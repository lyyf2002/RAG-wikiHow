Compute the odds in Craps.,
Bet the pass line.,
Bet on 6s or 8s.,
Work the odds.",How to Win at Dice2," Craps is a game of chance, but you can use statistics to figure out how to place your bets. You win in craps on the first roll if you roll a 7 or an 11. The combinations that will result in a 7 are 1-6, 2-5, and 3-4. Because there are two dice, you need to multiply the number of combinations by 2 (3 x 2), giving you a total of 6 out of 36 chances, or 17%, that you will roll a 7 on the first roll. An 11 is only made by rolling a 6-5, so the total number of chances you'll get an 11 is 2 out of 36, or 5.5%. To find out the overall probability of winning on your first roll, add 1/6 and 1/18, which makes your overall probability of rolling a winning number on the first roll 8/36, or 22%. Look out for rolls of 2, 3, and 12. These are considered the natural losing numbers in craps and no matter what you bet, you lose if these numbers are rolled. Don't worry too much, though, because the likelihood of each of these numbers being rolled is 1/36, or 2.7%., The pass line is where you bet for the roll of 7 or 11 on the first roll. You can start by bidding the pass line, which will win you money 22% of the time on your first roll if you roll a 7 or 11. This can be a nice way to gently build yourself up to betting higher., If you don't want to bet the pass line, you can bet on the point numbers. Point numbers are the numbers that aren't natural winners and losers, which are the 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. When your first roll doesn't automatically win or lose, you end up with a point number, which you have to roll one additional time to win. 6s and 8s are the most probable point numbers, and these numbers will be more likely to win you money than any of the other point numbers. There is a 10/36, 27%, chance that your point number will be either a 6 or an 8. Your chances decrease once a point number is rolled, with the odds of 5/36, or 13.8%, that you will get the matching point number.


Even if these odds seem low, they are the highest for any point numbers. The chances of you winning with a 5 or 9 is 4/36, or 11%, and with a 4 or 10 is 3/36, or 8.3%. These are much lower than the 13.8% chance that you'll win off the 6 or the 8., Even if you're on a losing streak, following the odds will likely pay out in the long-run, regardless of short-term losses. Odds will always even themselves out, but that process may be much longer than you anticipate. If you have plenty of money to burn, playing against the odds can be a fun risk to take.

Understand the odds.,
Determine the odds of a Yahtzee.,
Keep a full house.,
Go for the large straight.,
Get the bonuses.",How to Win at Dice3," Yahtzee is a great dice game, but relying on five dice to fall your way can be a daunting task. There is only a 6/7776 chance that you'll roll that coveted Yahtzee combination, which are not great odds at all. There is a 7056/7776, or 91%, chance that you'll get a pair on your roll, so you might want to try to strive for something higher early on since you are much more likely to get at least a pair or two on your final roll.

, To determine the chance of a Yahtzee, you simply multiply the number of sides that a die has as many times as there are dice (6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 6). This is your base number (7776). And since there are 6 numbers that can be used to make a Yahtzee, then your probability is 6/7776, or 0.1%. The other combinations have much greater odds, so settling for one of the other combinations is more likely to get you a higher score and win the game than always holding out for a Yahtzee., A good way to pick up some extra points in Yahtzee is to always take a full house when it first comes up. The full house is much more likely (300/7776, 3.9%) than four of a kind (150/7776, 1.9%) and it yields more points (25) than the highest four of a kind can yield (24). Although you might want to try for a Yahtzee as well, the likelihood is so low that taking the easy points early on will likely work in your favor. Plus, a full house can be elusive late in the game when you really need it., On your first roll in the game, there is only a 3.1% chance that you will throw a large straight. If you happen to roll three of four numbers in a row, play the odds and keep rolling. Say you roll a 2-2-3-4-5 combination. There is a 2/6, or 33%, chance that you will get either the 1 or 6 needed to complete the straight if you re-roll the 2. The likelihood that you will get enough 2s to make a four of a kind or Yahtzee are not nearly as promising, so go with the straight., If you roll a three of four 4s, 5s, or 6s, use them in your upper section as your total score for those numbers instead of counting them as three and four of a kinds. This will add more points to your overall upper section score and help you to get your bonus of 35 points. If you count them as three and four of a kind, you are just guaranteed the total on the dice. If you get your bonus on the upper section, you get the score for those dice plus an additional 35 points.


If you are left near the end of the game with only one or two of the higher numbers in the upper section to count as your totals for those numbers, you may lose your bonus, which will decrease your overall score by 35 points."

Select a banker.,
Set the stake.,
Match the stake.,
Roll for an automatic win or loss.,
Find the score for other results.,
Try to beat the banker's score.,
Start the next round.,
Switch bankers.","How to Play Dice 4, 5, 61"," If more than one player wants to start as the banker, have them roll dice. The highest roller is the banker for the first round. The banker has slightly better odds of winning, but puts up a larger stake.;
, The banker puts up a bet of any amount. If you like, your group can decide on a minimum stake.

, Each other dice player gets a chance to match some or all of the stake. Move on once the full stake is matched, or when no one else wants to put up a bet. Here are a couple examples:



Example 1: The banker puts up $25. Player one matches $15 of that stake, and player two puts up $10. The full $25 stake is matched, so no one else can bet. Continue to the next step.

Example 2: The banker puts up $100. Player one puts up $20, player two puts up $40, and no one else wants to bet. Since only $60 has been matched, the banker keeps the remaining $40 of his stake. Continue to the next step, playing for the $120 still on the table.

, Once all bets are made, the banker rolls three dice. In most versions of this game, these results immediately end the round:4 + 5 + 6 exactly (""c-lo""): automatic win. Banker takes all the money.
Any three of a kind (""trips""): automatic win.
Any pair + 6: automatic win. (For example, 1 + 1 + 6 or 3 + 3 + 6.)

1 + 2 + 3 exactly: automatic loss. Banker pays out to each player, matching their stakes.
Any pair + 1: automatic loss. (For example, 4 + 4 + 1 or 6 + 6 + 1.)


, If the banker didn't roll one of the combinations above, the round continues. Find the banker's score:


Any pair + a 2, 3, 4, or 5: the banker's score equals the value of the third die. (For example, 1 + 1 + 4 gives a score of 4. A roll of 5 + 5 + 3 gives a score of 3.)

Any other result: the banker rolls all three dice again until she gets a ""decision roll:"" a score, an automatic win, or an automatic loss.

, If the banker rolled a score (not an automatic win or loss), each player gets a chance to roll three dice to try and beat it. This uses the same scoring rules, but only affects that player's stake:


If a player rolls an automatic win or a score higher than the banker's, the banker pays that player an amount equal to the player's stake.
If a player rolls an automatic loss or a score lower than the banker's, the player gives his stake to the banker.
If a player rolls a score equal to the banker, no money changes hands.
If a player rolls any other result, he rerolls until one of the above happens.

, Once each player has rolled (or the banker rolled an automatic result), the round is over. If money is still on the table due to a tie, it stays on the table unless the banker changes (see below). If the banker changes, the betting players pick up their stakes instead. Start the next round, using the same rules.

, Some groups rotate the banker position clockwise each round.Others let the banker keep the position until someone rolls a 4-5-6. That person then takes over the banker position starting next round. The old banker becomes an ordinary player.


The banker role is always optional. A player can choose to turn it down.

To start the game, players shake their cups with the dice in them.,
Players can look at their own dice, but they shouldn't be able to see anybody else's.,
Players can also change their calls as others make theirs.,
1s, also known as an ace, are wild, but there must be a mother die for this to be the case.,
Eventually somebody will make what the next player believes to be an impossible call.,
Any player who makes a call that is shown to be wrong loses.,
The calls MUST keep going up until someone calls someone else a liar.",How to Play Liar's Dice," Then everyone slams them on the table with the openings downward, so no one else can see how the dice fell.






;
, After you peek at your dice, based on what you found you can make a call about how many of any number of dice there are on the table.









For example, you can say ""three 2s,"" meaning you think that there are three dice on the table that rolled a 2.
Remember, your guess includes all the dice belonging to all the players, not just your own dice, so you're making a guess that includes dice you can't see!

, The calls must be in order to the player on the left. If somebody else makes a higher call than you, you can raise yours, but only if the player that raises it is on the left. The hands are ranked first by amount, number of dice (5 4's), then by value, dots on the face (5 4's). So, (2, 3's) are better that (2, 2's) but not (3, 2's)








, For example, if there are 4 dice on the table and someone calls a ""3"" and there is a ""ace"" or ""1"" one, but no ""3"" to act as the mother die, they lose.








, For instance, they might say there are six 6s when there are only eight dice on the table and the other player can see none of his are 6's, and somebody will say the caller is a liar. At that point, the dice are revealed.









If you call somebody a liar and you were wrong, you lose.
If you call someone a liar and they were lying, they lose.

, For example, if you call ""five 6s"" and there aren't at least five dice that show 6 on the table, you've lost.








, This way there is always a loser--the loser loses some of whatever they were betting. Bets can be re-decided each time, or you can choose to make the bets constant, it's your choice. The first person who loses a game with no chips (NOT the first person who loses all of their chips).









On top of losing your chips you lose one of your dice.
If the person who made the first call calls 1s or aces, ones are no longer wild for that round.
If it should come down to two players each with one die, then Liar's Dice becomes ""spots"". This means that you both roll and look at your dice, but instead of number of dice you are saying the number of spots. If there is one five and one 3, there are 8 spots. The game continues normally after this.

Determine the rounds and throws per play.,

Decide on when lucky numbers will be chosen.,
Gather some dice and players.,
Select your lucky number.,
Take turns throwing the dice.,
Count your points and declare the winner.,
Add a low, mid, high bet.,
Allow odd and even bets.,
Reward doubles bets.",How to Play Lucky Numbers (Dice)," A throw is a single toss of the dice.You might decide to play three rounds with each round being made up of a single throw, or you may want to have several throws per round. The number or rounds and throws per round is a matter of preference.


Adding more throws per round can add uncertainty to your game. This will likely make it more exciting.;
, There are many ways you might score your game of Lucky Numbers. You could award a points per throw, per round, or for both. When giving points for both throws and rounds, you may want to weight the points scored by round winners as an added bonus.


Awarding bonus points for round winners can be especially fun with many players. As there will be more players, the points will be more spread between players. This will make winning rounds more important.

, Points are given to players who chose the number that is rolled by the dice. For a faster paced, more exciting game, you may want to choose your lucky number at the beginning of each throw. More laid back games can be played by selecting a lucky number for a whole round.


You can add variation to your game by having each player choose more than one lucky number. This works especially well when rolling multiple dice, as the spread of the numbers rolled will be wider and another lucky number will improve your odds.

, This game can be played with one, two, three, or four dice. You can play this game with as few as two people and there is no upper limit on the number of players. Every time you add a die to your game of Lucky Numbers, the probability of your number coming up will become lower, increasing the game's difficulty.

, The easiest way to play Lucky Numbers is to have each player select a number before the dice are rolled. If you are playing with many players, you may want to note down everyone's chosen number to keep players honest.


It's perfectly alright to choose the same number when playing Lucky Numbers. This is a game of intuition, so you should follow your gut. However, players that choose the same number will always finish a throw in a tie.
You may want to institute a tiebreaker to establish the point winner when there is a tie. For example, you might have tied players have a ""roll off,"" where each player rolls a die and the highest number takes the point. In the event of another tie, roll again.

, Pass the dice around between players and roll the dice for the number of throws you have decided per round. Continue to do this until you have played the determined number of rounds. You'll want to keep a tally of each player's lucky number throws for score keeping.


To determine the first roller of the dice, you might play a game of rock, paper, scissors, with the winner taking the first throw. You could also have a roll off, where each player rolls a die and the highest number starts the game. Ties in a roll off can be settled with by re-rolling until a player wins.

, The winner of Lucky Numbers will be the person who has the most points. This will likely be the person with the most lucky numbers guessed, though depending on how you've chosen to score your game, this may not always the case.

, You can divide the span of numbers possible to roll with your dice into low, mid, and high categories. For example, with two dice, you might decide that a low bet will cover 2 - 5 (you can't roll a 1 with two dice), a mid bet 6 - 8, and a high bet 9 - 12. Since there is a better chance of a throw landing in these spans, you may want to award less points for these bets.A weighted point system will create more varied strategy while playing and will allow underdogs a chance of coming back. For example, in the last throw of a round, one player might have 5 points and another 3. If a low, mid, high bet is only worth ½ a point, but a single number bet is worth 3 points, the lower point player will have a chance to win with a single number bet.

, Similar to low, mid, high bets, odd or even bets have a higher probability of happening.The odds of rolling an odd or an even will be even higher than a low, mid, or high bet. This being the case, you may want to award less points for these.


If playing with both low, mid, high bets and odd and even bets, you might arrange the point values to reflect the probability of these rolls. For example, you might have odd and evens worth the least amount of points, then low, mid, high bets, then single number bets.

, This will only be possible when rolling two or more dice. With two dice, the chance of rolling doubles is 1/6, or 16.66%.The chance of rolling a single number with two dice is 1/11, or 9.09%. To keep the game fair, your scoring should reflect this difference in probability.


You'll have to take into account the fact that adding more dice to your throws will increase the probability of rolling doubles. There is a 41.66% chance of rolling doubles with three dice. With four dice, the chance of doubles is 55.55%."

Gather your players around a table or other flat surface.,
Make sure everyone knows the standard points system.,
Start with the first player's roll.,
Observe the standard rules of ""farkling"" and ""hot dice."",
Keep rolling the remaining dice.,
Record all points collected on the paper after each player's turn.,
Play until a winner is proclaimed.",How to Play Farkle1," Determine who will roll first by having each player roll one die; the player with the highest roll gets to go first. Players will take turns in a clockwise direction.;
, This will help make the game go smoothly.


A roll of a 1 is worth 100 points.
A roll of a 5 is worth 50 points.
A roll of three of a kind is worth 100 times the face value. For example, if you roll three 2s, your total will be 200 points, three 5s will be 500 points and so on. However, there is an important exception to this rule; three 1s are worth 1,000 points, instead of 100 points., Roll all six dice at the same time and remove at least one ""point dice,"" meaning any dice that are worth points like 1s, 5s, or three of a kind.


Players do not have to set aside all point dice. It is important to consider strategy here. For instance, in cases where a player rolls two point dice, such as a 1 and 5, it can be strategic to keep the 1 aside and place the other back with the rest of the non-point dice to be rolled. In so doing, you may have a better chance at rolling a three of a kind (or other combination) and thus increasing your score., In the case of the former, this is where the game gets its name from.


If the player rolls and no point dice appear, this is called a ""farkle."" In the case of a farkle, the player loses all the point dice collected during that turn. The turn then passes to the next player on the left.
If the player rolls and all six dice become point dice, something known as ""hot dice,"" the player must roll all of the dice once more before stopping and adding the points collected. There is no limit to the number of ""hot dice"" a player may roll in one turn.

, In other words, the player can roll to collect more points, or stop and keep any points acquired. Carefully consider strategy in deciding whether to roll or stop. For example, if a player throws 1,2,3,3,3,5, any of the following plays are possible:


Score three 3s as 300 points and then roll the remaining three dice.
Score the single 1 as 100 points and then roll the remaining five dice.
Score the single 5 as 50 points and then roll the remaining five dice.
Score three 3s, the single 1, and the single 5 for a total of 450 points and then roll the remaining die.
Score three 3s, the single 1, and the single 5 for a total of 450 points. Stop rolling and score the 450 points.
If the player continues rolling in any of the above cases except for the last, they risk rolling a farkle and losing all accumulated points from that turn.
However, if they score five dice and have only one die left to roll, they have a 1 in 3 chance of scoring a 1 or a 5. Then, having scored all six dice they will have ""hot dice"" and can roll all six dice again to gain more points.

, It's important to keep clear records in order to keep the game fair and fun!

, To win, a player must get 10,000 points. After a player gets over 10,000, the other players get one turn to try to beat the first player out of the game. Declare a winner based on this last roll and play again!"
"
Place your bets.,
Roll until you get a result.,
Have each opponent roll.,
Compare your results.,
Shootout to break a tie.,
Give the pot to the winner.","How to Play Dice 4, 5, 62"," In this version of the game, there is no banker. Each player puts a matching stake into a single pot. These rules are recommended for two player games, or for groups looking for a more tense game with a top-heavy prize.

, Roll all three dice until you get a 1, 6, pair, or triple. For any other result, reroll all three dice until you get one of these results.

, Each player rolls in turn, following the same rules. Roll until everyone has a meaningful score (a 1, 6, pair, or triple).

, In this version, there are no automatic wins or automatic losses. Whoever has the higher result wins the pot. Here are the results from highest to lowest:


4+5+6 is the highest roll.
6+6+6 is the next highest, followed by all the ""trips"" from 5+5+5 down to 1+1+1.
Any pair + 6, down to any pair + 1.
1+2+3 is the lowest roll.

, If two or more players tie for the highest score, they each reroll to break the tie. The highest reroll wins, ignoring the earlier rolls. There's also a special rule for breaking ties with ""pair + third die:""


The higher third die always wins, no matter what the pairs are. 1 + 1 + 4 beats 6 + 6 + 2, because 4 > 2.
If the third die is the same, the higher pair wins. 3 + 3 + 5 beats 2 + 2 + 5, since 3 > 2.

, Whoever got the highest roll that round wins the entire pot. Put up stakes again and begin the next round.

Establish the changes to the sequence of play.,
Agree on all the rules and then begin to play.",How to Play Farkle2," Determine who will roll first by having each player roll one die; whoever gets the highest score is the first player, as in the standard Farkle game.

, Common variations include:


A straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) on one roll is worth 1,500, 2000, or 3000 points or no points.
Three pairs (e.g., 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5) is scored as 500, 600, 750, 1,000, or 1,500 points.
A full house (three of a kind and a pair) is worth the three of a kind value plus 250 points (e.g., 3, 3, 3, 2, 2 = 550 points).
Two sets of three of a kind: 2,500 points
Four of a kind is scored as 1,000 points, or double the three of a kind value, or quadruple the three of a kind value.
Five of a kind is scored as 2,000 points, or triple the three of a kind value, or six times the three of a kind value.
Six of a kind is scored as 3,000 points, or quadruple the three of a kind value, or eight times the three of a kind value.
Six 1s are worth 5000 points, or the player is instantly declared the winner., Common variations include:


Playing with five dice instead of six. Some scoring combinations (e.g. three pair) are not possible in this version of Farkle.
Playing in teams, rather than individually. Players on the same team combine their scores and sit opposite other teams.
Establishing a threshold in players' opening turns before they can begin scoring. Common thresholds are 350, 400, 500, and 1,000. At the beginning of the game, each player must throw in their turn until they reach the threshold; after that point, they can choose to stop or keep rolling in all subsequent turns.
Changing the winning score to greater or less than 10,000 points (e.g., 20,000 or 5,000 points). Another option is to make the score exactly 10,000 points, which is called the ""welfare"" version of Farkle. If a player scores above 10,000, all points won during that turn are transferred to the player with the lowest score.
Changing the farkling rules. If a player farkles three times in a row, he/she loses 500 or 1,000 points.
Allowing players to begin their turn by rolling the dice remaining from the previous player's roll (those dice not set aside for scoring). If the player scores with any of the dice on the first roll, they receive 1,000 points in addition to any other points they win. This is called the High Stakes (Piggy-backing) variant., Take turns in a clockwise direction and roll until a winner is declared. Have fun!

Designate a shooter.,
Hand the shooter the dice.,
Place the initial bets.,
Roll the dice.,
Place bets for the attempt to make the point.,
Roll to attempt to make the point.",How to Play Dice (2 Dice Gambling Games)1," This is the person who will roll or throw the dice for himself/herself and the other players to make bets on the outcome of the roll. All players, including the shooter, are playing against the house when they make bets.;
, The stickman (the person who retrieves the dice using a long, curved stick) offers the shooter a selection of (usually) five dice from which two are chosen. In street craps, usually only the two dice necessary are provided.


Dice used for casino craps typically feature sharp edges and carefully marked so that each face weighs the same as each of the other faces.

, The shooter is required to bet on the outcome of the first roll before rolling the dice, while other players are allowed to bet as they see fit from the available betting options, provided they make their initial bets when a betting round starts. Initial bets include the following:


Pass: An even money bet that a “right” or winning number will be rolled before a “wrong” or losing number. A pass bet is placed on the Pass Line when playing at a marked craps table. This is one of the options for the shooter’s required bet.
Don’t Pass: An even money bet that a “wrong” or losing number will be rolled before a “right” number. (This is sometimes called “playing the dark side” and considered by some to be in bad taste.) A don’t pass bet is placed on the Don’t Pass line when playing at a marked craps table. This is the other option for the shooter’s required bet. Some casinos also require the other players to make a pass or don’t pass bet before the first roll.
Odds (or Free Odds): This is a bet that can supplement a pass, don’t pass, or come bet. It is paid at the actual odds of rolling a given roll instead of whatever odds the house normally offers for one of the other bets.This bet is usually placed adjacent to or overlapping the bet it is supplementing instead of directly on top of it.Laying odds on a pass bet usually involves making a smaller bet to win big, while laying odds on a don’t pass bet usually involves making a larger bet to win small, although the casino can set a maximum of what multiple of a pass or don’t pass bet can be made as an odds bet.Proposition/service bets: These are bets on a specific roll outcome, such as a specific total or range of totals, or a specific combination of face values on the two dice. These are generally long-odds bets, as they are less likely to come up than the pass or don’t pass values., The first roll is known as a “come-out” roll. The outcome of this roll determines which bets are paid, lost, or held over for subsequent rolls.


If the come-out roll is a 7 or 11, pass bets win and don’t pass bets lose. The next roll becomes a come-out roll for a new round of play.
If the come-out roll is a 2, 3, or 12, pass bets lose. Don’t pass bets win if the roll is a 2 or 3, while they are returned to the player (“pushed”) without winning money if the roll is a 12. (In some casinos, a roll of 2 is the “push” number, while other casinos allow the player to choose which of the two numbers is the “push” number.)If the first roll is anything other than one of these results, the number rolled becomes a “point” that will win if rolled, and the round continues. Pass and don’t pass bets are carried over.
In casino craps, the shooter is required to roll both dice with one hand and have them hit the far wall of the table for the roll to count. If one of the dice flies out of the table, the shooter may either select one of the unchosen dice originally offered by the stickman or ask for the die back. (In such case, the boxman, the person who manages the table and its bets, will inspect the die to make sure it has not been milled or loaded.)In street craps, players may elect to use a backstop such as a curb, wall, or chair-edge, stretch a blanket to contain the dice, or do without a restraint.

, Pass, don’t pass, odds, and service bets can be made prior to each roll where the shooter attempts to make the point the same as prior to the come-out roll. In addition, two other bets are possible:


Come: Betting that the shooter will make a 7 or 11 on the first point roll or will make the point before making a 7.
Don’t come: Betting that the shooter won’t make a 7 or 11 on the first point roll or will roll a number other than the point and then roll a 7 before the point can be made.
As with the pass and don’t pass bets, players can supplement come and don’t come bets with odds bets. These bets cannot be laid down until a come-out point has been established.

, The shooter continues to roll until the point is made or a 7 is rolled.


If the shooter makes the point on the first roll, pass and come bets win, while don’t pass and don’t come bets lose. The shooter does not have to make the point with same combination that was used to establish it: if a point of 4 was established by rolling a 1 and 3, the point can be made by rolling either 1 and 3 or 2 and 2.
If the shooter makes the point on any roll after the first, pass bets win and don’t pass bets lose.
If the shooter rolls an 11 on the first point roll, come bets win and don’t come bets lose. Pass and don’t pass bets are carried over to the next roll. (Rolling an 11 after the first point roll has no effect on the outcome of pass, don’t pass, come, or don’t come bets.)
If the shooter rolls a 7 on the first point roll, come bets and don’t pass bets win. Pass bets and don’t come bets lose.
If the shooter rolls a 7 on any point roll after the first before rolling the point, don’t pass and don’t come bets win, while pass and come bets lose. The shooter’s turn as shooter ends, and a new shooter is chosen.
If the shooter rolls a 2, 3, or 12 on the first point roll, come bets lose. Don’t come bets win if the roll is a 2 or 3, while they are pushed if the roll is a 12. (Rolling any of these numbers after the first point roll has no effect on the outcome of pass, don’t pass, come, or don’t come bets.)
If the shooter rolls anything else on the first point roll, a come point is established as the new point for the come and don’t come bets, while the original come-out point remains as the point for pass and don’t pass bets. If the come point number is rolled before a 7 is rolled, the come bet wins and the don’t come bet loses. If a 7 is rolled before the come point is rolled, the don’t come bet wins and the come bet loses. If the original point is rolled before the come point is rolled, pass bets win, don’t pass bets lose, and the come and don’t come bets carry over while a new round of play starts to establish a new come-out point."

Grab a sheet of computer paper or lined/unlined notebook paper and fold it down the middle.,
Tear this half-sheet of paper off, to split the two sides apart.

,
Write the numbers 1-6 on each line of the paper (since the highest numbered side on any pair of dice is 6).,
Write down the special rolls which must include: 3-of-a-Kind, 4-of-a-Kind, Full House, Small Straight, Large Straight, Yahtzee, and Chance.,
Write down the reminder items of point totals for each of the items on their own separate columns.,
Play your game and write down your scores you score for each round of three rolls on the row on the paper.. Each successive column, will have your final scores.,
Total up your scores, and write your total on the last line of the page.

",How to Make a Yahtzee Scorecard," Make sure you don't tear it from one corner to the opposite corner (thereby making a triangle). Fold it as if you were making a paper-styled greeting card.;
,,


This article will come back to point totaling (another column later).

, Keep all these items on their own separate line.

,


As long as you realize that the top 6 items are only a total of total amount of successful dice that fit the category, write down ""Multiply by (x-number written on line) for each number of dice thrown"" for each line. The official scorecards say ""Count and only 1s(they call them Aces), 2s, 3s, and so-forth).
Bonuses for the total amount of points adds 35 points to the score at the end. Remind yourself of this fact, and write an area after the 1-6's that have totals for upper section and the bonus points (which, according to an official scorecard, says If score is 63 or over, and on next column write ""Score 35"".
Add another line for the grand total of the top portion of the page.
The special rolls area below has special rules.

3-of a Kind is the total number of points scored on all dice. Write down this information.
4-of a Kind is (again) the total number of points scored on all dice. Write down this information too.
Full House has a flat-rate score of 25 points, so write down ""Score of 25"" as a reminder.
Small-straights, which are a sequence of 4 successive dice, have a flat-rate score of 30, so write down ""Score of 30"" as a reminder.
Large-straights, which are a sequence of 5 successive dice, have a flat-rate score of 40, so write down ""Score of 40"" as a reminder.
Yahtzee, the best rolls in the game, have a flat-rate score of 50, and can be achieved when all 5 dice display the same exact number of each and every one of them, so write down ""Score of 50"" as a reminder.
Chance is the sum/total of all dice, so leave the next column blank.
You can also flip the placement for Yahtzee and Chance around, and add Yahtzee bonuses, if you feel you might be able to get more than one Yahtzee (a rare occurrence for most players). Each extra Yahtzee bonus has a score of 100 per Yahtzee Bonus earned. Write down this scoring point total as a reminder, and create a space for amount of checkmarks you might earn. Realize that each checkmark though corresponds to one and only one extra bonus item

Get a pair of dice and some people to play with you.,
Decide who is going to be the first “caster.” The person who rolls the dice in Hazard is known as the caster.,
Ask the caster to choose his or her “main.” The caster must call out a number between 5 and 9, which will be that caster’s main.,
Roll the dice.,
Determine if the roll is a win, loss, or chance.,
Pay attention to wins and losses.,
Decide if you want to take any special bets that are offered.",How to Play Hazard," You can play Hazard with a large or small group of people, but the game will be more fun with a larger group. Hazard is a betting game, much like Craps, but you don’t have to bet large amounts of money to make the game fun.


For example, you could decide on a prize for the winner or place low stakes bets using pennies, pretzel sticks, or even use play money.
If you plan to place bets, then you will need to choose a “setter.” The setter is the one who takes bets and places odds in the event that the caster rolls a chance number.;
, You can choose someone at random or roll the dice to determine who gets to be the first caster.For example, you could have everyone roll the dice and whoever gets the highest number gets to cast first. If two or more people roll the same number, have them roll again.

, An alternative way of playing is to have the player roll the dice until the first number between 5 and 9 appears. That number would then be the caster’s main.Choose 7 as your main if you get to choose. Choosing 7 gives you the best chance of winning if you are the caster.

, The caster must roll after he or she chooses a main. If the caster wins, he or she gets to keep rolling. The caster can keep rolling the dice until he or she loses three times. Then the caster passes the dice to the player who is standing or sitting to the left., Once the caster has chosen his or her main, the game can begin. If the caster rolls a winning number, then it is referred to as a “nick” or a “throw in.” But if the caster rolls a losing number, then you would say that the caster has “thrown out.”Numbers that are not wins or losses are considered “chance” numbers. These numbers include 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. If you roll one of these numbers after you have chosen your main, then you get to roll again.
If you roll the same number twice in a row, then you win.
If you roll the main after rolling a chance, then you lose.
Some other examples of wins and losses include:If you had a main of 5 or 9, then a roll of 11 or 12 loses.
If you had a main of 6 or 8, then a roll of 11 loses, but a roll of 12 wins.
If you had a main of 7, then a roll of 11 wins, but a roll of 12 loses.
If you roll a 2 or a three, you lose regardless of your main.



, If you are playing a game that includes betting, then you will need to make sure that you collect your winnings each time you win. If you are casting, then you only win if you roll a winning number. But if you are not rolling, then you win an amount equal to your bet each time the caster loses., During the game, the setter may provide special odds to anyone who wants to bet. Players may choose to take the opening bet or up the ante and take a higher odds bet that the setter offers during the course of the game.The setter may offer a special bet if the caster rolls a chance number. Players would then be able to bet on whether or not the caster will roll the chance number again.
For example, the setter might offer 4:1 odds if the caster successfully rolls the chance number again. If you bet on this, then you may quadruple your bet if the caster is successful.

Designate a shooter.,
Have the other players put up a stake against the shooter.,
Roll the dice for the come-out roll.,
Roll the dice for the point-making roll.",How to Play Dice (2 Dice Gambling Games)2," This person will roll a pair of matched dice. Before rolling, however, the shooter must lay down a bet.A backstop or restraining surface is not required for street craps, although players may choose to use a wall or curb as a backstop or restrain the dice by rolling them in a taut blanket. , The other players may “fade” or bet any amount up to the amount of the shooter’s bet. If they do not fade the shooter’s entire bet, the shooter must withdraw the portion not faded.


Players may also make side bets as to whether the shooter will roll a winning number or whether a certain combination will appear on the roll. , The outcomes are similar to bank craps.


If the come-out roll is a 7 or 11, the shooter wins money from the other players. The shooter can bet again and make another come-out roll, or retire by passing the dice to the player to his or her left.
If the come-out roll is 2, 3, or 12, the shooter loses the bet to the other players. The shooter again has the option to bet again or pass the dice to a new player.
If the come-out roll is anything else, that number becomes the point. The other players may then make additional bets as to whether the shooter will or won’t make the point.

, The outcomes are again similar to bank craps.


If the shooter makes the point, the shooter wins and may either bet and play another round or pass the dice.
If the shooter rolls a 7 (craps out), the shooter loses any money bet and must pass the dice to the next player.
If the shooter rolls anything else, the shooter rolls again until either making the point or crapping out. There is no “come point” as in bank craps. "
"
Designate a caster.,
Have the caster specify a number from 5 through 9.,
Make bets on the outcome.,
Roll the dice.,
Make bets on the outcome of the chance roll, if one is to be made.,
Roll the chance roll.",How to Play Dice (2 Dice Gambling Games)3," In Hazard, the player who rolls the dice is called a caster instead of a shooter.

, This number is the main and determines which numbers win and which numbers lose when the dice are actually rolled.


In some versions of Hazard, notably French rules, the main is determined by a preliminary roll of the dice.Because 7 is the number most likely to be rolled on two dice (1 chance in every 6 rolls), most casters chose this number as their main, thus leading to the game of craps., The caster bets against the other players individually or as a group, or against a bank (the setter). Bets at this stage are whether or not the caster will roll the called main or a number that also wins if the main is called., The outcome of the first roll determines whether a bet wins, loses, or is carried over to the next roll.


If the caster rolled the called main, the caster wins (nicks).
If the caster rolled a 2 or 3, the caster loses (throws out).
If the caster called a main of 5 or 9, but rolled an 11 or 12, the caster throws out.
If the caster called a main of 6 or 8, but rolled a 12, the caster nicks.
If the caster called a main of 6 or 8, but rolled an 11, the caster throws out.
If the caster called a main of 7, but rolled an 11, the caster nicks.
If the caster called a main of 7, but rolled a 12, the caster throws out.
If the caster throws out at this stage, the caster has an opportunity to call a new main, bet, and roll again, unless this is the caster’s third consecutive loss, at which point the player to the caster’s left takes over as caster.
If the caster rolled a number other than the main called, but not one of the losing numbers, that number becomes the chance (point) number the caster must roll to win. , The caster and the other players can raise their original bets on whether the chance number will be rolled before the original main. Bets are given odds according to the likelihood of rolling the chance number before rolling the main.

, The outcome of the roll determines whether the caster wins, loses, or rolls again.


If the caster rolls the chance number, the caster wins.
If the caster rolls the main at this stage, the caster loses. If this is the caster’s third consecutive loss, the caster passes the dice to the next player to cast.
If the caster rolls any other number, the caster rolls again until rolling either the chance or main. "

Place two dice in a cup.,
Roll the dice in the cup, then place it on the floor mouth down, concealing the dice.,
Take bets on whether the total of the dice is an odd or even number.,
Remove the cup to reveal the outcome.",How to Play Dice (2 Dice Gambling Games)4," In Japan, where the game originated among traveling gamblers who sat on a tatami floor, the cup or bowl is made of bamboo.

, Traditionally, the dealer rolling the dice sits in a kneeling position with buttocks touching heels and tops of feet flat against the floor (the ‘’seiza’’ position) and is shirtless, to prevent any accusation of cheating by concealing extra dice in sleeves or pants., Players may bet against each other, or against the house.


Players who bet “Cho” are betting that the sum of the dice will be an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12).
Players who bet “Han” are betting that the sum of the dice will be an odd number (3, 5, 7, 9, or 11).
When players bet against each other, typically, the same number of players will bet “Cho” as bet “Han.”

, Losers pay winners, with the house taking a percentage of the winnings if the dealer is employed by a gambling house.


The game is commonly played today by members of the ‘’yakuza’’ (Japanese mafia) and is featured in yakuza and ‘’chambara’’ movies. It is also featured as a minigame in the ‘’Ryu ga Gotoku’’ (Yakuza) series of video games."
"
Place bets on the outcome of the dice roll.,
Roll the dice.,
Pay winners and take money from losers according to the outcome of the dice roll.",How to Play Dice (2 Dice Gambling Games)5," There are only three bets taken:


An even money bet that the total will be under 7.
An even money bet that the total will be over 7.
An odds bet that the total will be 7. Typical odds are 4 to 1, although some casinos pay only 3 to 1.(Although 7 is the most likely number to be rolled on two dice, the actual odds are 5 to 1 against its being rolled.)

, Most commonly, the dice (made of wood) are rolled down a chute by a dealer.,


Instead of rolling the dice down a chute, they may be rolled in a cup and concealed as in Cho-Han Bakuchi.

"
"
Have each player agree to wager a total amount over the course of the game.,
Determine the initial rolling order.,
Have each player, in turn, roll two dice up to three times.,
Have the round loser pay into the pot.,
Pass the dice to the next player.",How to Play Dice (2 Dice Gambling Games)6," This is similar to “cashing in” in poker or craps. At the end of each round, a player will put an agreed-upon portion of that money into the pot each time he or she loses.

, Each player rolls one die; whoever rolls highest starts, with play passing to the left. The player who rolls lowest pays into the pot.


Having a table or surface with a backstop to roll the dice against and keep them from rolling off the table is recommended.

, The lead player for the round determines how many times the other players may roll by the number of times he or she rolls the dice. The other players may roll fewer times than the lead player, but not more times. The results are ranked, high to low, according to the following system:


A roll of 2 – 1, read as “21.” (The higher face value is read as the tens digit of a two-digit number and the lower face value as the ones digit.) This is called “Mexico,” from which the game takes its name.
A roll of doubles, ranked downward from 6-6, or “66,” to 1-1, or “11.”
Another mixed roll, ranked first by the higher face value, or tens digit, and then by the lower face value, or ones digit. Thus, 3-1, or “31,” is the lowest possible roll.
Roll values are not cumulative; if a player rolls 34 on the first roll and 31 on the second, they are not added to make 65.
If the lead roller rolls Mexico in any of his or her allotted rolls, the dice immediately pass to the next player, who may make up to three rolls (and so determine how many rolls subsequent players may make if he or she chooses not to make all three). If that player rolls Mexico, the next player gets the dice to make up to three rolls, and so on.
The leader’s roll of Mexico also doubles the stakes for the losing player. Players should decide before starting play if additional rolls of Mexico during a round further increase the stakes and by what method. However, if any player other than the lead player for a round rolls the first 2 – 1 combination, it is not treated as Mexico and the stakes are not increased.
If two or more players tie for lowest score after everyone has played, they play a round of Mexico among themselves to determine who is the loser.

, If the loser loses his or her stake on paying into the pot, that player is eliminated from the game.

, Play continues as before, with the person with the lowest roll paying into the pot and eliminated if his or her stake is wiped out. The last player remaining with stake money wins the pot."
"
Gather the players.,
Open all tiles on the box.,
Determine who starts.,
Have each player roll the dice, in turn.,
Use the total of the dice to determine which tiles to close.,
Continue rolling until no more tiles can be shut.,
Pass the box and dice to the next player.",How to Play Dice (2 Dice Gambling Games)7," Shut the Box, also called Batten Down the Hatches, Canoga, High Rollers (the game show of the same name derives from it), Klackers, or Zoltan Box, is normally played with two to four players for money, although it can be played as a solitaire game.


When played for stakes, each player kicks a certain amount of money in the pot, which the winner will collect when the game is over.

, The box in Shut the Box is labeled with tiles numbered from 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, all the tiles are open.


Another form of box is the “Full House” box, which features tiles numbered from 1 to 12. A variation of this form of Shut the Box is “The 300,” which has a second box with tiles numbered from 13 to 24.
The game may also be played with some of the tiles already closed. In Even Stevens, only the even numbers are open, while the odd numbers are closed. In Against All Odds, only the odd numbers are open, while the even numbers are up. In 3 Down Extreme, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are closed, while the rest are open. In Lucky Number 7, only the 7 tile is open and the box is passed around the players until one rolls a 7 to close it., This can be done by having the players roll one or both dice, with highest roll going first., Depending on the version being played, the player must roll both dice as long as the 7, 8, or 9 tiles remain open. Once those tiles are closed, the player may choose to roll one or both dice on each turn.


In some versions of the game, if a player rolls doubles, the player gets an extra turn.This option was used on the game show High Rollers, where an insurance marker was given to the player if he or she had a legal play with the value rolled.
In other versions of the game, a player must roll both dice until the sum of the values of the only tiles open is 6 or less (1, 2, 3; 1 and 5; 2 and 4; or 6). , Tiles whose face values add to the same values as the value rolled on the dice may be closed. If the value of the roll was 7, any of the following closures are legal:


Closing the 7 tile only.
Closing the 1 and 6 tiles, whether the individual die values are 1 and 6 or not.
Closing the 2 and 5 tiles, whether the individual die values are 2 and 5 or not.
Closing the 3 and 4 tiles, whether the individual die values are 3 and 4 or not.
Closing the 1, 2, and 4 tiles.
If the game is played “Thai style,” only one tile can be closed on each turn, either one of the two face values on their dice or their sum. If a value of 7 was rolled as a 3 – 4 combination, the player could shut the 3, the 4, or the 7 tile, but not any others, and not any combination that added to 7.
Other variations of the game require a certain tile to be closed on the first turn, or the player loses. In “2 To Go,” the 2 tile must be closed first; a first roll of 4 means an automatic loss. In “3 To Go,” the 3 tile must be closed first; a first roll of 2 means an automatic loss.

, Once a player rolls a number that cannot legally close any of the tiles still open, that player’s turn is over. At this point, the player adds the values of the still open tiles to determine his or her score; if the 2 and 3 tiles are the ones still open, the player scores 5. (This is known as the Golf variation.)


In the Missionary variation of Shut the Box, a player’s score is the number of tiles still open. If the 2 and 3 tiles are the ones still open, the player scores 2 for two still-open tiles.
In the Digital or “say what you see” variation of the game, the player’s score is a number made using the digits still displayed after making a roll that can’t shut boxes. If the 2 and 3 tiles were still open, the player’s score would be 23 instead of 5.

, The tiles are re-opened, and the next player tries to shut them by rolling the dice until no more tiles can be shut. This repeats until all players have had a chance to try to shut the box. The player with the lowest score wins the pot.


If any player succeeds in shutting all the tiles on the box, that player wins the game automatically and gets double the stake from the other players.The game can be played in rounds (Tournament style), using the Golf scoring variation, where each player’s score for a round is added to his previous score. Once a player reaches a total of 100 after a round is over, the player with the lowest score wins. It can also be played elimination style, where when a player reaches a total score of 45 or greater, that player is eliminated.
In the Unlucky Number 7 version of the game, if a player rolls a 7, the game ends.

Players will first roll the dice to determine who will roll for that particular game, and then all the participants will place bets on whether or not the person rolling will ""pass"" on the first roll (by rolling a 7 or 11), or ""crap out"" (by rolling a 2, 3, or a 12). If one of those values is reached on the first roll, the game is over and the bets are distributed accordingly.
The player shooting the dice is the first to bet and the other players must at least match his bet before the game can continue. If the bet cannot be matched, the shooter can either lower the bet to accommodate the other players, or handicap the odds. Once the shooter's bet has been matched, the other players may place side bets.;
, If the shooter neither passes nor craps out on the first roll, then the number rolled becomes the ""point."" Now, the only two values that matter on the roll are that point value and 7.









The player must continue rolling until either the point or 7 is reached. All bets that the shooter would ""pass"" are now bets that the shooter will re-roll the value of the point before rolling a 7, and all bets to the contrary are bets that 7 will be rolled first.
If the game goes to point, as soon as the shooter rolls the point or 7, the game is over and the bets are awarded accordingly.

, You'll make the learning curve a lot shorter if you don't have to ask for clarification every time someone says something about the ""come-out"" or the point. Learn the basic vocab and you'll be rolling soon enough:



The shooter is the player who rolls the dice, and will be a different player for each game

The come out is the initial roll
To pass is to roll a 7 or 11 on the come out roll
To crap is to roll a 2, 3, or 12 on the come out roll

The point is any value between 4 and 10 rolled on the come out
To seven out is to roll a seven before rolling the point

, In casino craps, obviously, the biggest difference is that you've got an elaborate table on which to place bets, as well as a banker controlling both the money and the action, and James Bond lookalikes are wandering around ordering elaborate drinks. In street craps, the betting is less formalized, and you're probably rolling dice against a brick wall, though the principles of the game are basically the same.


Because no one is watching the action, make sure that the piles stay even throughout the game and the tokens or money are distributed fairly. Tempers can flare if you don't take the game seriously and keep it clean.

, Unregulated gambling like street craps is illegal in every state in the US and in many places elsewhere. There's nothing wrong with playing for fun, and it's unlikely anyone would hassle you over a low-stakes penny game among friends, but it's still important to know that gambling for money outside of a licensed and regulated casino is always illegal.

, Like in most card games, if you want to play you've got to ante up by throwing a pre-determined value (usually small) in the pot. This will happen before you decide on the shooter and before you place any bets.









What you're paying for is basically the right to be considered for shooting. You don't have to place a bet after you've anted up. Like in cards, if you want to sit out for a game but still watch and think about betting, you need to ante up first.

, All players who anted will roll to determine the shooter. Whoever rolls the highest number shoots. Different games may have different rules--you could also roll until someone reaches 7, or whatever pre-determined way of choosing you desire. The point is, you must pick a shooter randomly.








, Once the shooter is selected, the shooter will bet first. The amount of the bet will be either ""pass"" or ""crap,"" though in some games it's assumed that the shooter will always bet on himself (or will always bet pass, in other words).









The other players must cumulatively come up with enough to at least match the shooter's bet before placing side bets or increasing the wager. To match the shooter's bet is to come up with the same amount of ""money,"" in support of the opposite outcome. If you've anted up, you can throw in to match, or you can wait and bet on the side.
Say the shooter makes a $10 pass bet. The other players must cumulatively come up with $10, but betting crap. So, if you throw in $2 on the initial bet toward the crap, the most you stand to win back is your $2 and $2 of the shooter's money.
If the other players match the shooter's bet, you can place a side bet with other players who are willing to match more bets if you still want to play. This might include betting either pass or crap.

, The shooter rolls the initial come out roll. If the shooter passes or craps, the game is over and the money is distributed evenly among the players, according to the bets placed. If the shooter rolls a point, all pass bets become point bets and all crap bets become bets that the shooter will 7 out.








, Continue rolling until the shooter points up or goes 7 out. Depending on the game, if a point is reached, sometimes the betting goes into higher gear. A round of side betting when the game goes to point is not uncommon, just as in poker the betting may continue. Although folding is not a possibility in craps, so it's probably more often that the initial bets stand through until the end, because the games are relatively short.








, Because you're using two dice, the probability of rolling any particular number is different depending on the number. Some values are more likely than other values, because there's more than one way to reach them. By learning a little bit about the statistical probability of rolling a particular number each time, you can make smarter bets.









7 is the most likely roll on any particular shot. There is a 17% chance of rolling a 7 each time, because there are a total of 6 ways to get that value between the two dice, out of 36 possible value combinations between the two.
The probability of rolling the other values makes a pyramid. 6 and 8 are the next most likely rolls, with five different ways to get each value, making them 14% likely. 5 and 9 are the next most likely values, and so on. 2 and 12 are the least likely rolls because there is only one way to roll them, snake eyes and a double six, respectively.

, Pass bets are always more likely. Betting on 7 is generally a smart bet, because the odds of rolling a 2, 3, or 12 are fairly unlikely when compared to the odds of rolling a 7 or 11. When you know about the likelihood of reaching any particular value on a given roll, you can place smarter bets.









Say you're in a game and you've betted crap, and the shooter rolls a 4. Now the likelihood is reversed, and the shooter's in the corner. It's more likely on the next roll he'll roll a 7, so your initial bet paid off. Now your odds are better.

, Set the dice so that on the top of each die the 3 is facing up in a V shape. This is traditionally the ""set"" for the dice, so all players know you're not cheating or doing something unfair to the game.


Usually, there's a designated surface the dice have to hit. In casino craps, the dice must go all the way to the back wall of the table for it to count. This is why most street craps games are played against walls. Generally, you'll be a few feet away and roll against the wall, or some other kind of backdrop.

, Most times when you shoot crap, the game involves the shooter making the biggest bet that he will pass and all the other players betting smaller amounts that he will crap out. Because, as you've seen from the probability, it's most likely that the first roll will be a 7. So, don't jump into the game making huge foolish bets on crap outs that are unlikely. Wait until you're the shooter if you want to win.








, Dice are super simple, but have a whole load of possibilities for games, some of which have unfortunately fallen out of style. You don't need an elaborate game board or an Xbox to play fun games, and there are plenty of games that don't require complex series of bets to enjoy. Learn a few and mix it up.


It's also important to distinguish between playing street craps and playing other kinds of dice games, some of which involve betting and some of which don't. If someone asks if you want to ""shoot dice,"" they could be referring to some other game, though craps is the most likely.

, Sometimes called lo dice, in this popular game, each player has three dice, usually in some kind of cup, and each player rolls simultaneously after a round of betting. The object is to get the highest possible score, though the scoring works somewhat like poker.









The highest possible combination is to roll a 4, 5, and a 6. This is like a royal flush in poker.
The next highest combination would be triples. Even if you rolled all ones, rolling three ones would be the next highest category of score, only beaten by triples of any other number, or the 4, 5, 6 combo.The next highest combination is called a ""pair and a spare,"" which is sort of like a full house. This would be a matched pair, plus some other value. In the event two players rolled double 4's, the higher value of the other die would be the winner. If a player rolled two twos with an extra six, while another player rolled two sixes with an extra two, the first player would win. Ties are awarded to the highest value on the extra die, the pair doesn't matter.
If two players roll exactly the same thing, generally a re-roll is performed.

, Also sometimes called Mexican dice or liar's dice, this is a game of deception that can get fun and rowdy, especially when somewhat, uh, lubricated. In drinking dice, players pass around a single cup with two dice in it and take turns guessing at the value under them, either challenging or accepting the value as reported by the previous player.









The first player rolls the dice and carefully looks at the value so the other players can't see, then says aloud the value, either choosing to bluff by reporting the wrong value, or telling the truth. The player then passes the cup carefully so as not to tip over the dice to the player to his right.
The next player can either challenge or accept the value as reported by the previous player, or can up the ante by making a guess of their own. Eventually, the game must continue until someone challenges. If, upon challenging, the initial report was correct, the challenger and all other players lose, unless a subsequent player had reported or guessed correctly. If a challenge is upheld, the liars are the losers, and usually have to take a drink.
The point values vary from game to game, though generally a 1-2 combo is considered the highest possible value. It's also possible to play the game ""blind,"" meaning that no one ever looks at the value until someone challenges.

, While ""rolling bones"" is sometimes slang for shooting craps, bones is actually a distinct and complex game that's similar to Yahtzee, and is also sometimes called hot dice or ""Farkle,"" though each game has a somewhat distinct scoring system in place. It's played with five or six dice and a cup passed between the players. The goal is to accumulate the most points in the round, or to accumulate the most points over a given number of rounds.








The first player rolls all six dice, keeping some by setting them aside, and returning the rest to the cup. Keepable dice include any that show 1, which are worth 100 points, and any that show 5, which are worth 50 points. If you roll 3 of a kind (say, three 2s) you'll also keep those, worth that many hundred points. In other words, three 2s would be worth 200 points, while three 6s would be worth 600. Return all dice that can't be counted back into the cup and roll again.
The player continues rolling until he's either ""kept"" all the dice, or has rolled something that can't be counted (like a 2, 4 and 4). On subsequent rolls, you can improve previous 3 of a kinds that you've kept. Say you rolled three 3s on your first roll and returned the other three dice back to the cup. If you rolled a 3 on your subsequent roll, the value of your 3 of a kind would be doubled.

, The number of dice rolled will depend on the number of quarters held:


When a player has one or two quarters, he or she rolls one or two dice, directly related to the number of quarters held.
If a player has three or more quarters, the player rolls all three dice.
If a player doesn't have any money left in front of them, he or she is still in the game, but doesn’t get to roll until someone passes them a quarter.
The last player with quarters rolls the dice and has to roll a 1, 2, or 3 in order to win the center pot of money or other goodies used.

, The person who rolls the highest number starts the game.

, For every 4, put one quarter into the center pot.

,,, When only one person is left holding quarters, he or she must roll for the center pot.


The player must roll a 1, 2, or 3 to win the pot. If the player rolls a 4 and only has one quarter left, that quarter must go into the center pot. In this case, the pot becomes a ""carry-over"" pot because nobody wins. The game (or a new round) begins afresh, with everyone taking three quarters again. The person who rolled last begins the new game using the same rules until somebody wins.
If the player rolls a 4, 5, or 6, then the remaining quarters are passed as throughout the game.

Understand the fixed-odd, money-line bets.,
Understand the point-spread betting system.,
Ignore parlays, teasers, and other betting shortcuts.,
Find the smart money bet.,
Consider the intangibles.,
Find a bookmaker and place your bet.,
Pick a hard line and stick to it.",How to Bet1," Fixed-odd bets are the simplest to play and learn. For any given event or game, a win-loss outcome is given a probability, which you can bet for or against. Sometimes they're portrayed as a fraction or a decimal, which will be multiplied by the amount of money you put down as a bet to result in the payout.


Say the Bears are playing the Sharks, and the probability is listed as Bears +400. That means the bookie's odds are 4/1 that the Bears will win. If you bet $100, your payout would be $400 if the Bears won and and if they lost, you'd lose your $100. This would be a likely odds if the Sharks were heavily favored to win.
If the odds were 1/4, or -400 on the same outcome, and you placed a bet of $100, you'd only win $25 if the Bears won and would lose your entire $100 if they lost.;
, The point-spread system is used by handicappers and bookers to generate interest in putting money on the game by providing a range of possible outcomes to even the action. It's not an indicator of the odds, and isn't always indicative of the smartest bet. Rather, it's meant to generate bets for teams that are unlikely to win. The point-spread system is used to ensure that enough bets will be placed for either team to cover the betting.


Say a spread of 10 is given in the Bears-Sharks game, and the Sharks are favored to win. If the Bears score plus the spread ends up with a total number of points greater than the points the Sharks scored in the game, bets against the spread would win, while bets with the spread would lose.

, Bookmakers, in an attempt to extort as much money as possible from betters with incredible-looking odds but extremely low-probability outcomes, have invented all sorts of exotic-play bets that are to your advantage to ignore completely. The odds are simply not in your favor. If it seems to good to be true, that's because it is.


If you're interested in side or additional bets to make the action more interesting, consider placing total bets. Total bets are usually placed as side bets additional to a spread or fixed-odd bet, in which you bet on the total number of points scored. These are common panel-features of sports talk shows and can offer compelling action., A smart-money bet is the opposite of what the bookies want you to make. Professional sports bettors, also known as ""sharps"" will often make smart money bets by calculating their own odds and consolidating a variety of bookmakers numbers from different sources to create a composite odd from which they place bets. For you, that might mean looking at several bookmakers numbers and making the most-informed choice.Smart money betting usually involves placing your bet at the correct time, before enough people jump on your side of the bandwagon to change the odds and make it a worse bet. When you've decided how you're going to bet, make it quickly and lock in the odds at that point, don't wait until conventional wisdom changes the odds out of your favor.

, What are the weather conditions set to be like for the game? Who seems to have the most momentum? Who feels right in your gut? There's more to betting on a game than tangible statistics. If you're a fan of and very familiar with the sport you're betting on, go with your gut. Consider the intangible, unquantifiable factors that can affect the result of a game.


Often, intangibles are also taken into account when bookies make the odds. If a player is out with injury or in the middle of a slump, these things are factored into the odds-making. But there's also a more difficult to qualify aspect to wins and losses that you can only get by watching lots of sports and making educated picks.
Don't just bet on your favorite teams. A classic rookie mistake is making uninformed bets on the teams that you like because you think that'll make the game more interesting. It won't. You have rosy-tinted glasses when it comes to your home team, and the game's already exciting for you since you're a fan. Only bet on teams with good odds that feel right.

, Many online and Vegas-based bookmakers are available for you to place bets with in a regulated and semi-legal form. In-person bookmaking is illegal, but online venues based primarily in Las Vegas operate in a semi-legal gray area, making it a popular choice for sports bettors.


In the UK and elsewhere, online bookies operate similar operations that you can take advantage of for the same events, generally speaking.

, Placing bets on sports can suddenly make a game between two teams in the basement of the standings seem like the Super Bowl. It can be fun and add a little life into your regular sports-watching, but it can also be addictive and easy to get in over your head. Select a reasonable amount of money you're willing to invest in a season, a game, a year, or a sport, and stick to that amount. Never bet more than you're willing and able to lose, and only bet to keep the game interesting and fun. It's not a sustainable way to make money consistently, and can become addictive. Be careful.


If you suspect you might have a problem, get help immediately and stop gambling. Gambling is a serious addiction that affects people all over the world, and it can be very difficult to quit alone. Learn when you have a problem and take the necessary steps to kick your habit.

Be careful about betting on events that are out of your control.",How to Gamble With a Chance of Winning1," Do you want the thrill of winning one big chunk, or would you rather win several smaller pots? Do you need to make a particular amount of money, or is simply playing for a while and coming out ahead enough? How high do the stakes need to be? Are you just looking to have fun in an exciting, social setting? Don't just gamble for no reason—decide before you start what you want to get out of it.
, If you want to have a chance of coming out ahead, you need to pick a game that offers you decent odds.

Avoid roulette, keno and slots. These games involve very little skill, and the house always has an enormous advantage.



 


Steer clear of newfangled table games. Virtually all of these are constructed to give the house a significant advantage, and learning the skill elements is more difficult.






Lottery tickets might tempt you with the potential of enormous jackpots, but your chances of winning are astronomically low.







, In craps players bet on the outcome of dice rolls, either against each other or against the house. By taking or laying odds on a number, you can lower the house edge. There is also a relatively new method for increasing your chance of winning called dice control. Controlled shooters hold the belief that they can control the outcome of their rolls by tossing the dice a certain way.

, Blackjack is one of the most basic casino games. You and the house each start with two cards, and then flip over random cards hoping their added value will get closest to 21 without going over. The key is knowing the odds that you will hit the desired sum and betting on those statistics conservatively. Some variations of blackjack can actually give the player the advantage (although this is rare).

, Poker is unique amongst casino games in that you play against the other players, not the house. There are many variations, but usually players bet on the strength of their cards as their hands develop over one or more iterations. More than just chance, it's a game of deception, as the best players learn to use the size of the bets to bluff when they have a bad hand, draw others into the pot when they have a good hand and read their opponents to know when to fold.

, It can be fun to put money on boxing matches, horse races or other sports, but the odds offered are designed to tempt you into betting on long shots. Long shots are bad beds by definition.

Gambling is addictive and can be dangerous, and spending more isn't a reliable way of making your losses reappear.

, Games in which you play an active role in the outcome of the game result in smarter bets than games in which chance plays a larger role. In general, the smartest game is always poker, both in video form and in person, as long as you've got the skills to play. The smartest casino bets are those made in the midst of a poker game by a player who knows how to play. Learn to play poker well and make smart bets if you want to make money at the casino.


Pure chance games like roulette, keno, and state-run lotteries offer the worst odds, making your investment worth the least in the long-run. If you want to make smart bets, bet on games in which your decisions and your play have some effect on the outcome.
Games like blackjack, craps, and baccarat offer better outcomes and smarter investments than other kinds of casino betting.

, Blackjack is still a game in which chance plays a huge role, but learning the proper strategy can help you make smarter bets and blackjack offers decent player odds you can learn to take advantage of. Basic strategy is a tabulation of odds that smart plays memorize and use to make the most probable bets and decisions at any point in the game. Learn when to stand, when to hit, and when to split or double down.If you want to really improve your chances of winning and making good bets, learn to count cards. It's not illegal, but it is generally against the house rules, making it something that pit bosses have learned to keep an eye out for.

, If you want to shoot craps with the high-rollers, bet against the roller. No-pass bets offer slightly better odds than pass bets, even if the roller makes point. Consistently placing no-pass bets still gives an advantage to the house, but it's not a bad one.

, Like craps, baccarat is a relatively simple up or down game when you learn the ins and outs. In baccarat, you either bet the dealer will win or the player will win, and the game is played by passing the shoe around the circle and dealing out two hands (one dealer hand, one player). The rules for taking a hit favor the house slightly, though the odds are incredibly close, making dealer bets always the smarter option, by a hair.

, While it's bad form to patrol the casino floor for people about to leave slot-machines (and is against the rules in some places) keep an eye out for people who've been sitting at a machine for hours without hitting any big pay-offs. When they get up to leave, play a few rounds. Those machines are statistically more likely to hit now.

Turn water into whiskey.,
Win a round with the ""repeat after me"" challenge.,
Win the 2 x 2 challenge every time.,
Make smoke come from your fingertips.,
Collect 17 coins and win.,
Make the glass drink itself.",How to Bet3," Ask the bartender for a shot of whiskey and a short glass full of water, then bet your friends you can switch the liquid in the glasses without using a third glass, and without putting either of them in your mouth. If you can't do it, the next round is on them. The trick is, you'll be able to do it every time.Use a business card, a playing card, or a coaster and cover the water-glass tightly with it. Turn it upside down, and put the water glass on top of the whiskey with the card separating them. Line them up carefully, then slowly pull the card out, so a little space remains.
If you watch closely, the different densities of the liquids will cause them to switch places gradually. The water will flow down into the whiskey and the whiskey will rise, until both glasses are eventually switched.

, Order two shots and then bet a friend for the next round that there's no way they'll be able to repeat after you and drink their shot exactly the way you drink yours. To complete the trick, you'll need four coins, two given to each participant.


Tell your friend to do exactly what you do. Put your shot glass on a coaster and let your friend repeat it. Then, put one coin to one side of your shot glass. When your friend does the same, put another coin on the other side. Your friend should be feeling quite confident now.
Pick up the glass and take the shot, but do not swallow all of it. Hold some of it in your mouth, but swallow some of it to make it look like you took the whole thing. Your friend will be trained in repeating after you, and will down the shot. When he looks at you expectantly, spit out the rest of your shot back into your glass. Since he's taken his, he won't be able to repeat after you, meaning that you win!

, Bet a friend that you can drink two pints of beer before they'll be able to take two shots of whatever liquor they favor. The only rules are that you're not allowed to touch the other's glasses and that you both have to wait to pick up the second glass until you've both put your first glasses down.


Your friend will take the first shot quickly. Try to drink your beer quickly, looking concerned that you'll lose. Your friend will wait for you to finish smugly and talk trash. When you're finished with your beer, put it upside down over your friend's second shot, then pick up your beer and drink it at your leisure.

, Bet your friends for a round that you can make smoke come from your fingertips, then rub your fingertips together and promptly blow your minds. This bar trick requires a little preparation, but is easy to pull off.


Tear off the striker strip from a box or a book of matches and fold it in half. Put it into an ashtray and light it on fire. Let it burn for a while and then blow it out. When you move it aside, there should be a yellowish-brownish residue left. Wipe it up with your fingers. When you rub your fingertips together, they should smoke slightly.

, Come up with a pile of 17 coins, preferably all the same, but the trick works just as well with a variety of coins. Tell your friend that you'll take turns pulling one, two, or three coins at a time from the pile, but that your friend will always be the last person to choose.The trick requires that you let your friend pick first. When they pull their coins from the pile, pull enough coins so that the sum taken from the pile for each turn is 4. In other words, if your friend takes 1 coin, you'll take 3. If your friend takes 2, you take two. Always keep the sum 4. After four rounds, you'll only be left with 1 coin and it'll be your friend's turn. You win!

, Tell your friends that, like Soviet Russia, you can make a glass drink itself. For the trick, you'll need a glass with some water in it, a small plate or a saucer, and a match.


Pour some water or other liquid from the glass into the saucer. Hold the glass upside down and light a match. Hold the match under the glass and wait for the match to burn out. When it does, put the glass upside down onto the plate and the liquid will move into the glass mysteriously, from the suction created by the heat.

, Even if you memorize the rules, playing is the best way to really learn how a game works. So before you put any money on the line, get together with friends and play practice hands until you know the rhythm and flow of the game.

This is especially important in poker, where the game is about more than just understanding the rules.

, Most games of chance aren't just random—they're statistical. At any given point, some basic math can tell you the probability that you will roll a specific number in craps or flip over one of your ""outs"" in poker. Learning to make these calculations and playing based on your real odds, not your gut, is the best way to lose less and win more in the long run.

, Set rules for how much you can put on the line before you go out gambling and yourself stick to these rules. You can lose a lot of money very quickly if you don't give yourself limits and cut your losses when you hit them.

, This can be the hardest part of gambling, especially with games like slots and roulette. Many gamblers will win a few rounds and feel like they are ""hot"" and can't lose. Don't fall into this trap! Just because you are on a winning streak, doesn't mean the odds are in your favor. In fact, it will make the odds in games like blackjack and poker edge to the casino.

If you do get ahead, that's a great time to take your winnings and leave.






If you keep playing, consider betting more conservatively (like the Kelly bet) instead of less to preserve your profits, because the odds will probably swing back against you sooner rather than later.

Outplay your opponents in poker.,
Play the math in blackjack.",How to Gamble With a Chance of Winning3," Unlike most games of chance, the winner is determined not just by who gets dealt the best cards, but by who can best outplay the others with bluffs, reads and careful betting. If you develop good poker skills, and get seated at a table with poor players, you could have a significant advantage.


Learn the habits of your opponents. Poker involves as much personality as strategy. Some people will always call a bluff, while others can be easily pushed out of a pot by aggressive betting. It takes time to learn these habits, however, so don't get carried away psychoanalyzing players you just sat down with.






Play to your outs. As in all these games, learning to calculate the odds that you will turn over the card you need is the best way to win consistently and avoid long-shot bets.






Draw in suckers. While bluffing is definitely flashier, a more consistent way to increase your winnings is to wait until you get a good hand and then use strategic betting to draw the other players into betting more than they should.

, Blackjack has enough strategy that you can get ahead if you know what you are doing.
Know when to split. If you get two different suits of the same card, you can split them into two hands, but this only favors you with certain numbers.
Never split fives—together they add up to 10, which gives you good odds.
Don't split face cards or 10s—they already add up to 20, a great score.
Don’t play using the Martingale betting system. According to the theory, players should double after each loss, and keep on doubling until they win. But, there are too many risks involved, as a lot of blackjack tables have maximum bet sizes.
Always split As and 8s unless rules like no-peek or hit 17 are in effect.
Splitting aces is usually good, but casinos often have house rules limiting this.
Double down when advantageous. Doubling down allows you to double your bet after receiving your first two cards, but requires you to stand after receiving exactly one more card. This lets you make more money when you have a favorable hand compared to the dealer. Computer simulations have been run to determine the best situations to double down, so find the correct chart and memorize it.
Count cards. Blackjack is famously a game in which it is sometimes possible to count cards. It requires very difficult mental gymnastics, but can confer an advantage when done right. Card counters don't just play each hand as separate and random. Instead they keep track of each card turned over by the dealer, and then calculate by implication which cards are left in the deck. Thus you can know to place a large bet when the remaining cards offer you a mathematical advantage.
Card counting is technically legal, but casinos often do not allow it. If they suspect you are counting cards, you will be asked to stop playing or leave the casino.
Cheating and stealing money is illegal, but there are ways to get around it (like having someone or something incapable of committing a crime do it, bribe them , or having someone capable of doing so because of position do so.

The rules and limits of online betting are generally the same from site to site, but some have better platforms than others when it comes to customer satisfaction. You may need to try a few sites before you find one that meets your specific needs.

Only bet what you believe you can afford to lose; betting too high can lead to disastrous results on your credit rating.

, Knowing how to bet on sports doesn't have to be rocket science, if you take the time to do a little research and sample the betting sites that are available on the Internet.

, All you need to do is collect your winnings when the sports event is over. Take the time to check out the bonuses and payment options that are provided by each betting site. Some only send a cashier's check every thirty days, so it's important that your check your account monthly to ensure that you don't have excess cash stacked away.


Removing your earnings also removes the temptation to betting all of your hard-earned cash on another sports event. The better payment options and bonuses that are provided by these free bet offer sites, the better your experience will be.

, If you gamble excessively or unwisely, you can end up in debt and damage your credit history. Mange your budget, set yourself a limit, and stick to it. If you think you may have a gambling addition, get help.

You will be attempting to create the funniest combination that you can so that the judge will choose your card.
When your card is chosen by the judge, you get to keep the green card. At the end of the game, the player with the most green cards is declared the winner.;
, You will have an advantage if you already know the people who will be playing Apples to Apples with you. Because you gain points in Apples to Apples by making people laugh, playing with close friends and family puts you one step closer to winning., Everyone takes turns playing the judge in Apples to Apples, but letting others be the judge first gives you an advantage. If you want to win the game, then you need to learn what everyone else finds funny.Pay close attention to the cards that your fellow players choose. Do they tend to choose cards that make an absurd comparison? Or do they go for cards that a just a bit silly?

, Once you have identified the types of cards that make each judge laugh, you can start to play cards that you think the judges will choose. Remember that each judge may have a specific preference, so remember to think about what each judge finds funny before you lay down a card., If you are playing Apples to Apples with more than five players, then the last person to lay down a card is not eligible to win the round.To ensure that you have a chance to win every round, aim to be the first or the second person to lay down your card.

If that person is your main competition in the game, no matter how much you like the card, don’t choose it., Although some cards like mud or string or crayons could be somewhat valuable depending on who you play with, they will not be effective very often.

Try to hang onto a couple of these cards until the right combination comes along.

, Sometimes the judge will be torn between a couple of cards and you may need to convince the judge to choose your card. But it is important to be subtle so that the judge does not know that it is your card. Simply laughing out loud as the card is read may do the trick, or you might say something like, “That’s hilarious!”, to convince the judge.Sometimes keeping quiet is the best strategy, especially if you are doing well and don’t want anyone to know that that card is yours.

Have all of the players at Millionaire Estates count up their money.",How to Set up and Play the Game of Life by Milton Bradley," The Game of Life comes with many cardboard parts that you will need to punch out and attach to the board. It also comes with some plastic pieces that you will need to attach to the board in the correct places., Your Game of Life set should have stickers for the mountain and bridge pieces. Put these stickers on the mountain and bridge pieces before you attach them to the game board., Before you start playing, you will need to assemble the board. Attach the buildings, mountains, and bridges to the correct places on the board. Each plastic piece has a letter on it that matches up with a letter on the board.Match the letter piece with the correct letter on the board. For example, the “J” piece should go into the “J” slot.

, The Game of Life uses a spinner instead of dice. You will need to put this spinner together and attach it to the board before you play your first game. Punch out the cardboard spinner and match the notches up with the notches on the plastic spinner dial. Then, snap the two pieces together.Next attach the spinner dial to the spinner base. The spinner base should have a letter on it that corresponds to the letter on the board. Snap the assembled spinner into place on the board.

, Make sure that they are all facing down. Mix them up and leave them next to the board to act as the draw pile. Take four tiles without looking at them and place them on the Millionaire Estates space., The four types of cards are Career Cards, Salary Cards, House Deeds, and Stocks. Make sure that you keep each type of card separate and then shuffle each stack. Place the stacks face-down somewhere next to the board where everyone can reach them., Place these items somewhere near the board. Players will purchase and borrow these items throughout the game, so you will want to have them somewhere that is easy to access. Select a spot right next to the game board to keep these items for when they are needed., The Banker is in charge of all money going into and out of the bank. Make sure the person who decides to be the Banker is aware that he/she will need to collect and distribute money throughout the game. The Banker will need to distribute $10,000 in Life money to each player., The Game of Life comes with six car movers in different colors as well as people pegs that go in the cars. Make sure that every player chooses a car and puts a peg into it before placing that peg on the board., Before your first turn, you will need to decide if you want to start the game with a career card or start the game by going to college. There are advantages and disadvantages to both options.The advantages of starting your career right away is that you will start earning PAY DAY money sooner and you will not have any debt. The disadvantages of starting your career right away is that you will not earn as much money and there are some career cards that you may not take.
The advantage of going to college is that you will earn more when you do get a career card. The disadvantage of going to college is that you will have $40,000 in debt and it will take you longer to get your career card.

, If you choose to start a career, then you will need to choose a career card right away. Discard any career cards that indicate that a college degree is required, such as the doctor career card., If you are going to start college, then you will need to place your car on the start college space. You may not draw a career card yet. You may draw a career card when you reach the Job Search space., Each play will need to spin the wheel at the beginning of every turn. The number that you spin will indicate how many spaces you may move your car on the board. You may only move your car forward, not backwards on the board., The Game of Life board is very colorful and each space has different instructions that you will need to read and follow. Take some time to review the basic instructions for the space colors so that you will know what your options are.Orange spaces have instructions written on them that you must follow.
Blue spaces have instructions on them that you may decide to follow or not follow.
Green spaces are PAY DAY spaces. Collect the amount shown on your PAY DAY card whenever you pass or land on a green space.
Red spaces require you to stop moving, even if you have enough moves left to go past a red space. You have to stop whenever you encounter a red space. Follow the instructions on the space, then spin and move again.

, The career spaces on the board match the available career cards. If one of your opponents owns the card, then you need to pay that opponent the amount shown on the card.If you own the career card, then you do not have to pay anything.
If no one owns the career card, then you need to pay the amount indicated on the space to the bank.

, This rule is known as the Special Police Officer Rule. If someone spins a 10, then that person is said to have been “speeding” and must pay whoever has the Police Officer career card $5,000. If no one has the card, then no one has to pay., The accountant gets an extra space on the board which is called the Taxes space. If you land on this space, then you need to pay $5,000 to whoever has the accountant career card.If no one has this card, then pay $5,000 to the bank.
If you have the card, then you pay nothing.

, You may choose to purchase an insurance policy at the beginning of one of your turns. These policies will offer some protection for your home or car (depending on which one you buy) in case of an accident.Auto insurance costs $10,000, but the homeowner’s insurance policies depend on the home that you own. You can find the cost of a homeowner’s insurance policy on your deed card.

, You may buy a stock card at the beginning of one of your turns. A stock card costs $50,000, but if someone spins and lands on the number on your card, then you collect $10,000 from the bank. This rule applies whether you are spinning or someone else is spinning.You may only buy one stock card, but you may get another stock card if you land on the Stock Market Zooms space.

, If you are running low on cash, then you may take out a bank loan of $20,000 at the beginning of one of your turns. Keep in mind that you will have to repay this amount to the bank when you retire plus an extra $5,000 in interest., When you have reached the Retire space, you may not spin the wheel any more or draw cards, or purchase things. This space indicates that you are near the end of the game. However, getting to the Retire space first does not mean you have won the game., The first thing you will need to do when you hit the Retire space is to repay any loans you have taken out plus the interest that you owe. Put this money back into the bank., Next, get rid of all of your special cards, but you may keep your stocks. If you are ahead of your opponents, then you can continue to collect money from your stocks when your opponents spin the wheel., Move to Millionaire Estates if you think that you have the most money. Keep in mind that if you do move to Millionaire Estates, you stand a chance to collect four additional Life tiles that may help you win the game. But other players may draw from this pile if the draw deck is empty.If you move to Countryside Acres, collect one Life tile. No one may take this Life tile from you and you may include it in your cash total at the end of the game.

, The player with the most money gets the last four life tiles that are on the Millionaire Estates space. Then, all of the players (including those at Countryside Acres) should add the cash amounts on their Life tiles with the money they have on hand. The player with the most money is the winner!"

Get your tiles.,
Play the tiles on spaces.",How to Play the Ancient Game of Pai Sho1," You are given 6 kinds of tiles. The water tile, earth tile, fire tile, air tile, avatar tile and lotus tile. The earth tile defeats the fire tile, the fire tile beats air, the air beats water and the water beats earth.;
, When the avatar tile is placed adjacent to any tile it will kill it. If any tile besides the lotus moves beside the avatar the avatar will be captured and will respawn at the beginning. The lotus is checked if a tile is adjacent to it if the lotus does not move after being checked it dies and the opponent wins the game. If the lotus is moved to the center of the board and no opponent is in any of the squares beside the center the player wins.

Keep playing until someone has all six wedges.,
Answer a question in a category chosen by the other players.",How to Play Trivial Pursuit," The Trivial Pursuit game board is shaped like a 6-spoke wheel. Players begin at the center, then move out to earn a wedge from each of the wedge-marked spaces where a spoke meets the outer wheel, and finally return to the center to answer a final question. On all but the oldest sets, a ""Roll Again"" space is set two spaces to either side of each wedge space.The wedge spaces are six spaces out from the center space.;
, Trivial Pursuit is designed for up to six players or teams. If more than six people want to play, or if players aren't comfortable playing by themselves, you may wish to divide into teams. Team play is a bit more casual and may work well if you are having a party., Before you start playing, you should figure out if you will play by any special rules. For example, you may want to set a time limit for answering questions. If you do set a time limit, make sure that you have a timer handy. Or, you may want to set a rule that players must be very specific about their answers, such as with names or dates., There are six playing tokens in different colors. The colors are blue, green, yellow, pink, brown, and orange. Playing tokens are circular in shape with slots for the wedges. Place a token at the center of the board for each player or team.Some editions of Trivial Pursuit include track pawns that match the color of the pie pieces. You can use one of these track pawns to keep track of your spot on the board and use the pie token to keep track of your score., Older editions of Trivial Pursuit come with two cardboard boxes full of questions. With these editions, if players are divided into two teams, you may wish to give one box to each team; if players are divided otherwise, you may wish to use only one box at a time.Some editions, such as the 25th Anniversary Edition, have one plastic box for each category; in this case, place each box by the matching color wedge.

, The player or the team with the highest roll starts the game. After the first player goes, play passes to the left (clockwise). If two or more players or teams tie for the highest roll, have them roll again to see who starts., You can move your token in any one legal direction: toward a wedge or toward the center when on a spoke, clockwise or counterclockwise when on the outer wheel. You can also move from a spoke to the outer wheel or from the outer wheel to a spoke. However, you cannot reverse direction in the middle of a roll.If you land on a ""Roll Again"" space, roll the die again. (You can move in any legal direction, including the opposite direction from your previous roll.)

, In Trivial Pursuit, you get to move again if you give the right answer. You can keep rolling, moving, and answering questions until you get one wrong. Just keep in mind that the questions you answer must correspond with the color space you land on. For example, if you land on a blue space, then you must answer a blue question.If you are in the center space and have not earned all six wedges, you may answer a question in any category of your choice.
In the 25th Anniversary Edition, the question you must answer is also determined by the roll of the die, as each box contains questions for a single category. The higher you roll, the more difficult the question you receive.

, You can earn pie pieces by correctly answering questions, but you can only earn a pie piece when you are on a pie space. These spaces look different from the others on the board because they show an image of the pie token with a wedge in it.For example, if you land on a brown wedge space and answer the question correctly, then you would earn a brown pie piece.

, When a player gets all six pie pieces, that player may begin moving to the center or the board. You must keep rolling and moving each turn as usual until you get to the center space on the board. You need to roll the exact number of spaces to get to the center space.Keep in mind that you may spend several turns coming up short of or overshooting the center until you land on it.

, When you get to the center space, your fellow players may choose any category and ask you a question from that category. If you answer this question correctly, you win the game. If you miss it, your turn ends, and play passes to the next player or team.The other players may not look at the questions before choosing the category. They must select the category without looking at the card and then read the question.
If you miss the question, you will have to roll again during your next turn and try to answer a different question when you get into the center space again.

Get all of your pawns to the HOME space to win the game.",How to Play Sorry," Sorry comes with four sets of four pawns in the colors red, blue, green, and yellow. Choose one color and take all four pawns. Then place all four pawns on the start space of the Sorry board., Take the Sorry cards and shuffle them a few times to get them mixed together. Make sure that all of the cards are facing in the same direction in the pile. Then, place the pile face down on the card spot of the board. There are 11 different types of cards in the deck and they all allow you to do slightly different things. The cards included in Sorry are:1: You can move a pawn from the start or move forward 1 space.
2: You can move a pawn from the start or move forward 2 spaces. You must draw again.

3: Move forward 3 spaces.
4: Move backward 4 spaces.
5: Move forward 5 spaces.
7: Move forward 7 spaces or split between 2 pawns (e.g. 3 spaces for one pawn, 4 spaces for another).
8: Move forward 8 spaces.
10: Move forward 10 spaces or move backward 1 space.
11: Move forward 11 spaces or switch places with an opponent. If it is impossible to move forward 11 spaces, and there are no opponent pawns on the board, then you will have to switch places with your partner or forfeit your turn.
12: Move forward 12 spaces.
Sorry!: You can save the card for later use, or you can use it to bump an opponent's pawn to the start.

, Choose someone to go first before you start the game. You can elect a person at random, have the youngest (or oldest) player go first, or start with the player who won the last game you played. The player to the left of the person who goes first will have the next turn and turns will keep going in a clockwise fashion for the rest of the game., The first thing that each player does at the start of his or her turn is to draw a card from the pile. Cards cannot be taken from the discard pile. Only the face down cards may be drawn. When you draw a card, read what it says to do and follow the directions.Some cards have special rules that allow you to split the move between two pawns, take the place of an opponent’s pawn, or move backwards.
You need to draw either a 1 or 2 to make your first move.

, If you draw a card that will advance one or more of your pawns past another player’s pawns or past your own pawns, then you can jump over them. Do not move other players’ pawns if you jump them, just move to the space that your card allows you to go to., If you land on a space that is occupied by an opponent’s pawn, then you will need to bump it back to the START space. Two pawns can never occupy the same space in Sorry.If you draw a card that would move one of your pawns to a space you already own, you do not get to move that turn. Leave all of your pawns where they are and let the next player take his or her turn.

, If you land on a SLIDE triangle that is not the same color as the pawns you have chosen, then you get to slide to the circle at the end of the triangle. As you slide, bump any other pawns (including your pawns) back to the START space. If the triangle is the same color as your pawns, do not slide. Just stay put on the triangle and move as usual during your next turn., Each player has a SAFETY ZONE that is the same color as his or her pawns. If the card that you draw allows you to do so, you may move into your SAFETY ZONE. Doing so may protect you from losing the progress you have made with one of your pawns. On a subsequent turn, you can move your pawn back out of the SAFETY ZONE if the card allows you to do so., It is possible that you and your fellow players will draw all of the cards in the deck before the end of the game. If you do, then simply shuffle the deck and replace the cards face down on the card spot of the Sorry board., To win Sorry, you need to get all of your pawns to the home space. Getting your pawns home sounds simple, but it may take time because other players will bump you back to START. You also need to draw the exact number of spaces between a pawn and your home space in order to get there. The number cannot be higher than the amount of spaces between your pawn and the HOME space."

Look for empty points on the board that your stones surround.,
Count the number of stones you still have on the board.,
Add up your score and determine a winner.",How to Score a Game of Go1," A game of Go is not over until both players have passed play or when one player resigns. In Go, you pass play if you have no moves left. Therefore, if both players pass play, then there are no more good moves to be made and the game is over., The intersections or points in Go are worth one point each. Count up the points that you have surrounded with your stones.If you have an area partially surrounded, then it is considered neutral and it does not count for a point.Write down the total number of points that you have.

, After you have counted your points, you will need to count up your stones. Any stones that are left on the board may be included in this total. Write down this number after you have finished counting up all of your stones., Once you have determined your total number of empty points and your total number of stones, add these two numbers together. Your total number is your final score. Compare your total score to your opponent’s total score to determine the winner."

Know the object.,
Learn the gameplay rules.,
Understand the concept of Harmonies.,
Know when to remove tiles.,
Wrap up the game.,
Calculate the scores.",How to Play the Ancient Game of Pai Sho2," To arrange your pieces in a way to gain the most points by generating ""harmonies"", and by avoiding the generation of ""disharmonies"".

, Each player may take one of four moves during their turn:


Play one piece on an intersection.
Move one of the pieces up, down, left, or right to an adjoining intersection, as long as they don't interfere with tile rules.
Use the wheel to rotate the pieces around the wheel clock-wise.
Pass their turn.

- A tile may not end its turn on a point occupied by another tile that it cannot capture.
- A player may move a tile any number of spaces shorter than its maximum movement value.
- Flowers may end their turn on an intersection composed of both red and white spaces regardless of their color.
- Flower tiles placed onto an opposing color intersection by a tile capable of moving other tiles are returned to the players reserve pile.



, Certain flower tiles go along with other tiles (called a ""harmony"") or they will go against other tiles (""disharmony""). At the end of each game, each tile that is in harmony with the one next to it earns 1 point. Each tile that is in disharmony with the tile next to it causes the owner of the tile to lose 1 point. Pieces must be owned by the same player to generate harmony or disharmony. The harmonies are displayed lower on this page.To form a harmony, the two tiles must be owned by you, and they must be connected by any number of the lines in one cardinal direction. There can be no opposing or disharmonious tiles in between your two tiles. However, there may be boat and neutral harmony flower tiles in between.

, Landing on a tile may or may not remove it from the board. To move one, it must be an opposite tile, and owned by your opponent. The Dragon and Lotus rules still apply here, and all removed tiles are placed into The Pot.

, The game ends when one player is left with only three harmonious tiles, a player forfeits, or a player forms a consistent chain of harmonies around the center point and wins the game.

, At the end of the game, each player tallies the points scored for all the harmonies they completed. Red flowers in red spaces and white flowers in white spaces in a harmony get one extra bonus point. All of a player's pieces that are within 3 spaces of a White Lotus tile gain an extra point also. Each player then subtracts 1 point for each piece that they have on the board. The player with the most points remaining wins.

Below is the guide to the tiles:



White Flowers


Jasmine: Harmony with Lily and Rhododendron.",How to Play the Ancient Game of Pai Sho3," Disharmony with Rose.

Lily: Harmony with Jasmine and White Jade. Disharmony with Chrysanthemum.

White Jade: Harmony with Lily and Rose. Disharmony with none.



Red Flowers


Rose/Snapdragon: Harmony with White Jade and Chrysanthemum. Disharmony with Jasmine. The Rose Tile can be substituted for a Snapdragon tile for aesthetic purposes.

Chrysanthemum: Harmony with Rose and Rhododendron. Disharmony with Lily.

Rhododendron: Harmony with Chrysanthemum and Jasmine. Disharmony with White Dragon.



Non-flowers


Knotweed: May be placed on any point. When played, all pieces that are next to knotweed orthogonally (or at a right angle to) are dead. Any piece, even the owner of the knotweed's pieces, that is placed or moved next to a knotweed is dead. Knotweed may not move, or be moved by other pieces. The point of this tile is to lessen your opponent's tiles, and therefore their points.

Wheel: When played, rotate clock-wise the pieces that are immediately around it. Wheels cannot be moved by any tile but another wheel. At the end, each player loses 1 extra point for each wheel they have on the board, even if they are considered dead.

Boat: Use this piece to ""push"" another piece orthogonally as well as the piece next to it. This may only be done if there is an empty space behind the second piece that the boat tile is moving (which would be behind the first piece), and if the move is normally legal.

Rock: Players may not play or move a piece so that it is next to an opponent's rock, orthogonally or diagonally.



Special Tiles


White Dragon: Harmony with the Lilly and Rose. Disharmony with Rhododendron.

White Lotus: Players gain 1 point for each piece that they own within 3 spaces from a White Lotus at the end of the game. No harmonies or disharmonies. This tile is a ""wild card.""

Pay attention to the positions of pieces that do not move.",How to Play Stratego," Each Stratego set comes with a 10X10 board to play on. The board is large enough to accommodate both players' armies plus non-moving pieces. The board has two 2X2 lake areas on it that pieces cannot move through and that act as the barrier space when you first set up the game. Do not place any pieces on or near these spots when you set up the game. Keep the two center rows of the board empty until the game has started., Each Stratego game comes with two sets of army pieces (one red and one blue). Each army has 33 army pieces and every piece is ranked from 1-10 (1 is the lowest rank and 10 is the highest rank). Each set also includes 6 Bombs and 1 Flag, but these pieces are not ranked and they do not move. Only the army pieces may move and attack. Each army set includes: 10: 1 Marshall

9: 1 General

8: 2 Colonels

7: 3 Majors

6: 4 Captains

5: 4 Lieutenants

4: 4 Sergeants

3: 5 Miners

2: 8 Scouts

1: 1 Spy

, Since there are two sets, you and your opponent will each have to choose a color before you can set up the game. Try choosing at random by holding two different color pieces in each hand (so your opponent cannot see them) and ask your opponent to choose one. Whatever color your opponent chooses will be his or her color for the game., Before you set you your army pieces, you will need to set up the fortress screen to prevent your opponent from seeing how you are positioning your pieces. Do not remove the fortress screen from the board until you and your opponent have finished setting up the board., As you set up your pieces, make sure that they are facing you and not your opponent. Your opponent should not be able to see the types of your pieces and you should not be able to see the types of your opponent’s pieces. After you have set up your pieces, you are ready to play., During each of your turns, you may either move or attack an opponent’s piece. You may not do both. If you find yourself in a position where you cannot move or attack, then you have lost the game and must announce your defeat to your opponent., Take turns moving your pieces in vertical or horizontal directions. Pieces may not move in a diagonal direction. Pieces may only move one space, except for the Scouts which can move an unlimited distance. Just keep in mind that because only scouts can move more than one space per turn, moving a scout more than one space will reveal its identity to your opponent and may cause your opponent to attack that piece.Pieces cannot jump over the lake or over other pieces. They also may not occupy the same space as another piece.Pieces cannot move back and forth between the same two spaces over three consecutive turns.

, Attack your opponent’s pieces to reduce his or her numbers and capture your opponent’s Flag. You may only attack pieces that are directly next to your pieces. They may not be a space away or diagonal to one of your pieces. They must be right next to each other in a vertical or horizontal direction.When you attack your opponent (or your opponent attacks you) you must both announce the rank of your piece that attacked (or was attacked). Whatever piece has the highest ranking wins the fight. Remove the losing piece from the board. If both pieces have the same rank, then remove both pieces from the board.
Place captured pieces in the tray as you play. Doing so will help to keep them organized for future games.
Place the winning piece on the space that was occupied by the losing piece., Some pieces have special attack privileges that make them capable of attacking more powerful pieces. Make sure that you observe these special attack privileges as you play the game.The Spy can capture the Marshal if the Spy attacks first. If the Spy is attacked by the Marshal, then the Spy is captured instead.
Scouts can move and attack on the same turn. No other pieces can do both in the same turn
Miners can disarm Bomb pieces. All other pieces must be removed from the board if they attack a Bomb piece.

, Whoever captures his or her opponent’s Flag first wins the game. But you may also win the game if your opponent reaches a point where he or she cannot make any more moves. For example, if all of the player’s moveable pieces have been captured or blocked, then that player would lose the game., A common strategy in Stratego is to surround one’s Flag with Bomb pieces to prevent players from accessing it. However, this strategy may fail if your opponent uses a miner to defuse these Bombs and then captures your Flag. If you do surround your Flag with Bombs, make sure that you have some high ranking, moveable pieces nearby to take out any approaching pieces., Since surrounding the Flag piece with Bombs is a popular strategy, you will benefit from keeping some of your Miner pieces in play. Having Miners on hand will help you to defuse Bomb pieces later in the game and hopefully capture your opponent’s flag., Scouts are helpful in identifying your opponent’s frontline pieces, so it is a good idea to keep some Scouts in your front row. Since Scouts are low-ranking pieces, you can afford to lose a few in the first few turns if it helps you to identify some of your opponent’s higher ranking pieces., Although you do not want to have all of your high-ranking pieces up front, it is wise to have a few in your first two rows so that you can use them if necessary. Otherwise, your opponent’s high-ranking pieces may take out an entire row of your low-ranking pieces before you can stop him or her., Stratego requires you to use your memory skills and pay attention to what pieces are where as your opponent attacks. It is also helpful to note the pieces that never move during the game. These pieces are likely to be Bombs, so you may want to send your Scouts to check them out or send Miners to defuse them."

, Seki means mutual life. In a seki situation, neither player can move because the player who moves will lose stones.


Look for areas on the board where you and your opponent have each other surrounded, but you only have one liberty each. Count the stones within this area and write down this number.

, You will need to know the total number of stones your opponent has captured from you to get your score. These are the stones that have been removed from the board and set aside in a captured pile. Count up these stones and write this number down as well., Once you have determined your seki stone total and your captured stone total, you should add these two numbers together. Write down the total of these two numbers., The last thing you need to do to get your score is to subtract your seki and captured stone total you’re your empty points total. The equation should look something like this: Empty Points – (seki stones + captured stones) = final score. Complete this equation using your numbers and then write down your answer., After you and your opponent have calculated your scores, you should compare them to see who won the game. The player with the highest score is the winner. If you want to determine the margin of victory, then you can subtract the lower score from the higher score. Doing this just lets you know how many points you or your opponent won by."

Select one person to be your picturist for the first word. The picturist is the person who attempts to illustrate the word using the pencil and paper. Everyone else on the team will try to guess the word that the picturist draws.Players on the team will take turns acting as the picturist.
If you only have three players, one person must be designated to draw for both teams during the entire game.;
, Each team gets a category card, a pad of paper and a pencil. The category card explains the meanings of the category abbreviations that you see on the playing board and word cards.The different categories are (P) for person, place or animal; (O) for object; (A) for action, such as an event; (D) for difficult words; and (AP) for all play.
If you prefer, you can draw on a dry-erase board and marker instead of pencil and paper.

, Place the game board and deck of word cards in the center of the group. Place a playing piece on the starting square of the Pictionary game board to represent each team. Since the starting space is labeled (P), each team will draw the person, place or animal category first., Some people like to set special rules before starting a game in order to prevent any disputes later in the game. Talk to the other players about any house rules that you want to set before you start the game.For example, how picky will you be about words that other players call out? If a player calls out “baseball” and the word is “ball”, will that count or does the player need to say the exact word?

, Each team rolls the die once and the higher number plays first. The first word played will be an “All Play” word, but the team with the highest die roll gets to select the card.Do not move the game pieces on the board after the opening die roll. Leave them in the start space.

, After the first card has been selected, both team’s picturists should have a chance to look at the word for five seconds before they begin drawing. Do not start the timer until five seconds have passed and both picturists are ready to draw.

, When both team’s picturists are ready, start the timer and instruct the picturists to start drawing. The picturists will have 60 seconds to draw while their teammates try to guess the word. The first team to guess the word correctly wins control of the die.Remember, do not advance any pieces during the first turn. The object of the first turn is to see who gets control of the die.

, Each team should decide on a turn order for picturists so that everyone gets a turn. During your team’s turn, the picturist selects a word card from the front of the deck. The picturist may look at the word in the (P) category for up to five seconds, but may not allow any of his or her teammates to see it., Each picturist has one minute to draw their word as best they can. Teammates can guess continuously during the one minute drawing time. Keep in mind that picturists may not talk, use hand gestures, or write numbers or letters during their turns.If teammates guess the word on the card before the timer runs out, they get to roll the die, move the number of spaces indicated, then pick another card and draw again.
If teammates don't guess the word in time, they pass the die to the team on the left, who begins by drawing a word card.

, Start each turn by picking a word card, not rolling the die. You only roll the die and move the playing piece when your team guesses the word before the timer runs out and your turn continues., If you land on an “All Play” square or the word on the card has a triangle symbol next to it, then all of the teams get to compete. The picturists for each team get to look at the word card for five seconds. Then, start the timer and have the picturists from each team draw clues for their teammates.The team that guesses the word before the timer runs out gets to roll the die, move the spaces indicated by the die roll, and pick a new word card.

, Once a team reaches the ""All Play"" square, they are eligible to win the game. Keep in mind that your team does not have to land on this square with an exact roll of the die. If your team doesn't guess the word guess the word, then play continues with the team to the left., It may take several tries before your team guesses the word and you may be in competition with other teams that are also on the final square. Keep trying until someone wins the game."

Make the game educational.",How to Play Snakes and Ladders," The object of the game is to be the first player to reach the end by moving across the board from square one to the final square. Most boards wrap back and forth, so you move left to right across first row, then move up to the second and move right to left, and so on.Follow the numbers on the board to see how to move forward. For example, if you rolled a five and you were on space number 11, then you would move your game piece to space number 16.;
, Each player should roll one die to see who gets the highest number. Whoever rolls the highest number gets to take the first turn. After the first player takes a turn, the person sitting to that player’s left will take a turn. Play continues in a circle going left.


If two or more people roll the same number, and it is the highest number rolled, each of those people roll the die an additional time to see who gets to go first.

, To take your turn, roll the die again and read the number that you rolled. Pick up your game piece and move forward that number of spaces. For example, if you roll a two, move your piece to square two. On your next turn, if you roll a five, move your piece forward five squares, ending up on square seven.Some people play that you can only move onto the board if you roll a one, and if you don't get a one, you just skip your turn. This isn't recommended, since this can be frustrating for unlucky players.

, The ladders on the game board allow you to move upwards and get ahead faster. If you land exactly on a square that shows an image of the bottom of a ladder, then you may move your game piece all the way up to the square at the top of the ladder.If you land at the top of a ladder or somewhere in the middle of a ladder, just stay put. You never move down ladders.

, Some versions have snakes on the board, while others have chutes (slides). Snakes (or chutes) move you back on the board because you have to slide down them. If you land exactly at the top of a snake or chute, slide your game piece all the way to the square at the bottom of the snake or chute.If you land on a square that is in the middle or at the bottom of a snake (or chute), just stay put. You only slide down if you land on the top square of a snake (or chute).

, If you roll a six, then you get an extra turn. First, move your piece forward six squares and then roll the die again. If you land on any snakes or ladders, follow the instructions above to move up or down and then roll again to take your extra turn. As long as you keep rolling sixes, you can keep moving!, The first person to reach the highest square on the board wins, usually square 100. But there's a twist! If you roll too high, your piece ""bounces"" off the last square and moves back. You can only win by rolling the exact number needed to land on the last square.For example, if you are on square 99 and roll a four, move your game piece to 100 (one move), then ""bounce"" back to 99, 98, 97 (two, three, then four moves.) If square 97 is a ladder base or snake head, climb or slide as usual.

, Having to land exactly on the final square makes the game more exciting, since it gives people a chance to catch up, but it can also make the game take too long. Instead, you can let people roll higher than they need to reach 100.


For a little more excitement, when someone reaches or passes 100, give each other player one turn to try to beat them. If someone would end up higher (such as 104 instead of 101), he wins. Two or more people can tie and win together this way, if they end up on the same square.

, Have each player play with two game pieces, each the same color so no one gets confused. When you roll the die, you can move one of your two pieces by that amount. You need to have both of your pieces reach the last square in order to win., In this variation, each player starts on square one. To take your turn, roll two dice instead of one. Choose one die and move your piece forward by that amount. With your remaining die, you can move another player forward by the amount on that die.For a much ""meaner"" variation, and potentially a much longer game, whenever you land exactly on the same square as another game piece, the piece that was already there moves all the way back to the beginning, and has to roll to get on the board again.

, Making your own Snakes and Ladders set is quite easy, as described in the tips. You can add your own touch by writing words, trivia questions, or other educational material in some or all of the squares. Here are some ideas:


For kids learning to read, write a simple word in each square. When a player moves his piece, he reads out each word he passes through.Use the snakes and ladders to teach good ideas and discourage bad ones.For example, a ladder could travel from ""I did my homework."" to ""I got good grades."" A snake could go from ""I didn't eat any fruits or vegetables today."" to ""My stomach feels bad.""

19 terrain hexes (four sheep, four wheat, four wood, three brick, three ore, and one desert).
Six sea frame pieces.
18 circular number tokens.
A black/grey robber pawn.
Four sets of wooden player pieces in four different colors each containing five settlements, four cities, and 15 roads.
25 development cards consisting of 14 knight/soldier cards, 6 progress cards, and 5 victory points.
Resource cards of each terrain hex except for the desert.
Four building costs cards, one for each player.
""Longest Road"" and ""Largest Army"" award cards.
Two dice, one red, one yellow.
Extra harbor pieces for placement of random harbors (optional).;
, The object of Settlers of Catan is to be the first to gain 10 victory points. Points are earned by building structures, buying cards, and earning accomplishment cards such as “Longest Road” and “Largest Army”.Each settlement is worth one victory point and each city is worth two victory points.
Each ""Victory Point"" card is worth one victory point.
Each special card is worth two victory points. The ""Longest Road"" card will be awarded to the first person to successfully build a continuous five roads. The card will switch hands whenever a player's number of connecting roads surpasses the longest continuous road of the cardholder. The ""Largest Army"" card will be awarded to the first person to play three ""Knight"" cards. The card will switch hands whenever a player plays more ""Knight"" cards than the ""Largest Army"" cardholder.

, Before you lay down the hexes to create the game board, place the outer frame pieces. Each frame has a small number on the edges where it connects to other pieces. Put the frames together by matching the numbers up., Put a random terrain hex on the inside of the frame so that its edges are touching the sea frame. Keep putting down random terrains in a clockwise fashion until you have reached the center and all of the terrain hexes fill are inside the frame.You may want to place the desert hex on an outside edge, away from any trade ports, to make the game a bit easier.
A variation on this way of laying out the hexes is to place all of the hexes face down. They may only be turned upwards when someone places a road or a settlement on that hex., Each token has a small letter above its number. Place the number token with the letter ""A"" on one of the edge terrain hexes, put the token with the letter ""B"" to the right of the first placed token, and continue on putting down tokens in alphabetical order in a clockwise fashion until you have reached the center. All of the terrain hexes should now have a token on them. These numbers determine which roll will grant which player resources to use.Do not place a number on the desert hex.
You may also place tokens at random without paying attention to the letters, but this will make the game more challenging.

, Place the robber on the desert tile. The robber is the small gray piece that resembles a bowling pin. The robber starts out on the desert tile, but may be moved whenever someone rolls a seven or plays a Knight card., The resource cards and development cards should be placed near the board where they are easily accessible to all players. Keep the resource cards separated by type (sheep, lumber, bricks, rocks, and wheat) and keep the development cards separate from the resource cards. Place the resource cards in five separate piles facing up and place the development cards in a separate pile facing down.You should shuffle the development cards, but do not shuffle the resource cards!

, Every player rolls two dice to start. The player who rolls the highest number gets to select his or her color and take the first turn. There are four colors included with the Base Catan 3-4 player set: red, blue, white, and orange.After the player with the highest dice roll has chosen his or her color, have everyone else choose and then begin the turns.
Turns progress in a clockwise manner.

, The first player places one of his settlements at an intersection, where three terrain hexes meet, the adjoining hexes are the resources he will earn if the number on that hex is rolled (so choose wisely!). Next, he places one of his roads on one of the three possible places next to his first settlement. The next player then takes her turn in the same way, but must place her settlement in a different area.Roads must always be placed where two hexes meet and border the player's settlement.
A settlement cannot be placed on an intersection adjacent to another intersection occupied by a settlement. There must be enough space for at least two roads between each settlement.

, The last player gets to place two settlements and two roads (one for each settlement) and then going counter-clockwise, the first players place their second settlement and second road until each player has two settlements and two roads down on the board., After all players have placed both of their settlements and roads, you all get some resource cards to start. Take one resource card for each hex tile that is adjacent to each of your two settlements.For example, if one of your settlements is bordering a wheat, lumber, and sheep tile, then you get to take one wheat, one lumber and one sheep card. Do the same for your other settlement.

, Each player's settlement will be touching three terrain hexes with three numbers. If the number that is rolled corresponds to the number that a player's settlement is on, then that player gets to pick up a resource card of that terrain hex. The same is true for a player with a city (instead of a settlement), except that they would get to pick up two resource cards.


You also get more resource cards if you have more than one settlement bordering a hex. For example, if you have two settlements on the edges of a hex and that hex’s number is rolled, then you get two of that hex’s resource cards.
All players are eligible to get resource cards even if they are not rolling the dice. If a number is rolled by another player and you have a settlement bordering that hex, then you get a resource card. The only exception is if the robber is on your hex. In that case, you are blocked from receiving any resources from that hex until someone moves the robber again.

, After the dice are rolled, the player then has the option of either building structures like roads or upgrading settlements to cities, playing a development card, or trading. Players may choose to do all or none of these actions. When a player has finished taking his or her actions, the player then passes the dice to the right.You may only play one development card per turn.

, During their turn, players can use resources that they have to build structures, such as roads, settlement, and cities. See your building cost card to figure out what you can build with the resources that you have. Keep in mind that each settlement is worth 1 point and each city is worth 2 points, but you have to upgrade settlements to cities. You cannot just build a city without first having a settlement.To build a road you need: One wood and one brick
To build a settlement you need: One wood, one brick, one sheep, and one wheat
To build a city you need: Three ore and two wheat. Cities can only be built in place of an already existing settlement.
To buy a development card you need: One sheep, one wheat, and one ore

, Players may play development cards at the beginning or end of their turn. Development cards do different things but their effects are clearly stated on the card itself. Development cards come in the following types:A ""Knight"" card allows a player to move the robber to any spot on the board and then gets to take a card from any player that has a settlement or city on the blocked resource.
A ""Road Building"" card allows a player to place two roads on the board.
A ""Year of Plenty"" card gives a player any two resource cards.
After a player plays the ""Monopoly"" card, that player announces one type of resource. Every player must then give that player all of that type of resource card(s) in their hand.
A ""Victory Point"" card automatically gives the player one victory point.

, For example, if you play a knight card, you must turn it face up and move the robber right away. You may move the robber to any hex and then collect one resource (at random) from the opponent who owns that hex. If two opponents have settlements bordering that hex, then you may choose who to rob.Keep any victory point cards that you draw face down so that your opponents cannot see them.

, The player can also trade for resources, either with any other players or with the bank. A player may trade in four of the same resource card for any resource card. If player is on a special harbor, that player may trade in two of that harbor's resource for any resource card. At a generic harbor a player may trade in three of the same resource card for any resource card., If a player rolls a seven, then each player must make sure that he/she does not have more than seven cards in his or her hand. If a player does have more than seven cards, that player must discard half of them. The person that rolled the seven then gets to put the robber on whatever number token he/she desires, and then, gets to take one card from any player that has a settlement or city touching the terrain hex with the robber on it.Keep in mind that the robber blocks players from getting resource from a hex. In other words, if the hex number occupied by the robber is rolled, players with settlements or cities on that number do not get to collect the resource the robber is blocking.

, There are a number of strategies that you can use to help you get the upper hand and win the game. The most basic strategy is to get your starting settlement in an area that give you access to the most commonly rolled resources (the resources with the red or physically larger numbers). Some other strategies include:Setting yourself up to build roads and settlements by aiming for lots of brick and wood hexes in the beginning.
Monopolizing ports. Try to get a port and at least two cities on different hexes with the same resource, so that you can trade for whatever you need.
Targeting the winning player(s) with the robber and Knight cards. Robbing your opponents can keep them from progressing too much while also gaining your some extra resources.
Building cities (and settlements) as soon as you can. When you have lots of resources to work with, you'll be able to trade and build easily.

, To win the game, you need to be the first one to get 10 victory points. Once you achieve this number, announce it to your fellow players. Keep in mind that your victory points cards and any special cards, such as “Longest Road” or “Largest Army”, will count towards your 10 point total. Keep a running total of your points as you play the game so that you don’t surpass 10 points without noticing.You can extend the game by playing until someone achieves a higher number of points, like 12 or 14 points.

Divide the players into two teams.,
Have the teams flip a coin to see who starts.

,
The starting team draws a circle in the ground - then throws the target ball or cochonnet out to a distance of 6 to 10 meters (19.7 to 32.8 ft).

,
The starting team then throws their first boule, trying to get as close as possible to the cochonnet.Then the 2nd team's player stands in the circle, and tries to get their boule closer to the cochonnet than the opposing team.,
Learn that if that team does get a boule closer than any of its opponents, it's called ""having the point"" - and then the opposing team has to attempt to throw a boule closer.

,
Understand that the team which does not have the closest boule (to the cochonnet) keeps throwing boules until either they get closest, or they run out of boules to throw.

,
When all boules are thrown, only the boules of the one team that are closest to the cochonnet are added to the running score.,
The teams continue to play rounds until one of the teams reaches 13 points.",How to Play Petanque," You can play 1 vs. 1 (3 balls per player); 2 vs. 2 (3 balls per player); or 3 vs. 3 (2 balls per player).;
,,, They can try to do this by rolling their boule; lobbing it; or even throwing it at the opposing team's boule moving it away.

,,, That is, if team-A ""has the point"" and has 2 of its 3 boules closer to the cochonnet than the opposing team's closest boule (in this example, the 3rd closest boule), then team-A gets 2 points added to their score.

, For each round, the team that won the previous round starts the new round. It draws a circle around the location of the cochonnet at the end of the previous round. That becomes the throwing circle for the next round.

The goal of Mahjong is to clear the board by removing all the tiles from the original layout and setting them up into four sets and one pair (a ""Mahjong"").,
The game uses 136 tiles.,
There is also a dice that is rolled in order to decide how the tiles are dealt.

,
Start with four players.,
Choose a starting dealer.,
Go over the rules with all the players.,
Set up stands for each player, which will keep the wall of tiles in place.

,
The dealer shuffles the four wind tiles and deals them to the players.,
The dealer then shuffles all the tiles on the table face down.

,
Each player takes 34 tiles and keeps them face down.

,
Players then should stack their tiles in a ""wall"" that is 17 tiles across and two tiles high.,
The dealer rolls the dice.,
The dealer deals tiles in a clockwise fashion to each player.,
The dealer starts by discarding a tile.,
The next player discards a tile.,
Then the player to that person's right (South) should discard a tile face up and either pick one up from the discarded tiles or from the wall.

,
Continue discarding and picking up a tile with each player in a clockwise fashion.

,
The players should continue until someone wins by declaring Mahjong or all the tiles are used up.

,
Calculate the score at the end.",How to Play Mahjong,"


The four sets are called Pung, Sheung or Kong sets.
Pung is a set of three identical tiles from any set
Sheung is a run of three tiles from a suit -- for example, you could hold a 4, 5, and six of bamboos
Kong is four identical tiles from any set
Ngan is a pair of the same tiles and is also needed to get Mahjong;
, These tiles have 36 characters, 36 bamboos, 36 circles, 16 wind tiles, and 12 dragon tiles. The groups of 36 tiles are each divided into 4 sets of numbers 1-9.

,, Because of the number of tiles, Mahjong is a game played by strictly four players.

, This person will deal out the first set of tiles to all the players.

, You will want to set the maximum number of points and the hand that represents it.


The maximum number of points (called the Fan) must be held by the winning hand.

,, The four tiles represent different directions and will determine how the players sit.


The wind tiles are North, South, East and West and the players should sit accordingly around the table.

,,, They should remain face down and players cannot look at the walls in front of them.

, Whatever number the dealer rolls, he or she counts that many tiles from the right edge of the wall and begins dealing tiles from the left of that spot.

, Each player will receive 13 tiles except for the dealer, who will have 14 tiles.


Players can look at their tiles but should not show them to others.

, When you discard a tile, place it face up in the middle of the square of walls face up so that all the players can see it.

, The player to the right of the dealer (East) then discards one of their tiles and can either pick up one of the face up tiles or pick one up from the wall.


The idea is to pick up tiles that will help you reach your Mahjong hand -- so for example if the face up tile combines with one of the tiles in your hand to create a pair, you would want to pick it up.

,,,, Make sure that the winner has a combination of four sets and one pair. If all the tiles are used and no one has declared Mahjong, then there is no winner.

Move through the board.,
Use senet sticks.,
Play with 5 game pieces.,
Read the basic rules.",How to Play Senet1," In Senet, you play on a board consisting of 30 squares, referred to as houses. The houses are arranged in 3 rows, with 10 houses in each row. The object of the game is to move through the board, eventually getting all your pieces off the board.To move, you move your pieces down the first row. Once you reach the end of the first row, you turn a corner and proceed the opposite way down the second row.Once you reach the end of the second row, you once again turn a corner. You then proceed the opposite way down the third row. Once you reach the end of the third row, you move your piece off the board.The number of squares you move at a time is based on how you throw the senet sticks.;
, Senet does not use dice like a traditional board game. Instead, senet uses what are called senet sticks. These are usually popsicle sticks with one side painted black and the other painted in a different, brighter color. When it's your turn, you'll throw the sticks in the air. How many sticks land with the black side facing up determines your move.


If you have three black sides and one color side, you can move one house and toss again.If you have two color sides and two black sides, you move two houses and then lose your turn.If you have three color sides and one black side, you move three houses and lose your turn.Four color sides means you move four houses and toss again.Four black sides means you move 5 houses and toss again., Senet is a two player game. Each player gets 5 game pieces at the beginning of senet. You must move all these pieces off the board in order to win. Pieces are usually rocks but you can also use pennies or other coins. Any small, movable object can be used on a senet board., There are some basic rules when it comes to playing Senet. You should familiarize yourself with these rules before beginning the game.


Only one piece can be placed in each house at a time.
At the beginning of the game, you must place your pieces on the first row. Player 1 will place his or her pieces on the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth houses. Player 2 will place his or her pieces on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth houses."

All 91 dominoes are tipped upside down and spread around to mix them up.,
Each player takes twelve dominoes and stands them on edge so that their faces are visible to the owner but not to the other players.,
Each player looks to see if he has the double-twelve.,
Everyone organizes their dominos.,
Continuing in clockwise order around the table, each player now starts to lay down his train, which is a single row of dominoes starting from the double (train station) in the center and extending towards the player (this makes it easy for everyone, including you, to remember which train is yours).,
Each player continues taking a turn.,
The play ends as soon as one player runs out of dominoes, or when no other domino can be played.








,
Each player scores as penalty points the spots on the dominoes they have left (so a player who ran out of dominoes will score no penalty points for that game).








,
A complete session would consist of 13 games, the first started with the 12-12, then the 11-11, 10-10 and so on down to the 0-0.








",How to Play Mexican Train Domino Game,"






;
, The remaining dominoes are left face down in the ""bone-yard"".









Up to 6 players take 12 dominoes each, 7 or 8 players take 10 each, and 9 or 10 players take 8 each.

, (The second game will be started by the double-eleven and so on downwards to the double-blank for the 13th game.)









The player who has the double-twelve (the train station) begins the first round by placing it in the center of the table.
If no one has the double, players draw one domino at a time, in clockwise fashion, from the bone-yard until the double-twelve (the train station) is found.

, This can take awhile, depending upon how many dominoes everyone had to pick up. Each player will learn their own system for keeping all their dominoes straight, but basically you want to:









Make the longest train possible with the dominoes in your hand. This is done in front of you with the dominoes on edge so your opponent(s) can't see what you have.
Keep all your starter dominoes (train engines) separate (as you use these only to start your train or a Mexican train).
Keep your ""loose"" dominoes (those that wouldn't fit into your personal train) handy to add to a Mexican train if and when possible.
Fit in any doubles into your personal train as early as possible. For instance if you have the following train: 12-12, 12-5, 5-0, 0-1, 1-3 and then you notice that you also have the double-1: Place this double-1 domino in between the 0-1 and the 1-3 dominoes (double dominoes are special during play).

, The ends of adjacent dominoes must match in number and the center facing end of the first domino played must match the center domino (in the first game, therefore, a 12 is needed). A single train might look like this: 12-12, 12-5, 5-0, 0-1, etc. As the train grows, it will turn and twist around; just be sure to allow your neighbors to have room for their trains too.









If any player is unable to start their train - having no (engine) domino that matches the center double - they draw from the bone-yard, hoping that they pull a domino with a 12 on one end, in which case they will play it as normal, and the next player will take their turn. Any player without a train must continue to pick up dominoes until he either draws a domino with a 12 (engine) or can place a domino on a Mexican train that another opponent has started.
No player is allowed to play on another player's train, nor to start the ""Mexican train,"" during their first turn. The first domino you place, after the starting double (train station) is your personal train.

, Any player with a 12 domino (engine) can lay it down off the double-twelve domino (train station) in the center anytime it is his turn to start a Mexican train. Mark the 12 half of this Mexican train starter domino with a marker to remind others they also can play on this new Mexican train whenever it is their turn.









If a player cannot either lay a domino on his own train, or play a domino on a Mexican train, or play a domino on an opponent's train, he must draw a domino. If he cannot play this domino, he states this out loud and it is the next person's turn. If he can play it, he does so and it is the next person's turn.
If he was not able play his drawn domino on his own train, he must top the first domino of his train (his engine) with a marker; this lets all other players know that his train can now be played on (just like a Mexican train). Splay a third domino, which again may go anywhere - on the first or second double you played or elsewhere, and may be a third double - and so on.
Your turn ends after you play one domino that is not a double or, being unable to do so, you pass and place your penny on your train. The only exception to this is that if your very last domino is a double you may go out (finish the game) with it. In that case, the game ends immediately and penalty points are tallied. You are the winner of this round, as you will have zero points.
If a double is played, and the player leaves a train ending in a double, then after the end of that player's turn the next domino played by the next player must be played on that double.
The duty of satisfying the double falls first on the next player after the person who played the double. If they can satisfy the double, they must do so - even though it may be on a personal train. If they cannot satisfy the double from their hand, they draw a tile and if that does not match the double either, they pass and place a penny on their own train; the duty of satisfying the double then passes to the following player in turn. If a player leaves several doubles unsatisfied at the end of a turn, each of the exposed doubles must be satisfied by subsequent players in the order that they were played.

Choose cards or blocks.,
Set up your blocks.,
Remove pairs of ""open"" blocks.,
Discard the removed blocks in a side pile.,
Shuffle the remaining blocks if the game is unwinnable.,
Reassemble the layout once the blocks are gone.,
Customize the rules to suit yourself.,
Score your game.",How to Play Mahjong Solitaire1," A typical Mahjong game uses blocks with Chinese symbols of them. However, you can play the same rules using a Western deck of playing cards. Mahjong tiles may be purchased online, or from a game's store. While cards may be a reasonable substitute, using the real thing will prove more enjoyable in the long run.;
, A traditional Mahjong set-up uses 144 blocks in a rough ""spider"" shape, with three extra layers added on top like a pyramid, making it a 3D puzzle. Although you don't need to adhere to the traditional setup, it's a good idea to give it a try at least once. Place the blocks in a random order. This will offer the game a sense of unpredictability.


Mahjong layouts are four layers high, in the rough shape of a pyramid. Although there are no strict layout rules, most traditional Mahjong setups use four jutting arms, fixed facing horizontally on the four corners of the square pyramid. More of these ""arms"" will open up more blocks for use, making the game easier.Templates for Mahjong solitaires are available to look up online.However, once you become a seasoned player, you should experiment with creating your own formations. Just make sure that the formation has a large base with jutting arms and blocks that are open for removal.
If you're using cards, set cards next to one another. Because these cards will take up more space than the small Mahjong blocks, it may be a good idea to add more vertical layers than you would with the blocks.

, The actual game of Mahjong Solitaire is simple but surprisingly challenging. Find blocks of the same type and remove them. Blocks can only be removed if they are ""open"", meaning they are not covered, nor adjacent to other blocks on their long sides. Keep your eye out for identical blocks and remove them when you see them. The game will end either when all of the blocks are gone, or when you have no more moves available.


Because a given block will appear four times in a set, the strategic element is to remove blocks that will open up the greatest number of new blocks, thereby making it easier for you to keep the game going., While you're keeping your eye out for ""open"" pairs, you should place the discarded blocks in a safe pile, away from your game. Try not to lose any of the blocks. If you lose even one, it can ruin the set for you.

, If you're playing Mahjong Solitaire by hand, there's a chance that the layout you've constructed was unwinnable from the start. If this is the case, you have the option of reshuffling the blocks you currently have left into something new.From there, hopefully you'll be able to pick out new pairs and keep the game going.

, At a certain point, you should either have all your blocks gone from the layout, or there should be no legal moves left for you to make. If you think you've possibly lost, give it a thorough checking over before you reassemble the layout. Following a game, you can either choose to remake the game in the original layout you were using, or experiment with trying something new.

, Customization is a natural progression for anyone with significant Mahjong Solitaire experience. Because it's a game you can play at home by yourself, there's nothing stopping you from creating your own versions and recalculating the rules to suit you better. If you feel you've been having too much of an easy time with the core gameplay, try adding new restrictions to ""open"" blocks. Why not take out blocks four at a time?


Layouts also radically change the game experience, especially if you maximize the amount of vertical layers. Take care not to make it too challenging for yourself, however. Getting too ambitious with layouts will quickly make the game impossible to play.
Look at some permutations of the game that other people have invented. Although many game versions have been created as online browser games, there's no reason why you can't apply those rules to an at-home game of it. Mahjong Solitaire is a fundamentally simple game at heart, so it practically begs to be experimented with.

, If you play Mahjong Solitaire, you have options when it comes to scoring the game. Some players view themselves as ""winning"" only if they get all of the tiles removed. The most accepted manner of scoring Mahjong is by scoring tiles removed based on their type. Depending on the set, certain sets of blocks may have a score of 1 to 7, depending on their rarity.Refer to the rareness of the pieces in your Mahjong set and give them increasing score counts based on how few of a type there are.


Set a stopwatch and time yourself. Adding time into the game will increase the intensity. This is a good move if you are already well-versed in Mahjong and need an increased challenge.
Because it's a single-player game, you don't need to score yourself at all if you don't want to.

Capture and protect houses.,
Follow the special rules for houses with pictures.,
Win the game.",How to Play Senet2," As only one piece can occupy a house at a time, you will sometimes be in a situation where a house is blocked by another player. There are ways to capture blocked houses when playing Senet. There are also ways to protect your own pieces.


If you land your move on a house occupied by another player, you can capture the piece. The other player's piece will be moved back to the house your piece was on at the beginning of your turn.However, if two or more of another player's pieces are next to each other, that house is protected. It cannot be captured and you will not be able to complete your turn., On a senet board, there are six houses with special pictures on them. If you land on one of these houses, there are special rules you have to follow.


The House of Happiness or Pretty House is marked by what looks like three upside down stick figures. All of your pieces need to pass through this house to win. You must land on the house exactly. If, for example, the House of Happiness is located on square 26 and you're on square 25, if you do not roll in such a way that you'll move exactly one house you have to stay in place until your next turn.The House of Water is marked by three zigzagged lines. If you land on the House of Water, you have to move straight back to the House of Rebirth. The House of Rebirth is marked by three sideways stick figures. Your piece remains on the House of Rebirth until you choose to remove it again.The House of Three Truths is marked by a drawing of three birds. If you land on this house, you can throw your sticks again. If you have three color sides up, you can automatically remove this piece from the board.The House of Re-Atoum is marked by two dancing stick figures. If you have land here, throw your sticks again. If you have two colored sticks facing up, you can remove your piece from the board.The last house on the board is marked by a leaf-like drawing. When you reach this house, you must toss your sticks again. You cannot remove your piece until you toss your sticks and only one colored stick is facing upwards., The object of senet is to move all your pieces off the board. The first player to do so wins."

Picture Card Playoff.",How to Play Our Great Globe," Layout the game board. Give each player a Passport, pen and wipe cloth. Shuffle the Go for Greatness cards and place face down on the designated space on the game board. The Picture card box contains 365 large cards so is impractical to be passing around each turn, so open the box and find a central position on the table for it to sit for the entire game. The game comes with 20 different tokens featuring a wide variety of historical figures. Each player needs to select their preferred historical figure and place it on a token base. All tokens start the game in the Stone Age square.
, All the player choose one player to be the initial dealer. The dealer selects a Picture card from the front of the deck and reads the questions to all the players, careful not to show the back of the card with the answers to any of the players. The dealer also tells the players what each question is worth. Blue question is 1 point, Red question is 2 points and Green question is special with point value described on the card., All the players write the question number and their answer(s) to the question in their Passport. Players should put a dash next to the question number if they don’t have an answer., All players show their answers at the same time. The dealer reads the answers and checks the scoring of each player. All other players check the dealers score., The player to the left of the dealer moves first. The number of spaces moved is equal to the points scored. If the last square a player lands on is a blue or red arrow then they move to the square the arrow points., If the last square a player lands on is labeled with Go for Greatness then the player picks up a Go for Greatness card and follows its instructions. Sometimes the card refers to another player explicitly, sometimes in terms of manager, henchman, partner, accomplice, etc. All of these terms mean another player needs to be selected to share in the benefit or failure of taking the risk and going for greatness in life. Note if another player’s token is repositioned to an arrow or Go for Greatness space they are not moved again., The turn finishes once everyone has moved their own token and the dealer has read the text on the back of the Picture card and returned the Picture card to the back of the deck., The player to the left of the dealer now becomes the dealer and the turn proceeds as before., The objective of the game is to be the player to travel through the ages and finish in the Knowledge Age at the end of a game turn. Note even if you make it into the Knowledge Age before everyone else finishes there movement does not guarantee you victory as the other plays may pick up a Go for Greatness Card and use it to move you back out. If more than one player finishes the game turn in the Knowledge Age they will need to have a Picture Card Playoff to break the tie., All players remaining in the Knowledge Age now playoff to decide the winner. All other players become the judges. A new Picture card is selected from the front of the box and the payers remaining answer the questions. The winner is the player with the most points as judged by the other players. If the highest score is equal among multiple players then those players with the highest score playoff again until there is only one play with the highest score."

Explore different online versions of Mahjong Solitaire.,
Review your score.",How to Play Mahjong Solitaire2," Although many think of Mahjong Solitaire as a classical Chinese game, it's more commonly (and easily) performed with a computer. Mahjong Solitaire is a very popular puzzle game for computers, so it's really easy to find a way to play it. Web search the game and you should come up with countless game servers with the game available for play.You can also download the game as a computer program, or as an app for your phone.


For simplicity's sake, you start off playing Mahjong Solitaire online. Helpful things like pre-made layouts, difficulty settings and a ""hints"" toolbar make it perfect for someone who is still learning the ropes.

, There are hundreds of different kinds of layouts available for Mahjong Solitaire online.While many will use the classical Chinese ""spider"" layout, different outlets of the game will favour different layouts. A layout will have a major impact on your experience on the game. Depending on the shape, there may be a lot or very few ""open"" tiles to choose from.


Try looking for a difficulty gauge on the version of the game you're using. This may have an impact on the type of layout you play with.

, The basic gameplay of Mahjong Solitaire involves removing pairs periodically from the game board. Although the particulars may vary depending on the specific version you're using, this mechanic applies to all versions of Mahjong Solitaire. Keep your eye open for pairs and remove them at will. Because there are more than two blocks for each potential pairing, strategy is involved. Aim for the blocks you think will open up the most blocks in future turns.


The blocks must be considered ""open"" in order to be taken out. This means they're not covered by other blocks on more than one side, and are not covered by a second layer of block.
This gameplay mechanic has been mirrored in many other online browser games to date.

, While you won't have anyone to tell you whether you have run out of moves in a real-life game, the computer will be able to let you know what moves there are to make with your given set. This is helpful if you're having difficulty identifying blocks apart.

, What's more, if you want to beat a certain puzzle, you can have the game restart to the exact layout it was at the start. This is helpful if you're deadset on triumphing over a particularly challenging round.

, Because it's a fundamentally simple game at heart, developers have created countless different versions with extra features to spice up the core gameplay. Certain versions, like Castle Mahjong, will add elements associated with computer gaming (like castle building) into the game.If you love the puzzle element of Mahjong but want it to resemble more of a game, sites like Mahjong Games will offer many variations all in one place.Although all of these games ill use the same core gameplay elements, you'll have to learn new rules specific to each game. This is perfect if you've overplayed the core game too much and are looking for a way to liven up your experience.

, Mahjong Solitaire is scored based on a combination of how many tiles you removed and how fast you played. A bonus is awarded if you're able to get all of the blocks removed. A benefit of playing Mahjong online is that the computer will score it automatically for you. Many online outlets host high score lists. This will give you a potential long-term goal to strive for.


Many Mahjong sets award different scores to sets of tiles based on their rarity. Taking account of the rarity of certain sets can help you strategize your game further."

Think a step ahead.,
Focus on the top layers first.,
Prioritize high-value blocks.,
Save pairs that don't open anything for you.Ultimately, your goal in removing blocks should be to open up new blocks for future removal.,
Be patient.",How to Play Mahjong Solitaire3," Although Mahjong Solitaire involves careful observation and a trained eye, you will maximize your success by removing your blocks in such a sequence that will open up the most pieces for you in the future. Much like chess, you should make your moves with the next potential moves you'll make taken into consideration.

, All Mahjong Solitaire games involve four layers on top of one another. Early on in the game, these layered blocks should be your priority. If there are multiple potential combinations, you should choose the ones that will remove these layers. This will free up the most blocks for you later on in the game, and possibly avert a failed game towards the end., If you're playing a version of the game that involves blocks of varying scores, it's a good idea to get these high-value blocks as early as possible. If none are currently available, look for the high-value blocks that you can potentially free up with a block or two., If you can potentially remove a pair of blocks that won't open up new pairs, you should save it for a backup. Instead, concentrate on the pairs that will maximize your possibilities in future moves.

, If you're playing the game with physical pieces, there won't be any concrete indication to let you know whether there are any blocks left or not. Rather than shuffle up the pieces as soon as you're not sure, take a patient eye to your pieces and look it over again. Especially if you're a beginner to the game, chances are you'll admit defeat while there are still options available to you.

Choose the right bag.,
Pack a notebook and a pen for recording notes.,
Find a flashlight or penlight for your kit.,
Be sure you pack a roll of duct tape.",How to Make a Spy Kit for Girls1," You'll need a bag that is big enough to hold all your supplies, but not so large that it slows you down or looks suspicious. Consider a backpack or messenger bag with lots of pockets. A dark, solid colored bag won't draw attention.


Pack a smaller purse or bag you can use if you need to ditch your big kit and take only the essentials.
If you're going in disguise, you will want your bag to match your persona. Your messenger bag or backpack will work in most situations, but if you're supposed to be an old lady, try a giant purse instead.;
, You need to write down any observations, codes, or suspicious behavior in your notebook. Try to find a small notepad that won't call attention to the fact that you're taking notes.


Write random notes on the first few pages of the notebook. This way, if someone is peeking at your notebook, they won't realize it's actually full of spy notes.

, Spying involves a lot of snooping and sneaking, and you may have to explore some dark rooms. A flashlight means you don't have to turn on the lights, but you also won't bump into anything in the dark.

, What for? Just about everything! Use it to stick a secret message under a table for your comrades to find. You can twist it to make a rope or use it to repair broken glasses. Duct tape a bad guy by taping his wrists together, or use your duct tape to help create a quick disguise (tape leaves to your hat for some camouflage).


You can use glow in the dark duct tape to mark a path for your fellow spies.

Make invisible ink and pack a small container.,
Bring a walkie-talkie if you have partners with whom you need to communicate.,
Make a cypher wheel to crack secret codes.",How to Make a Spy Kit for Girls2," Squeeze out the juice of half a lemon, then add just a few drops of water. Mix the liquids together and transfer into a small bottle or container to pack in your kit.Pack some cotton swabs so you can write with the ink. You can also use a small paintbrush or a toothpick.
To read your message, hold the paper on which you've written close to a lightbulb. The heat from the bulb will reveal the message.

, The walkie talkie will allow you to call for help or report anything suspicious. You can check in for any updates on your mission and let your partner or home base know where you are.

, You may need to leave a coded message or have to crack someone else's secret code. Cut out two concentric circles (one larger than the other) and place the smaller circle in the center of the larger circle. Use a tack or a brass fastener to hold the small circle in place, but allowing it to turn. If you use a tack, stick a small eraser on the sharp part.Make 26 sections on each circle and write the letters of the alphabet in the sections. Make sure they are written in order.
Match up the letters in the inner and outer circle. To write in code, choose a number (like four), and then turn the inner circle that many spaces (so the ""A"" on the outer circle matches up with the ""E"" on the inner circle"").
Encrypt the text of your message by locating each letter of on the outer circle, but writing down the corresponding letter on the inner circle. So, to encrypt ""HELLO"" with Cipher 4, you write ""LIPPS.""
Make sure you tell the person picking up the code the cipher number!

Bring some basic disguises so you can pursue your target and collect clues.",How to Make a Spy Kit for Girls3," You don't want to get too close to the person you're spying on, so a small pair of binoculars is key to observing them from far away. You don't need a heavy, fancy pair that will weigh down your bag and be super obvious. Find a a small, plastic pair at a dollar store or camping store.


Try to find binoculars in a neutral color, like army green, that won't call attention to what you're doing.

, If you have a camera on your phone, then you're already set. Otherwise, buy a disposable camera so you can catch events as they unfold. You'll have proof of suspicious activities once you get the film developed.

, These glasses have mirrors on the inside of the lenses, so you can see what's going on over your shoulder without anyone knowing. Find a pair of dark sunglasses with large, flat frames and a sheet of plastic mirror paper.Cut out two pieces from the mirror paper and trim them to fit inside your lenses. They should cover about 1/3 of the lens on the side furthest from your nose.Tape the trimmed mirror paper to your frames or have a parent attach them with a hot glue gun., You can use a doctor's stethoscope to listen through walls or closed doors. Or, if you have an mp3 player, you can modify it to actually record conversations with your spy stethoscope.


If you don't have a stethoscope, grab a glass and place the rim against the wall. Don't hold the glass flat--tilt it slightly so the sound will echo out for you to hear.

, There are times when a spy must take on another persona, and having a few disguises as your disposal will help you change your identity quickly. Pack hairbands to pull your hair back, and a beanie or a hat under which you can tuck your ponytail. This can hide your hair color and can also help if you need to go undercover as a boy.


Find a pair of glasses, which may be enough to change your look and throw someone off the trail.
Try some fake, stick-on mustaches when your hair is tucked up to really change your look.

Select a cheap analog watch.,
Remove the back of the watch.,
Remove most the internal mechanisms (optional).,
Glue the watch face and hands in place.,
Reattach the back.",How to Make a Spy Watch1," While you can store very small objects inside a functioning watch, in most cases you'll want to remove the inner mechanism for more room, so start with the cheapest analog watch you can find. Analog watches, with hands and a circular clock face, are recommended since they will still look like a normal watch at a glance. A digital watch will end up with a dark, blank screen, which raises suspicion.


More expensive watches may also require specialized tools to remove the back, and no one wants to go through that kind of trouble to make their watch non-functional.;
, Place a jeweler's screwdriver or eyeglass screwdriver into the lip between the back and side of the watch. Carefully lever the back out, keeping the watch face-down and flat to avoid spilling the pieces inside.If you see any screws around the edge, you will need to unscrew them first, then lever out the back.Set aside the screws in a cup or other container, so you don't lose them.

, You could tape a secret message to the inside of the watch back, but anything more substantial will probably interfere with the watch's mechanism. Gut the watch to turn it into a container instead. For an analog watch, make sure to leave the watch face and watch hands in place., Leave the watch face and watch hands in the watch so it still looks like an ordinary watch at a glance. You may need to glue them in place using a toothpick dabbed in white glue or epoxy glue.


If the watch face is transparent, glue a circle of construction paper behind it. Glue the paper on the back side so the glue is not visible from the front.

, Your watch is now ready to use as a secret container. To make the compartment accessible without a screwdriver, fit a small piece of tape between the back and the edge before fitting the back in place. To open the compartment, pull on the piece of tape.


If the back is screwed on, an easy-access compartment may also require several pieces of tape around the back edge, holding it in place instead of the screws.

Place two to three chairs on one side of your bed, preferably on the opposite side of your bedroom door. Throw blankets or sheets over the chairs and hold the other ends on your bed with heavy books., Find a large box to use as a fort. If you or anyone you know is sent something big, like a T.V. or refrigerator, claim the box it comes in as your own. Find a discreet spot to set up spy camp.

, No matter how secret of a fort you make, you will want to be sure it is secure while you’re away. Use a padlock on the front door of a fort that is in an old shed.

, If you have a tent, it should have a screen. Make a peephole by cutting a hole through cardboard. Ask someone older to help if you want to drill a hole through wood. Cover it with a flap of sturdy fabric, like leather. Lift the flap to spy on possible intruders or let in spy mates., Use a shoe box or an empty milk carton to make a periscope. It will help you secretly peak around corners or over the walls of your fort. This will be especially handy in an underground fort made in a ditch. "

Remove the bands from a cheap wristwatch.,
Tape together two bottle caps.,
Tape the watch over the bottle caps.,
Tape the bands to the bottle caps.,
Disguise the duct tape.",How to Make a Spy Watch2," Grab the band near the watch face with a pair of pliers, and twist until it separates from the watch. Repeat for the other side.


Some watch bands can be removed by pushing down on the attached bar using a spring bar tool, or by removing small pins with a jeweler's screwdriver or tweezers.Cheap watches usually don't have this option.
Choose a watch with a band that has plenty of extra room.

, Find two bottle caps of the same size, roughly as large as your watch face. Tape them together on one side using a single piece of duct tape. This is the container you will hide under your watch.


Shallow bottle caps will be less noticeable, but larger ones allow you to store more objects.
Black duct tape will be less noticeable.

, Use more duct tape to attach the side of the bottle caps underneath the watch face. Make sure not to tape the bottle caps together – you should still be able to open them.

, You may have to use several pieces of duct tape to make sure the bottle cap stays in place.

, Cover the duct tape with ordinary black tape for best results. If you don't have black tape, color the duct tape with black nail polish. Permanent marker might work, but is easily rubbed off.

Recruit members.,
Create a spy club name.,
Train.,
Assign ranks.,
Spy Base: Just like real agencies have a base or building to meet or to finding information.",How to Make a Spy Club (Kids)," To start ,make sure you have soldiers whom you trust; maybe like 8 trusted friends who want to join in. Give them forms to fill in with their trust to be a part of the team. Also test them if they have the power to take part of the group. After the paperwork give them badges or ID-cards to recognize them as team members.;
, Take votes with your team members what they think the spy club name should be. Make the name sound real for example...United Government Intelligence(U.G.I). The most votes wins the title.

, Your team needs fitness and muscles. Teach them the basics first then so on. After their warm up, start to heat the training up. Record their training and test them for ranks.

, After the training look at there record sheets and test sheets.Choose who looks like the winning team member.Here are some ranks for your team or change them if you want to for team.


Head Spy-In charge of the whole organization.
Vice-spy-In charge of the organization if Head spy is sick.
Governors-Situates the buildings roads and tracks for the spy club.
Senators-Goes to other places of spy clubs and talks to the head spy's.
Supreme Judges-Has the power to suspend licenses.
Councilors-In charge of discussing, situating votes and goes to other spy club meetings.
Spy agent-Goes wearing a disguise and getting information from bad gangs.
Employees-Just recruited personals.

, Find a place in your backyard or hiding place to set up your spy base.

Find a container.,
Make sure you can see what you’re doing.,
Be prepared to take notes.,
Stay in touch with your fellow spies.,
Equip yourself to check for prints.",How to Make a Spy Kit1," You need somewhere to store all your cool spy gadgets. Anything that flips open like a briefcase (a lunchbox, a pencil box, an old typewriter case, etc.) will feel extra official and sleuthy.There’s also a lot to be said for a spy kit you can have you on at all times and still be able to use both hands, so backpacks and fanny packs are good options too.
Thrift stores are great places to look for spy bags.;
, A good spy can’t be hampered by bad visibility. You’ll need to bring tools to help make sure you don’t miss any important details.A flashlight for snooping into dark corners
A pair of binoculars for scoping things out at a distance
A magnifying glass for getting a close look at top secret materials

, Spies need to be able to pass secret coded messages and record their discoveries. No spy kit is complete without a good pen and a notebook., You never know when you’ll need to call for backup, or let the spymaster know about some urgent new information. Make sure your spy kit includes at least one communication device.A walkie talkie
An old, unused cell phone
A digital watch with a big timepiece that can be spoken into like a communicator

, You need to find out what the person you’re spying on has been up to, and dusting for fingerprints is a great way to do it. Put together a make-believe fingerprinting kit with a few basic household objects.A small container (a baby food bottle, a small sealable plastic food container, or even a ziplock bag) full of flour
A clean makeup powder brush
A roll of transparent tape (for lifting the prints)

Build a briefcase.,
Staple together a spy notebook.,
Tape together some binoculars.,
Make a cell phone.,
Whip up a batch of invisible ink.,
Be creative.",How to Make a Spy Kit2," A spy needs somewhere to keep his or her gadgets. You can make your own briefcase with a shoebox, some duct tape, some string, and (optionally) some paint or construction paper.


Tape the lid onto the box along one of the long sides, so that it hinges open and shut without detaching.
Make string handles by poking four holes on the other long side (two in the side of the lid, spaced about two or three inches apart, and two in the side of the box itself, spaced identically) and threading a loop of yarn through each.
If you’re in a hurry to get out and play, you can leave it as-is and let your imagination do the decorating. If you’ve got a little time, though, you can make it look more official by painting it black, or gluing on black construction paper.

, Every spy needs somewhere to write down top-secret information. Fold a few pieces of paper in half, staple them together, and write “CLUES” or “TOP-SECRET” on the cover.For a pocket sized notebook, start by cutting a few pieces of paper in half, and fold these into booklets instead.
Don’t forget to pack a pen to write in your notebook with.

, Grab a couple toilet paper rolls and some tape, and whip up a pair of binoculars. You can make these look extra cool by decorating them with crayons or markers, or make them wearable by making a hole in either side and adding a loop of yarn you can hang around your neck.If you’ve got a paper towel roll but no toilet paper rolls, you can cut it in half and do the same thing, or use it as a telescope.

, You’ll need to be able to call for backup, or call HQ to let them know if something goes wrong. Cut out a phone-sized rectangle of cardboard, and draw on a screen and keypad with a marker.

, Squeeze some lemon juice into a baby food jar or other small sealable container, and put it in a small bag with a handful of cotton swabs.When you need to write a secret message, dip one of the cotton swabs into the lemon juice and use it as a pen. It will dry clear, but all the recipient will need to do in order to read it is heat it up by ironing it, holding it over a candle, or putting it in the oven for a short time at a low heat.Heating up one of these messages is, of course, not safe for children to do unsupervised. If you are an adult making invisible ink with a child, be sure to emphasize to them that they need to ask a grownup for help with this part of the process. If you are a child playing with invisible ink on your own, remember never to use irons, stoves, or flames without an adult’s help.

, Just about anything you need for a spy kit can be made with pipe cleaners and some cardboard. Spies are constantly incorporating new gadgets into their spy kits. Don’t be afraid to invent new spying technology, or to upgrade the technology you have."

Conceal your eyes.,
Wear fake facial hair.,
Wear a hat.,
Dress for your mission.,
Wear a communicator.",How to Make a Spy Kit3," Cover your face with a cool pair of sunglasses so the enemy doesn’t uncover your true identity. They can be real, or pretend ones made of pipe cleaners., This is a classic spy move. Throw your enemies off your trail by concealing your face with a fake moustache and/or beard.Buy false moustaches at a dollar store or toy store.
Color onto cotton balls with markers, and attach them to your face with double-sided tape.
Cut a beard and/or moustache out of construction paper and attach it to your face with tape or string.
Draw on facial hair with an eyeliner pencil or makeup kit (with an adult’s permission, of course).
If you have long hair, bring it in front of your face and tie it at your chin, so that it covers your face like a beard.

, Of course the classic spy hat is a trilby, the iconic narrow-brimmed felt hat worn by James Bond, but any hat with a brim will help cover your face. Besides, a trilby isn’t appropriate for every spying situation. Depending on where you’re spying and whom you’re spying on, you might be better off with a baseball cap, a fedora, or even a cowboy hat. It’s all about blending in, and staying hidden., A trench coat is the standard spy uniform. It’s black, which helps you fade into the night, it conceals your entire body from enemy eyes, and it has lots of pockets for your spy gadgets. That said, in some situations a trench coat will make you stick out like a sore thumb, which isn’t ideal for a spy.


If you’re going undercover, dress up as the kind of person you’re going undercover as.
If you’re sneaking into a high-security vault, skin-tight black clothing is a good idea, especially if you’re worried about tripping any laser-activated traps.
If you’re worried about leaving footprints, be sure to bring a pair of gloves., You need to be able to contact HQ at a moment’s notice, and you don’t want to worry about your phone falling out of your pocket while you’re sneaking around. Strap a digital watch (preferably one with a big timepiece) to your wrist, and pretend it’s a communication device.

Obtain a cheap webcam.,
Remove the outer shell of the webcam.,
Pick your hiding spot.,
Mount the camera inside the object.,
Tape or glue fishing weights inside the shell to keep the object from seeming unusually light.,
Thread the USB cord (the cable that connects the webcam to the computer) through the back of the hiding spot.,
If you hide your camera inside an appliance, consider taping up an ""Out of Order"" sign so that no-one tries to use it.,
Point your camera toward the scene of the crime.",How to Make a Hidden Camera1," You should be able to find a suitable model for less than $10. Run a web search for ""cheap webcam"".


Pick a basic, compact webcam. The camera must be small enough to escape detection. You may choose to hide it inside a household object like a pencil sharpener or a tissue box; bear this in mind as you're choosing a camera.
If you want to set up the camera as soon as possible, you should be able to find a webcam at a large electronics store (BestBuy, Circuit City, etc.) Ask for their cheapest, smallest model.
If you're trying to capture a serious crime, consider installing a professional-grade security camera.Homemade hidden cameras are fun, and they will work in a pinch--but the video quality will be much higher on a more expensive setup.;
, You should be able to see the circuit board upon which the lens is mounted. This will make the camera considerably smaller, and thus much easier to hide., Get creative! Your camera will not be so easily spotted if you hide it inside a nondescript household object. Make sure to use something that you would usually keep in your room or office; an out-of-place object may arouse suspicion.For example: Find an old electric pencil sharpener that no-one is using. You can take out the insides and point the camera out of the pencil-sharpening hole. Unscrew the shell and remove the motor, the wires, and the power cord from the inside. Make sure that the sharpener is unplugged!
Try using a cardboard shoe-box or tissue box.Cut a small hole in the side of the box so that the camera can ""see"" out. Make sure that the hole isn't too big: you don't want anyone to get suspicious!
Consider using a shopping bag or gift bag. Again, cut a small hole in the side of the bag. The hole will be harder to spot if the outside of the bag is textured or patterned. A black or dark-colored bag will make the hole even harder to notice.
Consider hiding the camera in the leaves of a potted plant or deep in the recesses of a bookshelf--anywhere that someone will be unlikely to look closely. Make sure that the camera lens is pointing where you need it to point.

, Point the lens facing out of the hole in the object. Make sure that the camera fits, and that it doesn't look obvious.


If you think that the object will be moved around at all, consider using superglue to hold the camera in place. Glue the outer rim of the camera lens such that it's facing out of the hole. Be careful to keep glue away from the lens glass--this will blur the video quality, and it is very difficult to remove.

, This is most important when hiding a camera inside machines--pencil sharpeners, clocks, and the like--that usually feel heavy.


If you don't have fishing weights, any heavy, flat piece of metal should do the trick. Be careful when handling jagged metal.

, You may need to place the hidden camera near your computer if the cable isn't very long.


Cover the USB cord with something. Loose papers or a jacket will do--but make it look natural. If a ""pencil sharpener"" is obviously connected to your computer, the snooper may become suspicious.

, If someone tries to turn it on, they might find your camera.


Keep in mind, however, that an ""Out of Order"" sign may call attention to the object. People may be more likely to ignore the ""appliance"" if you don't label it--especially if you place it out of the way., Think of yourself as a film director setting up a scene: think about what you are trying to prove with the footage, and think about how important it is that you can see the culprit's face.


If you just want someone to stay out of your space--say, a sibling sneaking into your room--point the camera toward the door so that you can catch them coming in.
If you are trying to stop someone from messing with a specific thing--say, you want to keep a sibling from taking your clothes, or a coworker from stealing your stapler--point the camera toward that thing so that you can see what they do.
If you want to capture several different crimes, set the camera back far enough that the lens catches a wide swath of the room. Consider setting up two cameras, though be sure to vary your hiding spots.

"
Acquire a smartphone.,
Install a free webcam app.You should be able to find a suitable program from your phone using the App Store or the Google Play Store.,
Note the URL for your webcam app.,
Connect the phone to your PC.,
Set up the camera.,
Secure your network.,
Watch the stream from your computer.",How to Make a Hidden Camera2," Any old Android, iPhone, or internet-capable iPod should do the trick--anything that can run an app and access the internet.


Bear in mind that the phone itself will be taking the footage. Thus, you won't be able to use the phone for anything else while you're filming. It's best to use a phone that you don't need on a regular basis; you may be able to acquire a used phone from a friend or from a used-phone retailer.
Make sure that you have an AC power charger for the phone. It will be very energy-intensive to record a constant video stream, and you'll need to keep the phone charging.

, Search for ""webcam app"".


Look for apps like IP Webcam, MobileWebCam, DroidCam, or iCam. Read reviews before you download any app, and make sure that you're downloading something safe.
Many of these apps are free, and the developers make their money from ads. Don't worry about paying for a more expensive app; a free program should be sufficient.
You will need to give the webcam app full control of your phone's camera, meaning that no other app can use the camera while the webcam app is running. This will not harm your phone or its camera.

, You will need this to link the phone to your computer.

, Make sure that the two devices are connected to the same wireless network. You will be able to remotely watch and record the feed. Use any video player with stream compatibility, such as VLC or Windows Media Player.


If you are using VLC, click ""Open Network Stream"" on the ""Media"" menu, and enter the URL that shows up on the phone's webcam app. Once you enter this URL, you should be given the option to connect to the phone's camera.
Free programs like VLC and Windows Media Player are great for watching a webcam stream through your computer, but you won't be able to record high-quality footage. If you're really serious about surveillance, consider looking into pricier webcam studio software.

, The phone will need to sit next to a charger, so plan accordingly. Point the phone-camera lens toward the area that you want to film, and place the phone such that it won't fall flat.


Leaning the phone casually against a wall or a stack of books may suffice, especially if the phone is laying on its lengthwise side.
Consider hiding the phone inside of a household object. See the ""Hiding a Webcam Inside a Household Object"" section.
Turn off the sound and the vibrate feature on the phone, especially if the phone is enabled to take calls and texts. A loud ringtone at the wrong moment could ruin your entire plan.

, Consider setting a secure, password-protected wireless network. If you set this up on an unprotected or public network, anyone who can pick up the network will be able to see your footage.


Ask your internet service provider about secure network options. If you are paying for wireless internet, you should be able to set up a password from your router.

, If you need to leave the house, you can connect to a public wifi network at a coffee shop, a restaurant, or a library.

Select a kit bag for containing all the items needed.,
Assemble the kit's likely contents.,
Place your detective or sleuthing items into the detective kit bag chosen.

,Flashlight (for finding clues at night)

,
Start being a detective!

",How to Make a Detective Kit," Select a bag, old makeup case, laundry bag, or any other type bag that you consider will work well. It is helpful if the bag contains extra internal pockets or places inside to hide away an espionage file, notebook, vest, etc. The kit's items are best zipped, Velcro-ed, or even taped safely inside, so that the objects cannot fall out and cause suspicion.


Just in case the detective or sleuthing mission at hand requires a specific type of bag or satchel, then the bag needs to conform to that mission's needs in both size and weight.
Avoid using any type of garbage or plastic shopping bags. These bags will pick up leaves, grime and dirt and ruin the disguise. Also, they make large crunching sounds when they hit objects and plant life.;
, Some of the most useful inclusions for your detective kit are:


A notebook: To record various observations.
Two paperclips: For lock picking. Note: Only do this if it's either a life or death situation or you just lost your key to the house.

Flour and a make-up brush: For revealing fingerprints.
Tape: Once you've revealed the fingerprint get a piece of tape and place it on the fingerprint. The flour will stick to the tape so you can take a closer look at the fingerprint.
Tape measure: To measure hairs and footprints.
Gloves: So you don't get your fingerprints on the evidence.
Tweezers: To pick up the evidence.
Small plastic bags: To store the evidence.
Pencil: To write which need more correction.
Pen: In case the pencil breaks or to highlight.
Magnifying glass: To take a closer look at things.

,,,"
"
Make sure you are not being observed or break line of sight.,
Step behind your cover or into the shadows.,
Keep quiet!,
If it's possible get up high or crouch.,
Try to compress your body as much as possible.,
Stay still (especially at night).,
If possible, cover yourself with your surroundings (leaves in a forest, clothes in a laundry room).

,
When hiding, it's worth noting that people are very quick to detect movement.,
If you aren't hidden by the time they are looking, dart to the nearest place, even if it's obvious.,
If you're small enough go and hide in small places.,
Draw a map of your area the day before you hide and circle some good hiding spots.,
Here are some ideas of hiding places:


You can hide in your closet behind some old bags of clothes, or even in a big box.",How to Hide,";
, (If possible do it silently).

, This is the key.

, The human mind instinctively looks left, right, and back -- but not up or down. Make sure you're not at eye-level.

, This will make whoever sees you less likely to associate a small shape with a human body in their brain.

, The human eye detects motion before anything else, even more so at night.

,, There's a much higher chance of staying hidden if you don't move. Even if they seem to be looking right at you they may not have seen you, so don't even move your eyes if they are looking in your direction.

, (e.g. if you are wearing all black clothes in a bedroom, it may still work to get on a bed with pillows, get behind all the pillows, and then curl up to disguise yourself as a pillow.)

, The person (or people) you're hiding from would not think to look in such a small area.

, Use the steps detailed above.

,
Hide in the basement! Or the garage! You can even hide in the car, but be careful that you don't mess around with the car and accidentally start the engine and make sure you don't lock yourself inside. Open the window just a little bit for air circulation but not enough to be noticable.
Hide behind a sofa. If there are some curtains behind a sofa, hide behind them too, for double protection. If people look behind the sofa all they will see is the curtains (which you are hiding behind.)
Hide under a large pile of pillows!

Be aware of the law.,
Download a webcam recording program.,
Hook the USB cord up to your computer.,
If you already own a webcam, consider simply using your existing camera to take the footage.,
Make sure to turn off or darken your screen.,
Keep recording until you get the footage you need.",How to Make a Hidden Camera3," In the U.S., it is generally legal to use a hidden camera to record footage without a person's consent--provided that you are filming in public or within your own home. Many states have passed laws against filming people in spaces where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as bathrooms or personal bedrooms.It is generally legal to use a hidden camera in the workplace, as long your filming pertains to a business concern. Don't film someone at work without their consent in order to settle a personal dispute--unless you're ready to risk legal consequences.Laws vary between states and countries. Research the laws for your area before you record audio or video of anyone without their express consent.
If you are planning to distribute the footage, sell the footage, or use it in court, then it is extremely important that you follow the law. If you are only planning to use the footage for personal entertainment purposes, you may not need to worry so much.

, Run a web search for ""free webcam recording program"" and install the software onto your computer.


You may be able to use Windows Movie Maker or iVideo, if these are already installed on your computer. Search the Start menu (bottom left-hand corner of the Windows desktop) to figure out whether you have a program installed.

, When you leave the room, or when you are ready to start recording, boot up the recording software and click ""Record"".


Cover up the USB cord with something so that it isn't obviously running to the hidden camera. Books, papers, or a jacket will do--anything that looks natural.

, Be subtle; only do this if you typically keep a webcam next to your computer.


Keep in mind that while this may be a more straightforward approach, the snooper may be more suspicious if they notice a camera point at them--even if they don't think that it's turned on.
Be sure to turn off, cover, or disable the LED light that shows that your webcam is running. The ""recording"" light may tip off a snooper that they are being filmed.

, If the screen is open and the snooper can see the webcam feed, they will know that they are being recorded. You have to be sneaky to catch a sneak.


If you own a desktop computer, you should be able to turn off the monitor and leave the computer tower running.
If you own a laptop, you may be able to put the screen to sleep while the recording program runs. You may also consider folding the screen down until the laptop is almost--but not quite--closed. The computer will look like it's off, but it will still be running.

, Leave the camera running when you think that it will capture what it needs to capture. If you're not sure, leave it on as often as possible.


If time goes on and you don't capture anything incriminating, reconsider the situation. Was the snooping a one-time thing? Has the snooper found a way to sneak around your camera?

Craft a makeshift grappling hook from wrenches and twine.,
Get two wrenches and twine.,
Form a cross with the wrenches.,
Tie a long piece of twine to the cross you have made with the wrenches.

,
Make sure everything is tight, and then you have a grappling hook!

",How to Make a Grappling Hook1," This is a quick design that you can complete using materials from your garage or with a quick trip to a hardware store. Be aware that the twine will likely not hold any serious weight, so avoid using this hook to climb. It may be best suited for snagging objects. You could use this to pull a bicycle from a river or dislodge a frisbee from a tree. You will need:


A length of thick twine
2 wrenches of roughly the same size
5-7 minutes;
, If you use rope, your grappling hook will hold more weight, but you may have trouble tying the rope around the wrenches.

, Make sure that it looks like an ""X"" to ensure that it will hook when you throw it.

Number the four corners of the room.,
Make space at the sides of the room.,
Ask for a volunteer to be ""It"".,
Explain the rules.,
Keep playing with the remaining students.,
Adjust the rules once most people are out.,
Play until there's one winner.,
Point to the loudest corner.,
Point instead of naming numbers.,
Switch the person in the middle every few rounds.",How to Play Four Corners," Put up a sign at each corner, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.


You can label the corners with colors or words instead. If you're a teacher, try using something related to today's lesson.;
, Clear the area near all four walls, so children can easily move between corners.

, The volunteer gets to stand in the middle and count down.

, Tell the players the rules of the game:


The person in the middle will cover her eyes and count down from 10 to 0, loudly and slowly.
Everyone else moves to one of the four corners, very quietly.
When the person in the middle finishes counting, she chooses a number from 1 to 4 (with her eyes still closed). Anyone standing in the corner she chose has to sit down.
Anyone who isn't in a corner when the counting is done has to sit down.

, After each round, the person in the middle can open her eyes and see who she knocked out. Then she closes her eyes again and counts from 10 to 0. Each round works the same way. Whoever is in the corner she chooses each round has to sit out for the rest of the game.

, Once there are only a few people left, the game can take a long time to finish. Add extra rules to speed it up:Once there are eight people or fewer, each corner can only hold 2 people maximum.
Once there are four people or fewer, each corner can only hold 1 person maximum.

, Once one person is left, that person gets to move to the center and count. Everyone else can stand up again and play for another round.

, Instead of choosing any number, the person in the middle can try to name the loudest corner. This makes sneaking around extra important, and might be a good way to prevent roughhousing., If the person in the middle has trouble remembering which corner is which, he can point instead. This variation is good for young children.

, If no one want to be in the middle, have each person take a turn counting for five rounds each. After the first round, you can ask someone who's out of the game to count instead.

Use a video editing program to isolate the clip of the crime.,
Save an extra copy of the footage in a separate folder.,
Confront the snooper.,
Forgive, but don't forget.",How to Make a Hidden Camera4," Your computer may be pre-installed with a default program (Windows Movie Maker or iVideo); if not, you should be able to download free video editing software from the Internet.


Make sure that the clip shows exactly what you need to prove your point. Whether you caught a sibling stealing from your room or a coworker stealing from your cubicle: the clip should start a few seconds before the crime and end a few seconds afterward.
Save the relevant footage in a new video file, but do not delete the extra footage just yet. Sometimes evidence appears where we least expect it. You may find something interesting when you review the extra footage.

, If you plan to use this video to make any sort of legal or professional case, it is important to protect your evidence.


Consider emailing yourself a copy of the file. Even if someone goes to drastic measures to find and delete the footage from your computer, you will have a remote copy that you can download onto any computer with an internet connection.
For the same reason: consider saving the footage onto a USB flash drive. Keep the drive in a safe place.

, Be tactful. Tell them that you know that they were sneaking around in your things, and ask them them not to do so again.


You do not need to bring up the hidden camera immediately. It may come in handy later on, if they continue to sneak around after you've asked them to stop. If they own up to their snooping ways when you confront them, then you don't need to show them the evidence.
If the snooper knows that you've hidden a camera somewhere, and knows where you've hidden it, they may find a way to sneak around it. Don't reveal your trump card right away.

, Some people don't learn the first time they're caught. Be aware that depending on who you're dealing with, merely catching the snooper in the act once may not stop them from snooping in the future.


Consider leaving the camera running when you suspect that the snooper might strike again. It never hurts to be sure.
If the problem continues, tell an authority figure. If you're dealing with a sneaky sibling, tell your parents. If you're dealing with a sneaky coworker, consider notifying your supervisor. If the snooping is of a criminal nature, consider contacting the police.

When planning an infiltration, it is important to know the area you will be ""working"" in.,
Don't be ridiculous and infiltrate an area that is either against the law to infiltrate or will get you into serious trouble if you are caught.,
Know the likelihood of being caught in your area.,
Always wear clothing that is suitable to your particular environment.,
If there are people in the target area, know their whereabouts at all times!,
Have some good footwear.,
If you want, bring a friend.,
If you are spotted, don't panic, this will only inhibit your thought process and you could make some bad choices.,
If you are caught, just accept the fact and turn in.,
Find some good Hiding spots: Roofs are very valuable, as no one will think to look up.,
Learn how to move fluidly.,
Don't ever bring a weapon unless it's necessary and is just an airsoft gun or small knife.,
If climbing is necessary in order to reach your objective, wear weight-lifter's gloves.,
If infiltrating during the day, use proper camouflage.,
When inside of a building, constantly be alert.,
Follow the law.",How to Infiltrate an Area," If you are planning a nighttime excursion, try scoping the area out during the day. This will provide valuable information on escape routes and access points.;
, Know how dangerous it is. It would be stupid to sneak into a bank or someone else's home.

, You're more likely to get caught inside someone's home than inside a construction zone or something of the sort. Make smart choices.

, If at night, black is not best as it can define your human shape more clearly. Try dark navy blue or dark green. Also, an army beanie hat can break up the outline of your head.

, While moving around, wait for the person to turn their back, or throw something to make a sound which will draw they're attention away from your vicinity.

, Footwear is also key. Soft rubber soles are best for grass, dirt and concrete. If you happen upon some gravel, don't be afraid to take your shoes off, as this will better cushion your footfalls.

, In the military this is known as a battle buddy and they can provide support if needed. Be careful of who you choose though. Pick someone trustworthy and stealthy.

, Forget all aspects of being stealthy, just flat out haul ass. Find a safe hiding spot and be completely still. But be aware running is not always the right choice, like if it's from a security guard or police officer.

, Like if you're caught inside a building: It would be relatively stupid to run as it is easy to be spotted and heard. You'll get into even more trouble if you run, so it's not always the best or only choice. Lying isn't the best way to go either, so don't make a hasty excuse.

, Tall grass or foliage, most of the time, people won't bother tramping through waist high grass. Trees, for obvious reasons. Never hide in someone's yard unless it's an absolute necessity.

, Basic parkour and free running skills are essential. I would suggest learning all the vaults, wall kicks, muscle ups and hangs.

, Concealed weapons will get you in even worse trouble if you're caught. And never use the weapon on a human being: This is a crime and will get you arrested.

, They have padding on the palms which will protect your hands. Wear shoes with just one piece of rubber on the bottoms. Try to avoid shoes with designs cut into the rubber on the bottom.

, If in a forest setting, wear greens and browns. If in an urban setting, wear clothes that don't stand out.

, Know when to move and when not to. If you've played ""Call of Duty 4"" think of the Chernobyl level, all hilled up.

, Don't hurt someone, rob someplace or trespass on the property of others. Of course sneaking around isn't exactly pro-law, but be sane and use common sense.

Consider making a grappling hook by tying together metal hooks.,
Point the hooks in different directions with equal space between them.

,
Bind the hooks together.,
Pass the rope through the holes in the hooks.,
Pull the rope tight.",How to Make a Grappling Hook2," This method is cheap, simple, and sturdy. Make sure to test the grappling hook before you try to climb anything high. You will need:


Three metal hooks with a hole at the bottom (which you can find in most building supply shops)
1-2 feet of thin but strong flexi-wire
A long stretch of rope (climbing rope will be the most sturdy)
500ml of no-nail super tack (also found in building supply shops).

,, Squirt the no-nail tack from the top of the three hooks between the hooks, and tie all three hooks tightly together with the strong flexi-wire. The strength of the grappling hook depends on the hooks being held together very well.

, Make sure that the hooks all face the same direction. Tie a figure-eight knot and a stop knot at the end of the rope to keep the rope from slipping back through the holes.

, You should have the three hooks tied together with the wire and the rope coming down in a single line. Test the rope out, attach it to your belt or relay, and climb!

Consider making a grappling hook from steel rods.,
Cut a 9"" length of 5/16"" round steel rod.

,
Bend the bottom 4"" of the shaft into a loop.,
Weld the end of the loop to the shaft.

,
Make the hooks.,
Bend the piece at a 50 degree angle 1.5"" away from the non-sharpened end.,
Weld the hooks.,
Use a magnet or clamp the secure the 3rd hook to the shaft perpendicular to the 2 hooks you welded previously.,
Flip the grappling hook over.,
Clean up the grappling hook.",How to Make a Grappling Hook3," This can cost you as little as $5. While the idea of a grapple is simple, the construction requires knowledge of metal working, forging and welding. The hooks must be capable of bearing at least your weight. You need to attach the hooks together such that whichever hook bites, it as strong as any other. You need to create a loop or ring to attach a rope that is also strong enough to bear your weight. You will need the following:


3 feet of 5/16"" round steel rod ($5.00 Canadian at Home Depot)
Hacksaw
Clamps or magnets (to secure the pieces while welding)
A welding mask, gloves and appropriate clothing
Welder
A grinder of some sort
A length of sturdy rope
Eye protection

,, Make two 90° bends about 1.5"" apart, forming a ""U"" shape on one end of the shaft. Use a vice to ""pinch"" the two straight legs of the ""U"" together, forming a loop. Finally, bend the shaft at about a 45° angle so that it is centered over the loop.

,, Cut a 5"" piece of 5/16"" round steel rod, and use the grinder to sharpen one end of the 5"" piece into a dull point.

, Repeat this step until you have 4 hooks.

, Place the first 2 hooks on either side of the shaft, near the top. Weld them in place. Then flip the grappling hook over and make matching welds on the other side.

, Weld it in place on both the left and right sides of the hook.

, Use the magnet to secure the 4th and final hook to the shaft perpendicular to the first 2 hooks you welded. The hook should also be in line with the hook you welded just before this one (the 3rd hook). Weld it in place on both the left and right sides of the hook.

, If you want, you can spray paint it.

"
"
Hold the rope about a foot up from the hook.,
Consider knotting the rope.",How to Make a Grappling Hook4," Swing it in a large circle around your body and release it at the appropriate angle to reach your desired grapple point.


There are other potential launching methods, such as a harpoon gun and a bow, but then you have to compete with the inertia of the rope throwing off the trajectory.

, It takes tremendous strength to haul your body weight, kit and equipment up a rope. One possible solution is to tie knots at various intervals in the rope for grip. Keep in mind that the thicker the rope, the easier it will be to climb, but the harder to throw. Another solution would be sliding handles that use a friction device that slides up the rope and grips once weight is applied through a stirrup (foot hold) on a length of rope.

Start again when someone is out.",How to Play Buzz," For example:


supposing the players have counted up to 12, the next player will say ""13,"" the next ""Buzz"" because 14 is a multiple of 7 (twice 7) and the next player would then say ""15"" the next ""16,"" and the next would, of course, say ""Buzz"" because the figure 7 occurs in the number 17.;
,, The game then starts over again with the remaining players, and so it continues until there is but one person remaining. If great care is taken, the numbers can be counted up to 70, which, according to the rules, would, of course, be called Buzz.

Determine the width of the track.,
Mark your track.,
Dig a trench.,
Line the trench with Bricktor.,
Mix your cement.,
Lay the cement.,
Draw lines.",How to Make a Backyard Race Track for Kids1," Before you map anything, determine how many lanes your track will have. Will it have two like an ordinary street or will it have four lanes like some toy racing sets? To get the right dimensions, measure the width of one of your child’s toy cars. Each lane on the track should be wide enough to accommodate one car. Then multiply the width of the car by the number of tracks you want. This should give you a rough estimate of how wide the track should be.


For example, if your child’s toy cars are one inch (2.54 cm) wide, your track will need to be more than four inches (10.16 cm) wide. This will ensure a little space between each car so that they are not packed tightly together.;
, With some string or rope, map out the path of the track. Lay out the string, looking to create good bends and curves for your child’s toy cars. If you want to lay out the track in detail, consider planting two rows of stakes and tying the rope around them to create the outline of the track.You should also use the string to measure the length of your track. This will help you determine how much Bricktor you need.

, Once you have your track mapped out, you will want to excavate it. With a shovel, dig a trench that is the desired width and about four inches (100 mm) deep. If you are digging in an area of your backyard where there is sod, you might consider chopping out the grass and replanting it elsewhere.Avoid digging into the roots of any nearby trees or bushes. Exposing their roots may kill the plant. In addition, the roots may eventually warp your track.

, Unspool the Bricktor and line the bottom of the trench. The Bricktor provides additional support and prevents the concrete from cracking. This will be particularly important if you live in a place that experiences significant seasonal temperature swings.Be sure to use your measurements of the track to purchase enough Bricktor to cover the length of your track. Most rolls of Bricktor have measurements that will help your know how much area they cover.

, In a large wheelbarrow, combine ¾ of the concrete and ¾ of the sand. Then add a small amount of water and mix with your shovel. This mixture should be soupy. Then add the remaining ¼ of the sand and concrete and continue to mix. Stir until the mixture is wet and thick but not soupy.You can also add black oxide powder to the mix to give it a black color.
For the best results, follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the cement mix.

, Once the cement is thick, you should use the shovel to pour it into the trench. Fill the entire trench and then use a wooden float and a trowel to level it off and create a flat surface for the track. Once level, let the cement dry for at least 24 hours.Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the cement’s drying time.

, Take a piece of yellow chalk and draw lines on the track to create the lanes. In addition, you can also paint on lines or create stencils and spray paint lines and traffic signals. Be as creative as you would like decorating the track."
"
Map out the track.,
Lay out the blocks.,
Add lanes.",How to Make a Backyard Race Track for Kids2," Find a place in your backyard where you would like to build the track. Pick a relatively flat place where you will not kill any grass. It should also be big enough to accommodate the track. However, because you are using bricks, you can also adjust the track as needed.Have your kids come help you lay out the track so that they get a fun route that they helped design.

, Lay out the blocks end to end to create the track. Experiment with different routes and designs. Ultimately, you will want a track that loops back on itself. However, you can go with whatever design suits you and your child.If you want to connect the blocks permanently, consider connecting the bricks with landscaping adhesive once you have your track laid out.
If you want to create bends in your track, consider using chalk to draw rounded lines at the corners.

, Take a piece of yellow chalk and mark a line down the center of each block. This can be a straight line or a series of dashes like on a highway. You can also place a large patio stone near the track and draw parking lines on it to create a parking lot for your track."
"
Cut the noodle in half.,
Glue the sides together.,
Add some flags and a finish line.,
Prop up the track.",How to Make a Backyard Race Track for Kids3," With a serrated knife, cut the noodle in half lengthwise. To get a straight cut, consider cutting along one side of the noodle. Then use the first cut to guide the knife as you cut the other side. This should give you two even halves with grooves down the middle.If you want to do four lanes, you can cut another noodle in the same way. You can repeat this step to create as many tracks as you want.

, Lay the noodles side by side on a flat surface. Take a hot glue gun and run a bead of glue just below the cut on one of the noodle halves. With the groove facing up, press the sides of the noodle halves together, squishing the glue between them. Hold for a few seconds.


Repeat this step to attach any additional tracks.

, Take your construction paper and cut out some small triangles with a pair of scissors. Tape or glue the triangles to toothpicks and then stick them along the side of the track. Finally, cut out a rectangular piece that is about the width of the two tracks and attach a toothpick to each end. Write “Finish” on one side of the paper and stick it at the bottom end of the track., Place the track on a chair, table, bench, or anything that gives it some downward slope. The higher the angle, the faster the cars will go. Have your kids place their cars at the top of the track and then let go of them to race."
"
Mow a track in the grass.,
Draw a track with chalk.,
Spray paint a track.",How to Make a Backyard Race Track for Kids4," If you want to create a track that will not last very long, you might consider mowing lanes into the grass in your backyard. You can mow a track in tall grass or adjust your mower's deck and mow a path that is slightly lower than the other grass you mowed. Simply weave a path as you mow and you have created a temporary track.If you want to give the track lanes, consider using spray paint to map them out.
The width of your mower deck will determine the width of your track. The wider the mower deck, the wider the track.

, If you have a large slab of cement or concrete in your backyard, like a patio or a basketball court, you can create a track using chalk. All you need to do is clear off the area and draw a track. Add as many lanes as you need and any sketch out any traffic signals.Depending on the space available, you can make a track that is as wide as you want.

, Take some yellow or white spray paint and mark a track. You can make the track small enough for your children’s toys or large enough for them to race on themselves. Once the paint has dried, your kids can start racing.For grass, you can use normal spray paint. However, the outline of your track may be visible for a few weeks. Avoid spray painting on any concrete because the track will be visible for months.
Depending on the size of the cars, you can make the track as wide as you want.

Purchase or use an old bandana.,
Make a square with the bandana.,
Fold the bandana in half to make a triangle.,
Fold the corner facing you.,
Continue to fold the bandana.,
Tie the bandana on your head.",How to Make a Blindfold1," It's very possible that you have an old bandana lying around the house, but if not, visit your local craft or fabric store and purchase a bandana. You can get them in almost every color, and they should be all the same size.;
, Lay out the material on a table or on the floor and make a square with the material that is 22 inches by 22 inches.Most bandanas come shaped as a square and usually have measurements close to 22 inches by 22 inches. However, if your bandana is larger than this, simply fold down each side until it measures 22 inches.
You can use a sewing machine or needle and thread to sew each side of the bandana if it is too large. This will keep the sides in place and make it easier to construct a blindfold. You can also glue down the sides with tacky glue, hot glue, or simply fold them over and readjust them anytime they start to become unfolded.

, After you have achieved your right size square, fold the bandana over so the corner of one side reaches the corner of the other side. This should make a triangle shape.









If you have folded your bandana and it resembles a rectangle unfold it and refold it to look like a triangle. You are basically taking the 90 degree angle, or tip, of one side and folding it directly over so it meets the 90 degree angle, or tip, of the other side.

, With the tip of the triangle pointed down, fold the corner two to three inches up, so that the tip now points towards the top of the triangle.








, Just like the previous step, you will fold the bandana again two to three inches towards the top of the triangle. When you have done this action, it will now look somewhat like a long, narrow rectangle. Continue to fold the bandana like this, making folds that are about two to three inches, until you have reached the top of the bandana. The bandana should then look a very long, flat, upside down trapezoid.








, Once you have folded the bandana, pick it up by both ends, wrap it around your head over your eyes, and tie it in the back with a double knot. Then, check to make sure you can't see anything through the bandana, below it, or above it.









If you find that you are able to see through the bandana, you might need a darker bandana or one that is thicker so it won't be so transparent.
If the bandana is covering your eyes but you are able to see the ground, then you might have made the bandana too narrow. Unfold it back to the triangle and begin folding it again up towards the top of the triangle, but make bigger folds -- closer to three inches.

Know your audience.,
Choose a large, age-appropriate location.,
Decide on a format or theme for your treasure hunt.,
Figure out how long you want the hunt to take.,
Make a great treasure.,
When writing clues, work backwards from your final treasure.,
Create a simple rule sheet.",How to Make an Amazing Treasure Hunt for Kids1," Different kids will enjoy different types of clues. Usually, the biggest thing to think about is the difficulty of the hunt and tailor it to the right age. Some other considerations include:


The age and gender of the children; you have to ensure that the intellectual level is directly suited to the children participating.
The amount of time the treasure hunt should take; younger children will become bored and irritated easily once they become bored.
Whether or not any of the kids have food allergies, or want special treats.;
, You want enough room to let the kids roam, but not enough to let them get lost. For younger kids, it may help to do the hunt as a group, or with adult ""buddies,"" if you want to move around a wider area without getting confused or lost.


For kids aged 2-4, have the treasure hunt inside a home familiar to them. This should be a small and supervised area.
For kids aged 5-8, have it inside and outside of a home. Again, this needs to be supervised and if outside; separate from the public.
For kids aged 9-12, have it at a location such as a school or park. This allows children to be more independent.
For teens, have the hunt go all around a small town or farmer's market, or a big, wide-open field.

, There’s a lot more to a treasure hunt than sending a bunch of kids off willy-nilly. The most amazing hunts usually have some common thread throughout them -- whether it is a theme, like The Hobbit, or a format, like a cooking hunt where each clue leads to an ingredient or recipe. Of course, there is also nothing wrong with a classic treasure hunt with clues and maps, either!


Themes are good excuses to get everyone in costume, which can make it much more ""realistic"" for many children. For example, you could buy a pack of cheap eye patches and plastic swords and call it a hunt for pirate's booty.
Do you want additional competition? Split the kids into two teams and have them race to the treasure. This will allow the children to improve their teamwork and better the communication skills. Make sure the kids are old and mature enough to handle this.
Will they go after individual prizes, finding one at each clue, or do you want one big treasure waiting at the end?, A good rule of thumb is that kids' patience will last through about twice as many clues as they are years old. Of course, even older kids may get a little tired after 26 clues. Anywhere between 5-15 is generally a good length, depending on how far apart the clues are from each other.

, The very last clue should lead to some sort of treasure or fun activity, rewarding everyone for finishing. Consider having a prize for the first person or team to get their as well, which will give some competition and urgency to the hunt..


Decorate a box with pictures or construction paper, then fill it with goodies such as candy, coins, or toys.
The treasure doesn't have to be a thing. You can set up a great meal, party area, or a game so that the kids arrive at a fun ""secret grove.""
If the hunt is for smaller children, make sure there are some consolation prizes -- everyone should find or go home with something., Once you know how it all ends, it's a lot easier to get people there. Each clue needs to lead to the next one, so figure out how to write a clue for your location, then hide it and repeat. Make sure, of course, that the last clue you write (and the first one the kids find) leads back to your starting point!Keep in mind that, though the first clue should be easy, they should increase in difficulty as the hunt goes on.

, Pass out the rules at the beginning, and tell the kids to hold onto them if they are old enough to read and use it. If they are younger, share this with a few parents and chaperones and have them help enforce. This is a good place to put any special considerations too. Some things to consider include:


Any places that are off-limits, or places that definitely have no clues
Where to ""turn in"" clues, or what do to if you get stuck.
Emergency contact numbers if anyone gets lost.
Any time limit, or time to return to the house, even if you haven't ""won"" yet."

Gather your materials.,
Fold your fabric in half.,
Place elastic band inside the fabric.,
Sew a piece of elastic in the middle of the blindfold.,
Sew around the edges.,
Flip it right side out.,
Sew it shut.,
Add any embellishments to your blindfold.",How to Make a Blindfold2," Visit your local fabric store to buy some fabric, or use fabric you have at home. The fabric should be about eight inches by nine inches, or a larger piece of fabric will work. You will also need a piece of elastic that is long enough to wrap around your head with a little extra.If your fabric scraps are smaller than the above dimensions no worries! Just sew them together to make a rectangle about that size. This will create a blindfold with mismatched fabric, but that could be fun!
Depending on what you are using your blindfold for will determine what kind of fabric you use. If this blindfold is for fun and games, any kind of fabric works, but if you are using it to sleep in, a softer fabric like felt or satin might be more comfortable.
The elastic can be a thick piece or a thin piece, but make sure when you wrap it around your head there is no slack. If there is slack, when you sew it into your blindfold the band won't stay around your head and so your blindfold will keep falling down.

, Take the sides of the fabric that are eight inches and fold them in half, creating a rectangle that is four inches by nine inches.








, Open up the fold you created and take the strip of elastic and place it inside the fabric lying in the middle of the side of your bandana that will be in the back. Leave about an extra inch of elastic side on each side of the fabric Fold the fabric back over and you should see one inch of elastic sticking out of each side.









To make sure this correctly fits around your head, flip the fabric over with the elastic on the outside and put it around your head, holding the edges of the elastic to the fabric in the same place you put them earlier. If it seems like there is too much slack in your elastic, you might cut a shorter piece, still leaving an inch or sew sticking out of the sides of the fabric.

, To create a wavy crease in the middle of your blindfold that will rest in between your eyes along your nose, cut a two inch piece of elastic and place it vertically in the middle of your blindfold, gathering your blindfold underneath it so it creates little creases or waves. Sew along the elastic.








This is not a necessary step, but will keep your blindfold from being a flat piece of fabric.

, Using a needle and thread, or a sewing machine, sew a line around the sides of your fabric, sewing over the elastic. However, you need to leave a hole about an inch or two wide on the bottom of your mask so that you can turn it inside out.









Start by sewing at the crease of the fabric, where it is flipped over, and sew along the side of the fabric through the elastic. Turn the corner and sew along the bottom of the blindfold until you are about half an inch to an inch away from the center of the blindfold. Then begin from the opposite side and start by sewing again at the crease until you are once again about half an inch to an inch away from the center of the blindfold.

, Once you have sewn your fabric, leaving a one inch hole at the bottom, you can flip it so the right side is on the outside. Do this by taking the fabric and putting it through the hole.









This may take some maneuvering, but you will eventually get all of the fabric through the hole and then it will be the right side of the blindfold.

, Now that you have turned your blindfold to the right side, it's time to sew it shut. Make sure the fabric is folded under so that the ragged edges don't show, and sew a line of thread along the hole, as close to the edge of the blindfold as possible.








, You may be satisfied with how your blindfold looks, but if you want to fancy it up a bit, add a bow or bedazzle it. This part is totally up to your creativity!


If you want your blindfold to look more like an eye mask, follow the same steps, but cut your fabric in the shape of an eye mask after your first fold. Then, continue the same steps such as sewing around it, leaving a hole, sewing the elastic to it, ect.

Grab a piece of card stock or computer paper and some elastic.,
Lay the paper vertically on a table.,
Attach your elastic.,
Try it on.",How to Make a Blindfold3," This blindfold is going to look more like a face mask rather than just a blindfold, but it fulfills the purpose if it is being used for something like a party game. You won't want to sleep in it though!


Although computer paper is fine, card stock will be better because it's more sturdy and won't fold and wrinkle as easily.
Using a darker colored piece of paper will create a better blindfold, but if you only have white, then double it up by using two pieces and tape, glue, or staple them together.

, Taking a pencil, mark about 2 and a half inches on each side from the top of the paper. This will be where you will attach your elastic.







, Taking your elastic, making sure it fits snuggly around your head with about an inch on each side to spare, attach it to your paper. The best way to do this for the most secure attachment is using a stapler. Attach it to the edge of your paper, where you previously marked the two inches.









Your staples can be any direction, but the best way to staple the elastic is to have the staple set horizontally along the elastic. You can staple it perpendicular to the elastic, but it won't hold the elastic as well and you will risk the elastic slipping out of it.

, After you've finished your blindfold, try it on and see how it fits. If it doesn't fit exactly right, then detach the elastic and staple it again so that the blindfold fits perfectly.


You can decorate this blindfold as well or if you want it be more comfortable, glue a strip of batting to the back of it where your eyes rest.
This blindfold is probably one of the easiest to make, but it may not be the most practical -- you may be able to see the floor with it, but if what you're using it for allows that, then it's okay.

Make rhyming clues and riddles.,
Use pictures as clues.,
Incorporate games into some of the clues.,
Use secret codes or invisible ink to make the clues a little more challenging.,
Hide the clues in something ""gross"" or fun to explore.,
Consider multi-part clues for older treasure hunters.,
Incorporate age-appropriate trivia, including popular characters and songs.,
Use a map instead of classic ""clues.""",How to Make an Amazing Treasure Hunt for Kids2," The classic treasure hunt clue is a simple couplet, or rhyming lines. These can be easy, like ""To find your first clue, look by the glue,"" or more opaque, such as ""We travel together, one black and one white, you only meet us when the food isn't right"" (by the salt and pepper)., Draw or take photos of places they should investigate, figuring out where the actual location is. This is a great clue for younger kids, as it lets them get moving quickly. For the older crowd, you can up the ante by using vintage photos, satellite shots, or extreme close-ups for a more difficult hunt., For example, you could get three identical cups. Show the kids which cup you are hiding the clue under, then rapidly mix around the cups. The kids then have to guess which cup contains the clue. You can run egg races, small obstacle courses, or mini scavenger hunts as well, giving out the clue only once the game is complete.This can be a good way to break up the middle of a hunt. Send them off on the first 4-5 clues, then go set up the game for the middle. After the game is over, they can get some food, water, and sunblock before hitting the next 4-5 clues.

, The simplest way to make invisible ink is to write something in white crayon, then have the kids go over it with highlighter. You can also make invisible ink, letting the kids figure out what to do with the ""blank"" clue on their own.For kids of all ages, you could turn all of the lights off in a room so it is pitch black. Tell the kids to search for the clues with flashlights or by feeling around.

, You might dunk the clues in a bowl of wet spaghetti ""brains,"" forcing kids to go dig through. If you have some waterproof clues, you can put them in the bottom of the pool, giving kids a chance to jump in and swim (as long as they are supervised). Anything that makes them move and try out different things will be a blast., For example, you can get custom-made puzzles cheaply online, which you can print with a clue. Then, at each smaller clue, you give out a puzzle piece, which build up to reveal one last clue or secret. Other ideas include:


Giving out letters at each clue as part of a word scramble. The scrambled word is a password for another clue, or the answer to reveal the final treasure.
Themed questions such as -- ""the final answer is the one thing all the other clues have in common,"" or ""the final clue comes from the first letter of all the other clues.""

, This is especially fun if you have a themed treasure hunt. For example, you can ask ""Where part of the house did Harry Potter have to live in as a kid?"" which would send the children scrambling towards the closet for the next clue.


Be sure to check with some kids beforehand, so that these clues are actually relevant or answerable!, This goes well with puzzles or multi-part clues. Write out a map, complete with illustrations and a few intentionally misleading parts (like an ""accidentally"" erased area). Then, at each location in the map, put a small prize or clue needed to open the final treasure, which prevents kids from racing straight to the end."
"
Let the guests know the appropriate clothing for the hunt in advance.,
Decide on some fun way to present the first clue to the kids.,
Be available for help and guidance if kids get stuck.,
Provide water, snacks, and sunscreen, especially if it's going to be a long hunt.,
Buddy up any kids younger than 10, unless you're in a small enough area.",How to Make an Amazing Treasure Hunt for Kids3," There is a big difference in getting a kid ready for an indoor hunt and an outdoor romp around the woods. Since only you know the clues and destinations on the hunt, be sure to let people know what to wear.


Make sure you account for the weather as well, especially if you're outside. If it rains, can you still hold the hunt?, The general idea is that the first clue leads in some way to another location, which has a clue leading to another location, and so on until they reach the treasure. But the first clue is usually delivered in a dramatic fashion, kicking things off with a bang:


Presenting the clue in a cool box or wrapping, like a ""wax sealed"" envelope, a mini treasure box, rolled up in a bottle, etc.
Presenting the clue to everyone at once, like with a banner, sign, or by announcing it out loud.
Running a game or challenge, such as a pie eating contest, egg race, etc. When they finish the challenge, they get the first clue., While some challenge is good, and you don't have to help every time, kids will get quickly frustrated if they stall out on a clue. Have a couple of ""back-up"" clues in your brain to point kids in the right direction if you see them getting worried.


Let the kids know at the beginning where to find you or other parents. Make sure you tell a few other chaperones where the clues are located so that they can help as well., The last thing the kids will be thinking off as they dig for clues is hydration and sun block. So keep it on hand for them, or leave a few water bottles and block at some of the clues, allowing them to refuel on the go.


A couple boxes of granola bars are a great, on-the-go snack. You can pass them out at the beginning or give them out halfway through.

, Smaller children shouldn't be out on their own unless you can keep eyes on them at all times. The buddy system, where each kid has at least one partner to work with, will help them get through the hunt faster and much safer.

,,, Two children, one from each side, play at a time. Each stands on his side, blows the bubble from the pipe and blows it toward the opposite side, and over the rope if he can. If it goes over the rope without breaking, he has won one point for his side, if not, his side has lost.

, The tally is kept as each set plays, and the side that has the most points, wins, and surely deserves a prize.

Talk to a good chess player.",How to Become a Better Chess Player," You can't get better if you don't know the rules or how to move a piece correctly.

, Be social and free with chess. Don't make yourself feel good by playing people that clearly are worse than you. If you have to make yourself feel better after a loss, a good way is to start planning how to counter your opponent.

, A pawn is worth one point. Knights and Bishops are worth three points each. A Rook is worth five points. A Queen is worth nine points. This is only a guideline, not a winning strategy so if you have a forced win on your turn, you can disregard the piece values.


Do not sacrifice material unless you have a clear win. For example do not sacrifice a knight for a king side attack unless you are sure you can win.
It is not advantageous to trade a Bishop (worth 3) and a Knight (worth 3) for a rook (worth 5) and a pawn (worth 1) because the Knight and Bishop are more powerful than a Rook and the pawn will not come into play until the very end of the game.
These values are relative. In some positions, a bishop or knight is stronger than a rook.
An exchange (a knight or bishop for a rook) is NOT worth 2 points despite its apparent value. It is generally worth 1-1 1/2 points. Therefor 1-2 (sometimes 3) pawns is enough compensation for being down an exchange.

, Pawns are overused and overextended, and often the developing pieces don't get developed. Then, your opponent will usually put a bishop through your pawn structure.


Moving too many pawns weakens the castled king side and opens you up to attack. Moving too many pawns usually will weaken your endgame pawn structure.

, There are two main ways that people play. Some have a strong defense, and aggressive people that use this style can be incredibly deadly. The other type capitalize. They instantly seize hold of any mistake that their opponent makes, developing quickly and leaving with an open position. Neither is the better, although the main population are more sturdy than capitalizing.


It is easier to attack than to defend. Some like to play gambits where they sacrifice a pawn to get an attack because they find that they win a higher percentage of games.

, Go there feeling like you are going to kick butt in this series of games. Forget the rating. Forget the scores. Just get out there and play the best you can, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

, Find someone that is better than you and ""compete"" against them. Play them. Go to the tournaments that they do. Slowly get used to their playing style and use it against them and other people. Don't think of this ""rival"" as someone to do better than. Don't beat yourself up if you lose. Play them again. And again. And again. Do this until you have learned their style and how to counter it.

, Study, play, study, play. Learn how to use their techniques, and how to counter them.

, Here are a few good books:


""The Mammoth book of Chess""
""Logical Chess move by move"" by Irving Chernev. It teaches you how to attack the king in the king pawn openings and how to play positional chess with the queen pawn openings.
""My System"" by Aaron Nimzovitch.
""Think Like a Grandmaster"" By Alexander Kotov. This book explains how to analyze variations so that you can play the middle game at a much higher level.
""Judgement and Planning in Chess"" by Max Euwe. A classic book that explains how to judge a position based on space advantage, combinations, endgame advantages, king attack and pawn structures.
""Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess"" by Bobby Fischer. A classic book that teaches chess tactics for the beginner.

""1001 Checkmates"" by Fred Reinfield. A classic book that will help you to see checkmates and calculate the variations.
""Ideas behind the Chess Openings"" By Reuben Fine. Explains the strategies behind the openings so that you can remember and play them better.
""100 selected games"" by Botvinnik.
""Basic Chess Endings"" by Reuben Fine. A thick book that is a classic and explains all types of endings.
""Point Count Chess"" by I. A. Horowitz. A Classic book that rates 32 positional features and teaches how to convert these 32 advantages into a win.
""How to win in the chess endings"" by I.A. Horowitz. This book explains endgame strategies without complex variations.
""Chess Fundamentals"" by Jose Raul Capablanca. This book teaches the opening, middle and endgame strategies.

, End game Strategy, ""If ahead in material, exchange pieces not pawns. If behind in material, exchange pawns and you can force a draw.”


Without pawns you must be at least a rook up to force mate, the only exception to this is that two knights and a king cannot force mate against a lone king.
The king is a powerful piece, use it to block and attack pawns.
Bishops of opposite colors draw most of the time because neither side can advance pawns without losing them. A rook pawn and bishop only draw against a black king if the bishop is the opposite color as the queening square.
Bishops are worth more than knights in all but locked pawn positions.
Pawns, Rooks, and Bishops become more valuable as the game proceeds so play to keep them.
Many games with all the pawns on one side of the board end in a draw. 90% of master games end in a draw where all the pawns are on one side of the board because the master with the less pawns will exchange pawns and then sacrifice a knight or bishop for the last of the pawns. If you are left with just a Bishop or Knight you cannot force mate.
Rook and Knight or Rook and Bishop many times can only draw against a Rook.
In Queen endings, he who moves the Queen to the center first dominates play.

,
A ""Passed Pawn"" is not obstructed by another pawn and should be pushed. Nimzovitch said, ""Passed Pawns must be pushed"".
A ""Protected Passed Pawn"" is a passed pawn that is protected by another pawn. A Protected Passed Pawn forces the opponent to constantly defend against an advance.

,
Isolated pawns are weak and must be defended by a piece.
Backward pawns on open files are extremely weak and subject to attack by rooks.
A King with the opposition can draw against a King with a Pawn.
A Rook on the seventh rank is worth sacrificing a pawn.
Zugzwang is where if your opponent moves his position becomes weaker (he would rather give up his turn), and is common in Chess.
Rook and Pawn endings are the most complicated so avoid them.

, That will train you not to keep forgetting and relearning which pieces are attacking which squares until you look and see. Since your brain will be forced to memorize so much information about the state of the board anyway, it won't be that much harder for it to learn to organize the information it learns about the board into a different set of pieces of information than ones that describe which piece is on which square, and you will instead get slowly trained to see the whole picture, notice very complex statements about the state of the board, and notice patterns of which complex statements about the state of the board should be figured out to decide which move to make. In fact, you will eventually even become better at blindfold chess than you would have been at non-blindfold chess if you had done the same amount of training using non-blindfold chess, though you won't be better at the current game done blind than you would be if you played that current game non-blindfold and the purpose of continuing to play it blindfold is to train for future chess games.

, Don't follow step 3 all the time with no exceptions, but rather judge the arrangement of pieces and decide whether it's really worth making a trade. It's good to trade pieces more easily if you're ahead as shown in the following sentence. If you would have a forced win if you promoted a pawn to a rook that would require losing the rook later, then you will still have a forced win if you promote it to a queen and don't do what ever you can to stop it from being traded for a rook and bishop because the queen can make any move a rook can make and so could use the winning strategy that the rook would have used. Use your trained ability to notice patterns to try to make a move that you predict will cause your opponent to make a mistake enabling you to win. The strategy can include knowledge of which person you're playing against, noticing which mistakes your opponent was making earlier in the game, or noticing patterns of the general type of mistake people tend to make.

, You can find these games online easily at sites like chessgames.com. You should memorize the first ten moves of black and white to get a sense of how true masters begin their chess games. This will help you get a sense of not just how to succeed, but how to truly excel. Also, memorizing these moves will make you more disciplined because you'll have to train your mind to absorb these moves as well as to understand what makes them so great.

, You can use websites like Chesstempo, Chessity, or Puzzle Books. As Malcom Gladwell once hypothesized, working on anything for 10,000 hours will make you an expert, so imagine what a pro you'll be after solving 10,000 puzzles! Of course, this can take a very long time to achieve, but if you aim to do at least one a day, you will go far. You can also start by setting a more realistic goal for yourself, such as 1,000 puzzles, and see where you go from there.

, You can also use the world champs chess app or other apps that are geared toward chess players. Though practicing to be a chess master takes complete concentration, having an app on your phone that relates to chess can help you train when you find yourself with some unexpected free time.

, Sign up for as many as you can and make sure you play at least once a week, no matter how tired or frustrated you may be. Local tournaments are the way to help you practicing playing against real players and to improve your technique and strategy.

, Having a chess coach may cost a pretty penny, but he can definitely help you improve at the game and to develop the discipline to be able to think outside the box. You can also find a chess engine online that can help you review your moves and have a sense of what you did wrong and what you did right. Recognizing your flaws and your strong suits is the best way to succeed in chess.

, Remember what we said about becoming a true professional after you've done anything for 10,000 hours? Though doing all of the above practice methods will certainly help, in the end, it's all about playing as many games as you can. If you're truly committed to being a better chess player, this is the path you should follow.

, One of the best things you can do to get better at anything is to talk to someone who knows the game and is good at it. It can be a relative, a grandmaster, or even someone who beat you.

Make contestants use their non-dominant hand.,
Form teams and have a relay.",How to Have a Squirt Gun Water Race," You’ll need at least one plastic drinking cup for each player, but for more extensive races, you’ll need more cups. Also, choose a length of sturdy string that is not too thick. Kite string or string of similar thickness works well. You’ll also need duct tape and scissors or a sharp knife.


The amount of string you need depends on how long you want the race to be. Be sure to include a little extra to account for hanging up the string.;
, Use a sharp tool to cut a hole close to the edge of the bottom of the cup. Be sure the hole is large enough for the string you’ll use. A small drill cuts the hole quickly, but scissors or a razor knife work, too., The length of string you use is completely up to you, depending on how long you want the race to be. A good distance for young players is 15-20 feet. If you want the race to have multiple sections, cut enough pieces of string for each one.


Remember that taping or tying the string to endpoints will use up some of the length. When you decide how long you want the race distance to be, add a little extra string to account for this.

, Once the hole is cut in the cup and the string is cut to the desired length, stick the end of the string through the hole. Pull about a foot and a half (.45 m) of string through the hole to give you enough excess to hang the string in the next step.

, With the cup on the string, attach each end of the string to either a tree, a post, a wall, or some other fixed object. Place the string at a height that is easy to reach for the people playing. Use duct tape to attach the string, or tie the string around the object.Work with the surroundings you have available. If you are setting up the game in an open field with nothing to attach the string to, stick two broom handles in the ground for anchor points.
Another option would be to have one person hold each side of the string if you have enough people available to help out and you have no other options.

, Make sure that each participant in the race uses the same squirt gun to ensure a fair competition. If players have brought their own squirt guns to use in the race, you may need to make adjustments as some guns are more powerful than others.

, With their squirt gun filled and ready to go, each player stands at the end of their designated string. Be sure that the inside of the cup is facing toward the player at the start of the race.

, The object of the race is to be the first player to move their cup from one end of the string to the other. Do this by shooting a continuous stream of water into the opening of the cup., To keep the game challenging, players are not allowed to stand too close to the cup. It’s important that players have to aim the water stream from a distance away rather than right up close to the cup.


For older players, stronger guns, or more of a challenge, increase the distance that players must stand from the cups.

, For an added challenge, repeat the race a second time moving the cup back to its starting place. Participants much shoot water at the bottom of the cup to make it move along the string., Using three separate lengths of string and three cups for each participant, set up a multi-part race. Each player races to be the first to move all three cups to the end of their string. Each section could be a little bit harder by being longer or at a different height.If you have a pool, hang a section of string across the length of the pool so that participants must swim while they shoot at their cup.

, Players are most likely to use their writing hand to squeeze the trigger of the squirt gun. Make it more challenging by forcing them to use their weaker hand. They can still use their strong hand to help balance the squirt gun if necessary., If you have lots of people who want to race but limited materials and space, a relay is a great way to get everyone involved. Have players stand at each end of the string. The first player moves the cup to the opposite end and the second player moves the cup back to the starting point.


If you set up two or more sections of string, each player can shoot the cup along one section.
If players run out of water in their guns, this creates an added challenge for the race.

Blocking the check with Nd2.,
Blocking the check with Bd2.",How to Use Lasker's Trap," A common opening move in chess, moving the Queen Pawn two spaces forward forms the Queen's Pawn opening. It opens up the center as well as the file for the Queen and the diagonal for the Queen Bishop.



d5. Moving the Queen Pawn two spaces, for the same reasons above, is a decent reply to d4.;
, Moving the Queen Bishop Pawn two spaces forms the Queen's Gambit Opening, by offering the pawn for Black's Queen Pawn. This is perhaps the most common continuation in the Queen's Pawn opening.



e5. Declining the gambit, and offers the King pawn as a counter-gambit. This move is called the Albin Counter-gambit. It is very risky and not recommended opening for Black.

, Accepting the countergambit is a natural continuation.



d4. Pushing the Queen Pawn forward, preventing Nc3. From here, the Lasker's trap may arise.

, Moving the King pawn one space to attack Black's Queen pawn. This move looks natural, as it aims to eliminate Black's menacing Queen Pawn that is cramping White's game. However, this move is dubious, due to Black's next move. A better move here is Nf3 or e4.



Bb4+. Bishop delivers check. From here, White has two possible moves to block the check, but neither is very good.

, Black answers with 5... dxe3 taking the pawn. Then 6. fxe3 Qh4+.


If White tries to push the King Knight pawn to drive the queen away: 7. g3, Black replies with Qe4, attacking White's King Rook, pawn on e3, and pawn on e5, with a solid advantage. (Note that the Knight is pinned to the King and cannot capture the Queen on e4.)







If White move the King up: 7. Ke2 Bg4+ 8. Ngf3 Nc6 and Black has the upper hand, as White's isolated pawns on e3 and e5 are hard to defend.







, Seemingly natural, this move falls prey to Lasker's Trap. Instead of exchanging bishops, Black plays dxe3! to set Lasker's trap. There are several possible replies here by White, but none is satisfactory.


If White takes the pawn: 6. fxe3 Qh4+ 7. g3 (if 7. Ke2, Bg4+)... Qe4 (attacking King Rook, pawn on e3, and pawn on e5) 8. Qf3 Bxd2+ 9. Nxd2 Qxe5, and Black has the upper hand. White is left with an isolated King pawn.






If White moves Queen to a4 delivering check: 6. Qa4+ Nc6 7. Bxb4 Qh4, threatening Qxf2+.

If 8. g3 exf2+ 9. Kxf2 Qd4+, followed by Qxb2, and White's Queen Rook is lost.






If 8. Ne2 Qxf2+ 9. Kd1 Bg4, followed by O-O-O+, with a winning attack.








If White takes the Bishop: 6. Bxb4 exf2+ 7. Ke2 (for if 7. Kxf2, Qxd1) fxg1=N+! (not Bg4, which allows 8. Nf3, and White is up a piece; and not fxg1=Q, which is not a bad move, but allows White to play 8. Qxd8+, followed by Rxg1) 8. Ke1 (if 8. Rxg1, Bg4 wins the White Queen) Qh4+ 9. Kd2 (if 9. g3 Qe4+ wins the Rook) Nc6 10. Bc3 Bg4 (attacking the Queen) 11. Qe1 O-O-O+ 12. Ke3 Qg5+ 13. Kf2 Rd1 14. Qe4 Rxf1 15. Kxf1 Ne2, and Black has a winning material advantage.

Qe2.",How to Set a Trap in the King's Gambit Declined Opening As Black," Moving the King Pawn two spaces forward is the most common move played in professional and amateur chess. It opens up the center as well as the diagonals for White's Queen and King Bishop.e5. Moving the King's two spaces, for the same reasons above, is a decent choice for black;
, Moving the King Bishop Pawn two spaces forms the King's Gambit Opening, by offering the pawn for Black's King Pawn. It is an aggressive move in an attempt to dominate the center.Bc5. Moving the King Bishop to the center, Black declines the Gambit and sets up a trap. This move also helps to control the center, and is a good spot for the Bishop.

, White falls for the trap by taking Black's King Pawn. The correct move here is 3.Nf3 to develop the King Knight or perhaps 3.Bc4 to control the center.Qh4ch. Queen checks and simultaneously attacks the King Pawn on e4.

, The only other legal move to get out of check is 4.Ke2, but after that 4... Qxe4 is mate.Qxe4. Taking the King Pawn, the Black Queen checks again and simultaneously attacks the King Rook. White must now lose the rook.

, Block the check.Qxh1. Wins the King Rook.

You set up your pieces on the two horizontal rows (""ranks"") closest to you. The major pieces go on the first rank. The pawns go on the second rank.
Unlike in checkers, chess uses every single square on the board.;
, Start with your rooks, which are tall pieces that move in straight lines either horizontally (along ranks) or vertically (along ""files""). Place a rook on each of your two corners.


On a novelty board, such as Civil War sets or movie-themed pieces, it may be impossible to tell what a piece is without knowing the icons (or rule-book symbols) which may be marked on the bottom of the pieces. The symbol for a rook is ♜.

, The knights, which look like horses, go just to the right and left of the rooks. Knights move three squares in an ""L"" shape, first two spaces in one direction, then one space in another, or first one space in one direction, then two in another. They move only along ranks and files, never diagonally. Knights can hop over pieces to make their moves, the only pieces allowed to do so. They are also the only pieces that do not move in straight lines.


The symbol for a knight is♞.

, The tall, round-topped bishops start next to the knights. Bishops move only along diagonal lines.


The symbol for a bishop is♝.
The left bishop will start on a black space (and always remain on black). The right bishop starts on a white space (and always remains on white).

, If you are the white side, your queen goes on the remaining white square in the middle of the first rank. If you are playing black, your queen goes on the remaining black square. The queen is one of the tallest pieces in the game and has a spiked crown. She can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of spaces, making her the most powerful piece on the board.


The symbol for the queen is ♛.

, The king is usually the tallest piece on the board and appears to wear a rounded crown often topped with a cross. The king can move in any direction but only one space at a time. You use the rest of your pieces to protect your king. If you lose your king, you lose the game.


The symbol for the king is ♚.

, After you've put your major pieces on the first rank, line up the lowly pawns like a protective wall on the second rank. Pawns move forward one space at a time, but they can make a variety of special moves, too.


The symbol for pawns is ♟.
Once both players place their pieces as shown above, they're ready to play.

, Your first two rows should look like this (black side):♟♟♟♟♟♟♟♟
♜♞♝♚♛♝♞♜

, This occurs when you can capture the king on your next move no matter what your opponent does. By contrast, your opponent's king is merely ""in check"" if you could capture him on your next move but the opponent has a means of escaping. A player must immediately move his/her king out of check if it's possible to do so. You never actually capture a king. Once it's apparent that a king cannot avoid being captured on the next move, checkmate is immediately declared, and the game is over.
You must say ""check"" when you make a move that puts the opponent's king in immediate danger.
You may not place your own king in check. Such a move must be immediately rescinded. , If one of your pieces makes a move that ends on a square already occupied by an opponent's piece, you ""capture"" that piece and remove it from the game. Your piece then takes the captured piece's place on that square. You cannot capture your own pieces or occupy any square with more than one piece. In other words, you cannot move a piece through or to a square already occupied by one of your pieces -- with the exception of your knights. They may move over any other piece (but may not end a move on a square already occupied by one of your pieces.


With the exception of the pawn, you can capture pieces only with a ""normal"" move. For example, rooks can capture only with vertical or horizontal moves.
You cannot move over a piece to capture another one. If your piece ""hits"" another piece during its movement, it stops, captures the piece, and stays on that square. The knight is the only exception to this, as it takes a piece only when it ends a move by landing on that piece's square.

, White always makes the first move, and the players alternate after that. For players of equal ability, there is a slight advantage to going first. Each turn consists of one player moving one piece. A player must move a piece every turn. They cannot skip a turn simply because they don't know where to move.
The only exception to the ""move one piece"" rule is called ""castling,"" which allows a player to move two pieces at once in a specific pattern to protect the king. See below for more on castling. , A game can end in a tie (a ""draw""). Stalemate occurs when neither king is in check and the next player to move has no legal move available. If you are in an advantageous position, you would want to avoid stalemate. (The opposite is true if you are in a weak position and would love to force a tie.) Stalemate typically may occur when there are only a few pieces left such as pawns blocked by other pawns, and kings that can't move without putting themselves in check.


Remember that you can never put yourself in check. Thus, if it's your turn to move and your only available move would put your king in check, the game is over, and a stalemate is declared. In some tournaments this means you lose, although most players call this a draw.
Stalemate does not occur if either king is currently in check.


, That is usually all they can do, so they're not very useful. However, in certain circumstances they become quite effective:


If your pawn gets all the way to the eighth rank (your opponent's first rank), you can ""promote"" it to any piece you want, typically a queen or knight. That means that a pawn that has advanced very far along its file becomes quite powerful. In its very first move, a pawn may (but does not have to) move two spaces forward instead of one.
A pawn can capture a piece which is diagonally one square in front of it. It cannot capture an otherwise adjacent piece.


En passant or ""capture in passing"" can occur when the opponent moves their pawn two spaces ahead to avoid moving into your pawn's capture position (forward-diagonally adjacent). If this happens, only on your very next turn you can move your pawn diagonally into the space they skipped and take that pawn anyway. , Rooks move in straight lines forward, backward, or sideways. They can cross as many vacant squares as they want but must stop if they come to another piece (or, of course, the edge of the board).


If an enemy piece is in the way, the rook must stop before the piece or capture it. If it's a ""teammate,"" it must stop before it comes to that square. , Knights have the most distinctive movement in the game: they ""hop"" three times, first two spaces in one direction and then one space in a perpendicular direction, or first one space in any direction and then two spaces perpendicularly. Knights move only along ranks and files, never diagonally. Knights are the only pieces allowed to hop over other pieces of either color. They capture a piece only by finishing their move on a square occupied by an enemy piece. (They cannot finish on a square already occupied by a piece of their own color.)

, Bishops can move in four directions: diagonally right or left (either forward or backward). This means a bishop always stays on the same color squares. For example, if it begins on a white square, there is no way for a bishop ever to get onto a black square.


Bishops cannot hop over pieces. If there is a piece in the way, the bishop must stop or (if it's an opponent) capture it. , She can move forward, backward, sideways, and diagonally as many vacant spaces as she wants. This makes her your most powerful piece.


A queen cannot move in the knight's L-shaped pattern.
A queen cannot skip over pieces. She must complete her move either by stopping before coming to another piece or by capturing that piece.

,  Kings can move one space forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. The only exception is called castling, whereby a king and one of the rooks switch positions to help defend the king. In order to castle:


Neither the king nor the rook can have moved at any point in the game thus far.
There can be no pieces in between the rook and the king.
The king cannot be in check at the time of castling, nor can the king in castling move through or to a square in which he would be in check.

In one turn, move the king two spaces towards the rook, then slide the rook into the square the king skipped over. They will now be on opposite sides and right next to each other. "

Set up pawn mower puzzles.",How to Teach Chess2," Start with the pawns, excluding the rules for en passant, then explain each of the pieces on the back row, starting with the king, rooks, bishops, queens, and finally the knights. Ignore explaining castling for the time being. Tell them there are only two pieces that move oddly, the pawns and the knights.;
, The student can do so either verbally or by moving the pieces. If they do so incorrectly, correct them, then start the test over.

, The students will pass the first lesson if they place the queen on the same color square. If they have correctly shown the movement of all pieces move onto lesson two, advanced movement.

, A pawn game is a chess game with the pawns only on the 2nd and 7th ranks. The object of the game is to promote a pawn, i.e. reach the first/last rank. These games are very helpful in learning how pawns move, developing the idea of a pawn structure, and understanding how pawns would interact in a real game.

, The object of a pawn mower is to have a single piece (the easiest is rook, then bishop, queen, and finally knight) capture all the pawns. The number of moves allowed is the number of pawns that are set. This will help the student learn how the pieces move, and learn basic tactics in the process.

,
If the king cannot move out of danger, it is checkmate (usually shortened to mate).
If the king cannot make a legal move due to the threat of capture, it is a draw or stalemate. Or if a player cannot move a piece at all it is a draw or stalemate. For example, even if your king has no legal moves, if you have a passed pawn, the game is not stalemate.

Say something like: ""wouldn't this suck, this is called a fork. I've put two pieces in danger and I can take your rook free of charge."" To accentuate this fact, do the same, replacing your student's rook with their queen.

, Place one of your bishops at the opposite corner. Explain that they have to get their king out of danger but will lose their queen because of it. Explain that this is a pin and because the king has to move, it is also a discovered attack.

, Place your bishop so that it attacks the rook and the king. Tell them that this is a pin, fork, and a discovered attack all in one.

, Many chess tournaments require you to take notation while playing to let you analyze it after playing and improve your game. Many chess boards should have the alphanumeric system already on it.


The length of the board runs from a to h (from white's perspective; if black, it is reversed. The width of the board runs from 1 to 8 (from white's side to black's side; again, reversed if from black's perspective).
If white, the bottom right corner should always be white. This square is called h1.
Rows are called ""ranks""; columns are called ""files."" If there are no pawns in a file, it is said to be ""open."" If only one pawn of one color is on a file, it is ""semi-open."" If pawns of different colors, then it is a closed file.

, If they demonstrate correctly, then play them in a game.


Teach them simple openings. Openings should not be analyzed into much detail unless they are highly advanced players. Basic opening principles should be taught, however, including the three objectives of the opening:

Open up your diagonals to let the pieces develop. Pawn to e4 is the best move for white for beginners because it opens up the bishop and queen diagonals simultaneously. Teach them to develop their knights before their bishops, to castle early, get their rooks on the center (d and e) files, and attack the king using tactics.
Take control of the center, which constitute the middle four squares of the board. In other words, put your pawns on e4 (and d4 if possible) and develop your knights so that they can easily move into the center.
Get your king into safety. This is perhaps the most important goal, for beginner players. Often they will fall into early mating traps, such as the Scholar's Mate. Be sure to help your student avoid falling into them, as the player who tries them will usually fall behind in development.


The openings you should teach are the Ruy Lopez, Italian Game, Four Knights, and other common king-pawn openings. For black, it is best to stick with the response 1...e5 for a while until teaching them other responses, such as the Sicilian Defense, French Defense, etc.

Get a chess set and set it up.,

Learn how to put it all together.",How to Read Algebraic Chess Notation," Although not absolutely necessary, having a chess set in front of you will help you follow along as you read chess notations.;
, There are 64 squares on the chessboard (32 white, 32 dark), and each one has a unique name denoted by the algebraic chess notation:


The vertical files (columns) are labeled a through h, starting from left to right on White's side;
The horizontal ranks (rows) are numbered 1 through 8, starting from bottom to top on White's side.
A given square on the chessboard is denoted by the lowercase file (column) letter, followed by the rank (row) number. For example, g5 is the square corresponding to the file g and rank 5.

, Usually, each chess piece is denoted by the first letter of its name in uppercase, except for the knight (N) and the pawn (nothing). For figurine algebraic notation, a specific symbol is used for each piece.


King = K or ♔ or ♚
Queen = Q or ♕ or ♛
Rook = R or ♖ or ♜
Bishop = B or ♗ or ♝
Knight = N (since K is already taken by a more important piece) or ♘ or ♞
Pawn = (no letter) -- pawns are denoted by the absence of a letter or ♙ or ♟

,


Label the move number first. Each pair of moves is prefaced by a number followed by a period which indicates the ordinal number of the pair of moves - i.e., 1. for the first pair of moves (white, then black0, 2. for the second pair of moves, and so on.
Write white's move after the move number and follow it with black's move, one pair of moves per line according to the following conventions:


Denoting a move to an open square: Write the capital letter which designates the piece, followed by the coordinate of the destination square. For example, a knight going to the square f3 would be denoted as Nf3; a pawn going to the square e4 would be denoted simply as e4. (Remember that pawns do not get a letter).

Denoting a capture:. Each capture move is denoted by the letter of the piece, followed by a lowercase x, then the coordinate of the destination square. For example, a bishop capturing a piece at c4 would be denoted as Bxc4. Sometimes, the x will be omitted.

When a pawn makes a capture, the file (column) from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial. Thus, a pawn on e4 captures a piece on d5 would be denoted as exd5, or simply ed5 as the x is sometimes omitted.
En passant moves are denoted by the file (column) of departure of the capturing pawn, followed by the square to which it moves, followed, optionally, by the abbreviation ""e.p."". Thus, a pawn on e5 capturing en passant a pawn on d5 is denoted as exd6 or exd6 e.p..



,


If two or more identical pieces can move to the same square, the letter for the piece is followed by:
the file (column) of departure if they differ;
the rank (row) of departure if the files are the same but the ranks differ;
both the rank and file if neither alone uniquely defines the piece.
For example, if two knights on d2 and f2 can both reach e4, the move is denoted as Nde4 or Nfd4, as appropriate. If two knights on d2 and d6 can both reach e4, the move would be denoted as N2d4 or N6d4, as appropriate. If three knights on d2, d6, and f2 can all reach e4, with capture, the move would be denoted as Nd2xe4, N6xe4, or Nfxe4, as appropriate.


For pawn promotion, the piece to which it is promoted is written after the destination coordinate. For example, a pawn on e7 moving to e8 and promoting to a knight would be denoted as e8N. Sometimes an equal sign (=) is used, as in e8=N, or parentheses are used, as in e8(N), or a slash (/) is used, as in e8/N. Only the first type is used in FIDEstandard.

For castling, O-O denotes king side castle, while O-O-O denotes queen side castle.

A check is denoted by + after the move notation; double check may be denoted by ++.
Checkmate is denoted by # after the move notation. Some older chess literature may denote ++ as checkmate.
A 1-0 is used at the end of the game to denote a white win, 0-1 to denote a black win, and ½-½ (or 0.5-0.5) to denote a draw. The words ""White Resigns"" or ""Black Resigns"" may be used to denote a resignation.

,


Punctuation is commonly used to comment on the effectiveness of moves, usually relative to the skill of the player. It is placed after the move. For example:

! a good move
!! an excellent move
? a questionable move
?? a blunder
!? an interesting move but unclear
?! a dubious move but worth considering



, List of moves are denoted as numbered pairs by White followed by Black. For example, 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5.


Moves may be interrupted by comments. When the record resumes with a Black move, an ellipsis (…) takes the place of the White move. For example: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Black now defends his pawn. 2...Nc6.

Set out a chessboard.,
Play the following moves, moving for each side.,
Begin the exercise.,
Analyze what has happened first.,

Start to visualize.,
Keep practicing.",How to Calculate Chess Tactics," Be sure to use a set that has algebraic notation on it: Algebraic notation is a way for you to read the moves and then play them on the board for each side so you can follow a game and study what each side has played, and analyze the moves.


Across the bottom will be the letters from ""a"" to ""h."" the letters will not be capitalized. There will be numbers going up the sides from ""1"" to ""8.""
Each square has an address. The first square on the board is ""a1.""
To represent a move, start with the first letter of the piece, capitalized, then write the square you moved it to. If two different pieces that start with the same letter can move to the same square, then include the square the piece originated from.
Each piece starts with the first letter of its name, except for the knight, which starts with a capital ""N."" If it is a pawn, then just write the name of the square it moves to with no capital letter. Castling is written 0-0 for king side castling and 0-0-0 for queen side.
There is more to explain about how to read a chess game, but for now, just follow the directions to get to a certain position where the visual exercise will begin.;
, 1.e4 is a white move. 1.e5 is a black move. In a score sheet it looks like this: 1. e4 e5.


Next play 2.Bc4 Qf6.
Next 3.Nf3 Qg6. 4. Nc3 Qxg2. When there is a small letter x, it means capture. So the Queen has captured the pawn on g2.

, Though you will be calculating white one's move, you will be visualizing for both sides.

, The queen has taken a pawn. It's not good to lose pieces or pawns willy-nilly, but it's also not generally a good idea to move the same piece twice in the opening, nor to move the queen out first, as she is such a powerful piece that she becomes a target and can get trapped. Greed can also get you into trouble, especially if you go attacking before your pieces are developed. Also there is a saying, ""Loose pieces fall off, meaning that pieces that are not protected can become targets of fancy tactics. So knowing these things, let's see if you can find a way to punish black.

, Find five candidate moves. Go down the branch of just one of them. This is what it means to calculate three moves ahead. You don't just pick one move and follow it. You pick as many as you can, and then analyze each one, finding the best possible moves for your opponent as you can, and seeing if you have a good response to it. There is a rule among strong chess players that says ""Look at all checks and captures."" There is a move here that satisfies both. Look for a moment at the board and see if you can figure out what it is, and then go on to the next step. But first look for it.

, Did you you find Bxf7? That's the one. So now comes the visualization part. Don't touch the pieces - do this in your mind.


Visualize what the board is going to look like after you play Bxf7. See the piece there.
While visualizing the piece there, ask ""what are all of black one's options for getting out of check?"". How many are there? That's right, there are three: The king can capture the bishop on f7, or he can move to where the queen used to be, on d8, or he can move forward one square to e7.
Visualize the king capturing the piece on f7. See in your mind the new position after these two moves have been made. Hold the image in your mind as clearly as you can.
Next ask what white can do from here. What moves can white make in this new position where black one's king is on the f7 square? Name several possible moves, and look for one that checks because you always want to look at all checks and captures first. See anything good? You could check by Ng5 but there is a problem with that. The queen is guarding that square and will capture. So how can you move the queen away. How about put the rook on the g-file? Visualize the Rook moving to g1. Now where can the queen go? Only one square. Visualize the queen moving to h3. Now you can check with the knight. Notice anything else about Ng5? That's right, it's a fork. You win the queen. So you sacrificed the bishop to win the queen. Not bad.
Do you see any better moves for the black queen? No. Probably just to take the rook on g1 to get as much as he can out of it. Can you reverse the order of these moves so he can't do that? How about instead of Bxf7 first you do that second, after chasing the queen to h3. Now you can get the queen with a minimum of losses. Of course, you also may have tipped off your opponent to your plans by chasing his queen to the forking square.

, After trying this exercise, you will have visualized three moves ahead for one move. In a real game, aim to analyze more than one move. Go through this process for each of the moves that you are considering. The further you are able to go, and the more vividly and accurately you are able to visualize the positions two or three, or even four moves ahead, the better chess player you will become.

Observe casino game workers if they are the ones spinning the wheel. The worker may have been playing the game for so long that he or she spins the wheel with the same force every time, resulting in a bias.

, This will help you get a feel for the game, increase your confidence, and determine what works and what doesn't. You can also talk to the dealer, think about how much you'd like to wager, and take a moment to study other players' strategies.

, The American Roulette wheel has an extra slot, 00, which slightly decreases the odds of winning. If you are given both options, choose European Roulette to increase your likelihood of winning.


The house edge on a European wheel is on 2.63%.With the American wheel, it's twice that.

, The last thing you want is to give over your money to some scam. Make sure the site is reputable, associated with a reputable casino, and always, always, always, publishes their payout. There are too many untrustworthy sites out there to just take your chances.


Also, make sure they have a random number generator. There are sites that rig the computer system against you. If you can verify this with others, do so.

, When it comes to roulette and any other gambling game, you should only bet an amount that you know you can afford to lose. Things can get out of hand quickly, especially with a game that goes so fast.


Once you have determined how much money you are willing to lose, stick to that amount and don't be tempted to bet any more. While this may be easier said than done, some ways you can help control temptation is to limit the amount of alcohol you consume, write the amount down on a piece of paper to hold yourself more accountable, and ask a friend to keep tabs on you.

, If you start off betting $100 and end up with $150, then you should withdraw your profit ($50) and keep it separate. Continue playing with the same $100, and that way, the maximum loss you can have is $50. The more you win and withdraw your money, the more likely it is that you will at least break even, if not make a profit.

, Sure, the profits are less grand, but if you keep your bets to red/black, high/low, or odd/even, you have a much better chance of not losing your money. The return is only 1:1, but the odds of the wheel being friendly to you are much better.


The house edge remains the same, but your odds of winning are just slightly under 50% (because of the 0 or 00). Obviously, the fewer numbers you bet on, the lower your chances; however, the house edge on 00-0-1-2-3 (first five) is the worst of all possibilities (coming it at 7.89%).So clearly, don't bet 5 numbers.


Two outside bets works as well. For example, red and odd -- that way you have most of your numbers covered and some covered twice.

, If you are betting on black versus red or odd versus even, then try the following strategy: each time you lose, double up the amount that you bet the first time and then bet on the same color until you win. This is called the Martingale Strategy.


For example, let's say you bet $5 on red and it lands on black. On your next turn, bet $10 on red so that you can win your money back and make a profit. If it lands on black again, double your amount again, betting $20 on red. Continue doing this until the wheel lands on red (which it inevitably will), to win your losses back and gain a profit.
Start off by betting the minimum amount that your table allows. Remember that some tables have a maximum amount you can bet, meaning you may reach the maximum before you see a win.
This strategy requires that you have enough money to be able to afford doubling up each time.

, This betting system is the same as the Martingale Strategy, but instead of doubling up, the player doubles up and adds another unit. The ""unit"" is whatever bet you started off with.

, This system involves betting $200 total, distributed as follows: $140 on the high numbers (19-36), $50 on the six numbers (13-18), and $10 on zero. This increases your likelihood of winning by spreading out your bets.


If the number is between 19 and 36, you will have an $80 profit; if the number is between 13 and 18, you will have a $100 profit, and if the number is zero, then you will have a $160 profit.
The only way to lose is if a number between 1 and 12 comes up, which means a loss of $200, in which case you may employ the Martingale Strategy for losses.

, This is generally only applied European wheels -- and even then only sometimes. It's a rule that brings down the house edge to 1.35% on even money bets. Here's how it works:


Let's say you bet on black. If the ball lands on zero (it must land on zero), the house keeps your $10 and the ball spins again. If it lands on black, you get your $10 back. You don't win anything, but you don't lose your $10!

Always prioritize the safest bets on the table.,
Take (relatively safe) pass bets.,
For the absolute lowest house edge, take don't pass bets.,
Maximize your winnings with odds bets.,
Consider also making come and don't come bets.,
Avoid risky bets with major house edges.",How to Win at Craps1," If you have a massive bankroll and can stand to lose lots of money for the thrill of a few big wins, you can probably make high-risk, high-reward bets to your heart's content. Otherwise, it's smart to take only the safest bets - the ones that offer the smallest house edge. By doing so, you minimize your risk - while the house will still have a mathematical advantage, it will be as low as possible.;
, Though there are many, many betting possibilities in the game of craps, the safest bets are, luckily, fairly simple. The simplest, most fundamental bet in the game of craps, the pass bet, is also one of the very safest, with a low house edge of 1.41%. Pass bets pay even money - in other words, if you bet $10, you win $10.With a pass bet, if the come out roll is 7 or 11, you win, while if the come out roll is 2, 3, or 12, you lose. If another number is rolled, this number becomes the ""point"" and the shooter continues rolling. If a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again, you lose, while if the point is rolled again before a 7, you win.
Don't make pass bets after the come out roll - this is allowed, but the value of the bet diminishes.

, The don't pass bet is almost the opposite of the pass bet - 2 or 3 on the come out roll win, 7 or 11 lose (12 pushes). If a point is established, you win if a 7 comes before the point and lose if the point comes first. The don't pass bet can be considered one of the single safest bets on the table as the house edge for this bet is only 1.36%.


However, note that most players generally make pass bets, so if you make don't pass bets, you'll win when they lose and vice versa. This can create the table dynamic of you ""going against"" everyone else, which some people like and some don't.
Like pass bets, don't pass bets pay even money.

, Odds bets are somewhat unique in that they are truly fair - the house has no edge at all on these bets. However, odds bets can only be made on top of other bets, so, if you make an odds bet, the house still has an edge (albeit a diminished one) on your overall wager. Odds bets usually have a maximum bet amount that is some multiple of your pass or don't pass bet - 2X, 3X, 5X, etc. By taking the maximum odds bet every time you make a pass or don't pass bet, you maximize your winning potential and lower the house edge on your overall wager.


Making an odds bet after a pass bet is betting that the point will be thrown before a 7. The odds bet pays 2 to 1 on points of 4 and 10, 3 to 2 on a 5 and 9, and 6 to 5 on a 6 and 8.Making an odds bet after a don't pass bet is called ""laying the odds"" and is the opposite of a normal odds bet - you're betting that a 7 will be rolled before the point. Laying the odds against a 4 or 10 pays 1 to 2, 2 to 3 against a 5 or 9, and 5 to 6 against a 6 or 8., Come and don't come bets are essentially the same as pass and don't pass bets, except they're made at any point other than the come out roll. In other words, the roll after the come bet functions as the come out roll for the come bet. The conditions for winning a come or don't come bet are the same as those for pass or don't pass bets, respectively. The odds on both are mathematically identical.

, Certain bets carry high house edges and are to avoided by serious gamblers at all costs. Only take these bets for their entertainment value - the thrill of risking your money on a long shot. In particular, put bets and proposition (prop) bets offer very unfavorable house edges, so avoid making these bets if you're looking to make money.


Put bets are essentially pass bets that ""skip"" the come out roll. In other words, you won't win on a 7 or 11 on the first roll and so on. Since much of a pass bet's value is in the come out roll, put bets can have house edges of as high as 33.3%. However, one mitigating factor is that odd bets can be made on top of put bets, lowering the house edge on the overall wager.
Proposition (or ""prop"") bets are basically bets made on the next roll of the dice. You bet on a specific number, and if the next roll comes up that number, you win. Prop bets are very risky and thus offer high payouts. However, the house edge is large (from about 5% - 17%, depending on the number you choose), so these bets aren't effective ways to make money.

Realize that, in casinos, the house will always have an edge.,
Look for ""downtown"" tables.,
Look for games with experienced dice setters.,
If legal, look for craps games outside casinos.",How to Win at Craps2," The idea that it's possible to ""win"" at any form of gambling is somewhat of a falsehood. Though it's absolutely possible to leave the craps table with more money than you came to it with, it's crucial to understand that craps, like every game in the casino, has a built-in house edge. This means that the structure of payouts is mathematically designed to make money for the casino in the long term. Basically, if you play for long enough, while you may have ups and downs, you'll always lose money to the casino.


Thus, you'll never, ever want to play craps with money you can't afford to lose. Always consider the absolute worst-case scenario before heading to the craps table.

, In the gambling Mecca of Las Vegas, the casinos on the famous ""Strip"" are renowned for their glitz and glamour, while the casinos in Vegas' lower-rent downtown area, to attract visitors, are known to offer slightly better odds in the form of more-favorable payout systems.Today, when it comes to craps, the terms ""downtown table"" and ""strip table"" don't necessarily refer to the actual location of the table, but, rather, the payout system being used. If you can, opt for a table using the ""downtown"" payout system for a small but not insignificant advantage.


There are many minute differences between ""downtown"" and ""strip"" tables. For instance, on a downtown table, while a $3.00 place bet on a 6 or 8 pays $3.50, while on a strip table, the house rounds this amount down and pays out only $3.00. Additionally, proposition bets of 2,3,11 and 12 have ever-so-slightly higher payouts on downtown tables (30 to 1 for 2 & 12 and 15 to 1 for 3 and 11) than on strip tables (29 to 1 and 14 to 1, respectively)., ""Dice setting"" is a technique for rolling dice that (theoretically) allows the shooter to control the outcome of the roll to a small degree. The actual usefulness of dice setting is a topic of some debate among gambling experts.Generally, it's thought that, if dice setting does give the shooter an advantage, this advantage is very minute and only becomes evident over the course of thousands of rolls. Still, if you can manage to find a table with a dice setter, it certainly won't hurt your chances to follow his or her bets.


If you're trying this method, bet with the dice setter on low-risk bets. That is, if s/he bets pass, you should bet pass, if s/he bets don't pass, you should bet don't pass, and so on for come bets. Generally, you'll want to stick with these low-risk bets. Don't follow the dice setter on high-risk bets - no amount of dice-shooting skill is likely to cancel out the long odds of winning such a bet.

, ""Street craps"", an improvised, informal version of craps, can be played virtually anywhere with just a few dice and willing participants. The primary advantage of street craps over casino craps is that there is no house to take an edge on your bets. Rather, it's up to the players to ""cover"" each others' bets by wagering against each other.


Also, since street craps is usually played without an actual craps table, the betting system is usually simplified and somewhat improvisational. Depending on the game, you may be able to make up your own prop bets and set payouts on the fly. This means that, if you're a shrewd gambler, street craps can conceivably be more lucrative than casino craps.
Note however, that, often, gambling outside of a licensed casino or gambling hall can be considered a crime. Before looking for a street craps game, be sure to check local laws in your area to make sure you're not breaking any.

Budget.,
Set win and loss limits for yourself.,
Quit while you're ahead.,
Don't get too caught up in the thrill of it all.",How to Win at Craps3," Many gamblers end up spending far more money than they originally intended to. Avoid having this happen to you by set a hard, inflexible budget for your gambling session. Set aside a certain amount of money that you can stand to lose as your bankroll for the day. Use your bankroll - and only your bankroll - to finance your craps games. Use your money wisely, making conservative bets, rather than risking it all on one roll of the dice. Doing so helps ensure that you'll have more money throughout the day and won't need to withdraw more to keep playing.


It can be easier to budget smartly if you have a healthy attitude towards gambling in general. Think of your gambling session as a form of entertainment, rather than a way to make money. This way, you'll be satisfied even if you lose money, while any money you win will be a ""pleasant surprise.""

, Knowing when to stop gambling is crucial. No matter how much you may win, if you play forever, you'll eventually lose all of your money to the house. To prevent this sort of over-reach, set hard, inflexible cash limits that, if passed, will end your gambling for the day. For instance, you might decide to stop as soon as you win or lose 50% of your starting bankroll. This way, if you hit your upper limit, you're prevented from losing any payout you receive by gambling for too long. Conversely, if you hit your lower limit, you'll still have money reserved for your next session.

, As mentioned above, if you play for long enough, the casino will take your money. Because of this, it's a smart idea to cash out when you're ahead. Resist the perennial gambler's temptation to boost your winnings further by playing just ""one more roll"", as innumerable payouts have been squandered this way.

, Above all, the best tool a craps player can have is a cool, rational head. It's easy to get swept away by the rush of excitement that comes with a winning roll, but try not to. If you're at a rowdy table, making a few great rolls can make you feel like a celebrity, but your present odds will always be the same regardless of your past luck. Stick to your betting plan and your budget at all times.


Other than this, enjoy yourself. Craps can be one of the funnest, most exciting games in the casino - especially if you win!

Score high Yahtzees in the upper section late in the game.",How to Play Yahtzee," In Yahtzee, scores are kept on a sheet of paper containing a column of 13 boxes. On each turn, you must choose which box to fill in based on your best scoring option. If you are unable to enter a score, or choose not to, you must enter a ""0"" in one of your boxes. Each box can be filled in only once.;
, The upper section boxes are scored differently than the lower section boxes. Your goal, in the upper section, is to score at least a 63. If you have 63 points or more in the upper section, you get a 35 point bonus at the end of the game.


The upper section contains six boxes labeled aces (ones), twos, threes, fours, fives, and sixes. You roll 5 dice in Yahtzee. To fill in the upper box, you combine the values on the dice with the same number. Then, you add the number to the appropriate box. You can only choose one box to fill in with each turn.This can be confusing when discussed in the abstract. Let's look at an example. Say you roll the dice and you score two fives and three twos. As you have two fives, you could enter a score of 10 in the fives box. You have three twos, so you could also enter a total of six in the twos box. You have to choose which number you want to enter.

, You want to get at least a 63 to get the bonus, so choose wisely. In our above example, you might be inclined to score in the fives box, as this is a higher score, but be careful. You can only fill in each box once. If you get four fives on your next roll, you miss out on a much higher score in that box., The lower section scores are more complicated. Instead of simply listing numbers, phrases like ""Three of a Kind"" and ""Full House"" are written in the lower section. These are different combinations of dice that are all scored differently. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the lower section scores before playing Yahtzee.

, One value you can score in the lower section is a three of a kind. To score a three of a kind, you have to roll three of the same dice.


With a three of a kind, you add all the values of your dice together. This gives you your total score for the three of a kind box.
This can be confusing. Let's look at an example to clarify. Say you rolled three fives, a two, and a four. This could be scored as a three of a kind. You would multiply five by three to get the value 15. Then, you would add two and four. This would give you a total score of 21, which you would write in the Three of a Kind Box., A four of a kind is similar to a three of a kind. You can score in this box if you get four of the same dice in one roll. Then, you would score it by combining the values of all the dice. For example, if you roll four twos and a six, you can score a 14 in the Four of a Kind box., A full house is worth 25 points regardless of dice values. A full house is made up of three dice of one number and two dice of another number. For example, say you roll three 6's and two 5's. This could be scored for 25 points as a full house., Small or large straights are scored when you roll dice in numerical order. For example, you roll a one, a two, a three, a four, and a five. A large straight is worth more points than a small straight.


A small straight includes four dice in a numerical sequence. For example, say you score a one, a three, a four, a five, and a six. You could score this as a small straight. A small straight is automatically worth 30 points.A large straight includes five dice that move in a numerical sequence. For example, if you score a two, a three, a four, a five, and a six, this would be a large straight. A large straight is worth 40 points., A Yahtzee is one of the highest rolls you can score. A Yahtzee occurs when all five dice are the same number. A Yahtzee is worth 50 points the first time, regardless of dice value. Additional Yahtzees are worth 100 points.


If you roll a Yahtzee after having already filled in the Yahtzee space, you get a 100 point bonus., In the event you're unable to score in any other box, use the chance box. You can score any combination of dice in the chance box by totaling their numbers.


For example, say you roll two threes and three sixes. Two times three is 6. Three times six is 18. You would add 18 and 6 to get 24. You could then write 24 in the chance box., At the end of the game, you calculate your score. Whoever scores highest wins.


Add the upper section scores together and write the total in the ""total score"" section. If you score 63 or over, add a bonus of 35 points.
Total the scores in the lower section as well, adding 100 points if you scored any additional Yahtzees in the game. Then, add the upper and lower score together to figure out your grand total for the game., You can play Yahtzee in a group of at least 2 players. If you have a big group, you can play in teams. To start the game, you first need to figure out who goes first. To do so, each player or team rolls all 5 dice. You would add all the values of the dice together. The player or team with the highest score goes first., You can roll your dice up to 3 times in a game of Yahtzee. Yahtzee comes with a cup or shaker in which you place the dice, shake, and then spill them on the table. As you roll, you can strategize to try to maximize your score. In any roll, you can choose to keep some dice and re-roll others. To start, roll all five dice.To help understand the process, let's look at an example. Say you roll a one, a three, a four, a five, and a six. You have a small straight with the three, four, five, and six. This would come to 30 points. However, if you re-roll the one and get a two, you would have a large straight. This means 40 points., If you're happy with your initial score, you can add your score to your card and complete your turn. However, you can also try for a higher score. Choose which dice you want to keep and which you want to re-roll.


In our above example, it would make the most sense to re-roll the one. This way, you have a chance at a large straight. Say you roll the one and get a three. You still do not have a large straight. However, you can roll the dice for a third time to try again.

, If you're still unhappy with your score, you can roll the dice one more time. Once again, you can re-roll as many dice as you want.


In our above example, say you re-roll the three you rolled in your second turn. If you get a 2, you can score it as a large straight. However, if you get another number you can still score it as a small straight. You can also fill in one box in the upper level.

, Every player rolls the dice 3 times each for 13 rounds. As you go, you need to try to fill in all your boxes. Each box can only be filled in once, so make wise choices in terms of how you choose to count your scores.

, Yahtzee is a game of both strategy and chance. There are steps you can take to maximize your chance at a Yahtzee each round. Remember, after your first Yahtzee, each additional Yahtzee earns you 100 points.


Early in the game, anytime you have a chance for a Yahtzee, take it over settling for a lower score. The earlier you score a Yahtzee, the better. This maximizes your chance at the 100 point bonus.If you already have a Yahtzee, never settle for lower scores over the chance at getting a second Yahtzee. For example, don't score three 4's and two 2's as a full house. Instead, re-roll the 2's to try for a second Yahtzee., Trying to decide where to score your round can sometimes be confusing. However, keeping the 35 point bonus in mind can help you strategize.


Higher scores with lower numbers, like the one and two boxes, are rare. It's to your advantage to score in the upper section if you roll a high number of twos or ones.
For example, say you roll four twos, a five, and a six. You can score a 6 in either the two or six box. However, you should aim to score in the 2 box. The highest you can score in the two box would be an 8 or 10. The highest you can score in the six box, conversely, is a 30 or a 36. You don't want to fill up the six box with a low score.

, You do not want a ""0"" score in any of the lower boxes. These boxes have the potential for high point values. Therefore, aim to get straights early on so you can then concentrating on going for Yahtzees. Be on the lookout for combinations like ""two, three, four"" or ""four, five, six."" Re-roll the dice as needed to get a straight early in the game., A Yahtzee is fairly rare, even with good strategy. If the score is tight, it's late in the game, and you have not scored a Yahtzee yet, it might be worth it to score high Yahtzees in the upper section. This usually guarantees you'll get the bonus, which may mean a higher score. For example, five sixes plus the 35 point bonus leaves you with 65 points. A Yahtzee is only worth 50.However, keep in mind if you score another Yahtzee you risk getting 50 points as opposed to the 100 point bonus.

, You don't want to waste money, so it's recommended to start out with a $100 budget. Then $500, $1000.

, They have to be able to count cards under pressure, make good decisions and so forth.

, There are 3 levels of card counters in team play:


Spotter: All they have to do is wait until a shoe starts over, get to that table, count until the table's hot and signal a gorilla or big player. If you're a spotter, you should look like a tourist.
Gorilla: A gorilla's job is to wait until the spotter signals them and bet big until the spotter signals them to leave. That's the easiest of all the jobs. A gorilla should act drunk and dress messy with stains.
Big Player: A big player. They get signaled just like a gorilla, except the spotter uses a word signal to secretly tell them what the count is, and the big player keeps counting and bets accordingly. A big player should dress cleanly in a suit and tie.

, There are hundreds of casinos just in America. You'll need a plan on what to do if you're asked to leave.

, If you get busted (get caught counting, not going over 21) you'll need to go to the meeting spot and call the other team members. The meeting spot could be a hotel lobby, or a restaurant or even another casino.

, If where you're going is far away it's recommended to use a plane.

, The biggest mistake a card counter could make is letting the airline know you're carrying thousands of dollars across a state border. They might think you're up to something. Stuff it in your underwear, tape it to your back, whatever. Just avoid putting it in your luggage, shoes, or pockets.

, The most important step. Remember to count and bet right.

, If you're worried about the casino thinking your large amount of chips is suspicious, you can divide it up, or ask random people to cash it in for you.

, If you had any investors, take their cut out, then divide equally among the team.

Know a bit about the martingale strategy.,
Find a roulette table with a small minimum bet and a high maximum bet.,
Bet a small amount on black or red, even or odd, 1-18 or 19-36.,
If you win, pocket your winnings and bet the same small amount.,
If you lose, double the amount you last wagered and place the bet on the same color again.,
If you win on the second bet, collect your winnings and place the original small bet or leave the casino.,
If you lose again, double your bet and try again.








,
Repeat these steps until you either lose all of your money or you hit the table maximum.",How to Practice Roulette Strategy1," Probably the most common roulette strategy out there, the martingale relies on doubling bets after a loss in a ~50/~50 chance game. This way, the first win recoups all the previous losses, along with a small profit for the gambler.









The advantage of this strategy is intuitive. In basic roulette, you're playing a coin-flip game. You bet on a color, and your color either wins out or it doesn't. If you only bet on a single color, and you keep doubling your bet until you win. Provided you keep doubling losing bets, as soon as you win, you've recovered all your losses.
The are a couple disadvantages to this strategy. First, keep in mind what is called the gambler's fallacy. Just because black has won 10, or even 100, times in a row does not mean that red is any more likely the next time around. The chance is 50% each spin. Actually, it is slightly less than 50/50 with the 0 and 00.
Another disadvantage of this strategy is that, eventually, you may reach the maximum bet, or run out of money, after several consecutive losses. As soon as this happens, you're in the red, even if you win. You need to continue making larger bets — or winning out — in order to recoup your losses.;
, You want to start small and have the opportunity to double your losing bets almost ad infinitum. Hence, a small minimum bet and a high maximum bet.








, American roulette tables have 37 pockets, including the 0, meaning that the ball has an equal probability of landing in either the black and red pockets, even or odd, and the small digits (1-18) or the larger digits (19-36).









For the sake of example, we'll assume that your bet is going to be red or black, even though you could easily bet even or odd, 1-18 or 19-36.

, Alternately, you can leave the casino, although leaving with $2 instead of $1 isn't very satisfying. It does beat leaving with $0, however.








, In other words, if your losing bet was $1, you should now bet $2. If you bet on black, you should bet on black again.








, If you win, you've made just as much money by winning on your second bet as you would have had you won on your first.








,, Remember that this is not a sure-fire way to win money, it is just a way to maximize your odds at the table with the worst odds (for the gambler) in the casino.

Join any ""slot clubs"" or ""player perks"" your casino offers.,
Know what you're looking at.,
Decide the amount that you're comfortable betting each pull.,
Don't buy into casino mapping.",How to Play Slot Machines1," These programs will reward you based on how much you play and can give you the opportunity to cash in for additional benefits. Compare the incentives of different casinos or sites, and choose the casino based on the benefits or freebies that are the best for you.


As a member, you may get additional offers in mail or online. During casinos' off-seasons, it's common for them to try to lure you in with free play, free food, or a free hotel stay (or all three). So if you're going to spend your money anyway, you might as well sign up. Always check the player desk daily to learn about daily promotions and special offers; many of them are not advertised online.
If this is your first time, walk around and get to know the facility, especially if you are staying as a hotel guest. Generally, casinos are layed out with the action in the middle and the services around the perimeter. Notice where the rest rooms and emergency exits are located. Look at the floor and you will see the ugliest carpeting you have ever seen; that is there on purpose to keep you looking up, not down. But the floor will also show you where the main walkways are, should you become lost. Also notice the overhead signs that indicate different areas and how to get back to where you were.;
, Though there are different types of machines all of varying, payouts, popularity, and method, how they work is generally all the same. There's just a few things you should know how to work:


You can pay with a previous payout ticket, your member card, or cash. Often (if not always), the previous payout ticket will go in the same slot the cash can be inserted. Most machines take $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 dollar bills, though some also take $1, too. These areas will be lit up and unmissable. If you see the Bill Acceptor not lit, or flashing blue, it is in need of service or what is called a Bill Drop . Press the HELP or SERVICE button to summon an attendant.
Most machines no longer spit out coins. If you're looking for a coin tray, you may be looking for a while. New machines use the TITO system . Some casinos have reverted back to coin usage in the high limit areas, as it takes less time to play coins that it does to insert paper. But for machines of $500 denomination and higher, you will need a ticket to play.
For certain variations of games, the methodology is spelled out on the glass above the screen. It'll tell you what type of game it is, what each spin pays out, and details on the jackpot. If it's there, read it before you sit down. Some machines will be blatantly better than others. Machines tend to be grouped by denomination, style and brand name. Video slots have a HELP or INFO button that will walk you through the various payouts, play lines, bonus games and special features.
Each machine has a light on top of it called a 'candle'. The candle contains a color indicating its denomination, and also serves to notify the slot attendant if service is needed. The candle flashes in specific patterns for service needed, entry made into the machine, jackpot, door not secure, and other functions.
Locate the ""Cash Out"" button. This is how you'll finally be freed from your semi-conscious state and released into the world of windows, clocks, and not-for-free soda. Press it and it'll tabulate your winnings and issue a ticket, which you can then take to the cashier or to the payout redemption machine -- if you win, of course. Keep in mind that tickets are bearer instruments; whoever holds it can redeem it. So guard it as you would cash. If you find one on the floor or other location, do NOT attempt to redeem it; turn it in to Security or other official. All tickets are numbered and time-stamped, and attempting to cash out one that isnt yours can get you in trouble, up to and including being ejected and barred from the location!

, With slot machines, you can bet a surprisingly high amount of money in no time. In fact, they can move faster than some table games. There are machines where you'll get by betting 50 cents and other machines that, in order to really be playing, you'll need to bet $5. Find an amount that doesn't make your stomach churn?


Generally speaking, if more money is needed to hit the jackpots, you should bet it (why play if you can't win?). So if you're not looking to dip into your grandmother's inheritance, the penny, nickel, or quarter slots may be more to your liking. And you'll get more playing time out of your dollar in the long run!
Most casinos lay out these machines in sections. You'll see giant lit-up signs displaying ""5¢"" or ""25¢"" or ""1¢."" If the casino is a maze (as some seem to intentionally be), just grab a waitress or attendant to be pointed in the right direction. High limit slots, usually $5 and higher, are located in separate rooms or 'salons', with their own attendants and cashiers.

, Sure, casinos employ a certain level of strategy in placing their slots, but each one varies and it's not something so simple as to be understood with a quick glance or paragraph. What's more, with technology nowadays, they can change a machine's payout at the click of the button. So before you go asking that cute hostess where you should play, think again.


While we're at it, the concept of a ""hot"" machine also doesn't pan out logically. Realistically speaking, a slot machine is a like a pair of dice. You may feel like after you roll four sixes in a row you're probably not going to get another six, but in all likelihood, the six is just as likely to come up again as every other number. With each roll, the dice starts back over. And the slot machine is the same. It's only over the course of an absolutely Titanic-sized number of turns that the casinos are getting their payout numbers.Unless you plan on making a career out of risking your money, there's no point in letting it factor into your decisions.

Know a bit about the reverse martingale strategy.,
Find a roulette table with a small minimum bet and a high maximum bet.,
Bet a small amount on black or red, even or odd, 1-18 or 19-36.,
Wait until you hit your color.,
When you've hit your color and won a bet, double the bet on the same color for the next spin.








,
If you win, continue doubling your bet.,
If you lose, move back down to your original bet.",How to Practice Roulette Strategy2," The reverse martingale is increasing your bets when you win and decreasing your bets when you lose. The idea is that if you go on hot streaks, you'll increase your earnings, and if you hit a dry patch, you'll limit your losses.








, Again, the strategy is basically the same as the martingale, except reversed.








, For the sake of example, we'll assume you made a red or black bet.








, If you keep losing, continue betting your very small amount.








,, This is the amount that you might bet if you won 14 straight bets:









1 - 2 - 4 - 8 - 16 - 32 - 64 - 128 - 256 - 512 - 1024 - 2048 - 4096 - 8192

, Using the reverse martingale can be risky if you lose. As soon as you lose, you've lost your entire earnings. To make the reverse martingale successful, then, you need to ride a streak of wins and quit before you lose.








"
"
Know a bit about the D'Alembert strategy.,
Pick a small starting bet and a color.,
Increase your bets by one after a loss, and decrease them by one after a win.,
Walk away when you've had at least as many wins as losses.",How to Practice Roulette Strategy3," A bit safer than the martingale and reverse martingale strategies, the D'Alembert strategy involves ramping up and down by arithmetic factors instead of geometric factors. That means, instead of doubling your bet when you lose (i.e. martingale), you increase your bet by 1 when you lose using the D'Alembert strategy.








, Alternately, because the D'Alembert is an even chance betting system, you can also place a bet on even or odd number, as well as 1-18 or 19-36.








, If you have as many wins as losses, using the D'Alembert will put you in the profit.









For example, you started off with a bet of $5 on black. You lose, so you bet $6 on black. You lose again, so you bet $7 on black. You win, so you decrease your bet to $6. You win and you walk away.
Using the above example, you won as many games as you lost and you came out with a profit: - 5 - 6 + 7 + 6 = +2.

, If you're riding a losing streak, wait until your winning picks up and gets to your total number of losses. If you're riding a winning streak, keep playing until the total amount of wins equals your total amount of losses.

Know a bit about the Fibonacci strategy.,
Start off with a small bet on either black or red.,
If you lose, keep going down the sequence.,
When you win, move back two bets in the sequence and bet that amount.",How to Practice Roulette Strategy4," Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, also known as Fibonacci, was a famous Italian mathematician who discovered an interesting sequence of numbers which are now named after him. The sequence goes as follows, with numbers generated by adding the last two digits together: 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 21 - 34 - 55 - 89 - 144 - 233 - 377 - 610.









The Fibonacci strategy involves betting by adding the last two bets together. One advantage of this is that you can come out with a profit by losing more games than you've won. But one serious disadvantage is that the further you go down the sequence, the more money you lose. In other words, strike quit or get out of the way.

, Alternately, because the Fibonacci strategy is an even chance betting system, you can also place a bet on even or odd number, as well as 1-18 or 19-36.








, If you started off with a bet of $1 and lose, bet another $1. If you lose that, bet $2 — $1 + $1 = $2.








, Here's an example of how you might bet — including winning and losing bets — using the Fibonacci strategy:









Bet black, $3 — lose
Bet black, $3 — lose
Bet black, $6 — lose
Bet black, $9 — lose
Bet black, $15 — win
Bet black, $6 — lose
Bet black, $9 — win
Bet black, $3 — win
Bet black, $3 — win

- 3 - 3 - 6 - 9 + 15 - 6 + 9 + 3 +3 = +3
You lost five bet and only won four, but you're still ahead +3.

Realize your odds.",How to Play Roulette1," Roulette is French for ""little wheel."" On this wheel are 36 numbers and a 0; on some American tables, there is a ""00."" A croupier sends a small white ball spinning that will eventually land on one of the numbers. Bets are placed on the table, correlating with the slots the ball can possibly land in.









On the table are the numbers and a few other options:













1st 12
2nd 12
3rd 12
1-18
19-36
Even
Odd
Black
Red;
, In roulette, you have to anticipate the number or type of pocket on which the ivory ball is going to land. To do this, there are a range of bets you can make.""Inside"" bets, or bets placed on specific numbers, generally have higher paying odds. You can bet:









""Straight up"" betting on one number pays 35 to 1
Split betting on two numbers pays 17 to 1
""Street"" betting on three numbers pays 11 to 1
Three numbers can be bet with just one chip. It can be placed on the end of any ""street"" (the row of 3 numbers) on the table map.
Corner betting on four numbers pays 8 to 1
The chip lies on the intersection of the four numbers.
Six line betting on 6 numbers pays 5 to 1
The chip lies on the edge of two adjoining streets.
Additionally, for American roulette, there is the Five-number bet which covers ""0,00,1,2,3"" and pays 6:1, and the Row 00 bet which covers 0 and 00 and pays 17:1.







, These bets do not involve specific numbers and are made on the outside of the number map, hence the name.









Color betting (red or black) pays 1 to 1.
Even or odd betting pays 1 to 1.
Column or betting on 12 numbers pays 2 to 1
Dozen betting (1st 12, etc.) pays 2 to 1
High or low bets pay 1 to 1.

, At every roulette table (and at every game in the casino itself), the house always has an edge. All bets at both wheels (French or American) are paid at odds that would be true if only the 36 numbers were on the wheel. Their advantage comes from to 0 -- and the 00 in America.There are theories as to how you can improve your odds, but they don't work. However, there are some variants that change how the favor lies:









At American tables, the ""00"" slot increases the casino's advantage even more. On a roulette table with a single zero, the casino has an advantage of 2.7%. On a roulette table with a double zero, the casino has an advantage of 5.26%.Some French tables will employ rules that generally help out the players. The ""La Partage"" and ""En Prison"" rules apply to outside even money bets like odds or even, black or red and low or high; they also apply when the ball lands in the zero slot. They are similar in the sense that players only lose half of their bet, but players cannot leave their bet on the table for another spin with the La Partage rule. If a player loses, they can collect half their bet in the En Prison rule, or leave half their bet on the table for the next spin with the La Partage rule.

Master the multiplier machine.,
Bet a bunch on buy-a-pays.,
Plug into the progressive slots.,
Venture into the video games.,
Settle on a game.,
Mind your manners.",How to Play Slot Machines2," This is the type where if you play a coin, you get a certain amount of money. If you play two coins, you get a much bigger amount of money. And if you play three coins, well, you'd be practically robbing the bank if you won.


Betting more doesn't increase your chances of winning, so it's fine not to bet max on this type of game. This kind is fairly straightforward in that if you bet a small amount, you'll win a small amount; bet a large amount, you'll win a large amount -- but it doesn't effect the number of times you win.
Look for machines that don't have much of a discrepancy between the coins if you're looking to save your money. If one coin gets you 2000 on the jackpot, and 2 coins gets you 5000, but three coins gets you 45000, you may want to walk away. Imagine what would happen if you bet one coin and hit it big! You'd be sulking all the way to the buffet.

, Not only is that alliteration, but it's true. If you're on a buy-a-pay, always bet the max. One coin may buy you the center line, two coins will buy you a diagonal, and three coins gets you the whole 9 yards. This also works with symbols. Again, imagine yourself betting one coin and seeing 7-7-7 come up in a diagonal! If you do choose this machine, it's best to go big or go home.


In other words, this machine doesn't increase the amount you win if were to bet more, it just increases the amount of winning combinations or places you have access to. You're literally buying what will pay you. And no, if the machine hits but you didn't pay for it, the machine still counts that as a payout -- it won't make up for it in its 93% payback (or whatever it may be).
Buy-a-pay slots are recognizable by the layout of their pay tables. Notice, for example, that a Double Diamond slot has the same symbols shown for one coin or two coin play. All symbols are active regardless of coins played. But look at Bally's Flaming 7s machine, and you will see the bars listed for one coin and the 7s listed for two coins. For the sevens to be active, you must play both coins per play. If the 7s come up with only 1 coin in, you do not win. As we have mentioned before, learn so you can earn!

Some video machines work like this, but those get their separate section.



, If you see a whole bunch of people at a row of machines with a giant display board above them that's turning into quite the spectacle, that's a community progressive game. These types of slots have a jackpot total that grows each time the machines are played. All their machines are linked up to each other's and the first person to hit the jackpot gets a percentage of all the play, not just their own.Just like on the buy-a-pays, you wanna bet the max on this type of game, too. If you don't bet the max, you won't be winning the jackpot. You can get smaller cash prizes, but the jackpot won't have your name on it. So if you do spend your time at this machine -- which, in its defense, can have ridiculously large jackpots -- be ready to turn out your pockets.

, These are otherwise referred to as ""multi-line"" games and they work similarly to buy-a-pays. You get to choose how many lines you'd like to buy and how many credits you'd like to spend on each line. At a penny slot, you could spend 1¢ on the center line and take a spin. It probably won't pay you anything, but you could do it. Some machines have up to 500 lines that you can bet on, and you can usually bet somewhere between a penny and a dollar per line (depending).


Consider your position. If you are playing a video slot with 100 paylines at $1 per line, your minimum bet is $100 per play. You are now playing a high-limit bet on a $1 slot. For greater payback percentage, increased ratings as a player and more personalized attention, you may wish to move over to the high-limit machines.
You do not need to bet max on this game, but you should bet all the lines. That way, not a turn will go by where you see a winner but don't get it reflected in your winnings (because you didn't bet the line). The machine doesn't care which lines you're betting and won't adjust its payout rates accordingly, so bet 'em all to catch 'em all.
Video games are far and away the most popular slot as of late. That's because they offer bonus rounds, scatter pays and special events fairly regularly. In addition to the fun and varied animation, it gives you the sense that you're actually playing a game and may have a chance at winning.

Okay, so video poker may be more popular, but that's another beast entirely. If you'd like to take a stab at this world, wikiHow has resources for that, too.


Winning combinations will criss-cross, use diagonals, Ms, Ws, squigglies, curly-cues, and other directions, depending on the game. Even if you think you're not winning, you might be and when you think you're winning, you may not be. Just take in the pretty pictures and try to keep your head above water. And then saddle up for a bonus round and put those free spins to work.

, Now that you know the different variations of play, the casino is your oyster. Find a machine that's open and settle down for what will hopefully be a long spell. Insert your player's card (even if you're not using it to access cash -- you'll get points this way) and then either insert cash or a previous payout ticket. Then it's all shiny lights and buzzes from there!


Follow the prompts on the screen or read the directions above it. If you get confused or the machine doesn't seem to be working, call an attendant (there's a button on the dash that will do this for you -- the machine will light up, notifying them) to help you.
When you're ready to leave, hit the ""Cash Out"" button. This will print you a receipt that you can then take to a Casino ATM or to the cashier's box. Once obtained, remove your player's card and hit the patterned carpeting. What time is it, anyway?

, Though casinos are hot spots for hedonism, that doesn't mean they're not subject to maintaining a certain amount of class. In general, the etiquette rules of any given casino are fairly logical:


If you see a jacket on a chair or a chair is pushed up against a machine, it's taken. Don't use it. You'll just end up in the middle of a confrontation when the person gets back from the bathroom.
Don't play more than one or two machines at a time. And if the casino is even remotely crowded, only play the one. Don't ruin someone else's good time with your insatiable appetite for handle-pulling.
If you see someone get a jackpot that should've been yours, don't fuss: There's no such thing. Each computer is going through thousands of combinations every minute and the likelihood that you would've pressed the button at that exact one-hundredth of a second are incredibly minute. Worse than the odds of you walking away with a padded wallet!"
"
Know your limits.,
Walk into the casino with only the money you will be playing with.,
Choose the lowest denomination possible for the slot machine you want to play.,
Select slot machines with the highest payback percentages.,
Pocket any winnings you earn.",How to Play Slot Machines3," Alright, it's time for the disclaimer: You must know your limits and you must stop playing when you reach them. Before you begin gambling, determine a dollar amount you can afford to lose as well as an amount you will walk away with should you win. Both are equally important, as they can help you know when to stop gambling.


Getting greedy or betting more than you can afford to lose are the 2 biggest pitfalls while playing slot machines. What can be a fun, relaxing experience can turn into something that'll make you pull your hair out. Proceed with caution.

, Leave credit or debit cards and access to additional funds at home or in your hotel room safe, where you won't be tempted to overspend.


If at all possible, section out your money for the night. Tell yourself you'll only spend a certain amount every half hour. If you're up at the end of that 30 minutes, you get to bank what you profited (and keep going with the original amount!). And if you run out of money, you wait until the next half hour mark rolls around and proceed again. The night will last much, much longer., This will allow you to play the slot machine for longer periods of time and can maximize your gaming experience. If you're going with a budget in mind, buy-a-pays and progressive machines aren't your best bet, literally. Stick to multi-line games or multiplier machines.

, This number indicates how frequently the machines pay out, and the higher the percentage the more likely your chances of winning. These amounts should be clearly displayed on the machines and will range anywhere from 80% to 98% -- the higher the denomination of the machine (1¢ for example), the higher the payout.


Be aware that the payout numbers may apply to a bank of machines as opposed to individual units (like in progressive games), and not all machines in that row will pay out the same. You may need to watch other players gamble for a bit to determine which slots are better options.
For purposes of clarity, that 98% payout means that you'll win 98¢ for every dollar you spend. That is, if you were to spend the greater part of this decade there.

Machines in Vegas are purported to payout more.But remember, this is over the long-term. Machines have the same number of combinations each time you take a turn. If you win or don't win on one spin, you have the same chances of winning or not winning next time.



, Never play with money you've won, because it goes against your beginning strategy of only playing what you predetermined you would spend while gambling. And even though instant gratification is a wonderful thing, you'll feel a lot better walking home with money in your pocket than you would if you simply got to spend an extra 20 minutes at the casino.


When you get home, put your winnings into a jar. The next time you go to the casino, take your bankroll out of that. If there's nothing in the jar after a few times, either cut down what you're spending or cut down on the number of times you go in any given period of time. Or wait until the casino sends you free play in the mail!

, If this penny goes in, then the other player throws one penny. After both players have thrown their pennies, the turn is over. If one player missed the shot, then that person loses. If both players miss, then another round occurs. If both player make the shots, then you move on to turn two.

Find a table.,
Watch what's happening.,
Hand your chips to the dealer.,
Know the procedure of a round.,
Place your bets.",How to Play Roulette2," Each one will carry a placard describing the minimum and maximum bets at the table. For example, it might read, ""Roulette. $5 minimum inside bets, $5 minimum outside bets. $1,000 maximum outside, $100 maximum inside."" Table maximums usually are lower on inside bets because of the higher payoffs offered.









Each table will also have a board that highlights the previous numbers the ball has landed on. While you may be tempted to look at this and feel as if the odds of a number repeating are incredibly low, that's not the way it works. With each spin, the odds of each number remain the same. It's the same wheel and same ball every time.

, For all intents and purposes, there can be no strategy to roulette. It's pure and simple luck. Each number has the exact same shot of popping up every time...usually.









Sometimes, dealers have habits. They might release the ball at exactly the same angle and velocity nearly every time during a specific session. As the dealer releases the ball, the same numbers pass every time, increasing the chances that the ball ends up resting on the same portion of the wheel repeatedly.
A wheel can go off-kilter. However, casinos are pretty good at spotting this. There's really no way to tell if a wheel is off balance unless you monitor thousands and thousands of spins.

, In Europe or France, this person may be called a ""croupier."" In roulette, you do not play with normal casino chips. If you did, how would you know whose was whose after all the bets are placed? Each person gets a specific color to be able to differentiate between bettors. Even husbands and wives are recommended to separate.









You can get your chips in different monetary denominations. When you hand the dealer your chips, he or she will ask what denomination you want to designate your chips. If you're at a $5 minimum table, you could make them $1 or you could make them $100 (or anywhere in between). Once you've chosen, they'll place a chip on top of the rail, with a marker on top of that to indicate your colored chips' value.Roulette chips have no value away from the roulette wheel. When you're ready to leave the table, place all your remaining roulette chips on the table and tell the dealer you'd like to cash out. He or she will give you normal casino chips in return.

, After the dealer clears the table and has paid the winners, play begins for the next round. He'll pause for a bit, giving everyone time to decide on their bets. Then, he'll throw the ball onto the wheel and spin it. The dealer will announce, ""No more bets!"" when the ball drops from the track onto the wheel.









Once the ball settles, the dealer places a marker on the winning number (or winning chips, that is). Losing bets get cleared off first and then winners get paid. The process then repeats., The first six bets are placed on the pockets numbered 0 to 36 on the game table. If you want to bet on column, place your bets on the empty pocket under the three columns. For the dozen, choose the pocket P12 for the first 12 numbers, M 12 for the 12 middle numbers and D 12 for the last 12 numbers. Finally, when you want to bet on the outside bets, use the red, black, even, odd, high or low pockets.









Some players like to watch the other players, either hoping the others know something they don't or doing the opposite of their opponents' actions. You can try this, but it won't improve your odds more than coincidentally.

Understand Powerball odds.",How to Play Powerball," In 43 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,Powerball tickets are available at authorized lottery retailers, which means they are usually found at the same places that most other lottery tickets are - drugstores, gas stations, and grocery stores. The game can be played by anyone over the age of 18.You don't have to be a resident of a Powerball state to play if you purchase your ticket in a Powerball state. You don't even have to be a U.S. citizen to play and win the Powerball.


However, if you are not a U.S. citizen and you win a substantial jackpot, the IRS deducts a flat rate of 30% from your winnings. U.S. citizens are subject to different rules.
Powerball tickets are not sold in Alaska, Hawaii,Nevada, Utah, Alabama, and Mississippi. These states prohibit lotteries by law.
Finally, Powerball tickets cannot be purchased via mail or the internet,except from the website of Powerball's recommended lottery ticket service, which purchases legal tickets on your behalf.
;
, Official Powerball drawings occur every Wednesday and Saturday night at 10:59 PM Eastern Time.Powerball ticket sales cut off at least 59 minutes before each drawing, though they may occur earlier. When you buy a Powerball ticket at the store, unless you pay for multiple drawings, it is only valid for the next drawing. In other words, if your Powerball ticket doesn't win, it's not eligible to win in future drawings, unless you specifically pay for multiple drawings.


The more drawings that occur without a jackpot winner, the higher the jackpot gets. Jackpots start at a minimum of $40 million and increase each time a drawing occurs without a jackpot winner.
Current drawing results are posted to the top of the USA Mega Millions and Powerball website.Most places where Powerball tickets are sold will also post the most recent draws.

, Powerball is played by selecting six numbers - five numbers between 1-69 and one number between 1-26. Each number is on a special ball that is randomly selected by a machine during the drawing. Your ultimate goal is to match every number selected perfectly, which will win you the jackpot. However, there are other winning combinations of numbers that will win smaller prizes (which can be quite lucrative in their own right).


Your first five numbers don't have to be in the same order as the balls that are drawn. Winning numbers win regardless of the order they're listed in. However, the final Powerball number must match exactly - none of the first five numbers can count toward it.The number of balls and the odds change regularly. They are current as of January 2016., If the numbers you picked match the numbers drawn in any one of nine combinations, you can collect your winnings. Note that the prize amounts below represent base values - Power Play prizes are subject to a 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x multiplier, selected at random (except for Jackpots, which aren't multiplied, and prizes for matching five white balls, which will only double). The winning combinations are:Matching only the red ball: $4 winnings
Matching the red ball and one white ball: $4
Matching the red ball and two white balls: $7
Matching three white balls: $7
Matching the red ball and three white balls: $100
Matching four white balls: $100
Matching the red ball and four white balls: $10,000
Matching five white balls: $1,000,000
Matching the red ball and five white balls: Jackpot!
Note: prizes differ in California because state law requires lottery prizes to be awarded on a pari-mutuel basis., Single Powerball tickets cost $2 a piece. In every state except California, you also have the option to play “Power Play”. Power Play is an add-on to the ticket price that increases your winnings for all non-jackpot prizes should you win. As of January 2014, prizes for winning tickets with the Power Play add-on are subject to a 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x multiplier, selected at random before each drawing.For instance, a $4 prize would become either $8, $12, $16, or $20 with Power Play. This option costs $1 extra.


The Power Play option is unavailable in California because state laws require that lottery prizes be paid on a pari-mutuel basis.This means that lottery prizes can't be set at absolute values, but must fluctuate based on the number of tickets sold and the amount of winning tickets.


, Though Powerball tickets will vary slightly from state to state, the basic method for filling a ticket out is the same everywhere. On your ticket, you'll need to specify the numbers you want to bet on, the number of drawings you want, and whether or not you want the Power Play option. Follow the guidelines below for filling out a basic ticket:Fill in the spaces for five numbers from 1-69 and one number from 1-26. Usually, Powerball tickets are divided into multiple sections called ""boards"" which have rows of multiple-choice style bubbles to fill in to choose your numbers. Each board essentially counts as one $2 ticket. In other words, for $2, you can fill out one board on the ticket and bet on a single set of numbers. Each subsequent board filled out costs $2 more but allows you to bet on an additional set of numbers.
Indicate for each board whether you'd like the ""Power Play"" option. Each board (except in California) should have a space that allows you to buy a Power Play for your set of numbers.
For random numbers, fill in the QP space instead of your numbers. ""QP"" stands for ""Quick Pick"" - this lets a computer randomly choose numbers for you.
Choose how many drawings you want. Most tickets have a ""Multidraw"" section that allows you to pay for multiple drawings. For instance, if you want to bet on your numbers for two back-to-back drawings, fill in the ""2"" space. Each subsequent drawing costs as much as an additional ticket.
If you make an error on any board, fill in the ""VOID"" space for that board. Don't try to erase - instead, mark the board void and fill your numbers in on another board.
When you're finished, pay for your ticket. The clerk will calculate the price of your ticket based on how many boards and Power Plays you've selected.

For example, if we play 5 draws on one board with a Power Play and 5 without, we would pay 5 × 3 + 5 × 2 = $25.




, If you don't wish to fill out a lengthy Powerball ticket by hand or you don't care which numbers you bet on, you can usually ask for a Quick Pick ticket instead of the normal Powerball ticket. In this case, a computer will randomly choose your numbers for you as if you had filled in the ""QP"" space for a board on the normal ticket.

, Small prizes can be claimed directly from the vendor you bought the ticket from, while larger prizes require official verification. If your winnings are less than $600, simply go to the lottery retailer with your ticket to claim your winnings. If your winnings are over $600, go to a lottery district office to present your ticket. The precise procedures for claiming large prizes differ from state to state - you may need to fill out a claim form, etc.


Powerball tickets do expire. The time window you have to claim a prize differs from state to state - from 90 days to a full year.
If you can't make it to the vendor or lottery office for some reason (for instance, if you've left the state you bought the ticket in), it's legal to mail your ticket to the state lottery office.Powerball provides a map that links you to state lottery pages, which will have more specific information about claiming prizes in your state. Access the Powerball Map to find any of these locations.

, Congratulations, you won the jackpot! The only question remaining before you retire is this: how would you like your money? Powerball jackpot winners have two options for receiving their cash - they can receive the entire prize at once in a lump sum, or they can receive it as an annuity - in other words, in yearly installments. Choosing which prize to take is a complicated decision that will differ based on your personal financial situation. Taking the cash as a lump sum will give you lots of money up front, so it may be a good idea if you have a dream purchase or investment you'd like to make immediately. The annuity option invests the cash winnings, gives you your first installment immediately, then gives subsequent payments each year for 30 years (plus interest), which is a better situation for long-term stability.


Note that Powerball winnings are subject to federal and/or state income taxes. Because of this, the annuity option will net you more money in the long term - not only will you receive interest on your winnings, but each year you'll only have to pay taxes on about 1/30th of your total prize, meaning more of your prize will be taxed at a lower bracket. On the other hand, with a large lump sum payment, you can expect to pay up to about half of your winnings in taxes, depending on your state's income tax rules.

, Like any lottery, Powerball's jackpot odds are very slim. Many avid Powerball players consider the excitement of going against the odds to be part of the fun. To make an educated decision when buying Powerball tickets, consult the official odds listed below, which are for a single random $2 ticket:Matching only the red ball: 1 in 38.32
Matching the red ball and one white ball: 1 in 91.98

, Players are given this opportunity going around the table from the dealer's right. When playing pai gow in a casino, the players usually decline in favor of the house because the banker has to be able to cover all bets made. Sometimes, a player may share the duties evenly with the dealer.

,, There should be 8 domino stacks, with each stack having 4 tiles. The stacks are called woodpiles.

,, The dealer puts 4 dice in a dice cup, rolls them, and declares an end to betting.

, The player who gets first choice is determined by starting with the dealer and counting to his or her right up to the number rolled on the 3 dice of the same color. Each player thereafter chooses 1 of the remaining woodpiles.

If neither of your hands beat the dealer's hands, you lose your bet. If only 1 of your hands beat the dealer's hands, you get back what you bet, but you don't win any money from the house.


The dealer uses the fourth die rolled with the other 3 to determine how to build his or her hands according to a set of rules known as Star City's Pai Gow House Way. Players may also build their hands by this set of rules or as they choose according to the rules in the remaining steps of this section.

, These are the 1-2 and 2-4 tiles, which may be played together or with other tiles as wild cards to make a pair. If you play them together, they form the highest possible hand, known as the Supreme Pair. If you play either tile with a different tile as a wild card, the wild tile earns you 3 points.

, Pai gow does not rank tiles in numeric order, but in a special order according to the significance of the numbers. The ranking is given below, with the name given to each matching pair. There are 2 of each tile in the Chinese domino set.


Matching 12s (called ""Teens"") - ""Heaven""
Matching 2s (called ""Deys"" or ""Days"") - ""Earth""
Matching 8s (called ""Yuns"") - ""Man""
Matching 10s (in 5-5 combination, called ""Mooys"") - ""Flower""
Matching 6s (in 3-3 combinations, called ""Chongs"") - ""Long""
Matching 4s (in 2-2 combination, called ""Bons"") - ""Board""

Matching 7s (in 1-6 combination, called ""Tits"") - ""Long Leg 7""
Matching 6s (in 1-5 combination, called ""Looks"") - ""Big Head 6""

, Unmatched pairs in pai gow are Chinese dominoes whose pips add up to the same value but are divided differently on the 2 halves of the tile. (There is 1 of each tile in the pai gow set.) Listed in rank from highest to lowest, they are:


Mixed 9s (3-6 and 4-5 combinations, each tile called ""Chop Gow"")
Mixed 8s (2-6 and 3-5 combinations, each tile called ""Chop Bot"")
Mixed 7s (2-5 and 3-4 combinations, each tile called ""Chop Chit"")
Mixed 5s (2-3 and 1-4 combinations, each tile called ""Chop Ng"")

, Wongs, gongs, and high nines are made with either the Teen (12) or Dey (2) tiles. Either of these pai gow tiles can be played with 9s, 8s, or 7s in the ranking order given below. (Note that a Teen or Dey tile can't be used in both a pair and one of these special combinations.)


Wong (with 9s) - ""King of Heaven"" (12), ""King of Earth"" (2)
Gong (with 8s) - ""Treasure of Heaven"" (12), ""Treasure of Earth"" (2)
High nine (with 7s) - Either a 12 or 2

, You're trying to make a score of 9 or come as close to it as possible. As in baccarat, if you score more than 9, the tens digit is dropped; a 2-2 and a 3-3 tile played together score 0.

, Score the hands for special combinations and points as described above. Ties are broken in the following ways:


If both the dealer and player have hands with the same numeric value, the value of the highest-ranking domino determines which hand wins. If the values of both dominoes in the hands are equal, the player has a ""copy"" hand and loses.
If both the dealer and the player's hands score 0, the dealer wins even if the player had a higher-ranking domino.

Know the personnel.,
Familiarize yourself with the table.,
Learn the lingo.,
Get ""superstitious"".",How to Play Craps1," When you walk up to any table, you'll want to know just who you're dealing with. Because craps involves the most money out of any standard casino game, you can expect to be working with a fair amount of employees.


Walk into virtually any casino today and you'll find a craps table with a double layout. At one side of the table (probably closest to the pit) in the center is the ""boxman,"" -- he supervises the game and handles and stashes all the cash (way more than what's circulating in all of the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Opposite him is the ""stickman"" (not the stick-figure man)-- he's the one operating the stick, believe it or not, using it to push the dice around. He controls the tempo of the game, calling out the results, working with the dice, and urging players to be decisive.
Near the stickman will be two dealers who manage all the bets, pay the winners, and collect the losers' money. Surrounding them will be the players -- your new friends.;
, Casinos aren't meant for customers to be scared away by feeling intimidated -- the craps table is simple once you've studied it for a minute. Here are the basics:


All around the table is a ""Pass"" line. This is for bettors who are on the shooter's side. A less noticeable ""Don't Pass"" bar is for the players who are smart enough to bet against the shooter.

You'll also notice areas marked ""Come"" and ""Don't Come."" These are similar to the two aforementioned sections, but will be utilized later in the game.


If you take a hard look between the boxman and the stickman, you'll see an area for proposition, or one-roll, bets. That's where you'd be betting on one specific roll, naturally. In the same vicinity is an area for hard-way bets. That's where you might bet, for example, that an 8 will come up as two 4s before a 7 or an ""easy"" 8 does.
Also in front of the players is a section that says ""Field."" This is for one-roll bets that one of seven numbers (2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12) will turn up next. The boxes that say 4, 5, Six, 8, Nine, and 10 are for ""Place"" or ""Buy"" bets that, before the next 7, the chosen number will be rolled.

Six and Nine being spelled out make it easy for players on all sides of the table to be able to decipher between the similar shapes.


In the corners on either end, you'll find boxes marked Big 6 and Big 8 -- bets that a Six or 8 will come up before a 7.(Pays 1:1 or 7:6)

, ""Comin' out. Bet those hard ways. How about the C and E? Hot roll comin', play the field. Any mo' on yo?""Did you catch any of that? Odds are that's what you'll be hearing when you saunter up to a game in progress. It will be mind-boggling at first, but you'll be hating those Skinny Dugans in no time. Here's a list to get you started:



Craps - 2,3, or 12Yo, or Yo-leven - 11C and E Craps - 11Snake Eyes - Two 1sBoxcars - Two 6sLittle Joe, or Little Joe from Kokomo - 4 (particularly rolled as a 1 and a 3)Jimmy Hicks - the number 6Skate and Donate - 8Skinny Dugan - A loser 7Center Field - 9, because it's in the middle of the seven numbers on the field betPuppy Paws - Two 5s -- though the more common call is simply ""Hard 10,"" or ""10, the hard way""Natural Winner - 7 or 11 on the come-out roll, Just like any avid gambler, the gods of luck must not be scoffed at, lest ye want your money revoked. Avoid certain habits (and do others) to look like a seasoned pro (literally) and not drive the others away, leaving you with nothing but nasty glares for companionship.


The more superstitious of players think it's bad luck to use different dice on the same roll. If a shooter were to throw one or both dice off the table accidentally, you might hear him call ""Same dice!"" just for good measure.(You might break the other dice and this one too.)
If you call out, ""Seven!""(the worst thing to say), don't be offended if everyone automatically flees. It's like uttering Macbeth in the theater. The word should be unthinkable and definitely unspeakable.
If you see a penny under the table, leave it; it's good luck. Or so some people might tell you.
If you're shooting, don't throw both dice in the air at the same time. You'll look like a pro if you toss just the one (maybe the other later); if you toss both, be ready for glares and a rush to the exit.

Recognize a pachinko machine.,
Find a pachinko parlor.,
Play to win.,
Play on new machines.,
Play pachinko online.",How to Play Pachinko1," Pachinko has been described as a vertical pinball machine. The goal of the game is to fire balls that fall through a maze of metal pins into a hole. The balls that go through let you play a slot machine with the chance of winning more balls. It's partially a game of skill and partially a game of chance.The small steel balls are smaller than those in most pinball machines. They are shot into a vertical playing field.You'll find three types of Pachinko machines: novice, intermediate, and advanced.;
, In Japan, entire arcades are devoted to pachinko. They are often referred to as pachinko parlors. They are located all throughout Tokyo, as pachinko is a popular game in Japan.At popular parlors, you might even see lines outside some Pachinko parlors in the mornings, as professional pachinko players and others line up early to get in.

, On top of every machine, you'll find statistics about how many wins and losses the machine has had. Consult these statistics to help you choose machines, as you want to pick ones with the best odds of winning.On top of the machine, look for a set of numbers. One number will be smaller than the other. That number is how many times the machine has won, while the bigger one is how many spins it has had. Both numbers only represent the day's spins.
You want a machine that hasn't that many wins with a large number of spins because machines tend to win in waves.
You don’t want a machine that won 25 times yesterday and many times the day before because it probably won’t give you much today.
Try not to spend more than 5,000-10,000 yen ($5-$10) on any one machine, and don’t play in an empty parlor. It probably has a reputation for losing machines.

, New machines are called ""shindai,"" and you'll see them advertised because they won't have stats on the top of the machine. Nonetheless, they can pay well, especially in the first two weeks.Try to find one to play on, even if you have to reserve a spot for it. You'll often see advertisements on trains for shindai machines in the area.

, The popularity of pachinko has started to spread around the globe and, to capitalize on this interest, many companies allow you to play pachinko online. You can play on whatever platform you prefer, from a smart phone to a tablet or computer. Finding a site is as simple as searching for ""play pachinko online.""


Some pachinko games online are free. Generally, the free games don't allow you to make any money doing it, but they do allow you to practice how the game works before you try it in real life.
You can play pachinko for money online, using your credit card, but always be wary of online gambling. Not only can you lose a lot of money, but it can be harder to vet the credibility of the sites.

Find three friendly co-players.,
Learn the structure of the game.",How to Play Bridge1," Bridge is a four-player game played in teams of two players each, so your significant other and another couple are a good potential choice. Teams sit across from each other around a square table.


For purposes of notation, each side of the table is given the name of a cardinal direction. Thus, the players in a bridge game are commonly referred to as North, South, East, and West. North and South play on a team against East and West.;
, Bridge is played with a standard 52-card deck in deals of 13 cards per player, so that the entire deck is dealt out each hand. After the deck is dealt, players make bids. The final bid determines the importance of each suit as well as the overall goal for each deal. Deals are then played card-by-card in 13 sub-rounds known as “tricks.” The goal of the game is to win 7 or more tricks on each deal in order to score points. Deals continue until one team accumulates a predetermined number of points.


Scoring systems vary from style to style and group to group.
Players typically take turns in a clockwise fashion. This means that actions alternate evenly between the two teams.

Place a bet before the come-out roll.,
Play the point.,
Place an ""odds bet."",
Place a ""(don't) come bet."",
Graduate to fancier bets.",How to Play Craps2," At the beginning of a round of craps, a button with the word OFF written on it is on the table not near any points. This means that no point (explained later) has been determined. A craps game can't begin until the shooter has placed a bet on the (don't) pass line. Anyone else at the table can also place a bet on the (don't) pass line at this time, though they don't have to. These are the most basic craps bets. The shooter's first roll of any turn is called the come out roll.


If the shooter rolls a 7 or 11 on the come-out roll, the pass line wins even money, the don'ts, you've lost your money. If the shooter comes out with a 2, 3, or 12----this is called craps----everyone loses their pass line bets and wins their don't pass bets (2 or 12 is a push for the don'ts, whichever the casino says.)
If the shooter rolls any other number, this number becomes the point.


, If the shooter establishes a point, by rolling a 4, 5, six, 8, nine, or 10, all bets on the (don't) pass line remain there. You don't have to make any additional bets to play the point. The dealer will take the button and place it on the number which is now the point. The button is now flipped to the ON side.


Let's assume the point is 8. The shooter now tries to roll his point (8) before he rolls a 7 (or the other way around). If he rolls any other number, it doesn't matter, but if he rolls 8, everybody passes. If he succeeds in hitting his point, he starts over with a new come-out roll and a new bet on the (don't) pass line, thus repeating the cycle. If he rolls a 7 at any time other than during a come-out roll, though, everybody fails and the dice are turned over to the next player (the first player has sevened out).
A player may hit, establish and hit several points before he finally rolls a 7, or he may roll a 7 on the first roll after he establishes his first point. You just never know what will happen.

, Learn the preceding steps, and you can play craps. The (don't) pass line bet has fairly good odds, and it's simple to play. Some people only play the pass line. There are, however, many other possible bets. One of the simplest is the odds bet, which also, incidentally, can have fair odds.


After the shooter has established a point, you can place an additional bet behind the pass line. This is the odds bet and can only be played if you are also playing the (don't) pass line. The odds bet is an additional bet on the point, so that if the shooter hits his point, you will win both your (don't) pass bet and the odds bet (2:1 point 4/10, 3:2 point 5/Nine, 6:5 point Six/8; 1:2 point 4/10, 2:3 point 5/Nine, 5:6 point Six/8).
The odds bet pays true odds, which differ depending on what the point is. For example, if the point is 4, there are only three combinations of the dice that will hit the point, while there are five ways to hit a point of 8. Thus the true odds for hitting 4 are worse than the true odds for hitting 8, and while the (don't) pass line pays even money no matter what, the odds bet pays you according to the true odds. Thus, if you want to bet more money, it's better to play the odds bet than to increase your pass bet. You should increase your don't bet rather than taking odds. House edge on odds (pass and don't pass) is zero.

Most casinos offer 3-4-5X odds tables, so that you can place an odds bet of up to thrice your pass bet if a 4 or a 10 is the point, 4 times if a 5 or a nine is the point, and 5 times if the point is a six or an 8, though some casinos allow even higher odds bets.


You can increase, decrease or remove your odds bet at any time.
The odds bet follows the same rules as your other bet.

, After a point has been established, you may also place a (don't) come bet in addition to your (don't) pass line bet. Note that you don't have to play both an odds bet and a (don't) come bet, but to play either you must play the (don't) pass line bet. A (don't) come bet is placed by putting your bet on the ""(Don't) Come"" space. When you place a (don't) come bet, the next roll the shooter throws will be your own come-out roll, with the same rules for a regular come-out roll. The come bet affects only you.


Assuming that the roll after you place you come bet is a 4, 5, six, 8, nine, or 10, the number rolled becomes your own ""come point."" The dealer will move your come bet to the appropriate number. Your pass line bet still depends on the shooter's point, so you now have two points.
A come bet works like a pass line bet. If the shooter throws your come point before he throws a 7, you win, but if he throws a 7, you lose both your pass line bet and your come bet. If the shooter throws both his point and your come point before rolling a 7, you win both.
You can place odds on a come bet. Tell the dealer ""odds on come"" when you lay your odds bet down.
Once your come bet is placed on your come point, you can place additional come bets to establish additional come points.

, Once you've got the basics down, you'll want to know about the...riskier bets. These are field bets -- bets that on one roll (the next roll) one of seven numbers will show up. They don't have to wait for the come-out; they may be placed before any roll by placing a chip or chips in the field area. Likewise, you may bet propositions or hard ways before any roll by putting a chip or chips on the layout and telling the dealer what bet you want.


After 7, six and 8 are the numbers that turn up the most. There are six ways to make 7 and 5 ways to make six and 8. If the player ""places"" six or 8 in multiples of $6, the house will pay winning wagers at odds of 7-6.The means the house percentage is at 1.52%, which is better than most other bets in the entire casino and still offers quick play -- but it's not as reliable as Line bets that have free odds.
4,6 ,8, and 10 are the hard-way numbers. That is, these numbers pop up if you roll the dice and the same number pops up on each. If you make a hard-ways bet, the number must come up (two 2s, two 3s, two 4s, two 5s) before a 7 and before it shows up in any other combination. The house edge is 11.1 percent on the 4 and 10 and 9.09 percent on the 6 and 8.

Put your money in the machine.,
Press the ball-release button.,
Turn the handle.,
Try to go through the gaps.,
Watch for the doors.,
Play the slot machine.,
Use pachinko etiquette.",How to Play Pachinko2," Insert cash or a prepaid card into the pachinko machine. The cash will buy you a certain number of balls, which should be listed on the machine. You will buy a certain number of balls at a selected monetary values for the game.If playing an offline game, put money into the money slot on the ball dispenser that you find on the machine’s left-hand side.Think of the balls like a casino's chips. They stand in for real money, just not money you can collect at the parlor.

, The ball-release button is called the tamakashi button. When you press the button the balls will fall into the tray at the top of your machine. This tray is called the uwazara. Those are the balls you have to play with, which are technically ""borrowed"" from the parlor.If the balls don't come out or it doesn't seem like what you paid for, you can ask an attendant to help you.

, You start playing in pachinko by pulling the handle that is on the machine’s lower right. You’ll want to turn the handle firmly by twisting it. The amount you twist controls how fast the balls shoot out the top. You want to find the right angle to aim the balls towards the hole near the bottom of the machine. If the balls don't enter the hole, you lose them to a chute below.Keep twisting to find the best speed for the balls. Try to aim for about 20 balls in the hole for every 1,000 yen you're spending.
The more strongly you turn the handle to the right, the faster the balls come out. If you don’t turn the handle strongly enough or far enough, the balls won’t move. If you turn the handle too strongly, the balls will go right into the losing shoot at the bottom.

, Part of pachinko is avoiding the pegs on the board, which can make your balls go off course. When turning the wheel, try to get the balls between the gaps as much as possible so they fall easily into the winning hole.You can launch the balls singly.
Each board has about 500 pegs that you must guide your balls through., Another part of pachinko is the small doors that surround the hole, one one each side. When they are shut, you'll only be able to get one ball through. When they open, you'll be able to get three balls through at once.The balls that go in reward you with more balls, as well as giving you a spin on the slot machine.

, The slot machine uses numbers, which you need to line up. You are looking for a three in a row. Of course, you want three in a row, but you also want a situation called a reach, where you are waiting for the third number to show up after having two in a row.You'll see reach happen about a fourth of the time. When it does, you'll have the number you want represented on the screen, battling against another number you don't want. Usually, these numbers are represented by various silly characters that literally battle across the screen.
If the other number wins, which usually happens, you lose. However, the fun happens when your number wins in a reach. When it does, each ball you've already won is converted to ten balls, or the machine will pay out a huge amount of balls.

, Pachinko is a very popular game in Japan, so an entire set of etiquette rules have popped up. It’s best to follow them if you are playing the game in its home country, as you can upset people if you don't.Don't gloat over winnings or look sad when you lose, as you are playing close by other people, and generally, everyone keeps a poker face. Most people don't want to be disturbed by the people around them. They view the game as something they do alone, not together.
Make sure not to touch anyone else's balls, as it's considered bad luck and bad form.
If you need to reserve a machine, use a pack of cigarettes or some other marker, and place it in the tray, which will work for about half an hour.Don't take children with you.

Empty the winnings box.,
End your game.,
Call the staff.,
Collect your tokens or cards.,
Exchange your tokens at a tuck shop.",How to Play Pachinko3," If you hit a jackpot, which is called an aotari, the machine will spit out balls into your lower tray. Once you have a lot or it seems to be overflowing, you need to empty it into your winnings box with the lever at the bottom.Never move the winnings box yourself. If it's full, you need to call a staff member, who will come move it for you. Usually, the person will set it behind you on the floor. You'll also get a new winnings box if you're still playing.
Each box of balls is usually worth about 5,000 yen., Once you're done, you need to collect any money you still have on your card, which you can do by pressing the card/coin return button. It should eject your card for you to take with you. Remember, like any gambling game, it's best to quit while you're ahead., Once again, you never touch the winning boxes of balls, mostly because no one wants to pick up thousands of balls. If you don't have a call button, make a big X with your arms to show the staff you're done. The staff member will come over and pick up your balls for you and take them to the counting machine., Because playing pachinko for money is technically illegal in Japan, you only get tokens or cards at the pachinko parlor. Once your balls are counted, the staff will hand you your tokens. Keep them in a safe place.Just like in casinos, the balls represent a certain amount of money. However, unlike casinos, you have one extra step in the exchange. Think of it like converting money. You are converting balls to tokens to yen.

, Once you've gathered your tokens, you must go elsewhere to find a tuck shop, where you can exchange your tokens for yen. Because playing pachinko for money is illegal, the staff at the parlor won't tell you where to look. However, you can ask another friendly pachinko player where to go.Once there, you won't find people to convert your tokens. Rather, you'll find a drawer. You'll be able to pick it out because it usually has Astroturf.
You place your tokens in, and the drawer is drawn in. In return, it comes out with your yen, and you leave.
Often, the tuck shop is a small shed located near the pachinko parlor. Sometimes, in place of a drawer, you will find hole in the shed’s wall where you retrieve the money."

Shuffle and deal a deck of 52 cards.,
Determine who should go first.,
Continue putting down the cards clockwise in consecutive ascending order.,
Call ""bullshit"" on anyone who you think is lying.,
Continue play after ""bullshit"" has been called.,
Win the game by playing all of the cards in your hand.",How to Play Bullshit2," These should be evenly distributed amongst the players. To keep the game from getting too complicated or lengthy, you should probably keep it from 3 to 6 players, though you can play the game with 2 to 10 players. Some of the players may end up with one more or fewer cards than the rest of the players, but that won't affect the outcome of the game in the long run. Before you begin, remember that the object is to get rid of all of your cards first., It can be the dealer, the person with the ace of spades, the two of clubs, or whoever has the most cards (if the distribution wasn't quite even). This person lays a card (or several) down on the table and tells the other players the type of card they just used. The person who goes first should always start by laying down an ace or a two., For example, if the first player put down one or more aces, the next player should put down one or more twos, the third should put down three or more twos, and so on. When it's your turn and you put down your cards, you have to say, ""One ace,"" ""two twos,"" or ""three kings,"" and so on. You may not actually have the cards that you need to put down -- the fun is in faking it.If you don't have any of the required cards, you can skip your turn though, it's better not to pretend to put down 3 of them -- and definitely not four. If you say you've put down 3 of a card you don't have, it's likely that a player will have at least 2 of the card and will know you're lying and will call ""bullshit!""
You can also play dumb. Let's say it's your turn to put down queens, and you happen to have two of them. Say, ""What am I again?"" and look confused as you look through your cards before you put them down. Your goal is to make people believe you when you're lying, and make them doubt you when you're telling the truth.

, If you know someone is lying because you have the cards they claim to have in your hand, because they're getting low on cards, or just because you have a feeling they're not telling the truth, then call ""bullshit!"" after the person puts down his cards and announces what they are. This entails an accusation and reveal, in which the person who just played is required to turn over the cards they just put and show everyone else what they actually are.


If the cards aren't what the player said they were and the person who called ""bullshit"" was right, the lying player takes all the cards from the pile and adds them to their hand.
If the cards are what the player said they were and the accuser turns out to be wrong, all of the cards in the pile go into the hand of the accuser. If two or more people call out the player in question and they are wrong, the pile is divided amongst all the accusers.

, After ""bullshit"" has been called, another round starts with the last person to play. As the game progresses, it will become more difficult to get away with lying during a round, especially if the amount of cards you have keeps decreasing. In the end, it will come down to luck and how good your poker face is--just try not to make any moves that are too risky, and don't call ""bullshit"" unless you're fairly certain the person playing has indeed lied about their cards.

, Once one person has played all the cards in their hand, they are the winner. Of course, most people would call ""bullshit"" on the last play of the game, but you can get around this by making your final play very subtly and quickly, or by calling ""bullshit"" on the person right before you in hopes of starting the next round. Bullshit really is all about strategy, and the more you play it, the better you'll get.


After one player wins, you can continue playing until there are two or three people left if that's how you decide to play.
If you only have one card left, don't announce it in advance or let people know that you're about to win.
You can also take the bold strategy -- if you only have one card left, you can pretend to count off and say, ""Oh, perfect! I only have one three!"" Though this is more likely to fail than not, you can have fun trying to trick your teammates.

"
"
Play with two or more packs shuffled together.,
Change the sequence of ranks.,
Allow players to put down more cards than they said they had.,
Allow players to put cards down when it is not their turns, but not the most recent player.,
Allow people with all four cards of the same rank to discard them off to the side, when its their turn, face up, telling everyone what rank it is.",How to Play Bullshit3," This is ideal if you're playing with five or more people. It'll make the game last longer and it will be harder to tell who is actually bluffing., Instead of playing the cards in ascending order of rank, play in descending order of rank. Start with twos, and then move back to aces, then kings, then queens, and so on. You can also play by going with the next highest or the next lowest rank of the person who went before you. So, if that person puts down a nine, you can put down a ten or an eight.You can also allow the next player to put down the same card as the player before him or her, or the card below or above that card in rank. This will make it easier for each player to actually put down a card he or she has.

, This rule should be decided before the game starts to avoid any accusations of cheating. If this rule is in effect, a player can say he's putting down three cards, for example, while sneaking in a fourth card. You can still call ""bullshit"" on this player to check if he actually put down the correct amount of cards; if he lied, then he'll have to take the pile., Follow all of the same rules, but anyone can go at any time if the player who should go takes too long.

, This helps make a shorter game. If you have for say, 3 nines, try to call BS when someone puts down the nine, hopefully it has a nine, then you can discard the nines. This is great especially if the pile has 3 cards, excluding the nine. Then, the number of cards in you hand goes down. Once the rank is put discarded, skip it next time. So if you or someone else discarded nines, it will go 7,8,10,etc, as long as those ranks are still in the game.

With more than two players, throw the ball across the circle, at random. For younger kids, throw the ball around the circle to make sure they know when they'll receive the ball.

, Whoever has the ball at the end of the chant has to do a dare. Whoever gave the loser the ball is the one in charge of assigning it.

, When the loser carries out the dare, keep playing!

Deal the cards.,
Make bids and award the contract.,
Begin the first trick.,
Finish the trick and start the next one.,
End the deal.,
Start the next deal.",How to Play Bridge2," The dealer distributes 13 cards to each player, so that the entire deck is used. Give players time to sort their cards by rank and suit. Aces are high in bridge, followed by kings, queens, jacks/knaves, tens, and finally spot (number) cards from 9 to 2.


The more cards in a suit you have, and the higher the value of those cards, the better luck you are likely to have with them. Keep this in mind as bidding begins.

, Teams bid numbers and suits, which represent the number of tricks they believe they can win on the deal if the suit attached to that number becomes the trump suit (the suit of cards that will be more valuable than the other 3 suits during tricks). Whoever deals will get to bid first, and bidding rotates clockwise from the dealer around the table, continuing for as many rounds as is necessary to settle on a final bid. Whichever team ends up bidding the highest number wins the right to name the trump suit. There are many rules and special terms governing the bidding phase; this guide will cover the basics required to play a friendly game.


A minimum of 7 tricks are required to win each deal. (This is because there are 13 tricks per deal, and a majority must be won to win the deal.) Bridge players therefore traditionally count bids starting from the seventh trick, referring to the first 6 tricks collectively as “the book.” If your team wants to bid 7 tricks (saying that you expect to win 7 of the 13 tricks for the current deal), you would announce a bid of 1, and so on up to a bid of 7 for winning all 13 tricks.

You can remember this easily by adding 6 to whatever number is bid to get the actual number of tricks that must be won to “make” (complete) the contract. You can't ever bid to win less than 7 tricks (a bid of 1).


Suits are important during bidding. The power of the suit you bid will determine how many other cards will be able to outbid it. The suits are ranked from most powerful to least powerful as follows: spades, then hearts (these are known as the “major” suits), then diamonds, and finally clubs (the “minor” suits).

Each new bid must be more “valuable” than the last bid before it, so if the person before you bid 1 in hearts, you must either bid 1 in spades or 2 (or more) in any other suit to beat it.
It is often advisable to bid on the most common suit in your hand, even if it is relatively weak. For example, if your hand has six cards with the diamond suit, you might lean towards bidding for diamonds to become the trump suit. Pay attention to the bids your partner makes to get an idea of what he or she is holding as well.
No trump bids: In addition to bidding for a trump suit, you can declare a bid of “no trump” (sometimes condensed as “notrump,” and abbreviated NT), which indicates you are only bidding a number, not a suit. If you win a no trump bid, tricks are played without a trump suit, meaning only the highest ranked card in each trick can win it. This is riskier than naming a trump suit, but making (completing) a no trump contract will score your team more points than a regular contract.

For bidding purposes, NT is considered the highest “suit;” therefore, the highest possible bid is 7NT.




Beware of overreaching on your bid. If your team wins a bid and is subsequently unable to make that number of tricks by the end of the deal, you must pay the opposing team a number of points from your own total, which can quickly change the balance of power.
You do not have to bid. You can pass a bid to the next person instead. If three players pass in a row, the last bid wins the contract and determines the trump suit; if all four players pass without any bids at all, the deck is reshuffled and the hands dealt out a second time.
There are special terms for each player once a contract has been awarded. The person who made the winning bid is called the “declarer,” and his partner is called the “dummy.” The other team are collectively called the “defenders.” Knowing these terms makes it easier to keep track of the flow of the game.

, Now that a trump suit (or a bid of no trump) has been established for the deal, the tricks begin. Play begins with the defender to the left of the declarer. The defender “leads” the trick by placing a card face up on the table. The suit of this card is the suit for the trick, which means that players can only win the trick with a card of that suit, or a trump suit card.


The other two suits don't count during this trick.
Once the trick has been led, the dummy spreads his or her entire hand out on the table, usually in four columns organized by suit. The dummy's hand is played by the declarer for the rest of the deal. Defenders play normally.

The dummy has an unusual role. The dummy cannot comment on the strategic decisions of the declarer, but is allowed to point out when the declarer would accidentally violate a rule of the game. Otherwise, he or she leaves the decisions to the declarer for the duration of the deal.


Lead suit cards must be played if possible. For example, if the suit of the lead card is clubs, and you have a club in your hand, you must play it rather than any other card. If you don't have any cards in the leading suit, you may “ruff” (play a trump suit card, assuming it is different from the lead suit) or “sluff” (play a card from one of the two remaining suits).

A ruff is likely to win the trick, as any card from a trump suit beats every card of every other suit.
A sluff is functionally the same as a pass, and cannot ever win the trick.



, After the opening lead, the declarer plays a card from the dummy's hand. The second defender plays a card after that, and finally the declarer plays a card. Once all four cards have been played, the most valuable card wins the trick, and whoever played that card keeps all four cards in the trick for scoring later.


Whoever wins a trick leads the next trick. There is no set leading pattern after the first trick.

, When all 13 tricks have been played, add up the number of tricks each team won. If the declaring team made the contract, they win the deal; otherwise, the defending team wins the deal. Award points based on your chosen system. Extra points should be awarded for making a no trump contract.

, Put the cards back together in a deck and deal out 13 cards to each player once more. This is the second deal. Deals continue in the pattern outlined above until one team earns enough points to win the game.


To play a relatively quick game, play until one team has won a specified number of deals (for instance, 2 out of 3) instead of counting points.

"
Each player is dealt a hand of cards to start (the exact hand size varies with expansion set and number of players; in the base version it is five cards).,
Players take turns in order.,
Each player also has a trading area.,
When the deck runs out, the discard pile is reshuffled into it; this happens twice.,
During their turn, each player does the following:


1.",How to Play Bohnanza," Cards in hand must be kept in the order in which they are dealt at all times.;
, Each player starts with two invisible fields in which to plant beans. A third field may be bought by any player at any point during the game for three coins. No player may have more than three fields. Each field may contain any number of bean cards, of any one bean type. If a bean of a type different from those already growing in a field is planted into that field, the beans previously in it get harvested for coins. A field containing just one bean may not be harvested by a player who also owns a field containing more than one bean.

, Cards in the hand are kept hidden. Cards in the trading areas and fields are visible to all players. The number of cards in each treasury is secret, although its presence need not be. The discard pile is face up, but only the top card is visible (the rest being underneath it) and players may not examine the pile.

, The game-play ends instantly the third time the deck runs out.

, They must play the first card in their hand (the one at the front; i.e., the one dealt to them earliest) into a field. This may result in them having to harvest beans!
2. They may play the next card in their hand into a field.
3. They must take the top two cards from the deck and place them face up into their trading area.
4. Trading opens. Players may make offers and trade cards from (and only from) their hands (but they may offer/trade any card(s) in their hands in any order) and the cards in the active player's trading area. Traded cards go into the recipient's trading area. Trade may only occur with the player whose turn it is. No cards may ever be traded from fields. No cards can ever get placed into a player's hand by trading. No cards that have been traded once may be traded again - once a bean has been traded it must be planted in the field of the person it has been traded with.
5. Trading ends whenever the player whose turn it is decides it should. At end of trading, each player must plant all cards in their trading area into their fields. This may involve harvesting beans, possibly several times; take note of the order in which beans are planted into fields if there are more types of beans being planted than fields they are being planted into.
6. The player ends their turn by drawing cards from the deck, one by one, and placing them at the back of their hand (so they get played last). Again, the exact number of cards drawn here varies. If players started with a hand of five, three cards are drawn in this stage.

Have players sit in a circle.,
Shuffle and evenly distribute the cards.,
Pick one player to go first.,
Continue play clockwise.,
Call ""Bluff"" when one desires.,
Play until a player runs out of cards.",How to Play Bluff1," This version can be played with three to ten people, and requires one standard 52 card deck. Remove the jokers from the deck. Place the ace of spades face up in the middle of the circle so that all players can reach it.;
, It's okay if it's not exact, but the players' hands shouldn't differ by more than one card. Players may look at their hands, but must keep them private. The cards should be kept visible at all times.

, He/she must find any 2s he/she has and place them on top of the ace face down and say, ""one 2"" or ""three 2s"" etc. However, if s/he doesn't have any 2s, s/he must pick one or multiple cards and bluff. Play goes clockwise.


You can bluff with as many as four cards, but the fewer cards you play when bluffing, the more believable the bluff will be, as it would be unlikely to have all four 2s in your hand. Bluffing with a number of cards higher than one is riskier, but the payoff is greater because you get rid of more cards.

, The next player must put down all his/her 3s, the next player 4s, and so on. After Kings, the play goes back to Aces. As with the first turn, if at any time a player doesn't have any cards of the next rank, he/she must bluff, and risk having to pick up the whole pile. There is no pass option.

, If at any point in the game a player thinks another is bluffing, he/she can say ""Bluff!"" right after the cards are set down. If the challenged cards were not what the player said they were, the player who bluffed must take all the cards from the pile. However, if the player didn't bluff, the challenger must take all of the cards from the pile.]


After the challenge is settled, the next player takes his/her turn with the next rank of cards.

, This ends the game, and that player has won."
"
Get some chips at the table.,
Be an active and orderly participant.,
Roll the dice.,
Play conservatively.,
Know your odds.",How to Play Craps3," Don't try to hand cash to the dealer; all you need to do is the place some money on the layout (before the shooter has the dice) and ask the dealer for ""change only."" The dealer actually isn't allowed to take anything from your hand.


You can tip the dealer, but do so in chips as well.

, While craps is very much so a game of camaraderie and group mentality, there's a definite etiquette that a non-shooter must abide by. When you're not rolling, keep a few things in mind. And when you are, the same goes.


You may make (Don't) Pass bets, the odds bets backing them, Field, and (Don't) Come bets yourself. All you need to do is place your chips on the table in the appropriate, marked place. On all other bets, place your chips on the table ask the dealer to make the bet. Once you've completed this, take your hands out of the table area. Craps moves very quickly -- you don't want to become an interference.

Store your chips in the rail in front of you -- that's its purpose. Put them right in front of you and keep an eye on them at all times. Though craps is about solidarity, that doesn't keep the occasional player from snagging a chip or two.


In general, cheer on the side of the shooter. Root for the point to come up as quickly as possible. If you're betting with the shooter, be as loud as you like. It's pretty common for the entire casino to hear the roars of the craps table. However, if you've opted for the ""Don't Pass"" option, keep your excitement to yourself. You wouldn't like it if someone were rooting against you, would you? If you do, you'll not feel very welcome (or be welcome) at the table.
If you're shooting, fling the dice to the opposite end of the table. And don't skip them along the sides -- the guys working the table want to see the dice in the air.

, In truth, you could play craps all your life and never have to roll the dice. Players take turns being the ""shooter,"" and you can pass when it's your turn. Craps is a dice game, so you should probably at least learn how to roll in case you feel lucky. Generally when it's your turn, the stickman will present you with five dice. You then choose two to throw, and the stickman takes the others back.


Always handle the dice with only one hand. This is a must-know rule to prevent cheating. When it's your turn to roll the dice, you must roll them so that they cross the table, hit the opposite wall, and bounce off the wall.
If either dice goes off the table or fails to go far enough, you'll need to roll again. The craps table is fairly large, so you actually need to toss the dice rather than simply rolling them as you would for a board game.

, These are the most basic bets of craps. You can also bet on single numbers or single rolls, and you can even bet on certain more complex ""propositions."" To begin, however, you should learn the basics and get comfortable playing craps. It can be a very fast-paced game, so you want to be able to master the simpler bets so that you don't have to think about them. Once you've done so, do some research on the odds of other bets and learn more about betting strategies.


Playing only these simple bets will give you better odds than just about anywhere in the casino, but you can win more by playing riskier bets. You can also lose more, and quickly, so you'll need a hefty bankroll if you plan on doing anything more complex.

, Just as with every game in a casino, the house would have the edge. 7 is the number most likely to come up with a pair of dice -- and the house practically owns it. Know what you're getting into when you make your bets.


The house has only a 1.41 percent (7/484) edge on a Pass bet and 1.36 percent on Don't Pass.Most players bet the Pass line, in part because it builds camaraderie and solidarity, and in part because the house edge is low. They are called ""right bettors,""; those who bet against the shooter are called ""wrong bettors,"" unsurprisingly enough.
Don't Pass/Don't Come bettors may lay odds even when the point has already been established, which results in the same odds the house gives a Pass/Come bettor on an odds bet. For example, if the point is 4 or 10, a bettor with $5 on the Don't Pass line can bet another $10 to win $5 if a 7 is rolled before the point (2:1 odds). It's not that great of a deal, sure, but remember that once a point is established, Don't Come bettors will win more often than they lose. And points happen 2/3 of the time. Don't Come bettors who lay odds also lower the house edge to .7 percent with single odds and .5 percent with double odds.A bet on any craps (a proposition bet), for example, wins if the next roll is 2, 3, or 12; it loses if any other number is rolled. House percentages are huge on this type of bet: 1/6 bet on any 7, 13.9 percent on 2, 13.9 percent on 12, 1/9 bet on 3, 1/9 bet on any craps, 1/6 bet on 2 or 12, 1/6 bet on 3 or 11, 1/9 bet on 11.If it wasn't clear already, only do this if you're looking for a quick way to lose money.

Grab a deck of playing cards.,
Shuffle the deck.. Like poker, big two is a game which draws its chance from the random-ness of deck shuffling and dealing.,
Decide who is dealt to first.,
Deal the cards.,
Begin the game by playing the three of diamonds.,
Play the three of diamonds in a pair or triple.,
Play the three of diamonds in a group of five.,
Continue play until everybody passes.,
Begin a new round.,
Score the remaining players.",How to Play Big Two," Part of big two’s popularity is that it is one of many games that can be played using a traditional 4-suit, 54-card (including jokers) deck. You probably already have one in your home that you’ve used in the past; grab it to get started.If you need to buy one, the size/design won’t make any difference, just be sure it has 4 full suits of clubs, diamonds, spades, and hearts.;
, You’ll want to be very thorough in shuffling (first remove the two jokers), especially if your deck of cards is a recent purchase. Once you’re done shuffling, “cut” the deck (remove any number of cards from the top in a single pile) and place the cut pile to the side.


Once this is complete, pick one player amongst yourselves to be the dealer. The dealer receives no special advantages in gameplay, so it is more or less an arbitrary choice.

, Before dealing out cards, you’ll need to decide to whom to deal to first. In big two this is determined by the cut pile just made. Look at the bottom card of the cut pile for its rank, from ace to king (then replace the pile on top of the deck). Going counterclockwise and starting with ace as 1, count players until you reach the rank of the card at the bottom of the cut pile. This player will begin the game.Provided you’re playing with four people, certain ranks match with players in the counterclockwise order, such that you don’t need to count it out.

If the card was an ace, a five, or a nine, the dealer will be dealt to first.
If the card was a two, a six, or a ten, the player to the right of the dealer will be dealt to first.
If the card was a three, a seven, or a jack, the player sitting opposite the dealer will be dealt to first.
If the card was a four, an eight, or a queen, the player to the left of the dealer will be dealt to first.



, Starting with the player just determined, have the dealer deal thirteen cards (counterclockwise), one at a time, to every player. These thirteen cards will comprise the player’s starting hand, with the goal being to play every card you’ve been dealt. Whoever is dealt the three of diamonds begins the game as first player.If you’re playing with three players, deal each player seventeen cards and place the last card, face up, on the table. The player with the three of diamonds takes this card into their hand, unless the card itself is the three of diamonds in which case the player with the three of spades take the card.

, In the rules of big two, the three of diamonds is the lowest ranked card, so it must be placed first either by itself or in some combination. The rules of big two revolve around the game’s own ranking of the cards and suits. The gameplay is essentially successive players placing increasingly ranked cards until no longer able.The namesake of the game comes from it’s ranking of the game’s cards (from high to low): 2, Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 to 3. The suits are ranked (from high to low): spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds.
There are four combinations in which cards can be played: single cards, pairs of cards, triples, and five card groups.

, If the player with the three of diamonds has another three in their hand, or two threes, they might consider playing the card in a double or triple. The advantage to this is that it forces the remaining players to also play a double or triple, potentially damaging their ability to get cards out of their hand.


When playing a pair of cards, they must be of equal rank (ex. two nines or two jacks). Triples work in the same way.
Higher suits will determine rank among equal pairs (ex. a nine of spades and of diamonds beats a nine of hearts and of clubs, because the spade is higher).

, For groups of five cards, there are five different ways to play them, many of the combinations similar to ones in poker. Naturally, five card groups are considered the most valuable because they are the most difficult to match and outrank. The groups are listed here in rank from lowest to highest:


You can play a straight, which is five cards of successive rank using any suits (ex. six of hearts, seven of diamonds, eight of hearts, nine of clubs, and ten of spades). When ranks are identical, the suit of the highest ranked card determines supremacy.
Four of a kinds are also possible, and you include any other card to make a combination of five. The four must be of the same rank (ex. all 4 sevens, and a three of spades). Choosing between two four of a kinds, the rank of the four cards decides supremacy.
You can play a flush, which is a five card combination of any cards of the same suit (ex. nine of hearts, seven of hearts, six of hearts, ten of hearts, and three of hearts). Higher suits beat lower suits, irrespective of the ranks. Between identical suits, highest card determines supremacy.
The next five card combination is a full house, which is essentially a pair and a triple. Three cards of one rank and two of another (ex. 3 fours and 2 sevens, of any suit). Deciding between two full houses, supremacy goes to the one whose triple is of a higher rank.
Straight flushes are also possible as five successive cards of the same suit (with twos in this case ranking below threes, with aces able to be high or low)--an example would be an eight of spades, a nine of spades, a ten of spades, a jack of spades, and a queen of spades. Between equal ranked flushes, suit determines which is higher.

, The rules of big two require you to place increasingly higher-ranked cards, and always of whatever number combination the round began with. For example, if the first player (with the three of diamonds) plays it in a triple each successive player must play a triple of higher rank.


Note, you are never obligated to play cards. If you believe it’s advantageous to hold on to your cards, you can pass at will.
A five card group can be surpassed by a five card group of another, stronger type. They are listed in ascending order above (ex. a straight flush can beat any five card combination).
When you are unable to play a higher card or combination of cards, you must pass.
Once everyone save one player has passed, a new round will begin.

, To start again, take the previous round’s pile of cards and set them aside. The player who did not pass (who played highest) will play first by playing any single card or combination of cards. As with previous rounds, succeeding players may only play higher rank card combinations of the same number (or singles if a single card).The game will continue in this way until one person has played their last card. Once a player has emptied their hand of cards, they are automatically determined the winner.

, Traditionally, big two will include scoring to determine who is second, third, and last. This takes the form of penalty points counted up, determined by the number of cards left in hand. The player with the lowest number of the points will be second, the next lowest, third; and the player with most will be last.


For those with nine cards or less in their hand, they will count one point per card.
For those with ten, eleven, or twelve cards in their hard, they will count two points per card.
For those with all cards still in their hand, their score will automatically be 39 (3 points per card).

Play often.,
Learn to read your partner.,
Try card scoring to determine hand strength.,
Keep your strategy simple at first.,
Work with your dummy's hand to make contracts.",How to Play Bridge3," There is always more to learn about bridge strategy. The best way to improve your game is to practice by playing a lot. Books and guides can help a lot, but at the end of the day, developing a sense of when to do what is a matter of gaining experience with the game.

, You can't directly communicate with your partner during bidding, but there are ways for you and your partner to send each other cues about what each of you would like out of a contract. The opening round of bids is often used to tell your partner what your strongest suit is, rather than actually make a serious bid.


Your partner can support your bid by bidding a higher number in the same suit as your bid (signaling that he or she is also happy with the suit), or suggest a different approach by bidding a different suit.
No trump bids often indicate that a person has a hand full of face cards and aces that are likely to win a lot of tricks based solely on rank.

, If you're having trouble estimating the strength of your hand, there is a commonly used way to score the cards in your hand in order to assess it more accurately. In this system, the deck has a total of 40 points.


The points are assigned as follows:

Aces are worth 4 points.
Kings are worth 3 points.
Queens are worth 2 points.
Jacks/knaves are worth 1 point.


If your hand has 12 or 13 points or more, it is probably a very strong hand.
With practice, this system can help you decide where to place your opening bids to guide the final bid to an advantageous result.

, Two of the four cardinal ways to win a trick are easy enough to understand that you can adopt them into your strategy right away. (The other two methods are more complicated, and rely on indirectly controlling the way your opponents play their hands by keeping track of the cards they have already played and are likely to play in the future.) By anticipating which of these two techniques to use at what time, you can improve your chances of making the contract (or successfully defending against it). The two methods are:


Playing the highest card in the trick.
Beating an opponent's high card with a trump card.

, When you lead a trick as the declarer, if you and your dummy control the highest cards in the trump suit between your two hands, you can be sure that each trick leading from that suit will be yours. These are called sure tricks, and they are a good simple way to up your trick count. Lead with a card in your sure suit, and then play the next highest card from the dummy's hand to lock in the victory.


Since you won the trick, you will lead the next trick as well. Repeat the pattern until you have played out all your sure tricks.
Remember, you only need to make your contract to win the deal. Get as many sure tricks as you can to easily boost your total.

, It's okay if it's not exact, but the players' hands shouldn't differ by more than one card. Players may look at their hands, but must keep them private. The cards should be kept visible at all times.

, This player must place a single card in the middle of the circle, face down. He/she should announce the rank of the card, whether it's a queen, or a 2, etc. If he/she chooses, he/she can play a card that doesn't match the rank announced.

, Play goes clockwise. The next player has two choices. He/she can pass the turn without playing a card, or play a single card facedown on the pile. By playing a card, he/she is claiming that it is of the same rank as the first card, but it may or may not be.


Passing is the safer option if a player doesn't have any cards that match the round's rank, but bluffing will get rid of his/her cards faster.
You can bluff even if you have a card of the round's rank. This could be a risky but effective strategy if, for instance, you have multiple cards of the round's rank. The other players will have no reason to suspect you don't, especially early in the round, and they will be less likely to call bluff. You can then on later turns use the actual cards that match the rank, which players will be more likely to incorrectly call bluff on.

, If at any point in the game a player thinks another is bluffing, he/she can say ""Bluff!"" right after the card is set down. The challenged player now turns over the challenged card.

Try “2-For-1 Apples.” To up the stakes of the game and keep things interesting, make each round count double.",How to Play Apples to Apples," Get together a group of your friends to play the game. Players should gather around a table or arrange themselves in a circle on the floor. Apples To Apples works best with 4-10 players, but some versions can be played with more. The fewer players there are, the faster paced the game will be, which can increase the hilarity.A deluxe “Party” version of Apples To Apples can be played by 12 or more people., Start by thoroughly shuffling both the red and green decks of cards to make sure that they are drawn in random order. Cards from each deck will be used during every individual round of play. Keep the decks separated—red cards should never be mixed with green cards within a deck.Always make sure to shuffle after the conclusion of a game so that the same cards aren’t dealt and played in the next game.

, Decide among your friends who will serve as the judge for the first round of gameplay. The judge is responsible for deciding who has the best match, and therefore who wins each round. Each player has a chance to be the judge, as the position is handed off to the player on the left after each consecutive round.Judges may pick the winning red card for any reason. One judge might choose the strongest direct match, such as a red card reading “Scissors” for a green card reading “Sharp,” while another will favor ironic or humorous associations. These types of differences are what makes the game exciting!
Everyone will take multiple turns as the judge, so it doesn’t much matter who starts the game off.

, The judge will also act as the dealer. Whoever your group chooses to be the judge of the first round will deal seven red cards to each player around the table. You will replenish your red cards after every round, meaning that each player should always have seven red cards at the start of a new round. When each player has seven red cards in their hand, the game is ready to begin.Keep an eye on your red cards to make sure you have seven at at all times. Otherwise, you may be limiting your playable options.

, The judge should flip over the card at the top of the green deck and call it out to the group. Green cards bear descriptive terms that must be matched by the people, objects, places or events on the players’ red cards. The green card in play might read “Cute,” “Harmful” or “Patriotic.” These terms are designed to describe the red cards laid down by players each round.There are over 749 red cards and nearly 249 green cards in the basic version of the game. That’s enough different matches for hours and hours of fun.

, Players will now select one of their seven red cards to associate with the word on the green card. For example, a player might play a red card reading “Babies” to match a green card reading “Cute.” There are nearly endless possible combinations of red and green cards, so get creative!Each player should choose a red card to play quickly to keep the game moving at a brisk pace. Cards should be played face down beside the green card.
The judge is the only player who will not lay down a red card. The judge changes every round, giving everyone an equal chance to play.

, After every player has laid down a red card, the judge should shuffle or mix up the stack of red cards in play. This will ensure that the judge doesn’t know who played each card. The cards should be left face down as they are rearranged.There’s no need to shuffle extensively. Just reorganize the red cards until they’re out of the order in which they were laid down.

, Now the judge will turn over and look at each card. Whichever card the judge decides is the best match for the green card wins. The winning player will identify themselves and collect the green card from the round. The player to the left of the first round judge will become the new judge, players will take one card from the red deck to replenish their hand and the game will continue.The number of green cards accumulated by the end of the game determines the winner. The official Apples To Apples rule guide suggests 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 green cards be the winning number for games with 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 players, respectively.After the round-winning card is chosen, all red cards that have been played should be returned to the bottom of the red deck.

, The game’s official rules recommend that players compete for a certain number of green cards in order to win. However, you can modify this number as you see fit. For instance, you might play for 10 green cards to keep the game going longer, or take a “sudden death” approach and see who can win 3 cards the fastest. The options are totally customizable, depending only on the number of players in your group and how you’d like the game to proceed.You might also elect for players to replace their red cards with green cards for a winning outcome. For this to work, a player will add the green cards they’ve won to their deck after each round, meaning they’ll have fewer red cards to choose from. Once a player reaches seven green cards in their deck, they are declared the winner.

, Rather than finding the strongest match for each card, switch gears and play the “Crab Apple” version of the game. This requires players to play red cards that are the opposite of the green card in play. If the green card reads “Scary,” players might try to win the round with cards like “Kitten” or “Love.” Choose carefully—coming up with the right combination of cards might be trickier than you expect!Playing Crab Apple effectively doubles the number of possible card associations.
Variant versions of Apples To Apples force you to think more carefully about your card choices, breaking up the monotony of the standard games.

, The judge chooses the best match as usual, but the player gives up control over their card associations and the outcomes are random. Apple Potpourri can be especially fun in large groups, as there will be more options for the judge to choose from.Apple Potpourri is a perfect alternative for groups where the judges tend to choose the most entertaining card combinations.

, The judge will turn over two green cards instead of just one, and players will have to choose a red card that is best described by both of the terms on the green cards. This variation of the game forces players to think more carefully about each pay, as red cards has to be associated with two different terms, and rounds are worth two green cards.For the 2-For-1 Apples version of the game, you can decide whether the same number of cards is necessary to win, resulting in a quicker paced game, or whether to also double the number of green cards needed and only increase the difficulty of each round.

'Diamond'♦ is higher than 'Spade'.
'Hearts'♥ is higher than 'Diamond'.
Spades'♠ is the highest of all colours.
After that comes 'Not Trump'.
The highest possible bid is 'All Trump'.
There is the option to 'Double'. This way you're saying you intend to beat your opponent at his own bid. The results in the end are doubled.
The other option is 'Re-Double', which can only be said if there has been a 'Double'. The results in the end are re-doubled (multiplied by 4).

,


When you're playing a colour as a trump (e.g a player has bid 'Hearts'), then the Hearts' strength is as follows (from strongest to weakest):

Jack, Nine, Ace, Ten, King, Queen, Eight, Seven.
The other cards are like that:
Ace, Ten, King, Queen, Jack, Nine, Eight, Seven.


In that case, 'Hearts' is the strongest colour and beats all other.
When you're playing a game of 'All Trumps', all colours are equally strong, none beats the other. Cards are again Jack, Nine, Ace, Ten, King, Queen, Eight, Seven.
When you're playing a game of 'Not Trump', all colours are again equal, but the strength of cards is Ace, Ten, King, Queen, Jack, Nine, Eight, Seven.
Whatever game you're playing, remember that you always have to answer the colour wanted, if you have it. Hearts on the table means you have to give hearts, as well. If you don't have that colour, you can give whatever you want. In a game of colour, when you don't have the wanted colour, you need to use a trump (the colour that was bid) in order to get the hand.
When a trump card has been played, you must overtrump it, if you have a higher-ranked card. For example, the player before you gives a Ten of the trumps. Then you must play a higher-ranked card, such as Ace, Nine or Jack.

In a game of 'No Trump', you can try 'going low'. In other words, you need not give a higher-ranked card, if you don't want to. E.g. The player before you gives a Queen of Spades. If you are uncertain who will win that hand, and you have a Ten and a Nine, you could give the Nine. That's 'going low'.


,


Declarations must be announced during the first round of the current game.
They are:

A sequence of three. Cards can be any part of this order: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7. This is worth 20 points.
A sequence of four. It is worth 50 points.
A sequence of five. It's worth 100 points.
Longer sequences don't count. A sequence of eight is called one sequence of five and one of three.
Four Nines. This is worth 150 points.
Four Jacks. This is the highest declaration. It's worth 200 points.
Four of A, K, Q or 10 is worth 100 points. Sevens and Eights are not awarded.
A belote is the combination of a King and a Queen of the same colour. It must be a trump colour. A belote is worth 20 points.


In a 'Not Trump' game, declarations are not allowed and don't count.

, Each card has its own scoring value. Only Jacks and Nines change theirs depending on the game.


Aces are worth 11 points. Tens are worth 10 points. Kings are worth 4 points. Queens are worth 3 points. In a game of 'Not trump' and if not a trump colour, Jacks are worth 2 points and Nines are worth 0 points. Eights and Sevens are always 0 points.
In a game of 'All trumps', Jacks are worth 20 points and Nines are worth 14 points.
The winner of the last round gets an additional 10 points. Declarations are also added to the score.
When the team who bid the game do not have enough points, they are considered 'inside' or 'committed'.This means all points go for their opposition.
When a team is kaput (has no hands won), the other team wins additional 90 points.
The whole score for a game of 'All trumps' is 258 (26) and for a game of 'Not trump' it's 162 (16). When a team has half or more, they win the current game. The score is then added to the global scoring sheet.

, A score is always rounded.


If the score is below the limit (half of the required to win), then it's rounded to the lower number. For example,35 points in a game of 'Not trump' are rounded to 3,not 4.
If the score is above the limit, then it's rounded to the higher value. E.g. 135 points in a game of 'Not trump' is rounded to 14 and it's enough to win the current game or make the declarer be 'inside'.

If both teams have the same amount of points when rounded, the one with more points when not rounded wins. For example, team one has 13 points and team two has 13 points, then whoever has more points when not rounded, will win the round.


,


The players from the same team must sit opposite each other.
One player splits the deck and gives it to the next player.
Cards are dealt. Players then bid and the rest of the cards are dealt.
Players take their turns anti-clockwise. First to play is the player after the dealer.
When the current game ends, scores are written in the global score sheet.
The first team to reach 151 points is the winner.

, In BANG, “distance’ is defined as how many spaces away from other players a player is. Distance can be modified by Blue Bordered playing cards., A player can only have as many cards in their hand as life points they possess. For example, if a player has two life points, they can only have two cards in their hand at the end of their turn., To determine what each card does, use the ""Symbols Key"" card. Each card will:

give the player an ability
initiate a response from other players

, These cards contain the roles players are assigned in the game.

, These cards make up most of the cards included in your deck and are identified as cards with a brown, blue, or green border and the “BANG!” logo on the back of the card. These cards include at least one symbol that determines what the card can do and its equivalent Standard Playing Card value.


Brown Bordered cards are played once and then discarded into the discard pile.
Blue Bordered cards are played in front of the players. The effects of these cards last until they are discarded or removed, or until the special event described by the card comes true.
Green Bordered cards are played in front of a player just like blue bordered cards. However, players must wait one turn before using these cards.

, Certain Playing Cards are conditional. These conditional cards are identified as any Playing Card with a card symbol that includes a suit symbol from a normal deck of cards inside it.

For example, a “Barrel” is conditional because it includes a card symbol with a suit symbol inside it (seen as a heart in a rectangle). This card is conditional and only counts as a ""miss"" card if a heart is drawn.

, These cards are identified as green bordered cards with yellow bullet symbols on the upper right hand side of the card and images of bullets on the back of the card. These cards provide players with special abilities which are listed at the bottom of the card. The bullets on the front are the maximum lives the player can have using the character., These cards provide special rules that must be followed in a round and are identified as cards with black backs. It is not mandatory to use Round Rule Cards.

,,,, The player with the Sheriff role reveals his card by flipping it so its faced up. This player is the Sheriff. All other players keep their role cards faced down. It is important all role identities besides the Sheriff are kept secret., Each player will pick one character card which will become the player’s character. The other character card will be placed faced down thus displaying 5 bullets to the player., The Sheriff gets one additional life point, with a maximum of 5.

, Then place the rest of the deck in the middle of the circle. This is the draw pile.

For example, the player playing as “Herb Hunter” in the above example gets 4 Playing Cards

, BANG! is a game played in turns, starting with the Sheriff and continuing in a clockwise direction. While following the turn, make sure to abide by the limitations of a turn which are listed in Part 1 ""Important Concepts"" section of these instructions. A turn consists of three phases:


draw 2 cards
play any number of cards
discard excess cards (only if you have more cards than you have lives).

, Starting on the Sheriff’s second turn, the Sheriff draws a Round Rule card at the beginning of his or her turn and reads it. The rules described by this card must be taken into consideration by all players during the round it’s played.

, Any used card is placed in the center faced up. This is the discard pile. If draw pile runs out, shuffle discard pile and create new draw pile.

, If during any time in the game, a player has no life points and no “Beer” cards in their hand, they’re eliminated from the game. The eliminated player reveals their role card to all players. If a player is in possession of a “Beer” card, they may place the card in discard pile and gain one life point.

, If the Sheriff is eliminated, the game is over. If the renegade is the only player left, they win. Otherwise the Outlaws win. If all Outlaws and the Renegade are eliminated, the Sheriff and Deputies win.

Shuffle the deck and deal three cards to each person.,
The bidding begins.,
In bidding, a person determines how much their hand is roughly worth.,
The dealer is not permitted to bid.,
After bidding ceases, the person who holds the highest bid typically chooses a suit to be the trump suit.,
After a trump suit is chosen, the players discard all cards that do not match the trump suit.,
The play goes in a clockwise direction with the person to the left of the bidder leading.,
After everyone has used up all their cards, the players count the number of tricks they have.,
If the person who bid fails to match or exceed the bid they made, then the amount they bid is deducted from their score.,
If a person is at or exceeds 100 points but has not won the game, they are not allowed to add points to their score unless they chose the trump suit and made their bid.

,
The above is repeated, with the person to the right of the previous dealer dealing the new hand.

",How to Play Auction Forty Fives," Then take two cards and set them aside. Then deal two more cards to each person, and set an additional two cards aside with the previous two. Those four cards are referred to as the kitty.;
, People bid depending on how many points they believe they will make. Valid bids include five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-for-sixty (in which, if a person takes every trick, they gain 60 points, but if they fail to take even one trick, they lose 30 points) and sixty-for-one-twenty (in which, if a person takes every trick, they gain 120 points, but if they fail to take even one trick, they lose 60 points.)

, Since the person who holds the bid chooses the trump suit, they would look for several good cards of the same suit. The values of the cards are as follows: Five of trump, jack of trump, ace of hearts, ace of trump, king of trump, queen of trump. Afterwards, the value of the cards is dependent on the colour of the trump suit. If the trump suit is red, then the highest remaining cards are worth the highest. For black trumps, the reverse is true.

, Instead, the dealer must hold a bid if he wishes to match it. By holding, he bids the same amount as the last bid entered. Someone must bid at least five points more in order to surpass the dealers bid. Bidding is also optional. If a person wishes not to bid, they say ""Pass."" They are not permitted to bid again for that hand.

, This is usually the suit that they believe will allow them to take the most tricks. Optionally, a person can choose to go on the kitty. By doing this, they discard their entire hand and decide which suit is the trump based on the cards in the kitty.

, The only exception to this rule is the ace of hearts. (See above.) The person who chose the trump suit then picks up the kitty (if this hasn't already been done) and takes all of the trump suit cards out of it. They discard what is left. If more than five cards remain, then the person who chose the trump suit must discard the lowest card(s) until their hand has no more than five cards in it.

, Whoever plays the highest card gets the trick and then leads for the next trick. All players must follow the suit of the originally played card when possible. Trump cards may be played at any time regardless of which suit lead.

, Each trick is worth five points. If a person has the highest card played during that hand in their tricks, they receive an additional five points.

, Negative scores are allowed in the game.

Experts suggest three players to be the perfect amount, however this number is subjective to your group’s preferences. Some people are all about the competition, while others focus on spending some good time with good friends. ;
, Throw out those jokers and shuffle up the cards.

, Although a table is ideal for card games, all you really need is a comfortable space for people to sit around a central location. Cards will be placed in the center for the whole group to share, so be sure to chose a location where everyone will be able to reach and see these communal cards.

, Hands consist of three cards and totals are determined by adding together cards of the same suit.

, Card game rules can vary from group to group as rules are often spread by word of mouth, so be sure your group agrees. Official 31 rules state that an Ace equals 11 points, while Jacks, Queens and Kings count as 10 and number cards are worth their face value.Cards can only be added together if they are from the same suit. For example, your hand may consist of a 3 of diamonds, an Ace of spades and a King of spades. The hand’s total would equal 21. The 3 of diamonds is not a spade. It cannot be added together with the King and Ace.
Any hand with three-of-a-kind is worth 30 points. This means a hand of three fives, three deuces or three kings are all worth 30 points and automatically trump any other hand of the same suit worth 30 points.

, Each player grabs a section of the deck of cards. Players then reveal the bottom card of their cut. Whoever has the card of the lowest value is the chosen dealer.


Each game, the person to the left of the previous dealer takes over the position.

, Although it is not necessary, some people prefer to play 31 with “lives”, represented by three chips, three pennies or three of any marker the group chooses. At the end of each round, a loser is determined. That loser must place one of their lives in the middle.


After a player looses three lives, they cannot move on to the next round. The game continues until all but one player is eliminated.

, After everyone has received three cards, each player may look at his or her hand. Under no circumstance should a player allow any other player to see their hand.

, Players will be taking and replacing these three cards in turn throughout the game.

, Look at the three cards in your hand and the three cards in the window. Decide which cards, both in your hand and in the window, will push you closer to a hand totaling 31.


Never forget you can only add together cards of the same suit! Keep this in mind while strategizing.

, Although betting is not necessary, it can heighten the stakes. If you chose to bet, every player should place an equal amount of chips into the center before anyone takes a turn.

, This player has the option to exchange one of their own cards for one of the cards in the window. Players can switch out as many cards as they wish as long as it is their turn.

, Players continue to add value to their three-card hands.


Always make sure you have three cards in your hand, no more or no less.

, Try to reach a hand of 31, but also keep an eye on your opponents. Determine if they seem pleased or agitated by gestures, facial expressions and the tones in their voices.


Scoring exactly 31 can be a difficult task. Sometimes a player must decide they are as close as they will get. Use your knowledge of the other players to decide if your hand has a good chance of winning. Perhaps you only have a score of 23, but everyone seems disgruntled and the game has been lagging on. You may be the winner.

, As soon as you have reached as close to 31 as you believe you can, knock on the table. All other players then have one final turn exchanging cards with the window.


If your hand is exactly 31, knock and declare that you have 31. Players do not receive another turn and you show your cards to the group. Everyone else looses and forfeits a life. This can happen at anytime, even after another player has already knocked to begin the final round.

, The player with the cards of the same suit closest to totaling 31 wins the game.


In case of tie, the player with the highest-ranking cards wins. For example the combination Ace, Jack, and 4 equals 25 as does a King, Queen, and 5 combination. However the Ace has a higher rank than the King. The Ace, Jack, 4 hand beats the King, Queen 5 hand. If the tie continues, the second highest cards are compared (Jack and Queen in the case of the previous example), and so on until a winner is determined.

, The player with the lowest total looses and forfeits a life. Once a player looses all three lives they are eliminated from the game and may not move on to the next hand.


In the event that one player knocks but another ends with the highest score in the final round, the knocker looses a life.

, Whether the prize is money, bragging rights, a personal favor or a boost in self-esteem, winning is always fun.


Collect cards, reshuffle, switch dealer to the left and repeat the steps above until all but one have been eliminated.

, The amount of rounds per game will change depending on how many people are playing. More players increase game length as there are more lives to be lost.

Look for two or more cards with the same suit.,
Deal out new cards.,
Move cards onto empty spaces.,
Continue in the same pattern.",How to Play Aces Up2," There's only one way to remove cards from the tableau: by finding two or more cards of the same suit, then removing the lower card. Look for pairs like a 2 of hearts and a 5 of hearts, then remove the 2 of hearts.For another example, with a tableau of (8♣, 9♦, 8♦, 5♥), 8♦ is removed because it is lower than 9♦.
Remember the order of the cards. In this game, aces have the highest value, followed by Kings, Queens and Jacks. After the face cards, the numbered cards have descending value, with two being the smallest card.
Place the removed cards in a new discard pile. You'll want the cards in a separate pile: don't place them at the bottom of the stock like some other card games.

, When you run out of matching suited cards, deal out four more. Lay one on top of each row on the tableau, face up. This will display a whole new set of cards that you can match and remove., If you remove a low card and it leaves an empty space behind, you're allowed to move an empty card onto this space. This will come in handy later, because lower cards often get stacked on top of higher cards of a same suit.Always try to move aces onto empty spaces. If an ace of any suit comes out of the stock and you end up with an empty space to put it on, move it right away. The goal of the game is to have only the aces remaining on the tableau, so they'll need to be on the bottom spaces.

, Keep matching cards until you can't match any more, then deal four more cards. Move cards to empty spaces to create new openings when it's possible, always trying to move the aces to the bottom spaces. Keep playing until the stock runs out and there are no more available moves.

Check your tableau.,
Use some strategy.,
Play again.",How to Play Aces Up3," To win the game, you'll want to leave only aces on the table, with every other card discarded. The more you play, the more you will win, but keep in mind that games often end with cards of different suits on the tops of the stacks; this is the easiest way to know that you've lost., Aces Up is a simple game, so there's not much complex strategy to be applied. However, if you keep in mind the basics of the game, you're more likely to win more often. Use your empty spaces and move your aces as soon as possible.If you see a low card stacked on a higher card of the same suit, try to move the lower card to an empty space. For example, if you see a 7 of diamonds on top of a 9 of diamonds, move the 7 to an empty space and then remove it to the discard pile.
Try moving aces to empty spots. When an empty space appears and you have an ace that's free to move to it, move the ace as soon as possible.

, Aces up is a fast moving game, so each game takes only about 5-10 minutes. If your first one ends in a loss, reshuffle your cards and try again. The more practice you get, the more strategies you'll be able to develop.

, This is slightly complicated. In 500 there are 4 suits of cards. The hearts are worth the most followed by diamonds then clubs and finally spades. The person to the right of the dealer begins. An example of a bid is '7 spades' or '7 diamonds'. This means that the player thinks he or she can win 7 tricks (during the play whoever puts down the highest card wins the 'trick').

Get a Ludo set.,
Understand Ludo terminology.,
Get a group together.,
Prepare the board.,
Decide who goes first.",How to Play Ludo1," You should be able to find a Ludo board game at any children’s store or bookstore that sells board games. It is more popular in Indian and Bangladeshi cultures, but there are Western versions available.


A popular Western adaptation of Ludo is the board game “Sorry!”;
, There are several terms specific to Ludo and other similar games. Each player picks a color and is control of the four pieces, or pawns. Instead of using a pair of dice, Ludo only requires one die. The game begins by setting up each pawn in their corresponding pockets. Pockets are the big, color-coated squares in each corner. The home pocket is the center square that has one space of each color.


Most of the game play occurs on the track. The track consists of 52 spaces.
The home run is made of four sets of five spaces. This stretch leads into the home pocket. You can only be on the home run if your pawn’s color matches the color of the home run., Ludo can be played with 2 to 4 players. Players should be over four years old or have the attention span to count and take turns. Each player chooses one of the four colors represented on the board and on the pawns., After each player chooses a color, take all of the pawns of that color and place them in the pockets of the same color.


When played with 2 people, play as the opposing colors across from each other, or in opposite corners. This would mean yellow vs red or green vs blue. Place the pawns inside the pockets that match the color of your pawns.

, Determine who goes first by luck of the die. Let each player roll the die. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first. The order of play will proceed clockwise from the player who goes first."
"
Start the game.,
Follow the roll.,
Understand the rule of sixes.,
Capture an opponent’s pawn.,
Play with blobs.,
Pair your pawns.,
Reach the home run.,
Win the game.",How to Play Ludo2," Whoever rolled the highest initial throw has the first attempt to begin the game. To start moving across the board, a player must roll a six to activate a pawn ""into play."" If the starting person doesn’t roll a six, then the player clockwise to them rolls. The initial six allows a pawn to leave the pocket.


Everyone gets one chance to roll a six, and if they don’t get a six, it becomes the next player’s turn.

, After a player rolls an initial six to activate a pawn into play, that player will roll the die a second time to move the pawn. You must follow the number that is thrown. To land in the “home” section, you need to move the exact number rolled. You can’t capture home pockets if you roll a higher number than required.If there is not a legal move you can make, you have to pass your turn., When the player rolls a six they can get a single pawn out off a pocket. Then you roll again and move that pawn the number of spaces corresponding to the second roll.


If the player rolls a six on the second roll, then the player can choose to place another pawn out of a pocket or move the first pawn. If you moved a second pawn out of your pocket, roll a third time and proceed to move a pawn.
If a player rolls a six on their third roll, they cannot place any pawns out of their pocket. The third six ends a player’s turn., You can capture an opponent’s pawn anytime you land on top of one of their pawns. The pawn that is captured goes back to the corresponding player's pocket. That player then has to roll a six in order to get their pawn out.If an opponent's pawn is blocking your pathway and you cannot capture the pawn, you cannot move that pawn.

, A blob forms when one or more pawns of the same color are on the same space. Blobs act as barriers for all pawns, including yours, on the board. When you have two pawns of the same color and an opponent’s pawn lands on the space, it is called a mixed blob.When a mixed blob occurs, all pawns on the space are returned to their respective pockets.


If there is blob three spaces away from your pawn and you roll a four, you cannot move your pawn towards the blob and must pass your turn. If you roll a four, you can capture your opponent’s pawns, but your pawn will also be sent back to your pocket.
Blobs act as barriers to your pawns as well. The only way to pass your own blob is to first land on it with an exact roll. Then on your next roll, you can move your pawn forward.
You can choose to instead play with ""pairs"" instead of blobs.

, This is a double edged sword that can either win you the game or lose you the game. You can pair pawns by simply landing one pawn on top of another with an exact number. When pawns are paired, you cannot separate them until you reach the home pocket or get captured back into your pocket. As long as you are paired and not in a pocket, the opponent cannot pass you or take you out, unless they also have a pair and land on top of your pawns.


If an opponent's pair lands on top of your pair, you lose both of your pawns.
You can instead play with the rule of blobs, or create a hybrid by using both options.

, In order to place your pawns into the home run, you'll need to make a lap around the track of the board. Each pawn starts by going to the right. Once you've made a complete lap you can file your pawns into the home run., To win the game, you need to get all your pawns inside the home pocket before your opponent can.You cannot jump pawns in Ludo. If you have an empty space in your homerun, you’re required to move the closest pawn into that space. You must move the pawn according to the number you roll on the die.


If you have one space to move and you roll a three or a two, you cannot move that pawn one space.

Characters.,
Board elements.,
Building the board.,
Use combinations.,
Mechs.,
Gorillinators.,
Water.",How to Play Heroscape," First of all, the original author of this page believes that Syvarris is the best character, because of his range and double attack ability. If you can get Syvarris on a hill to gain the height bonus, he becomes nearly invincible. Especially if you can surround him with a squad of tough characters like the Knights or Utgar's Minions. Mechs work well as protection too, and have great range in most cases.;
, Note which board elements are in play and choose characters that play well with those. For example, the Microcorp Agents are awesome if there is a lot of water on your board; the Obsidian Guards gain a ranged attack in lava, and if you have a road on the board, the Dumutef Guard is actually a pretty good use of 25 points. If you have a lot of variable height terrain, make sure to get some characters with range. The best of these are the Krav Maga Agents, the Airborne Elite, and, again, Syvarris. The only ranged characters with no real use are the Massachusetts Line, since there are so slow. Again, this is just the opinion of one person, and many would disagree with him/her. The characters are all well-balanced, and each has their own uses...there really aren't any figures that are hands-down better than any others. Your playing style, the map, and the rest of your army impacts the ""worth"" of the figures more than anything.

, Try to get a lot of height variance in your board, because playing on a flat field does not allow characters to take advantage of their abilities. Make sure you build in ways to get to the top of hills other than flying--most characters cannot climb higher than their height, and Syvarris is not as good if he's standing in a field as if he's standing on a hill. Place trees to block lines of sight TO each starting spot, but that do not block sight lines FROM each starting spot.

, Several squads have the power of ""bonding"", which allows them to move certain heroes before moving themselves. The Knights work very well with Sir Denrick here, for example, as Denrick can actually have two turns every turn--first the Knights move him, then you place him later in your turn for another go with Denrick. Denrick has 4 defense dice, and is great against monsters like Krug, Su-Bak-Na, Mimring, and anyone Huge. Send him in and back him up with Kelda if you can. Two turns with 6 attack dice can't be beat, even by the mechs. Other good combinations are Syvarris and Taelord, the Gruts along with Grimnak and Krug or another Beast, and the Scotsmen (though they suck) can be used with Denrick to give him THREE turns every turn. Other great combinations are Grimnak with the Gruts, as Grimnak can eat his way through any squad in as little as one turn. If you play, you know sometimes you don't get too many chances with Grimnak--having a Grut reserved to give the Dino-rider an extra turn is a great play.

, Mechs are cool--but be warned, though they are tough, an all-mech team has never won any game I have witnessed.

, These guys are wearing plate armor. This means that in their simple minds they believe themselves to be mechs. This is why they are invincible--because they hold the power of a mech in their minds so hard that they become mechs. Automatic, self-propelled death-dealing beasts of unequalled destructive, chaotic annhilation. Gorillinators for short.

, Make sure to put some water on every board. Otherwise, no one will ever play the Marro Warriors, Microcorp Agents, or Snakes. And that would be too bad.

The objective of the game is to collect as many playing pieces as possible before one of the players clears their side of all the playing pieces.,
Start by placing four stones in each small cup.,
Your mancala is the big basin to your right.,
Choose which player is going to go first.,
Going counter-clockwise, the beginning player takes all four stones in one cup on their side and places one stone each in any four adjacent cups.,
Players can put stones in their own Mancala, but not in their opponent's Mancala.,Take turns picking up stones in any cup and placing them

,
If your last stone falls into your Mancala, take another turn.

,
If the last stone you drop is in an empty cup on your side, capture that piece along with any pieces in the hole directly opposite.,
When one player's six cups are completely empty, the game ends.",How to Play Kalaha," The row of six cups in front and closest to each player are theirs.;
, You have 48 stones total, and 12 cups, which means there should be four stones in each cup. Each player starts off with a total of 24 stones or beads.

, Also called a ""store,"" it is where captured pieces are placed.

, Because there's not really an advantage to going first, flip a coin or choose a person at random.

, Players can only grab stones that are on their side.

, If you have enough stones to reach your opponent's Mancala, skip it.

,,, Captured pieces go into your Mancala store.

, The player who still has stones left in their cups captures those stones and puts them in their Mancala. Players compare the number of stones in their Mancala. The player with the most stones wins.

, Start with the person left of the dealer and put down any card. All players must follow suit if they can (this includes all magic cards and trumps) and the highest card in that suit, or the winning magic card wins the trick., They are are as follows:

2s make that suit the trump suit for the trick
7s automatically win the round, but if more than one player plays a 7, the last one played wins
Jacks are not suit-sensitive, so if the Jack is the highest card played, even if it's not following suit or a trump, it wins.
If more than one Jack is played and they are the highest cards, the trump or one following suit wins, or failing that, the one with the highest suit (S, H, D, C).

, After all the cards are played, the round is ended and any player who hasn't won at least one trick becomes a bitch and if they have a partner they also become a bitch.

Bitches only get given one card, but they can play it in any trick they like. If you don't win the trick, or, if you're in a pair and neither of you win a trick, you are eliminated. If you do or your partner does, you are back as a regular player in the game.

, Between rounds, you are allowed to split with your partner. If one of you has not won any tricks in the last round and you split then, only the one who didn't win any tricks will become a bitch. However, if you have become bitches and neither of you have won a trick in the next round, it's too late and you are both eliminated., Between rounds you can also partner up with people, if they have also split, or you can ask someone to split with their partner and pair up with you (only two people per pair, though)., At the end of that time, if you still can't get a partner, you are eliminated., The game ends when there are one pair remaining, who become the winners (you could then battle it out between the last two, but that's up to you).,"

End the round and award points.",How to Play Dominoes," A standard set contains 28 rectangular tiles marked with between 0 and 6 dots on each end of the face side. The back side is blank and smooth. Most domino sets are inexpensive; many also come with a carrying case for easy transport.









Thrift stores and yard sales are great places to find cheap domino sets. Dominoes last more or less forever, so don't worry about the age of the set.
If you don't have the money to buy dominoes yourself, consider asking friends and relatives if you can borrow a set. Often, someone you know will have an extra set stored away somewhere that they will be glad loan you.
There are also larger domino sets with numbers from 0 to 12 or more, all the way up to 18. The game is played more or less the same way regardless of numbering, but this article assumes you have an ordinary 0 to 6 set.;
, A game of dominoes requires a flat surface with a decent amount of space. Large tables, such as those found in cafeterias and libraries, are usually a safe choice.









Make sure that you pick somewhere that allows at least a moderate level of noise; dominoes clack when they're set down.
A kitchen table is a fine choice if you are playing with friends. Clear off any centerpieces or dishes first.

, Turn the tiles face down on the table, then move them around with your hands, being careful not to flip any over. Once the tiles have been sufficiently mixed, scoot the pile to one side so that your play area is clear.









The collection of shuffled tiles is often called the ""bone yard,"" since one of the most common nicknames for dominoes is “bones.”

, Take seven dominoes from the bone yard and stand them on the table so that your opponent can't see their faces.








, There are a few ways to do this; choose whatever method you and your partner can both agree on. The most common methods are as follows:









Each player picks one extra tile from the bone yard. The player who draws the tile with the highest total value goes first.
Each player reviews his or her hand and reveals the tile with the highest total value. Whoever has the highest number goes first.
Each player reveals a double (a tile with the same number on either end) from his or her hand, and the player with the highest double goes first.
One player flips a coin and the other player calls it. Whoever wins the flip goes first.

, It is customary for the first domino to be a double tile (a tile with the same number on both ends), if possible; otherwise, any tile may be used. The orientation of the domino doesn't matter.








, Using your hand of seven tiles, add one domino to either narrow end of the first domino. You can only add a domino to the board if it has a number that matches a number on one open end of the domino board. For example, if the first tile is a pair of 4s, you can only play a domino that has one end marked with a 4. Place the dominoes together end on end to show that they are matched.









Once the end of a domino has been placed on the end of another domino, those ends are closed and no further dominoes can be attached to them.
There are never more than two ends open anywhere on the board. These are always the outside ends of the domino chain.
If you can't play onto either end of the board, you must pass your turn.
If you are placing a double tile, it is customary (but not necessary) to set the tile perpendicular to the tile you are playing onto. Regardless of orientation, only one side of the double tile (the side opposite the touching side) is considered free.
If you run out of space, it is acceptable to play a domino onto the appropriate side of the open tile so that the line of dominoes turns. This has no strategic value, and is only done to save space.

, Whoever plays all 7 of his or her dominoes first wins the round, and receives points equal to the total of all the dots on the opponent's remaining tiles.









If neither player is able to finish, both players reveal their hands and add up the total of tiles in each one. Whoever has the lowest total wins the round, and receives points equal to the difference between his or her total and the opponent's total.

In the case of a tie, the victory goes to whichever player has the tile with the smallest sum total.


Whenever a set number of total points (usually 100 or 200) is reached, the game is over.

The Clue game board features nine rooms that the six character pawns may move between. Make sure that you choose a game surface that all of your players can sit around and access the game board with ease.Up to six people can play Clue and they will all need to be able to access the board to move their character pawns.;
, You may place the character pawns on the board at random, but make sure that each pawn is in a room at the start of the game. Each of the six pawns should have a weapon in the room as well. It does not matter what weapon goes with each character pawn., Before you start the game, make sure that each player has a detective’s notes sheet to keep track of suspects, rooms, and weapons. These sheets include a list of all of the suspects, rooms, and weapons, so players can check them off as they rule them out.For example, if a player has Mrs. Peacock, a candlestick, and the kitchen in her hand, then these cannot be in the envelope. That player would want to check those items off of his or her list to rule them out.

, Clue comes with three different types of cards: suspects, rooms, and weapons. Keep these card types in separate stacks and shuffle each stack of cards. Then, place the stacks face down on the board., Draw one card from each of the three stacks and place these cards into the “Case File Confidential” envelope. Make sure that you keep these cards face down so that no one can see them. The player who guesses what these three cards are will win the game., After you have placed the cards into the “Case File Confidential” envelope, you can shuffle the remaining card stacks together. Then, deal all of the cards to the players so that you all have the same amount of cards.You may look at your cards, but do not show your cards to any of the other players.

, The first thing you need to do one your turn is to roll the dice or use a secret passage to enter a room. You should try to go into a new room every turn. Roll both dice and move your game token that number of spaces.Keep in mind that you may move up, down, or to the side, but not diagonally in Clue.
Miss Scarlet always goes first in Clue, so whoever is using her game token will roll the dice first and then play passes to the left.

, Two players may not be on the same square at the same time. Therefore, you may get blocked into a room from time to time if another player is on the space right outside of the door to a room you are in.If you get blocked in a room, then you will have to wait until your next turn to see if the path is clear and try to leave the room.

, Since it is your goal to use deduction to figure out what suspect, room, and weapon cards are in the envelope, you will need to use the process of elimination to get closer to the answer. Therefore, every time that you enter a rom, you should make a suggestion to your fellow players about what might be in the envelope.For example, you might suggest that it was Colonel Mustard in the study with the lead pipe. Your fellow players would then search their cards for this suspect, room, and weapon. The player to your left would be the first to reveal one of these card to you if it is in his or her hand.
Your fellow players would all take turns showing you one card from their hands if they have any of the cards you suggested. You would then check off the cards that players showed you to eliminate some more possibilities.

, You need to be in a room to make a suggestion about that room, but you also need to move the suspect and weapon that you are suggesting. Take the suspect and weapon from wherever they are on the board and put them into the room you are suggesting.There are no limits on the number of suspects or weapons that you may have in one room at one time.

, You should make an accusation only after you have eliminated most of the possibilities and you feel confident that you know who the suspect is, where the suspect committed the murder, and what weapon the suspect used. If your accusation is correct, then you win the game!Keep in mind that you may only make one accusation per game. If you are wrong, then you have lost the game. You will have to return the cards to the envelope and continue revealing your cards to other players, but you may not make another accusation.

The Monster Lord represents you on the board and it is more difficult to kill than your regular monsters. As you attempt to get closer to your opponent’s Monster Lord, you will need to build dungeons and attack your opponent’s other pieces., Before you set up the game, you should make sure that you have everything you need to play a game. If you are missing something, then you may need to improvise. For example, if you are missing one of the Monster figures, you can use a coin or some other small item to represent that monster on the board.

2 Crest Counters
10 Dungeon Pieces
6 Monster Figures
1 Monster Lord Figure
7 Monster Cards
1 Damage Marker Sheet
1 Field (game board)
1 Official Rule Book

, Each monster card has some important information on it that you will need to know how to interpret. Study the information on your monster cards before you play them so that you know which ones are more powerful. The information on the monster cards include the monster’s:name
level
hit points
explanation of special ability
number of crests needed to perform special ability
tribe
attack power
defense power

, Before you set up the game, you should figure out who will be going first. The best way to determine who goes first is to flip a coin, but you can also play a game of rock, paper, scissors to decide., After you have familiarized yourself with the game components, you can set up the game and get ready to play. Setting up Dungeon Dice Monsters is easy. The first thing you need to do is to lay out the game board.If you are playing a basic game, then you will use the inner 11 by 11 square field. This type of game is recommended if you only have the starter set.
If you are playing an advanced game, then you will use the whole field. This game is recommended if you have booster packs in addition to the starter set.

, You can play either Yugi’s or Kaiba’s monsters. If you won the coin toss or rock, paper, scissors, then you get to choose which one you will play as. Your opponent gets the other set. Place your monster cards to the left side of the board facing up. Place corresponding figures on top of the cards., The starter game set only comes with one monster lord, so your opponent will not get a figure unless he or she owns one. Otherwise, just have your opponent use one of the cardboard monster lord tokens as his or her monster lord. Place the monster lord tokens or figures within the white area of the board., The dungeon pieces are two-sided and each side has a different color, so you can keep them all in one pile near the board. If you are playing with Yugi’s monster’s then you will be red and if you are using Kaiba’s monsters then you will be blue., Dungeon Dice Monsters comes with 12 dice in four different colors. At the start of each turn you will select three dice to roll and the symbols that you roll will determine how many crest points you earn and whether or not you can summon a monster.Keep the dice separated by color to make it easy to roll all of one color at a time.

, Each player will need to have a crest counter to add up any crest points that he or she earns by rolling the dice. Keep your crest counter right in front of you so that you can easily add crest points as you earn them. There are 5 types of crest points that you can earn from dice rolls and they match up with the symbols on the dice.The only symbol that does not earn you crest points is the summon crest, which looks like a start with a number inside of it. This symbol allows you to summon a monster right away.

, You should select the dice set that corresponds with the monster level that you hope to summon. Therefore, if you want to summon a level one monster, then you should select the level one dice set. Once you have selected your dice set, roll the dice to see if you can summon or just collect points., If you roll crest symbols other than the summon crest, then you can add them to your crest counter. Make sure that you pay attention to the symbols and only give yourself the number of crests indicated by the dice roll., If you rolled 2 summon crests of the same level, then you get to summon a monster right away. Make sure that the monster you summon matches the level of the dice you rolled.For example, you cannot summon a level 3 monster if you rolled the level 2 dice set.

, After you have selected the monster that you want to summon, place a dungeon piece on the board and place your monster on the dungeon piece. Now your monster is on the board and you may use progress crest points to advance it into other dungeon spaces that you add to the board.Make sure that the first dungeon piece you place on the board is touching one side of your monster lord’s space. All other pieces that you place must be connected to other dungeon pieces.
Dungeon pieces may not overlap or go over the edge of the field.

, Continue to roll the dice, summon monsters, build dungeons, and collect crest points in your following turns. You may also begin moving your pieces forward on the board and attacking your opponent’s pieces. During your turn, each of your monsters may move and attack once.Keep in mind that you must use crest points to move and attack. You cannot move or attack if you do not have enough crest points.
If you use one of your monster’s special abilities, then you cannot move and attack with that monster during that turn.
You may move and attack as many of your monsters as you like during your turn as long as you have enough crest points to do so.

, Every time an opponent attacks you, you will need to place damage counters to indicate how many points of damage that monster has taken. If the monster is killed, then you will need to flip the card over and remove the monster figure from the board., The winner is the first player to kill the other player’s monster lord. Monster lords have 3 life points instead of hit points. That means that a monster lord will die after it has been attacked three times. It does not matter how powerful the piece is. Any three attacks will kill the monster lord.Place one damage counter on your monster lord’s space for each time that it is attacked. Your monster lord is dead after it has been attacked three times.
If you find yourself in a position where neither player can move or attack, then the player with the most life points left wins. If life points are equal, then the player with the most monsters on the board wins. If the number of monsters is equal, then the player with the most high-level monsters wins. If that number is equal, then the game is a tie.

Look for pairs of consonants and change the vowel before or after each pair.,Try adding a letter before the first two letters or after the last two letters.,Think of as many items in the second category as possible.,
Get to the End Zone.",How to Play Common Ground (Board Game),", Place each half in the areas of the board labeled ""Category 1"" and ""Category 2."", Hand them out according to the color of their game piece.,,,, That player turns over the top card from the Category 1 pile and then names three items from that category. All players write them in the left hand column of their pad., The top card of the Category 2 pile is then revealed and the time started. Players then have 90 seconds to think of an item in the second category that shares common ground with the items listed.

Only one response per item.

, When the time expires, players add up the total number of letters in common for the three responses. The player with the highest total wins the round and advances five spaces.

In the event of a tie, the payers involved play an instant round where the next category cards in each pile are revealed simultaneously, and the first player to call out an item from each category that shares common ground, wins the tiebreaker, and advances five spaces.
Instant rounds also take place whenever a player lands on the same space as another player, and the instant round involves only those 2 players.

, Next the players select an option card (No Action, Roll & Advance or Super Instant Round) and place it face down on the board. When all have done so, they flip them over simultaneously.

No Action - This means that the player wishes to not use an option card at this point.
Roll & Advance - Player rolls the die and advances accordingly. These are played in order beginning with the player to the left of the player who started the round by listing items. Roll & Advance cards are played before any Super Instant Round.
Super Instant Round means that the player is calling for an instant round involving all players and the winner advances four spaces in this case. If more than one player chooses to play a Super Instant Round card at the same time, only one Super Instant Round shall be played and the other Super Instant Round cards are forfeited. Once any Roll & Advance card is used it cannot be used again.

,, Look at two consecutive letters at a time, shifting through different pairs of letters across the word. Then try it with three consecutive letters, and so forth.,, Or, look for pairs of vowels and change the consonant before or after each pair.,,, A player must be in the End Zone and win a Normal Round or a Super Instant Round. A player doesn't need an exact roll of the die to enter the End Zone.

Use a game solver tool.",How to Play Connect 4," There are several different types of Connect Four boards, but all come with a grid that hold the checkers and some type of stand that holds the grid. The traditional set-up features two end supports with slots for hooks on each side of the grid to snap into. Once the end supports are attached, place the board on a flat surface, and close the sliding lever at the bottom of the grid so that there are bars to prevent the checkers from falling through.When attaching the end supports to the the grid, make sure that the notched edge of the end support is facing the grid.
Some versions of Connect Four, such as the Pop Out Connect Four and Connect Four On the Run travel game, feature a round game base with slots on each side for tabs on the bottom of the grid to snap into.
When you’re ready to play, place the board between you and your opponent so you’re each on one side of it.;
, Connect Four comes with 21 red checkers and 21 black checkers. Before you begin playing, separate the checkers into piles based on their color. Next, you must decide who will play each color. Whatever color you choose, take that pile of checkers. Your opponent takes the other pile.If you and your opponent both can’t agree on who should play which color, you may want to put a checker in each color in a hat, bag, or other container that you can’t see into. Then whatever color you or your opponent pulls out is the checker shade that you’ll play.

, During the course of play, you and your opponent will alternate turns after making a move with a checker. The player who goes first typically has an advantage in the game, so to be fair, you should take turns going first.If you can’t agree on who goes first, you may want to flip a coin to avoid an argument.

, Before you can start playing Connect Four or planning a strategy, you must make sure that you understand the object of the game. In order to win, a player must get four checkers in their color in a row. Whoever does it first is the winner.There are three ways to get four checkers in a row in Connect Four: horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
Some versions of Connect Four have an additional game where you attach an extra column to the grid and attempt to get five checkers in row.

, When it’s your turn to make a move in Connect Four, you take a checker and drop it down one of the slots at the top of the grid. Standard boards have have seven columns and six rows to choose from. On your first move, you will typically wind up placing your checker in the bottom row, but you can choose any of the columns, depending on your strategy.You want to choose each move carefully because your opponent will have a turn after you. Not only do they have a chance to thwart your strategy for four in row, your move can sometimes make it easier for them to get four of their checkers in a row.

, After you make a move with your checker, your opponent gets a chance to go. As you plan each of your moves, try to imagine how your opponent will respond. That allows you to react to their moves quickly and decisively. Before you drop a checker into the grid, ask yourself what you would do next if your opponent had made the move that you’re about to. If you have the first turn in the game, your opponent will probably be responding to your moves and attempting to block you from getting four checkers in row.
If you have the second turn of the game, you’ll likely be on the defensive, trying to keep your opponent from getting their checkers in row.

, If you are the first player to go in a game of Connect Four, your initial move can actually dictate the entire game. When you’re opening the game, the best move is to place your checker in the center column. By placing your checker in that slot, you may it much more difficult for your opponent to counter your moves so your chances of winning increase.Placing the first checker in the middle column doesn’t guarantee a win. You still have to avoid making mistakes along the way.
If you choose a column other than the middle for your first move, it becomes easier for your opponent to force a tie.

, When you have the second move of the again, you’re on the defensive so it’s more difficult to win. If your opponent places their checker in the center column to open the game, don’t place yours in the same column so it’s on top of their checker. That doesn’t give you any strategic advantage. Instead, your best bet is to place your checker in the bottom row in one of the other columns and hope that your opponent makes a mistake.If your opponent doesn’t place their checker in the center column with the first move of the game, that should be your initial move when it’s your turn because the space offers the best advantage in the game.

, If you’re having trouble defeating opponents, you may want to consult a game solving tool. The game solver allows you to input your opponent’s moves and then provides winning moves that you can counter with so you’re guaranteed a victory. Most opponents won’t appreciate you consulting a tool like this on your smartphone or tablet while you’re playing, so try practicing with the game solver to help you start identifying winning moves that you can use in actual game play.There are several websites, such as Connect Four Solver, that offer these types of game solving tools.

Keep playing until you have played 16 rounds.",How to Play Mah Jongg," A Mah Jongg set comes with 144 tiles. Each tile has either a symbol or a Chinese character on it. Your goal when playing Mah Jongg is to create combinations with these tiles. Your Mah Jongg set should include:36 Bamboo tiles, 4 sets numbered 1-9
36 Chinese Character tiles, 4 sets numbered 1-9
36 Circle tiles, 4 sets numbered 1-9
12 Dragon tiles, 4 red, 4 green , and 4 white
16 Wind tiles, 4 of each wind direction (North, South, East, and West)
4 Flower tiles numbered 1-4
4 Season tiles, numbered 1-4;
, Although there are many different tiles in Mah Jongg, there are just three different kinds of tile combinations that you will be trying to make as you play Mah Jongg. These combinations includeChow: a run of the same type of three tiles, such as three Chinese character tiles numbered 2, 3, and 4
Pong: a set of three tiles, such as three number 2 Bamboo tiles
Kong: a set of four tiles, such as four number 5 Circle tiles

, The object of Mah Jongg is to complete four Chow or Pong combinations OR a Kong combination plus a pair of two identical tiles. The first player to do so wins the round.A game of Mah Jongg usually includes 16 rounds so that each player has a chance to be the dominant wind four times. Players earn points when they win a round and at the end of 16 rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.

, Before the game begins, assign each player a wind direction of either North, South, East, or West. The players will keep this direction for the entire game. As you play, you will cycle through the four winds so that each round has a designated wind., Have each player stack up 36 tiles (18 on top of 18) to form a wall on each side of the table. Make sure that the tiles are all facing down. Then, push the walls together to form a square. These walls form the draw pile for the game., Have all four players roll both dice. Whoever rolls the highest number will be the dealer for this round. The player sitting to the right of the dealer goes first and play passes to the right., The dealer will need to give everyone 13 tiles from the wall. The rest of the tiles can stay in the wall formation in the center of the table and players can draw from the wall or from the discard pile as you play.The player whose wind direction is dominant for this round gets an extra tile. That player will get 14 tiles total while the rest of the players get 13.

, Start your turn by either drawing a tile from the wall or from the discard pile (unless it is empty). After you draw your tile, discard a tile by placing it face up in the center of the table.Keep in mind that other players may pick up the tiles you discard.

, The way to win Mah Jongg is to create melds, also known as Pungs, Chows, and Kongs. Each of these melds is a different combination of tiles that you can make. If you play melds during the game, you will earn a certain amount of points for each different type of combination., If you create the required number of melds to get a Mah Jongg, then you can call out “Mah Jongg” after you place the winning meld on your turn. As long as you have the correct number and type of melds for a Mah Jongg, then the round is over., After someone has won the round, you will need to calculate the scores for each player. There are several different ways to score in Mah Jongg, but to keep things simple, you can assign points based on the following guidelines.4 Pungs earns 6 points
4 Chows earns 2 points
1 Dragon Pung or Kong earns 2 points
2 Dragon Pungs earns 6 points
Pung or Kong of Winds matching dominant Wind for the round earns 2 points
Flowers or Seasons tile earns 1 point

, A game of Mah Jongg is over when you have played 16 rounds total and each player’s wind direction has been the dominant wind four times. After you have finished 16 rounds, add up the scores for each player to determine the winner."

Learn the rules that apply to each piece's movement on the board.,
Practice Chinese chess rules and learn what each move is called.,
Win the game by putting your opponent's general in checkmate or by forcing a stalemate.",How to Play Chinese Chess," The board itself has 64 squares, the same number of spaces as an international chess board. However, the Chinese chess board has a river in the middle that divides the board between opposing players. It also has diagonal lines in some places that designate the boundaries that some pieces may not move beyond.No plays can be made in the river. Pieces must cross it to make a play.
On each side of the playing board, there is an Imperial Palace where the general and guard pieces are not allowed to leave.;
, Chinese chess pieces are placed on line intersections, which are called points, instead of in the actual board squares. The board is made up of 9 by 10 points.On a Chinese chess board, pieces may only move on the line intersections, much like in the game Go.

, These pieces are quite similar to the pieces in International chess. Each player gets 1 general (king), 2 guards, 2 elephants (bishops), 2 chariots (rooks), 2 horses (knights), 2 cannons and 5 soldiers (pawns). Each piece is a flat white disk with either red or black markings that make up the Chinese word that corresponds to the piece. , Each piece has a designated place on the board, as in International chess. To play Chinese chess, you need to make sure that your pieces are all in the correct place on the board. Remember, the pieces go on the intersections, not on the squares.On the row nearest you, place your pieces on the points from left to right: the chariot, horse, elephant, guard, king, guard, elephant, knight and chariot.
On the third row, place your two cannons on the intersection that is one space from the edge of the right and left side of the board.
On the fourth row, place your soldier pieces on every other intersection, beginning with the first intersection on the edge of the board.

, As in International chess, your goal is to capture the other player’s general (king). You will need to use your other pieces to put your opponent’s general into checkmate. In the process, you will try to capture as many of your opponent’s pieces as possible to make it easier to put your opponent into checkmate. , Each piece in Chinese chess has a specific type of movement that it can make. It is essential to understand these rules for movement in order to play the game. The pieces’ movement rules are as follows:The general can move 1 space back or forward, right or left but cannot make a move diagonally. This piece is also not allowed to leave the Imperial Palace area. The general piece may capture any enemy piece which strays into the Imperial Palace area unless that piece is protected by another piece. Generals on the opposite sides of the board cannot be across from each other without another piece between them.
A chariot or rook piece can move any number of spaces in a straight line horizontally or vertically through the rows of the board.
The horse piece is equivalent to the knight in international chess rules, in that it can move 1 point any direction and 1 point diagonally (aka 2 points in one direction and 1 point perpendicular to it). However, the horse cannot jump another piece (e.g. If there is a piece in front of the horse blocking it's path of 2 points forward).
Cannon move rules are the same as the chariot/rook with one difference. In order to capture, the cannon has to jump over only 1 piece but it can be of either color.
Guards can move only 1 point diagonally in either direction but, they cannot leave the Imperial Palace.
The elephant can move 2 points diagonally, as a bishop can in international chess. However an elephant cannot cross the river on the board. If there is a piece on the point which the elephant has to jump over in order to get to the second point then the elephant can't get to the second point.Soldiers can only move and capture 1 point forward (not diagonally) until they cross the river. Once they cross the river, soldiers can move 1 point to the left or right or forwards but not backwards.

, The player with the red pieces always makes the first move, and then the next player goes. The players alternate turns throughout the entire game. Players may only make one move each per turn. Make sure that you consider the ways each piece is allowed to move before you make your moves.To ""capture"" is to take over the point that the opposing team occupies. It's the same strategic move that's used in international chess.
You put your opponent's general in ""check"" if your next move will capture the piece. Your opponent's next move has to be to protect the general from capture.

, You and your opponent must move and capture each other’s pieces until one of you checkmates the other or neither of you can checkmate the other. In a stalemate situation, the game is considered a draw.A ""checkmate"" occurs when the general cannot escape capture. You can also win if you force your opponent into a ""stalemate,"" in which your opponent cannot make a legal move to protect his general.
The game is a draw when neither player can force a stalemate or checkmate.

Make sure that you place the board somewhere that everyone can reach it. A large table or a carpeted floor make good playing surfaces., Make sure that all of the cards are facing down so no player can see what they will pick up off the top of the deck. Place the cards somewhere central so that all players will be able to reach them., The game comes with four gingerbread character pawns. Each player should choose one of these gingerbread pawns and place it on the start square of the Candy Land board., Have all of the players announce their birthdays to determine who is the youngest player. That player gets to go first and then play passes to the left. Keep the turns moving in a clockwise fashion throughout the entire game., At the start of your turn, draw a card and check to see what is on it. Each card will either have one color square, two color squares, or a picture. Each of these cards allows you to do something different on your turn.One color square: Move your pawn to the first color space on the board that matches the color square on the card you have drawn.
Two color squares: Move your pawn to the second color space on the board that matches the color square on the card you have drawn.
Picture: Move your pawn forward OR backward to the picture square that matches the picture card you have drawn.

, There are two shortcuts on the board that will allow you to move ahead faster if you land on one of these special spaces. The two shortcuts are located on Rainbow Trail and Gumdrop Pass.The shortcut space on Rainbow Trail is orange and the one on Gumdrop Pass is yellow. If you land on one of these spaces, follow the shortcut path upwards to the space above it.
You must land on the exact space to use a shortcut. You may not use a shortcut if you are just passing by it.

, There are three licorice spaces on the board. If you land on one of these spaces, then you lose a turn. Keep in mind that you do not lose a turn if you are just passing by a licorice space. You must land on the exact space to lose a turn., The first player who reaches the multi-colored rainbow space at the end of the board has made it to the candy castle. The player who makes it to the candy castle first wins the game!, If you are playing with very young children, then you can use a rule variation that allows players to discard any cards that would send them backwards on the board. If a child draws a card that would send his or her gingerbread pawn backwards instead of forwards, then that child may simply discard the card and draw a new one., If you are playing with older children or adults, then you can use a rule variation that allows players to draw two card per turn and choose which one to use. This variation adds an element of strategy to the game play. Players draw two cards per turn, select one to use and then discard the other card."

Each corner will have a 51 millimeter circular hole with a net under it, similar to a miniature pool table. The board has two concentric circles in the center, one the size of a playing piece and another larger circle. Two lines running at a diagonal from the corners create the foul lines. Lines running parallel to the sides create small rectangles known as the “Baseline.”Some players choose to lubricate the board with boric acid, potato starch, or chalk dust to allow the pieces to move more freely over the wood.
This is representative of a traditional Carrom board. Other boards come in variations of sizes large enough to to push pieces as you would in shuffle board. Some boards can also be shaped in hexagons to allow for more players.;
, The game involves nine black or dark playing pieces, nine white or light-colored playing pieces, a red queen and a striker.


Advanced players often own a personal striker. These can be up to four times heavier than a piece and are commonly made of bone or ivory.Each player can bring their own striker, or one striker can be shared among all the players.

, The queen is the red playing piece. Begin by placing the queen in the small circle in the center of the board. The remaining dark and light pieces will be arranged around the queen within the larger circle., Place the first light piece along the diagonal from the queen, in the direction of the pocket where you would like to strike the piece. Alternate dark, then light pieces in a circle, clockwise, using the queen as the center point.Place another light piece along the same diagonal as the original one, and alternate dark and light pieces clockwise around the first circle of pieces, until you have completed an outer circle of pieces.

, One player will hold a game piece in one hand. The other player must guess which hand conceals the game piece. If the player guesses correctly, they can choose whether to strike first, or allow the other player the position of the light pieces, having them strike first and “break.""If the player chooses the incorrect hand, the player who held the piece will get to choose whether to strike first or pass to the other player.
The first player can also be determined by flipping a coin.

, The player who strikes first will be seated in the position facing the lighter pieces. For a traditional, two-player game, the opponent will be seated on the opposite side of the board.


Carrom is often played with four people playing as doubles. In this case, your partner is seated opposite you and assigned the same color pieces.
Turns proceed clockwise in a game of doubles.

, All shots must be taken from a seated position. Be sure you are seated comfortably in a position where you can clearly see your shot and position your hand on the board for shooting.Players must remain seated. They can not get up from their chairs or move around the board.
A player’s body must remain within their quadrant, which is created by the diagonal lines on the board. If those were to extend out past the board, this would be the player’s quadrant. Only a hand can cross the diagonal. Arms, legs, shoulders, and the rest of the body should not cross this imaginary line.
Only your hand and arm can touch the board. Elbows must never touch the board., The baselines are the parallel lines running along your side of the board, which create the Carrom bed. The striker can be placed anywhere within the rectangle created by the baselines and the circles at the end.The striker must be touching both base lines.
It can be placed directly in the center of the circle at the end of the lines. Otherwise, it should not touch the circle at all.
The striker should also not be touching the diagonal lines in the corners.
Replace the striker in the Carrom bed every time you shoot.

, Players have different styles of flicking the striker. It is acceptable to use your index or middle finger. Choose whichever one is most comfortable for you.Rest the palm of your hand on the board. Touch your middle or index finger to your thumb, directly behind the striker.
Apply some resistance on your finger, using your thumb, then flick your finger out and hit the striker to flick it across the board.

, If the piece you are aiming for is behind the striker from your seated position, you may need to shoot backward. In this case, you will want to adjust your technique for a back-shot.Shoot with your thumb by curling your index finger over the tip of your thumb. Apply pressure creating resistance on your thumb, then flick your thumb out of the finger lock to hit the striker.
Create a scissor effect with your index and middle finger by slightly overlapping one over the other. Keeping both fingers straight, apply pressure with the top finger, then flick the bottom finger out in a scissor motion. This technique can also be used for a forward shot.

, The white, or light colored player always strikes first. This player is responsible for breaking the pieces from the center by flicking the striker into the arranged pieces to break them apart.If the striker does not leave both lines, replace it and try again.
The first player will get three chances to break.
The player responsible for breaking alternates with each game. If you are playing doubles with four people, the turn moves counter-clockwise.

, The goal is to earn points and win the board by pocketing your pieces. Your turn will continue as long as you pocket your own color pieces by striking them into one of the corner pockets.


When you fail to pocket a piece, or accidentally pocket the opponent's piece, your turn is over.

, Once you have cleared all of your pieces by striking them into the pockets, you are declared the winner of the board. Collect one point for each of your opponent’s pieces which remain on the board once yours have been cleared.The goal is to collect 25 points or 8 boards to win.

, Sinking the opponent’s pieces costs you your turn. Their piece stays in the pocket and puts them closer to winning the board. If you pocket your opponent's last piece, you also lose the board and three points., The queen is the red piece, which was placed in the center of the board. Once you pocket the queen, you must pocket one of your pieces in any of the corners on your next turn for the queen to be considered covered. If you fail to pocket a piece on the next turn, the queen is not covered and is returned to the center of the board.If one of your pieces is pocketed on the same shot when you sink the queen, this counts for covering the queen.
The winner of the board collects three points if they also pocketed the queen. If the losing opponent pocketed the queen, no one gets the queen points for that board.
Once the game reaches 22 points, no more points are issued for covering the queen.

, The queen cannot be pocketed until you first pocket one of your pieces. You must pocket the queen before your last piece is pocketed, so that you can cover the queen with that piece.You lose the board, three points and a point for each of your opponent’s remaining pieces if you sink your last piece before covering the queen.

, If you do not pocket one of your pieces, but you sink the striker, you lose your turn and one piece. Your opponent takes one of your pieces out of a pocket and places it back in the center of the board.


If you have not yet pocketed a piece, it will be placed in the center when you do.
If you sink both your piece and the striker, your piece is placed in the center of the board and you get to go again.

Instead of balls, you use small playing pieces and try to put them in pockets with a heavier piece called a striker. A Carrom board is a large wooden board that contains a variety of markings. Make sure you know the meaning of these markings before you begin to set up the game to play. It's vital to understand the board in order to play carrom effectively.The Carrom board should be positioned 60-70 centimeters (roughly 23 to 28 inches) above the ground.A circular hole sits in each of the board's four corners, and a net is placed under each hole to catch the pieces.There are two foul lines on the board, and two concentric circles stand in the board’s center. The center circle is the size of a playing piece, and the main circle is six times larger. Before beginning the game, the pieces are arranged in these circles.
There are also rectangles drawn on either side of the board. Each player has his or her own rectangle, and must shoot their strikers from these rectangles.;
, There are 9 black pieces in carrom, 9 white pieces, and one red piece (sometimes referred to as ""the queen""), in addition to two pieces known as the ""striker pieces."" Each player has 9 pieces in Carrom, in addition to one striker piece. One player has all black pieces, and the other player has all white pieces. Sometimes, the pieces are referred to as carrommen.The white and black pieces are smooth, wooden pieces that look something like the ones used for the game checkers. In each round, you attempt to use your striker to knock these pieces into the board's pockets.
The red piece is called the queen, and it can be pocketed any time you want after sinking your first piece (the queen's function is similar to the black 8 ball in Billiards). If you have less than 24 points, the queen will add an additional 5 points to your score. If you have more than 24 points, you receive no additional points for pocketing the queen.

, To start the game, put the queen in the board’s center. Then, put six pieces around the queen directly in a circle. Each of those six pieces should touch the queen and its neighboring piece.Position the remaining 12 pieces around the inner circle of six pieces. Make sure each outer piece must touch the inner circle. Alternate the color of the pieces. In other words, the circle should have one red piece, followed by a white piece, followed by a red piece, and so on.
You and your opponent should place your strikers in the rectangular boundaries on either end of the board.

, The game is often played as singles with two opponents, although sometimes people play Carrom in teams. At any rate, teams or players should sit opposite from one another. You and your partner, or your team and your partner's team, should take a seat at opposite ends of the board. You should each have your own rectangle from which to shoot your striker., The striker is the heavier piece you use to hit your pieces into the pockets. If you're new to the game, it's a good idea to practice gripping and hitting the striker a few times before playing. Make sure you flick the striker instead of pushing it. You cannot move or leave your chair when using the striker, and you have to hit the striker from within the rectangular boundary on your end of the board. There are two main grips you can use to hit the striker: the straight grip and the scissors grip.The most commonly used grip is the straight grip. It may be easier to maneuver if you're new to carrom. You hold your hand palm side down and rest your fingertips very lightly on the carrom board. You would hold your index finger just behind the piece and make your shot by flicking your finger. For added control, hold the striker between your thumb and third finger to position it before flicking it.
The scissors shot is less commonly used, but you may find it more comfortable. You would place your hand sideways on the board, so your ring and pinky finger are pressed on the board. You would then hold your middle finger backwards with your index finger, so these two fingers are at a roughly perpendicular angle with your pinky and ring finger. It looks somewhat like a pair of scissors. A shot is made by releasing your middle finger, causing it to snap forward and hit the striker.

, Usually, a coin flip is used to determine who goes first, but there are no strict rules. If you'd rather not do a coin flip, you can follow rules of other board games, such as ""the oldest player goes first"" or ""the tallest player goes first."" Once you've determined who goes first, that player has to break the circle in the middle by taking the first shot with his or her striker.It's unlikely any player will get a piece in the pocket on the first shot. In the event this occurs, however, that player will continue to take turns until he or she fails to pocket a piece.
You must always return your striker to your rectangle before taking a new shot.

, You do not go into a game of carrom knowing whose pieces are black and whose are white. This is determined in play. The first player to pocket a piece must pocket pieces in that color for the rest of the game.The object of carrom is to get all your pieces pocketed before you opponent does. You should also aim to pocket the red piece, sometimes referred to as the queen.
The red piece, or queen, can only be pocketed after you've pocketed a piece of your color.

, A round of carrom ends when one player pockets all of his or her pieces, and the queen has been pocketed. You play rounds until one player has reached 29 points. The first player to hit 29 points wins.Remember, you and your opponent take turns shooting your striker. You can only shoot your striker from within your rectangular boundary.
In the event you pocket a piece, you get to continue to play. You can shoot your striker again, and can continue to shoot your striker until you fail to pocket a piece.

, The queen, or red piece, has to be pocketed by the end of a round. A player must both pocket and ""cover"" the queen. Covering the queen simply means one player has pocketed the queen following the rules of the game. Under certain circumstances, you can pocket the queen but not ""cover"" it, and the queen will be returned to the board.You cannot pocket the queen until you've pocketed at least one piece in your color. In the event you pocket the queen before pocketing any pieces, you have not covered the queen. The queen will be returned to the center of the board.
If you pocket the queen after pocketing one of your own pieces, you have successfully covered the queen. The queen will not be returned to the board and you may receive points for the queen at the conclusion of the round.

, There are fouls in the game of carrom. In the event you or your opponent commits a foul, you are penalized by having one of the pieces in your color returned to the board. The following situations can result in a foul:If you accidentally pocket a striker, this is a foul. You will also receive a foul if you knock your striker or another piece off the board.
If you pocket an opponent's piece, this is a foul. In addition to having one of your pieces returned to the board, pocketing an opponent's piece comes with an additional penalty. If you pocketed and covered the queen earlier in the game, the queen is also returned to the board.
If you pocket your final piece before the queen has been pocketed, both the piece you pocketed and the penalty piece are returned to the board. In other words, two pieces are returned to the board in this case.
If you touch any piece besides your striker, this is a foul.

, The first player to pocket their pieces wins the round, and is then awarded points. However, a round cannot end with the queen still on the board. The queen must have been pocketed and covered by one player for the round to conclude.

, To determine your score, count how many pieces your opponent still has on the board. For example, say your opponent has 5 pieces remaining on the board. Your score would be 5.If you pocketed and covered the queen during the game, an additional 5 points are added to your score as long as your score is below 24. If you had 5 points based on your opponent's pieces, and you covered the queen, your score for the round is 10.
Points add up as you continue to win rounds. Once you reach 24 points total, you no longer get the additional 5 points for covering the queen.

, There is no set number of rounds you play in carrom. You simply play until a player hits 29 points. You add up scores from each round. Eventually, someone should hit 29 points or higher, allowing the game to end.For example, you score 12 points in the first round. Your opponent wins the next round, scoring 9 points. In the following round, you score 12 points again, giving you a score of 24.
In the fourth round, your opponent wins and scores 5 points, giving him or her a total score of 14 points. In the fifth round, you score 8 points. You have a score of 32, exceeding the 29 points you need to win. You have won this game of carrom.

The winner of Carcassonne is the player who has the most points when all of the game tiles have been used., Every game of Carcassonne begins by placing the starting tile in the center of your playing space. The back of this tile looks different from all of the rest of the tiles, so it should be easy to find.Use a large table or other playing space to play Carcassonne because the tiles will sprawl out quite a bit.

, To start the game, every player puts one meeple on the scorecard. As the game progresses and players earn points, they will move their meeples to indicate how many points they have. Each player is responsible for his or her own points., Players will need to draw tiles at random to place them on the board and continue to expand it. Therefore, it is a good idea to shuffle the tiles and place them in a few piles around the playing space. Or, if you have a cloth bag, you can use it to hold the tiles and have players draw from the bag without looking., You can choose the first player at random, have the youngest player go first, or have the person who won the last game you played go first. The first player should begin the game by drawing a tile at random and placing it next to the starting tile so that their features align.Each tile has features on it that must align with each other when you place them. For example, some tiles have roads, while other have fields or cities. You must make sure that the tile you place matches up with the tile or tiles that it touches.

, Play should pass to the left and each player should draw and place a tile next to an existing tile during his or her turn. Players should continue drawing and placing tiles until no tiles are left.Make sure the edges of tile match the edges of any connecting tiles.

, You may use your meeples to claim a road, farm, or city on a tile that you just laid down. You may not place meeples on another player’s previously placed tile. Before you place a meeple, make sure that the territory you will claim has not already been claimed by another player.Place meeples standing up on roads, cities, and cloisters. If you want to claim a field, then you should lay the meeple on its back to indicate that it is a farmer. Farmers remain on the board until the end of the game.

, You cannot place a meeple on a territory that has already been claimed by a fellow player. For example, you can't place a meeple if another player’s meeple is already on the same road/city/farm on connecting tiles., If you complete a road by laying down a tile on your turn, then you can remove the meeple that is on that road, count up the tiles for the road, and add that number to your score. You can then return the meeple that you picked up back to your supply for reuse., When you score points, add them to your score card by moving your scoring meeple right away. Keep in mind that some scores cannot be tallied until the game is over. For example, farmers cannot be scored until the end of the game because their fields may keep expanding.Add 1 point to your score for each road tile that connects to a road you have completed.
Add 2 points to your score for every city you complete, plus an extra 2 points for any small shields that appear within your city.

, A game of Carcassonne is over when all of the tiles have been used up and placed. If at any point you draw a tile that you cannot place because it won’t fit anywhere, that tile is discarded and left out of the rest of the game.If you decide that a tile cannot be played, make sure your fellow players agree that there is nowhere to place the tile. You cannot discard a tile because it would benefit your fellow players and not you. You must play it if it has a place on the board.

, At the end of the game, you will need to add up your points for incomplete roads, cloisters, and farms. All of these things give you extra points that may help you to win the game. The player with the most points wins the game. Check to see if you have any of the following:Incomplete Roads-add 1 point for every tile that is connected to an incomplete road that you own.
Cloisters-add 9 points to your score if you have a complete cloister (if it is surrounded by tiles on all sides) and add 1 point per adjacent tile plus the cloister tile if you have an incomplete cloister (not surrounded by tiles).
Farmers-add 3 points to your score for each farmer that has a city connected to its field. Add another 3 points if the farmer is the only farmer in that field.

, Any basic scratch paper will work well. If you're worried about cheaters, you can have each player write on a clipboard or a stiff book.


Boggle is for two players or more., Pick up the grid with the dome on top and the cubes inside. Turn the domed grid upside down and shake to scramble the dice. Turn the grid right side up and give it a few gentle shakes until all of the dice fall into place.


You want each letter die in its own space before you start.

, The mini hourglass that comes with Boggle is pre-set to run out of sand in three minutes time. Let all the sand fall to the bottom, then, when you're ready to start, flip it and the game will begin!


You can also use a watch or digital timer set to three minutes — the hourglass isn't essential.

, The goal of Boggle is to score points by finding words in the random letters in the grid. The letters you use must be touching vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in a chain. You can't skip or ""jump"" across letters.


When you find a word, write it down on your paper. At the end of the round, you'll use all of the words you found to figure out how many points you've scored.

, Very short words, like ""I,"" ""an,"" and so on are not allowed.

, When you're making a word, you can only use each die once. For example, if you make the word ""neon"", you can't use the ""n"" at the start of the word again at the end of the word.


You can (and should) use the same letter multiple times in separate words. For example, if you find the word ""tear,"" you can use the ""a"" in words like ""apt,"" ""part,"" and so on.

, The words you find don't have to go right-to-left. They can go up, down, backwards, forwards, and diagonally as long as all of the letters are connected in a chain and each letter is used only once.

, It's common for simple words to appear on the Boggle board several times. However, you may only write each word once on your piece of paper. In other words, you're trying to see how many different words you can find.


This rule is also true when a word has more than one definition. For instance, ""tear"" (a drop of water that comes out of your eye) and ""tear"" (the act of ripping something) count as the same word., It's a good idea to have a dictionary handy when you play Boggle to settle disputes. If you can find a word in the dictionary, it's ""fair game.""

, For example, if you see the word ""apples,"" you are actually allowed to write down two words: ""apple"" and ""apples.""

, For example, if you see a word like ""Webster,"" you can also write down ""web"" ""webs."" This is an excellent strategy for scoring as many points as possible.

, Some players choose not to allow the types of words listed below. However, these words are not specifically mentioned in the official Boggle rules provided by Hasbro, which only say that words have to be in a dictionary to count.Proper nouns (i.e., names of specific people, places, etc. that start with a capital letter).Examples: ""Mary,"" ""Cairo,"" ""Microsoft.""
Abbreviations and contractions (i.e., words that use periods or apostrophes to take the place of letters). Examples: ""can't,"" ""A.C.L.U.""
Words borrowed from languages other than English. Examples: ""tete,"" 'bushido,"" ""mazeltov.""

, As soon as the three minutes are over, all players must set their pencils down. Even if you notice new words after this point, they can't count towards your score.

, Starting with the player who shook the Boggle grid, all players take turns reading the words they wrote down. As other players read their words, look at your own list and see whether you wrote down any of the same words.


Whenever two or more players have written down the same word, all players cross this word out. The word will no longer be able to score points for any player.
When it's your turn to read your words, ignore words that you've already crossed off. You're only trying to name words that there's a chance no one else noticed.

, When all the players have narrowed their lists down to only the words that no one else has, have them count the number of letters in these words. The number of letters determines how many points each word is worth.

, The official Boggle scoring rules are as follows:Three or four letters: One point

Five letters: Two points

Six letters: Three points

Seven letters: Five points

Eight letters or more: Eleven points
The ""Qu"" cube counts as 2 letters even though it takes up one space in the grid., Have all the players add up the points from their scoring words. The winner for the round is whoever has the most points overall.


Alternatively, you can play multiple rounds and have the winner be the first person to reach 50, 100, or more points. The official Boggle rules suggest both game styles., As a general rule, it's wise to spend your effort finding a few long, difficult words than it is to look for lots of short, easy words. Not only are longer words worth more points — they're also less likely to be found by other players, which means there's a better chance you'll score points from them.


As an example, scoring a tough eight-letter word like ""acquaint"" means your opponent has to find eleven unique three- or four-letter words to match your score. Since these easy words are more obvious, it will be much harder for her to find eleven that no one else has found.

, The letter S is your best friend in Boggle. Sticking it at the end of a noun or many verbs will instantly get you an extra word that's one letter longer. It's easy to forget this simple trick, so racking up lots of plurals is a great way to find words that your opponents will overlook.


Other common prefixes and suffixes can be used in a similar way. For instance, an ""-ed"" at the end of most verbs will give you a separate word that's two letters longer. Other combinations to look for are ""er,"" ""est,"" ""ier,"" ""de,"" ""re,"" and ""es.""

, Short words may not be the most effective way to get points, but if you're crafty, they can push you over the edge to victory. A good way to find short words that other people won't is to use anagrams — different words made from the same letters. You may be surprised how many words you can make from a handful of five or six letters.


For instance, if you have the letters H, E, A, R, and T in a cluster, ""heart"" is the obvious word that everyone will notice. However, it's not as likely that everyone will notice ""earth,"" ""rate,"" ""tear,"" ""rat,"" ""heat,"" ""tea,"" ""hater,"" ""art,"" and the other words made from these letters.

, Some Boggle sets come with a ""challenge cube"" that you can use in place of one of the other letter dice (chosen at random). Successfully making a word with the challenge cube gives you five extra points for that word, which makes it a great scoring opportunity. Be careful, though — everyone else will be looking to make words with the challenge cube, so look for difficult words that others are unlikely to find.


When you're playing with the challenge cube, the standard Boggle scoring rules are a little different. See below:Three letters: One point

Four letters: Two points

Five letters: Three points

Six letters: Four points

Seven letters: Five points

Eight letters or more: Six points

",How to Do String Art," When it comes to string art, you essentially need three things: string, nails, and some type of surface. Here are the details on all three:










String. The type you use depends on the look you want to create. Embroidery floss works well for more delicate pieces. Yarn and thicker strings work well for pieces that pack a punch.

Nails. Veneer pins work very well – they have small heads that let paper slide easily off (if you're using paper).You could also use small, regular nails from the hardware store. Colored nails can be a nice touch, too, especially if you use more than one for the juxtaposition.

A surface. Canvas or wood are the basic options. However, do know that if you're using canvas, the nails will likely be wobbly and harder to work with. You can use plain wood, or you can use wood covered in felt or cloth.;
, Here you have two basic options: a paper transfer or a stencil. Let's weigh the pros and cons:









For a paper transfer, you simply find an image or word you like on your computer, and print it to size. You'd place it on the board and put nails into the paper. When you're done, you need to take off the paper up and over the head of the nail. If the nails allow this, it's a good, simple, cheap option.
A stencil transfer is easier to work with. You simply put the nails in the holes of the stencil and remove the stencil when you're done (it comes right off). That being said, it is more expensive and you are limited to what stencils you can find at your local craft stores.

, If you're using a block of wood (or cork floor tile), you may want to cover the surface with cloth or felt. Secure it on all sides with hot glue if you have it handy – if not, adhesive spray, double-sided tape, or white glue will do the job, too.









Whatever you're using (canvas, wood, or otherwise), you may want to paint the background beforehand. A solid pop of red or orange can turn an otherwise simple string art shape into something that makes more of an artistic statement.
Or you could just leave your surface bare. Simple can be quite striking, too.

, You're probably using a piece of paper with a shape or word on it or a stencil, right? Whichever one you use, center it on your surface where you'd like the image to be. Secure the design to the surface with tape on the edges where it won't interfere with the string. This is important as you don't want the design to shift while you're pinning.








, Following the printed pattern, place nails as close together as you want – the more the nails are scrunched together, the more vibrant the piece will be. That being said, about 1/4"" (6mm) apart is a good place to start.









Grip the pins with needle-nose pliers to make it easier to hammer the pins in. It also keeps you from slamming the hammer into you fingers.
Hammer each pin only until about 1/4"" (6mm) protrudes from the surface. You want the nails to be very stable and not be going anywhere anytime soon.

, Once all the pins or nails are in, un-tape each corner of the design. Then either slide off the stencil or pull the paper up through the nails. If you're working with paper, be patient – you don't want to take any of the nails with you. This may take a second – just pull up each section little by little if it's not easily coming off.









If applicable, place the pattern nearby, positioning it so the numbers on the pattern correlate to the pins you hammered into the floor tile.

, Determine your starting point and and tie a knot around that pin (or nail). Dab a bit of clear-drying glue or clear nail polish on the knot and let it dry.









While it's drying, map out the design in your mind. Are you going to do it haphazardly (which does work) or incrementally, making the entire thing symmetric? Are you working with different layers of colors? Do you want to weave them in and out? How you go from nail to nail will greatly determine the look of your end product.

, There's no wrong way to thread and weave around the nails. You could do it immediately across from the current nail or weave up and down or side to side. And the beauty of string art? If you mess up, just un-weave and try again. This part is all about experimenting.









Have you ever thought about weaving outside of the pattern? You'll have to line the surface with nails, but the inverted version of your art (where the shape is exposed and its surroundings are woven with thread) can be a new take on an otherwise basic piece.
You could also use beads, especially if you want certain areas of your piece to pop. Just thread them on and secure them with glue.
If it turns out your string is too short, just take your new string and tie the ends together. You may want to put a dab of glue on this knot, too.

, Are you happy with just the one color? Do you want to create multicolored layers? Maybe a different pattern? This is up to you. When you like it, your work is done.









If you're interested in changing up patterns, some like to switch up the number of pins they leave between weaves. Start with 5 pins between each weave for one layer, 6 for the next, and so on.

, It'll probably make most sense if you can knot it in a corner. Then, cut off the string as close to the knot as possible and once more, secure it with a dab of glue. Your first piece of string art is completed!

, Make sure the knot is secure and not too big. Some toy makers sell string already in a loop especially for this game. Double-check that the string can slide smoothly across your skin without causing a rope burn.

, Start with your hands in front of you and both thumbs pointing up. Place a section of the string over the side of your thumbs facing your chest. Your hands should be roughly six inches apart with palms facing each other., You may need to bring your palms closer together slightly. Dip your hands slightly forward with your wrist if necessary.


If your string is properly positioned, it should be held diagonally across your palm, looped over the back base of each pinky finger and thumb.

, Keep your hands level with your chest, palms facing each other. The result should be a rectangular loop that isn't sagging. This is called Position 1 or First Position., To do this, start by moving your palms close together so that they nearly touch. Lower your right hand so that your right index finger lines up with the center of your left palm. Move your right index finger under the string so that it loops over your fingernail., Make your palms face each other. Spread your arms back apart to tighten the string. The string doesn't need to be taut. Just make sure it doesn't sag, or the string may tangle.

, Loop the string crossing your right hand over your left index finger. Bring your arms back apart with your palms facing each other. The string should loop over the backs of each of your thumbs, index fingers, and pinky fingers. If there is a loop over a different finger or one missing from these digits, start over., When your fingers are spread, your figure should be vertically, horizontally, and diagonally symmetrical. The string should cross twice between your palms, forming two Xs in the center.


One way to think about the proper shape is a large diamond in the center connected to two triangles by its top and bottom angles. The other two angles are at your index fingers. The bases of the triangles are the parallel string segments between your thumbs and your pinky fingers.

, A string is any straight section. A noose is any loop around your digits. Most string figure guides will use this nomenclature.

, The near thumb string is the straight piece of string closest to your chest, while the far thumb strings are the sections running from your thumb to the first X. The near index finger strings are the sections running from the center of this X to your index fingers, while the far index finger strings start at your index fingers and end at the further X. The near pinky finger strings begin at the further X and end at your pinky fingers. Finally, the far pinky finger string is the section that runs between your right and your left pinky fingers.


Some guides will use ""little finger"" instead of ""pinky finger"" and ""forefinger"" or ""pointer finger"" instead of ""index finger."", There are six nooses, three for each hand. They are the left and right thumb nooses, index finger nooses, and pinky finger nooses. The nooses should sit right on top of the last knuckles of their corresponding digits., Hold your hands open with your palms facing outward. The near string should be short, just the distance between your two hands. The far string should be very long., Bring your hands close together and use your left thumb to hook the string around itself. Return your left hand to its original position. There should now be a section of string extending from under your right index finger over to your left thumb., Mirror Step 2 using your right hand and the dangling left index string. Return your right hand to its original position, palm still down. The string should now make an X between your hands with a short near string across your index fingers and a long far string across your thumbs., Rotate your wrists so that your palms now face each other. A properly-formed Navajo Opening should be much less angular than Opening A. The nooses will be loose and wide. There should be two parallel strings oriented inward, one connected the index fingers and the other connected the thumbs. Underneath these two strings should be an X formed by two strings connecting the index fingers to the thumbs on opposite hands., Your hands should be held at chest level with your index fingers pointing upwards. Make sure that the far string is short, while the near string is very long.This opening is sometimes called the Index Opening.

, Move your hands closer together. Use your right index finger and thumb to pinch the slack into a loop, making a cross within the far string. Hold the loop with the index finger and thumb of each hand so that the loop is pointed upwards with the cross oriented down., Turn your wrists slightly outwards in order to hook your index fingers into the loop. Each of your index fingers should now have two nooses. There should also now be two straight near strings and a set of crossed far strings., A properly-formed Murray Opening should consist of two nooses on each index finger. One noose should rest on the bottom knuckle, while the second noose should cross near the base of your finger nails. It should look like a wide rectangle with an X crossing through its center.

Create the looped string.,
Loop the string around your hands.,
Pull the palm strings.,
Tighten the string.,
Pick up the far forefinger string.,
Move the lower thumb string.,
Drop the pinky string.",How to Make the Cup and Saucer With String," Start with a piece of string measuring approximately 60cm long.If you already have a continuous Cat’s Cradle string, you can use that string, but otherwise, tie the two ends of the string together to create a large loop.;
, Loop the string around both of your hands so that the string loops on the outside of both of your thumbs and both of your pinkies. The string should run across both of your palms, specifically over the three inner fingers (pointer, middle, ring).An easy way properly loop the string is to hold the string with one hand, and touch together your thumb and pinky of your other hand. Place your thumb and pinky inside the hole of the looped string. You will now be holding up the string by your thumb and pinky.
Then touch together your thumb and pinky of your other hand, and again place them inside the hole of the looped string. Pull your hands apart to make the string taut, and fully widen your hands.

, With the string taut, bring your right pointer finger over to the left palm string. Slide your pointer finger under the left palm string and pull it back to your right side.Then bring your left pointer finger to your right palm. Slide your pointer finger under the left palm string (directly beneath your right pointer finger), and pull it back to your left side.


It does not matter if you first pull the string with your left or right pointer finger. The formation will still be the same.
Some people use their pointer fingers to pull the palm strings, while others use their middle fingers. It is really based on personal preference, but if you have smaller hands, it may be easiest to complete the cup and saucer if you pull the palm strings using your pointer fingers.

, Your hands should be pulled apart as far as the string will allow, with your fingers pointing up, spread apart, and palms facing toward each other. This is called “Opening A.”It is very important that you tighten the string after each step by pulling your hands apart from each other. A taut string will lead to easy visibility of the strings, and crisp string formations.

, Use your thumbs to reach over the strings to the furthest pointer finger strings.Hook your thumbs underneath these far pointer finger stings and pull your thumbs back toward their normal position.

, Move the lower thumb string (running straight across from thumb to thumb) over your two thumbs. Some people do this by using their teeth to pull the string up and over their thumbs, and some people manipulate their thumbs to roll right under the lower thumb string.You can alternatively try to lift each side of the bottom thumb string using your opposite pointer finger and thumb to pinch the string and move it. How you move the lower thumb string is all based on personal preference.

, Release the string from your two pinky fingers by letting the string fall from the pinky fingers.Pull your thumbs and hands apart to reveal the “cup and saucer” formation. You can tilt your hands horizontally so the cup and saucer can be positioned more realistically.


For an added trick, you can use your teeth to pull the top string of the “cup” and pull your pointer fingers downward to create the “Eiffel Tower.”

Find a suitable piece of string.,
Get another person to help you play.,
Hand off the string after every turn.,
Restart the game if you make a mistake.,
Choose a player to start the game.,
Loop the string around the back of both hands.,
Wrap the string around your wrists one more time.,
Catch the inner strand of the string with your middle fingers.,
Turn Cat’s Cradle into “Soldier’s Bed.” The other player should now pinch the two center ‘X’s of Cat’s Cradle with the thumb and forefinger of both hands.,
Transition to “Candles.” Inside the Soldier’s Bed formation, you should see two more ‘X’s in a pattern similar to Cat’s Cradle.,
Make “The Manger.” From here, your partner will hook the top strand with their right pinky, then reach across from the opposite side to snag the bottom strand with their left.,
Start the sequence over.",How to Play The Cat's Cradle Game," Any type of cord will work as long as it fits around your hands. However, you’ll have the easiest time using a piece that’s around 40 inches (about 120cm) in length. This will ensure that the string is long enough to give your hands plenty of room to maneuver without getting in the way or becoming unwieldy. Tie the string together at the ends so that it creates a circular loop.Try cutting a piece of string, yarn or twine to just the right length to fit you and your partner’s hands.
If you can’t find anything else to play with, use a tied shoestring.;
, Because of the sequential nature of the game, it’s not possible to play Cat’s Cradle with only one person. You’ll need a partner both to help you form new shapes and to take the string from you at the next turn.You can theoretically play Cat’s Cradle with as many people as you want—simply go in a circle or choose a specific order to transfer the string from person to person.
The game will go more smoothly if you’re playing with someone whose hands are roughly the same size as your own.

, Decide which player will get the game started. This person will twist the string into Cat’s Cradle, the game’s opening formation. After this shape has been made, transfer the string to the other player’s fingers fingers without breaking the formation. The game will proceed in this fashion until you miss a shape.Let go of the string carefully to keep it from coming unraveled.
Both players should practice making each of the various shapes so they’ll know exactly where to place their fingers when you pass the string.

, The game is over when you pull the string in the wrong place or end up forming a shape from which no other shapes can be made. If this happens, start back from the beginning with Cat’s Cradle. Keep playing until you can run through the entire sequence flawlessly.Practice slowly the first few times until you get the hang of making shapes and handoffs.
For an added challenge, increase your speed each time you successfully complete a cycle.

, This person should be the only one holding the string. It doesn’t matter which one of you makes the first move—the game will play out the same way in either situation.By the time you go through one complete cycle, your roles will be reversed. The player who started with Cat’s Cradle will then be the one assisting with the following shape.
If you mess up, begin a new game with the other player starting things off.

, Let it rest just behind your knuckles. Keep your thumbs on the outside of the strands. This will allow you to move freely and will also keep the string from slipping off your hands.Keep your fingers clear of the string. That way it won’t accidentally get tangled up.
Some people prefer to lace the string around their middle and ring fingers rather than their whole wrist. This is mostly a matter of preference.

, Rotate your hands so that the loop is doubled up around your palms. You should now have one strand running in front of each palm in addition to the ones wrapped around the backs of your hands. This will put you in the correct position to start weaving the first shape.You should turn your wrists in such a way that only one strand gets wrapped around twice. Otherwise, both strands will twist together and ruin the setup.
If you’re having trouble looping the string around your wrists a second time, have your partner help you., Reach across and slide the middle finger of one hand under the strand looped in front of your palm. Do the same with your opposite hand, making sure to only grab the section in front. Then, pull the strands apart so that they form a double ‘X’ in the middle. This shape is the “Cat’s Cradle.”Guide your fingers directly through the center of the loop and make sure not to grab any other strands by accident.
Once you’ve formed Cat’s Cradle, the game can officially begin., They’ll then pull the ‘X’s around the outside of the bottom strands and up through the center. As they do, gently slide your hands out of the string. When the other player opens up their thumb and forefinger, the resulting shape is known as “Soldier’s Bed.”Soldier’s Bed looks very similar to Cat’s Cradle, but the finger positioning is different. This makes it possible to transfer the string to the other player when forming subsequent shapes.
An inverted version of Soldier’s Bed is known as “Diamonds,” and can be made by wrapping the strands over the top of the two middle 'X's rather than underneath.

, Pinch these ‘X’s where they intersect lengthwise, with your fingers facing the other player’s hands. Once again, bring these ‘X’s around the outside of the shape and up through the middle. As your partner removes their hands, pull the string taut and spread your thumb and forefinger to form “Candles,” the next configuration.Candles is recognizable by the internal pattern of parallel lines.
This is a very useful transitional shape, as it gives you the freedom to go forward or backward in the sequence.
Candles is also known as “Chopsticks” in Korea and “Mirror” in parts of Europe., While holding on with their pinky fingers, they’ll bring their thumb and pointer finger under and around the inner two strands. When you hand off the string, you’ll have formed The Manger.The Manger is essentially an upside-down version of Cat’s Cradle.If you continue on from The Manger in the same order, you’ll make Diamonds, which is an inverted Soldier’s Bed., After you’ve made it to The Manger, you can repeat the first few movements to keep the game going. Keep in mind that at this point the string will be inverted, so certain movements will have to be reversed in order to correctly produce the next shape. This will make the game more difficult the second time around. Have fun!The game can continue in this way until you make a mistake or end up with a shape that won’t allow any other shapes to be made.See if you can invent new configurations based on your knowledge of the basic shapes.

;
, Secure the string in a square knot so it won't pull loose. Use a square knot and cut off the excess when the string is tight.








, Start with the string across your palm in an open position. Your thumb and pinky should be looped by the string. Your three middle fingers should stay out.







, Guide your finger through the string in front of your three left fingers. Return your right hand to its original position.







, Guide your finger through the string directly under your right index finger. Return your left hand to its original position. Hold the string taut between your two hands.







, There should now be four strings running between your hands. There will only be one “X” between your hands.







, You’ll need to be careful only to hook the last string away from you under the rest of the strings. Bring your hands back to the original position.







, Move your thumbs over the first string on your index finger, and hook them beneath the second string on your index fingers. Return to the original position.








, Make sure only to drop the strings wrapped around your pinkies.







, Move your pinkies over the last string and under the adjacent string. Return your hands to the original position.








, This creates the Cat's Whiskers position. You should only have the string looped around your pinky and index fingers.







, Put your thumbs over the two strings on your index fingers. Then carefully position them under the first string on your pinky fingers. You should now have loops around your pinkies, index fingers and thumbs.








Try not to pull too tight. You want a little tension but not too much.

, Take the loop on your right index finger and place it over your thumb. The top loop should be on both your right thumb and right index finger.







, On your right thumb, use your same hand to position the bottom string on your thumb over your thumb. You should see a small triangle form between your right index finger and thumb.








, Now use your left hand to pull your index loop over your thumb. Then take the bottom string on your thumb over your thumb.









You should now have one string over each thumb., You’ll need to do a complex move to finish the ladder. This part trips people up, so take it slowly. You’re going turn your hands so they face away from you while doing two things. Put your index fingers through the two small triangles next to your index and thumb.

Hover around closed doors.,
Listen through the keyhole.,
Use a thin glass.,
Sit quietly in the next room.,
Crack the window.,
Eliminate other sounds.",How to Eavesdrop1," Maybe you want to know how mad your parents really are about your D in Chemistry, or what your son is saying to his friend on the phone, or what your roommate really thinks about you. Sneak quietly to the door and listen.


If someone walks by and sees you, don’t act suspicious. Instead of running off in a hurry, seem like you have a reason to be there, such as picking up something you just happened to drop outside of the door.
If one of the people you are eavesdropping on comes out of the door, you could pretend you were about to knock and say something like, “Oh, I was just coming to find you. I needed to ask you a question.” Then come up quickly with a question to ask!;
, You may be able to hear more if you crouch down and put your ear to the door. It would be a good idea to drop something very obvious on the floor (such as a pile of papers) so that if anyone comes by they will just think you are kneeling on the floor to pick up what you have dropped.

, If you are trying to hear through a wall, you can use a thin drinking glass to amplify the sound.Place the rim of the glass to the wall and position your ear on the other end.


It’s best to use this method in a place where you won’t be seen, such as your bedroom. You will have a harder time pretending not to be eavesdropping if someone sees you listening through a drinking glass!

, You can position yourself in a good location to eavesdrop after a conversation you want to hear has already begun. Just be quiet about it, and be sure to pretend to have a good reason to be there.


For instance, maybe your competition at work has a meeting with the boss, and the boss’s office is next to the supply closet. Pretend you desperately need some paperclips. In fact, you seem to be out of everything at the moment so you need to spend a while stocking up—long enough, at least, to eavesdrop just a tiny bit.
If you’re at home, your parents might be having a discussion in the kitchen that you want to overhear. Go into the living room (or whichever room is near the kitchen) and sit quietly, but have an excuse ready if they ask you what you are doing. Maybe you left something in the living room and you need to look under all the couch cushions… repeatedly.

, You can catch a conversation going on outside your room by opening your window. Don’t be too obvious, though. Instead of opening the window all the way, just slowly open it an inch or two. Sit down with your ear near the window so that the people you are eavesdropping on don’t see you.


You could also listen to a conversation happening inside your house from the outside via an open window, but you’ll have to do some pre-planning. In this instance, you should crack the window prior to the conversation you want to overhear and position yourself outside. Crouch down by the window on the outside of the house so no one inside sees you.

, Wherever you are trying to eavesdrop, it’s important to cancel out any noise other than the conversation you are trying to overhear.


In addition to turning off the T.V. and stereo or MP3 player, be sure to turn off overhead fans and any devices, such as a computer or printer, that make less obvious noises. Even small sounds can interfere with your attempt to overhear!

"
"
Plant a recording device.,
Purchase a spy tool.,
Pick up the other line.,
Employ social media.",How to Eavesdrop2," You can use a small digital recorder if you have one, or a recording app on your phone. Be sure to place it in an inconspicuous place that is still in a close proximity to the people you want to record.


Be aware, however, that recording conversations in order to eavesdrop is illegal in some places and punishable by law., If eavesdropping is your favorite hobby, you might consider purchasing a tool that will allow you to overhear conversations easily. A small device such as the Next Room Eavesdropping Device allows you to amplify conversations through walls and listen through headphones., Very few people have a home telephone now, but if you do live in a house that hasn’t yet gone “cell-phone-only,” you can pick up another line and listen to the conversation. Make sure you don’t breathe too hard or giggle, though!

, Eavesdropping doesn’t always have to be done in person. You can of course check out conversations on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to find out who is talking to whom and what they are saying.

Familiarize yourself with the game board and pieces.,
Understand the object of the game.,
Set up the game.,
Decide who will go first.",How to Play Congkak1," The congkak board consists of two rows of seven holes called the houses and two bigger holes called the storehouse or home. Each player uses the side of the board that is closest to him or her. Each player starts the game with seven shells in his or her houses., The object of the Congkak is to move your shells into the storehouse that is situated on your left-hand side. You move your shells by picking up all of the shells in one of your houses and depositing one into each of the houses to the left of the space. The first person to empty all of his or her houses is the winner.You may also put one shell into your storehouse, but do not put any shells into your opponent’s storehouse.
If you drop a shell into an empty house that you own, then you get to take all of the shells from your opponent’s house that is across from your house and put them into your storehouse.

, Place the Congkak board on a level playing surface between you and your opponent. You should each have 49 shells or Congkak seeds each. Before the game starts fill your seven houses with seven shells or Congkak seeds. Make sure that your opponent does the same. Both of you should leave your storehouses empty., Take a moment to decide who will take the first turn. You can determine who will go first by flipping a coin, allowing the youngest player to go first, or letting the person who won the last game you played together go first."

Practice if needed.",How to Make an Eiffel Tower With String1," If you are new to string shapes, it can be tricky. The instructions will make more sense to a person who has gotten the hang of it. So, be prepared to start over a few times before it comes easily. It is recommended to try the simple Eiffel Tower before moving on to the elaborate one. Many of the directions in the elaborate method will make more sense if you have tried them out with the simple Eiffel Tower.;
, Any type of string should work but it needs to be at least three feet long if you are a child or have very small hands, or at least four feet long if you have larger hands.

, It can be hard to scroll down if your hands are 'tied' and no one is around to help you. Before you start making your Eiffel Tower, position your cursor over the 'down' triangle on the scroll bar so you can move from step to step using your palms, pinkie, or elbow to bump the left mouse button. Or, make sure no element on the page is selected so you can bump the down arrow on your keyboard.


If you are using a touch screen device, you should be able to use some part of your hand to scroll down. You might even try using your nose.

, Trim off any excess string coming off the ends of the knot.You should now have a complete loop of string.

, Place the string over both of your thumbs. Now position your hands so that the palms are facing each other and are at least a foot away from each other. Move your pinkie fingers under the string so that the string is now hooked over them as well. Pull the string taut.In other words, slide your pinkies into the loop from underneath, and then make them straight again. Afterwards, when pulled taut with your palms facing each other, the loop will be in a rectangular shape behind your fingers and pinkies, but in front of your pointer, middle, and ring fingers.

, You should hook the opposite side's string where it is going in front of your middle three fingers over the palm.


Repeat this with your other hand as well, looping the string onto your pointer finger from the middle of the opposite hand.
Pull the string figure taut once again. Now you have your string figure in ""open a"" position. This position is the starting position for many string figures.
Holding your hands vertically, from top to bottom you will see a downward pointing triangle, a diamond, and an upward pointing triangle.

, This will be the piece of string on the farther side your pointer finger. In other words, the two strings you count from your thumb include the one actually looped around it.


After the third string is looped, pull your thumbs back out to their normal position, pulling the figure taut while you do.
You should now have two loops of string on each of your thumbs, a lower loop, which was the original on your thumbs, and an upper, which you just hooked onto.

, Leaving the string you just looped over your thumbs in place, you will be releasing the string that was looped over your thumbs at the very beginning. In other words, this piece of string is extending from the outer edge of one thumb to the other.The easiest way to do this is with your teeth. Be careful to keep everything else where it is. Grab the string with your teeth and pull it over your thumbs, making sure to go around the string that will stay on your thumbs. Then release your teeth, and pull taut again.


If you experienced with making string figures, you can also do this by rotating your thumbs in a circle down toward your palms. As you do this, you will make sure that you are still hooked onto the upper loops while the upper loops are released.
Make sure to keep your string figure pretty taut while completing this step. It's important that you don't let loops other than the top ones on your thumbs come off your fingers.

, Pulling the string tight as the loops are released will make it so that you do not lose any other loops.

, Now you should see the classic string figure ""cup and saucer.""


This string figure is explained fully, with illustrations here.

, Be sure that even though there is slack in your figure that all of the loops on stay on your fingers.

, This is the piece of string you just released from your pinkies. It should have settled between your thumbs. Pull the string in your teeth up toward the tips of your fingers.If you're not keen on holding it with your teeth, nail a small tack to a board that won't move when you pull on it. Attach the string to the tack instead of your teeth.

, The result should look like the Eiffel Tower.

, Once you have gotten the basic motion down, you may find that the the one in the picture looks more like the Eiffel Tower than yours. It should only take you a few seconds to do this after practice, so play with the string to get the shape right. Experimenting with the tautness may help you get a better looking Eiffel Tower.

Feign absorption.,
Bring a prop.,
Find a good position.,
Get out and about.",How to Eavesdrop3," Maybe you are at home, school, or work and plan to eavesdrop on a family member, schoolmate, or coworker. Maybe you’re even in the same room (or the next cubicle). Your main goal should be to look extremely absorbed in whatever you are doing so that the person you want to eavesdrop on won’t be suspicious. They might even forget you are even there!


If you are at work, look intently at your computer screen while frantically typing. You might be typing gibberish, but the person in the next cubicle will just think you are concentrating on your work (and not his or her conversation).
At home or school, put on your headphones and grab a book or magazine. Look completely disinterested in what is going on in the room; be surprised that other people are even there. The look on your face, if approached or “interrupted” from your magazine and music, should say: “Wow, I didn’t even realize you were in here having this private conversation !”

, If you have a prop, people will be less likely to think you are paying attention to them. Grab a book, your phone, or your MP3 player. You should look like you are doing something other than listening in on people’s conversations, so pretend to read, scroll through your phone, or listen to music.


Be sure your prop is one that helps you blend in, not stand out! You don’t want people to notice you at all

, In shared, public spaces, the busier the place, the better. Sit down on a bench or in the middle of park where people are hanging out or walking by.


Alternately, walk around and listen closely for a good conversation. If you hear a snippet of a conversation that interests you, sit down close (but not too close) to the people you want to eavesdrop on. Pretend to be interested in your book, phone, or music.

, If you enjoy eavesdropping as a leisure activity, taking public transport, eating out alone, browsing a store, and hanging out at a coffee shop will put you in a good position to overhear some interesting conversations.


Instead of driving yourself to work or around town for your weekend errands, take the bus or the subway. You may have better luck on weekends or evenings when people are headed out on the town, since people who commute to work are usually solo travelers and aren’t generally engaged in conversations.
When eating out alone, try to sit near a large party—the more boisterous, the better. If the hostess sits you at a table away from other groups, ask politely if you could have a different table—perhaps a high top near the restaurant’s bar, if a lot of people are hanging out there.
While shopping, don’t just make a bee-line for the items on your list. Instead, wander the aisles of the supermarket, convenience store, or neighborhood shop. Pick up items and look at them; walk slowly and listen for conversations on the aisles close to you.
Grab something to drink on the weekend at a coffee shop and stick around for a while. You could do this during the week, too, but weekends are better because people are out and about with friends (rather than scrambling to get work done on their lunch break during the week).

You should also drop a shell into your storehouse each time you pass it, but do not deposit any shells into your opponent's storehouse., If the last shell that you deposit falls into your own storehouse, then you get to take another turn. In this case, you may scoop up the shells from another of your houses and deposit them into other houses., Empty storehouses on your opponent’s side of the board will create an obstacle for you. During a turn, if you drop your last shell into one of your opponent’s empty houses, then you lose a turn.Try your best to avoid your opponent’s empty houses so that you do not lose any turns.

, The goal of Congkak is to have the most shells in your storehouse at the end of the game. During a turn, if you manage to drop your last shell into an empty house on your side of the board, then you get to collect the shells that are opposite that house.Take the shells from the corresponding house on your opponent’s side of the board and put them into your storehouse.

, After you and your opponent have both emptied your houses, the game is over. To determine a winner, count up the shells in your storehouse. Whoever has the most shells is the winner!"

Redistribute your shells into your houses.,
Play using the normal rules.,

Place seven shells into each house beginning with the house that is closest to your storehouse.If you have more than 49 shells, then put the extras into your storehouse.
If you have less than 49 shells, then some of your houses will have fewer than seven shells or may even be empty. Empty houses are considered “burnt.” If a player drops a shell into a burnt house, then that seed goes straight into his or her opponent’s storehouse.

, Play your next round of Congkak just like you played the first round. Observe all of the same rules as you play, but you do not need to count up the shells at the end of each round. Just collect your shells and redistribute at the end of each round., You and your opponent can continue to redistribute the shells and play Congkak until one of the players has no shells left. The player with all of the shells at the end of the game is the winner."

Know what a James Bond lifestyle is.,
Take care of your appearance.,
Be clean.,
Learn how to gamble.,
Learn the art of seduction.,
Look wealthier than you are.,
Master hand-to-hand combat.,
Get in shape.",How to Have a James Bond Lifestyle," It's all about being sophisticated, suave, and smart. Never forget this; if you lose any of these at any time, it's over.;
, The first impression is the person's appearance. Always remember to wear nice, clean clothes - not something you found in your wardrobe. It also has to fit the situation; you're not likely to go to a wedding in shorts & a tropical t-shirt. Define your 'casual look' as something not too formal or exaggerated, but still very smart and smooth. If you're not going to a meeting or doing anything formal, there's no need for a suit. To have an idea of what a casual but still sophisticated look is, watch the latest Bond film, Quantum of Solace.

, Have at least two showers per day. Never forget to use a smooth deodorant and perfume. You might not notice, but this is very important. Have a nice, short hairstyle. Long hair for men is not sophisticated at all, it actually may even look dirty. Also remember to shave, it makes your face look much cleaner. Your hair must also smell good, use a shampoo. And don't overlook the details - clipped and clean nails and, of course, clean mouth. Hygiene makes all the difference.

, How many times have we seen Bond gambling at beautiful casinos? His two favorite games are Baccarat Chemin de Fer and Texas Hold'em Poker. There are thousands of guides in the net which cover how to play, strategies and everything there is to know. At the beginning, never bet any money, try downloading some online gambling softwares - they're very useful. However, limit yourself to know or play just some games - let's say, three popular ones and two not so known. If you learn how to play, for instance, fifteen card games, you are going to look like a paranoiac gambler. Also, never forget that you play for fun, not for money, so don't get angry if you lose once or twice.

, The famous Bond girls. You're certainly not going to get any if you have lame pick-up lines. The truth is that girls pay more attention towards your body language than what you say. Always remember to lock eye contact - never look at her body, it will just make her despise you. Don't cross your arms. Open arms make you look more receptive. If she smiles, you smile. You might eventually have to smile first. If she doesn't react positively at the beginning, give up - your chances are now close to zero. Avoid flirting too much, that's a very uncomfortable sexual harassment. If you can manage your body language, there's not that much of a necessity for good pick-up lines. If she reacts positively, a 'how are you doing' will just be fine.

, You can't have a wonderful James Bond lifestyle if you look poor. The unfortunate reality is that people with more money are likely to have better relationships and contacts than people without money. Happily, a big part of this step is psychological. Always walk around with cash so that you can spend it and never run out of it. Of course you're not going to take the entire money from your bank account, but make sure you have enough to spend on a day. A money clip is also very fashionable and makes you look wealthier. It might not look so now, but if you do this you are actually going to feel wealthier. You will realize you have money and that it doesn't hurt to spend it a little. Just remember not to splash out too much, you're not supposed to have an empty pocket - still, don't be afraid to spend some money.

, James Bond knows karate, boxing and judo. He also knows five ways to kill a man with a single blow. Don't worry, you don't need to be a black belt in every martial art in the planet. However, try to learn the basics of martial arts and self-defense. Know how to defend yourself, but never be aggressive or you're more likely to become 'James Bully'. The most important: if you're in a situation you're dealing with people with any kind of weapon, you're unarmed and your life or health is threatened, the best thing to do is surrender. Take in count numerical advantage as well. It's all about judging the situation and making the best move. Bond has surrendered many times, because he knew what was the best choice. Just check out movies like Casino Royale, Goldeneye and The World is not Enough and you will see what I'm talking about.

, In order to complete his assignments, James Bond has to be physically fit. If you have seen Bond's body in Casino Royale (and shortly displayed in Quantum of Solace trailer), you will know what I'm talking about. Search for quality gyms in your area and, if possible, ask a specialist what kind of exercise you should do to get in good shape. If you can't afford a gym or you don't have time for it, do some exercises on your own at home - however, remember that doing exercises on your own, mainly musculature building, might get you hurt. Know the proper way to do the exercise and, most important: do it on a regular basis. No exercise will get your body fit for eternity. There are many alleged training programs Daniel Craig did for his part as Bond in Casino Royale, but all of them are untrue or loosely based on what he really did. In fact, nobody knows for sure his exact training program, but know that he worked on his arms (biceps, triceps and an emphasis on shoulders), torso (chest and abdominal exercises) and legs. A good James Bond training program is available at James Bond Lifestyle - once again, the website is not mine.

Position your Jacob's Ladder vertically, with one of your hands on the top and one on the bottom.",How to Make an Eiffel Tower With String2," If you are new to string shapes, it can be tricky. The instructions will make more sense to a person who has gotten the hang of it. So, be prepared to start over a few times before it comes easily. It is recommended to try the simple Eiffel Tower before moving on to the elaborate one. Many of the directions in the elaborate method will make more sense if you have tried them out with the simple Eiffel Tower.

, You can use any type of string but it should be at least three feet long for children and at least four feet long for adults.

, It can be hard to scroll down if your hands are 'tied' and no one is around to help you. Before you start making your Eiffel Tower, position your cursor over the 'down' triangle on the scroll bar so you can move from step to step using your palms, pinkie, or elbow to bump the left mouse button. Or, make sure no element on the page is selected so you can bump the down arrow on your keyboard.


If you are using a touch screen device, you should be able to use some part of your hand to scroll down. You might even try using your nose.

, Form a secure knot and then trim off any excess string coming off the ends.You should now have a complete loop of string.

, Begin the string figure by placing the string over both of your thumbs. With your palms facing each other, hook your pinkie fingers under the string so that the string is now looped over them as well. Pull the string tight, but not too tight., This loop should be made on the opposite string where it is going in front of your middle three fingers. Repeat this step with your other hand, taking your pointer finger and hooking the string from the middle of the opposite hand.


Pull the string figure taut once again.
Holding your hands vertically, from top to bottom you will see a downward pointing triangle, a diamond, and an upward pointing triangle.
This position is called ""open a."" It is the starting position for many other string figures as well., Pull the string figure tight as you do it, so that you don't lose any other loops.

, There should be four strings running between your hands.

,, Then hook them beneath the second string on your index fingers.

, Once you have dropped them, turn your hands so that your palms are facing up.

, Return your hands to the original position after you have done this, with your palms facing each other.

, You may need to use your teeth if you are new to string figures and your fingers aren't nimble enough for this move yet. Pull the string figure taut. You now are in the string figure called Cat's Whiskers.

, You should now have strings around your pinkies, index fingers and thumbs.

, This top loop should now be on both your right thumb and right index finger.


Use the fingers on your left hand to expand and move this loop without dropping the strings they hold. This can be a bit difficult but just do it slowly and carefully.
Repeat this step on the other hand.

, Be careful to leave the upper loop in place on your thumb. Again, people new to string figures may find using their teeth to be the easiest method for doing this.


Repeat this step on the other hand as well.
You should see a small triangle form on both of your hands between your right index fingers and thumbs.

, Just simply curve your index fingers and point them down through the holes. Don't pull them back up, just leave them pointing down.

, Rotate your hands 180 degrees around, moving so your thumbs move up. While doing this you will also need to simultaneously take your pinkies out of their loops. The flip of your hands should also release the second loop on your index fingers while keeping the loop you gained from the triangle.


You now have Jacob's Ladder!
This is the most difficult step of this method. Don't get discouraged if you mess it up a couple times. Simply keep practicing so that you can master this movement.

, Move the fingers of your top hand together and then pull the whole string figure tight.You should now see the Eiffel Tower before your very eyes!

Stick with the plan.",How to Find Good Hiding Spots," Are you playing hide and seek? Are you trying to surprise someone? Are you trying to evade detection altogether? The reason you are trying to hide (and any rules that you may have to follow) should guide you at this point.


If you are required to hide in one place the whole time, you'll want a spot with maximum cover that whoever is looking for you won't think of.
If you are trying to surprise someone you don't necessarily need to be well hidden. You just want to be hidden in a place where they can't see you until they are close and you leap out and surprise them.
If you are trying to evade detection altogether and are allowed to move, you'll want to take advantage of sight lines and mobility. Maximum cover is less important.;
, Evaluate the area in which you will be hiding from the perspective of the person you are hiding from. If they are actively looking for you, where will they think you are hiding? What will their sight lines and priorities be?


For instance, if playing hide and seek, your ""seeker"" is going to be actively thinking of hiding places as well. For this reason, try to avoid common hiding places like closets and below beds.
If trying to surprise someone you'll want to predict where they are going and position yourself in a blind spot that they'll have on the way to their objective.
If trying to move and evade detection think of the sight lines that the other person will have. Ideally you will move in and out of these sight lines as their gaze shifts.

, Ideally, you'll have time to consider different hiding spots and find the best one. But if the person looking for you is right on your tail or if you are playing hide-and-go-seek and the Seeker is nearing the end of their count, you might not have the luxury of time. If so, you may have to rush.


Even if you are in a rush, don't pick the most obvious spot. If it is really obvious, the person looking for you is sure to find it.

, If you have plenty of time, you'll want to start picking hiding spots after evaluating the territory from both your perspective and the perspective of the person looking for you. Remember the guidelines. Well concealed, non-obvious spots are best for static hiding. Surprising someone is all about taking advantage of blind spots to seize the initiative. Evading detection involves evaluating sight lines and cover, with an emphasis on mobility.


Are there such things as doors, furniture (such as a sofa) or soft furnishings to hide behind?
Are there tables, chairs, shelves that you can crawl under?
Are there outdoor items to hide behind, such as the dog's kennel, a tree or a fence?
Are there things you can hide on top of? For instance, the top of a toilet cover in a bathroom stall or the space between the top of a cabinet and the ceiling.
Are there optical illusions you can make use of? For example, hiding behind hanging coats with your feet in snow boots at the base of the coats, making it seem that these are just stored objects.

, Often, the best spots are up high. Looking up is the least natural eye movement for the person searching for you.This is why it is a good idea to hide in spots up high., Boxes and laundry baskets make excellent hiding spots, as long as you won't be trying to move or change hiding spots. They are especially good if they aren't big enough to be obvious spots.

, Which of the hiding spots suit your objectives best? If someone is looking for you they are bound to check the obvious places first, such as behind furniture or in closets. If you are trying to evade detection you may want to consider how easy it is to relocate from one hiding spot to another as the other person moves. Remember your objectives and priorities:


If you can't move, maximum cover and originality.
If trying to surprise someone, blind spots and the ability to seize initiative for the surprise.
If trying to evade detection, minimal exposure to common sight lines and maximum mobility.

, Be careful not to make noise or do anything that might give away where you are going, particularly if you are playing a game. If other players are hiding as well, you may wish to make sure that they don't see where you are going.


Be careful with hinges, as they can squeak. You can try to hold the squeaky hinge while opening or closing the door.

, You'll want to make sure that you don't leave any clues that the area where you are going to hide has been disturbed. Everything should be in the place it was before you hid in that location.


You can also disturb the environment as a decoy.For instance, leave a disturbance on the other side of the room so that you can hide next to the door and exit the room when the decoy is investigated.

, Now that you've been careful not to make noise or leave traces, enter your hiding spot. You may want to position yourself in a non-conventional way in order to present yourself in a different shape than normal. The human eye and brain are very sensitive to shapes, and breaking up your expected ""shape"" is useful to evade detection.


For instance, curl into a fetal position when hiding under a bed next to discarded laundry.

, Whenever it is possible, you can try to add to your cover as long as it doesn't break the rule regarding disturbing your environment. You can also use accessories to further break up your shape

, If you are nervous your heart rate will spike, and breathing heavily could give away your location.Moreover, you are more likely to lose your cool and do something dumb if you don't stay calm and panic instead. Stay calm and collected.

, Try your best not to sneeze or cough, but if you must, try to do so into your sleeve or a piece of clothing to muffle the sound. Don't fidget or shift your weight if it can be helped.


Yes. This means putting your cell phone on silent too.

, If playing hide and seek, don't give yourself up just because you think the other person has found you. Sometimes, you may think they've seen you but they actually haven't. This is especially true if you are camouflaged or have broken up your shape with strange positioning or additional cover.

, If you were trying to avoid detection, moving to a place the other person has already checked is a great idea, as is leaving the room when your exit is out of their line of sight.If trying to surprise someone, make sure that you take the initiative right before they would have seen you.

Go around the world.",How to Use a Yo Yo," Since yo-yos have been around for literally thousands of years (they've changed a bit since ancient Greece), a few different kinds have emerged that all serve slightly different purposes:


Imperial yo-yos. This is your classic, circular shape. These are for ""looping tricks"" -- where the yo-yo isn't sleeping but routinely coming back to your hand as you make loops and circles with the string.
Butterfly yo-yos. These are shaped just like their name -- larger on the outside, smaller on the inside (like wings). They're good for string tricks, where the yo-yoist creates intricate, woven webs with the string.
Automatic yo-yos. Yomega quite a few years back started the craze of automatic yo-yos: ones that could ""sleep"" (stay on the bottom of the string, spinning) and ""wake up"" (come back to your hand) on their own. These are fine, but it's kind of like cheating. If you want to actually do your own tricks, you don't want an automatic yo-yo.
Off-string yo-yos. They're literally that -- off the string. It's technically a yo-yo but it's more like an awesome grooved disc that bounces on a string as you manipulate. It's generally reserved for very serious, competitive yo-yoists.;
, Hold your yo-yo out so it hangs off its string just before the floor. Where is the string in relation to your body? If it's at your belly button, you're good to go. If it's any longer, just cut the string. It's just string, after all. If it's too long, you won't be able to do any neat stuff with it!









Cut it a few inches above your belly button to leave room for creating a new loop. Then make a knotted loop at the end big enough for your middle finger to slip into. Or just recreate the loop size you cut off.

, In other words, open up your yo-yo. Odds are you can twist the two halves apart. Yo-yos used to have the string knotted around the center, but now they have a bearing system (if yours doesn't, tricks will most likely be impossible). That means the string is just looped around the center (you'll see a silver bit and maybe some metal balls), and if physics were different, the yo-yo could just spin on the end of the string forever. This leaves a lot of time to do really neat stuff!








, There will be a time when your yo-yo just doesn't cooperate and you have to wind it yourself. Don't freak out! This is totally normal. Just hold your yo-yo in your non-dominant hand with your pointer finger across your yo-yo. Wind the string around the yo-yo and your finger once. Then loop the string two or three times underneath your finger (creating a loop). Remove your finger and wind up as normal. A loop will be there at first, but it'll come out with your first throw.









After one throw, it'll be back to normal. So when you give it your first go, be sure to snap it back up!

, It's best to keep it around your first knuckle, near the tip of your finger. If it's at the base of your finger, it'll be hard to rotate the string around your hand.









Turn your hand palm-side up, with the yo-yo in your palm. Now hold onto it. This is the position you'll return to almost always.

, Point them a bit downward while you throw your yo-yo down, rotating your palm to the floor to snap the yo-yo back up.









For a more basic move, start with your palm facing down. Then with an upward movement of your arm and an extension of your fingers, release the yo-yo. With this variation, you don't need to worry about rotating your palm (but you get less speed).

, It's only right before the tug that you need to rotate your palm to the floor. It's this part of the move that makes it important the string is near the tip of your finger.









Your hand should just give a slight twitch. The yo-yo will then land in your hand, coming to you 100% of the way. No need to go grabbing after it or looking to catch it -- just keep your arm where it is.

, That's the basic movement of the yo-yo. Pretty simple, huh? But there's so much more you can do! Once you get the feel for what speed is necessary for you and how to position your hands, arm, and wrist, you can move onto tricks. Keep reading!








, This is the first step to doing string tricks -- most involve a ""sleeping"" yo-yo: one that is just spinning on the end of the string (sometimes for minutes on end). The idea is to thrust out the yo-yo and keep it from coming back to you until you want it to. It hovers on the ground, spinning freely. Here's the basics:









With the yo-yo in hand, make a muscle-man pose, bringing your hand toward your shoulder. Your palm should stay up as you wind up, give it a straight snap, and release the yo-yo forcefully, extending your arm. Make sure to do this with a lot of strength or the yo-yo will pop right back up to you, never sleeping.
Having trouble? It's probably because you're jerking your hand trying to get all that speed.That jerk you have at the release forces it to wake up. Concentrate on having force and speed, but keeping your hand and wrist stable. And definitely don't bounce!
When you're ready to wake 'er up, rotate your palm down and give it a slight tug up, per usual.

, This one is the precursor to looping tricks. With your yo-yo in hand, place your hand at your side with your palm down. Swing back a little to wind up, and swing the yo-yo forward. When it hits the end of the string, pull it back, twist your hand, and catch.









It's important that you view this as a swing and not a throw or a snap; there's a very circular motion to it. If you snap or throw it, it will just jut out and come right back to you, not catching any air.

, Never thought that'd be a sentence, huh? These two are very, very similar to the sleeper. In fact, if you can do the sleeper, you can do these tricks, too, so it's almost a three-for-one. Here's how to get started:









To walk the dog, you're basically just doing the sleeper as you walk forward. However, as you're holding it on the ground, move your hand forward and then back, forcing the yo-yo to follow suit but a second or two later (as the momentum moves down the string). This gives the illusion that the yo-yo is walking, too, just like a dog.
The creeper is the same sentiment, only nearer to the ground. However, instead of throwing it straight, throw it a bit behind you, sort of winding up to bring it out in front of you. As it hits the farthest point behind you, bring it out in front of you and kneel. The yo-yo should now be on the ground in front of you, ready to be snapped back into your hand that's ready on the ground to retrieve it.

For both of these tricks, it's much, much easier to do it on a solid surface, like a wood or concrete floor. Carpet makes things much more difficult. Not impossible, but difficult.
Both of these also need a strong, strong sleeper. If you're having trouble, try focusing on your speed. The yo-yo may need more to rotate longer on the end of its string.



, Remember the forward pass? It's the same idea, only you're going in an entire circle around you. So instead of snapping it back up as you see it outstretch in front of you, you're going to hold it down by your leg, shoot it out, and continue a rotating motion with your arm, forcing the yo-yo to go ""around the world,"" or around in a large circle. When you're ready for it to come back, wait until the yo-yo is at your 90-degree angle and snap it back.









If the yo-yo is ""falling"" after it reaches the top, you're not swinging enough. You need to maintain a very small circular motion at your end of the string to keep it rotating evenly.
The breakaway move is very similar to the ""around the world"" trick. In fact, it basically is this trick, but to your side. Just rotate your arm out like a chicken wing and proceed to do the same movement, and catch when the yo-yo is at shoulder height.

It will help you evade detection while you infiltrate enemy facilities. Stick with close fitting, durable clothing that will protect you yet not get in your way.

, Weight tested carabiner clips can save your life if you need to scale a wall or climb a cliff face. And you can store valuable on-the-job spy tools, like handcuffs and binoculars, on a utility belt. Both utility belt and climbing harness, along with the things you might carry with these, are useful additions to your spy kit.

, Other spies like to disguise themselves a little more comically, and sometimes chose to wear masks imitating infamous characters. Whichever suits your preference, a mask can protect your identity while out on operation.

, A spy utilizes every part of his body for optimal tactical advantage. This includes his head. By wearing goggles, you can protect your eyes from dust while crawling through duct systems. A headlamp, on the other hand, can provide vital light without costing you a hand to hold it.


For greater functional authenticity, you might visit an army surplus store to purchase a pair of night vision goggles, or purchase similar vision enhancing gear through an online retailer.

, Access to certain areas will likely be restricted to certain areas that you, as a spy, need to get into. You'll need learn how to crack a safe and bring along any safe-cracking tools you might need, like a stethoscope to hear the tumblers of a lock fall into place.

Take note of your ordinary appearance.,
Alter your complexion.,
Choose appropriate clothing.,
Invest in the right footwear.,
Have a purse or bag to consolidate your spy gear.,
Cultivate an unobtrusive persona.",How to Dress Like a Spy3," While performing your surveillance, you'll want any and every notable feature of your normal appearance disguised in some way. Looking in the mirror, write down any features of yours that you believe might draw attention, and also any feature that you've been complimented on or that others might think prominent.


For example, bright red or platinum blonde hair might make you more memorable and easier to spot, which is the last thing you want while performing surveillance.
Features of yours that are complimented by others are generally unique, and these might be used to identify you if you don't make efforts at concealment.

, One of the first things people notice when looking at someone else is skin tone. By changing the color of your skin with the right self-tanning product or a little powder, you can make yourself look more nondescript. Aim for a color that you might describe as ""plain"" or ""unremarkable.""


Whatever changes you make to your face must be applied to other visible parts of your body. If you only apply self-tanner to your face, you might stick out more than you did before altering your skin tone.

, Before you go out on your mission, research what others will be wearing. If you're attending a formal event or a dinner at a nice restaurant, fancier dress is in order. But if your operation takes place at a cartoon character convention, you might blend in better with a graphic t-shirt and a pair of jeans.

, Although seven inch heels might match your elegant gown during your infiltration at a political event, these may be a liability if your cover is blown and you have to make a break for it. The same goes for men in wing-tipped shoes or other dress footwear; smooth soled shoes might make traversing a roof, a time-honored spy tradition, treacherous.


Take your time finding footwear that matches your disguise and is also highly functional in various environments.

, A purse with a hidden pouch is an excellent way to smuggle around important spy tools, like a set of lock-picks or infrared sensor revealing spray. Men dressed in suits and ties might look less natural wearing a backpack loaded with mission equipment, but stashing this backpack in an accessible hiding spot at your mission location can put valuable tools at your disposal.

, Have a simple story ready that explains who you are and why you are at the mission location. This will come in handy if someone engages you in conversation while you are on mission. Try not to make up any tall tales or include any personal details. Your goal is to be as ordinary and unmemorable as possible.

If you don't want to buy a bearing-axled yoyo, try customizing a cheap yoyo yourself.",How to Make a Yoyo Sleep1," It can be difficult to make your throws sleep with an inexpensive plastic yoyo. Many yoyos on the market today are cheap, wear out easily, and rub the string with too many friction-heavy surfaces. If you are serious about practicing tricks with your yoyo, consider buying a quality yoyo. A metal ball bearing will reduce the friction grinding between the axle and the end of the string.


A Duncan Butterfly or YoyoFactory F.A.S.T 201 is one example of a cheap but trick-worthy starter yo-yo. Later on, you might consider buying a more advanced, expensive brand for even longer throws.;
, Place your hands where the string leaves the yoyo and gently twist the thread loose. Wind back up.

, Gently toss the yoyo over your hand.

, The best way to do this is to loosen the string that loops around the center axle of the yoyo. You can also lube the axle. Don't lube ball bearings with any lube, try get some yoyo lube. If you lube the bearing with something like WD-40, it will probably stop working!

, Lip reading is an important spy skill. It's easier to pick up people's conversations this way because you don't need to be very close. To learn to lip read, pay attention to the way people's mouths move when they're talking when you can hear them. Or, maybe check out this article, on How to Read Lips

, If you're following someone, they may notice you and become suspicious of you. so what do you do? You turn into someone else. Simply changing your coat and putting on a wig can change the way you look. Make sure they're good disguises if you're serious about this. In order to use them, you need to find a place where you're concealed to duck into quickly, and change into your disguise. If you can, carry multiple disguises, and/or combine your different wigs and coats from your different disguises to make a new one.

, A book can be used to cover your face, but only if it's big enough. If you can't find a book, find a newspaper. It also serves as a disguise. For example, let's say you followed someone to a coffee shop. If you just sat, alone, at a table, you would look suspicious. But, if you have a book with you, you've simply come to the coffee shop to find a relaxing place to read.

, All spies know codes! You can make up your own or get one from the Internet (from Wikihow for example? There's lots of good codes to learn on here.)

, All spies can do cool martial arts moves. Learn how to do basic blocks and punches, and some fancy kicks. You'll need to sign up for some form of martial arts at your local martial arts studio., A person with a good memory can memorize license plates, codes, conversations, etc. This is an important spy skill.

Slide the yo-yo into this loop in the string.,
For auto-return yo-yos, wrap the string at least twice.,
Wind up the string.,
Replace your yo-yo string frequently.,
Cut it to its proper length.,
Make a slipknot for your finger.,
Adjust the string tension.",How to String a Yoyo," Unwind the string so there is nothing wrapped around the yo-yo but the basic loop at the base. About three inches above the yo-yo, grab the string with your non-dominant hand.


For some yo-yos, you will be able to just to unscrew the halves and take the string immediately off the yo-yo. However, that can damage the yo-yo. Therefore, we'll be talking about removing a string from a yo-yo without separating it.;
, Yo-yo string is actually one long strand that has been folded in half and twisted together with the open ends tied at one end.Therefore, spinning it removes the twist and separates the halves of the string, allowing you to slip it off the spool. As it spins, you'll start to see the base of the string form a loop that grows bigger and bigger.


You only need a loop at the base large enough for the yo-yo to slip through. Once you see that, you can stop the spinning.
Counterclockwise means the yo-yo will be spinning to the left.

, To get the yo-yo through the loop, stick your fingers in between the two strings, spread the string apart, and pull the base of the yo-yo (the axle) free of the string.


If the string is still good (that is, if it was undamaged before), it just needs to be retwisted.You can do that once you put it back on your yo-yo.

, There are a few different varieties of yo-yo string you can purchase at hobby shops. Having a few on hand, even if it's just to experiment, is always a good idea. Here are the details:



Cotton/polyester blend. This is otherwise known as 50/50. It's a very strong string and effective for just about any style of yo-yoing. If you're not sure which to buy, this should be your default.

100% polyester. This type of string is even stronger than the cotton/polyester blend. It is thin and very smooth; because of this, many professionals prefer it.

100% cotton. This style was popular a decade or so ago, but is being replaced by blends and pure polyester.
Occasionally you see variants, like nylon string. These are uncommon and less popular.

Do not use polyester string if your yo-yo uses a starburst response system. The friction can actually melt the polyester, breaking your string and potentially damaging your yo-yo.



, If you've purchased a new yo-yo string, you'll notice that it comes with one end looped and knotted for your finger and one end unknotted. You may also notice that it's twisted – a yo-yo string is actually one large string twisted in half. Place your thumb and forefinger around the unknotted end and untwist it until a yo-yo sized loop forms.

, Put your fingers in the loop to keep it open wide. The yo-yo will rest half on either side of the string, with the string on its axle. Then twist the string by crossing the strands, allowing the string to twist around the axle of the yo-yo.


If you don't have an auto-return yo-yo, you're essentially done. Just spin the yo-yo clockwise (to the right) to retwist the string and help it find its balance. That's it – your yo-yo is restrung.

, Auto-return yo-yos need their strings wrapped twice (or even three times) around the axle. Once you place the yo-yo in the loop and before you retwist the string, twist it just once and then pull the yo-yo through the loop again. You may wish to do this a third time, too.


If you don't wrap the string at least twice, the auto-return function will not work – the yo-yo will not come back to you on its own.

, Yo-yos with bearings will just spin and won't wind if you just try to wrap the string around the yo-yo freely. To get around this, use your thumb to pin down the string against the side of the yo-yo when you begin winding. After about a few winds around you can release your thumb and finish winding the string.

, If you're a beginning yo-yo enthusiast, it's wise to replace your string every three months or, or at least when you notice the string is getting frayed or your yo-yo is getting more difficult to control. A bad string can greatly affect your performance, so always keep an extra or two handy.


The professionals, on the other hand, replace their strings at least once a day. The more you use your yo-yo, and the more vigorously you use your yo-yo, the more often you'll need the string replaced.

, People who are taller than 5'8"" may be able to use the string right out of the package. However, for those that are shorter than 5'8"", shortening the string is necessary for easy and skillful play. Here's how:


Unwind the yo-yo, dropping it to the floor, holding it in front of you.
Put your forefinger on your belly button and wrap the top of the string around your forefinger at that point.
Tie a knot in the string, making a new loop.
Carefully cut off the excess string and throw it away.

There is no ""correct"" string length, but belly button length is a good guideline. Some players prefer a slightly shorter string, while others prefer a string that's a little longer. Experiment to find the length that suits you.



, A yo-yo string has a knot at the top which, counter to popular belief, is not for your finger. That knot won't adjust to the size of your finger – you need to make a slipknot to get the most out of your yo-yo skills. It's quick and easy – here's how:


Fold the loop over the string
Pull it through the loop
Place it on your middle finger and adjust it to size

, To function at its best, a new yo-yo string will need to be tightened. To start, slip the loop over your middle finger, like you're about to play. Instead, let the yo-yo drop and rest at the end of the string. Watch what it does – if the string is too tight, the yo-yo will spin to the left, or counterclockwise. If the string is too loose, it will spin to the right, or clockwise.


To remedy this, just take the string off your finger, hold the actual yo-yo in your hand, and let the string dangle down freely. The twist in the string will undo itself, quickly disappearing.

Prepare the proper attire.,
Prepare disguises, fake glasses, caps, changes of clothes.,
Carry an empty bag (sports bag, rucksack, briefcase etc).,
Spot your target.,
If there are many parked cars, outrace your target.,
If the street is fairly empty, walk behind your target by about ten meters.,
Glance at your target only as often as you need to to keep them in sight.,
Be prepared for your target to stop.,
If you are seen, don't withdraw quickly.,
Find a desperate method of escape for if you are recognized and your target begins to approach.,
If your target enters a building, your method of proceeding really depends on the situation.,
Assuming that your target stops only briefly (for example, they make a call on a pay phone), be well ahead of your target while hiding.,
Resume following as before.

,
Get your friends involved.",How to Follow Someone on Empty Streets," Black is a bad idea. At all hours, you'll stick out like a sore thumb. Red attracts attention. Wear greys and greens. If the weather permits it, wear a hooded sweater or jacket.;
, if possible go into a shop to change outfit.

, If someone sees you you can drop the bag off somewhere. People who recognised you with the bag may, surprisingly, not recognise you without it.(Make sure the bag matches your outfit- a hoodie and a briefcase would look out of place)

, See which direction they're headed in, and how fast they are moving, remember to keep this pace.

, You should be on the opposite side of the street from them. Get a little bit in front of the person you're tracking, then slow down to about their walking pace (Be careful not to make too obvious of a change. It will draw their attention).

, If the weather isn't cold enough to make a bent head plausible, keep looking down at your watch.

, Pretend that you're busy. Walk around reading a book, etc.

, If this happens, keep on walking nonchalantly. If you are behind your target, move in front, until you have created that same ten meter gap. At the nearest corner or parked van, or any other form of cover for that matter, hide and look back. Be careful not to be seen while doing so. You should count to three after hiding before looking back.

, Instead, move away at a normal pace, as though you heard a noise behind you. Then, continue walking, as though you did not recognize your quarry, until you find the next bit of suitable cover. (Note: It is recommended that if you are hiding in an indentation in a building that you hold out a book, binder, or cell phone, and return your attention to that as you withdraw back into your spot).

, Look at your watch or pretend to check a text message on your cell phone, then shout a curse or exclamation and run past your target at a dead run. Do not look directly at them. Logically, if you were avoiding them, you'd run the other way, so the fact that you went past is a sure sign that you have to be somewhere. Right...? No. Find a secure hiding spot (preferably on the other side of the street), and wait it out there. Keep an eye on your target, but sit tight.

, If you plan on following the person as they emerge, get as far away from the entrance of the building as you can while still retaining the ability to recognize them if they leave.

, Make sure that you are across the street from them. Then, keeping your head down to keep from being recognized, allow them to walk past, giving them a distance of 15–20 meters (49.2–65.6 ft).

,, If you are spotted give a signal (hand signal, text etc) for them to take over. Swap outfits and follow him again later if your friend(s) gets spotted. Also if you walk alongside a friend, talking to them, you are less noticeable.

If you are right-handed, follow the instructions precisely.,
Place the diabolo down on the ground directly in front of you.,
Roll the diabolo over to your right foot, and let it stop.,
Before it stops spinning, move the right stick up and down in a ""hitting"" motion.,
The diabolo will naturally tilt away from or toward you.,
The diabolo naturally tends to unbalance until you learn to keep it at consistent high speeds.,
When you can keep the diabolo level and with reasonable speed, try learning to throw and catch it.",How to Start up a Diabolo (Chinese Yo Yo)," If you are left handed, reverse the handedness of the instructions.;
, Put the string under the axle (the metal bit).

, Then roll it over to the left or just back and forth, and lift the sticks into the air when it reaches the foot. This gives the diabolo initial rotational momentum that stabilizes it when you lift it into the air.

, Try to imagine cutting a carrot with a kitchen knife. Try to keep this up as long as possible without the diabolo falling off.

, Do not fret; this is easily controlled. If the diabolo is tilting towards you, move your right hand forward. If it is tilting away from you, move your right hand back. Do this while continuing to move the right stick up and down. This works by pushing against the top of the diabolo with the string.

, Until then, you can rectify the balance of the diabolo by moving the right stick it the opposite direction diabolo is leaning. For example, if it's leaning forward, bring the stick backwards.

, This is done by simply pulling the two hand sticks apart rapidly, causing the diabolo to fly up. To catch, simply position the string underneath the axle of the diabolo.

Hold the yoyo in a flat palm.,
Grip the yoyo.,
Throw the yoyo.,
Let the yoyo spin.",How to Make a Yoyo Sleep2," Gently twist your palm downward and let the yoyo fall. The yoyo should start to spin once it reaches the end of the string. It should not reel back up the string.

, Bend your arm backwards—as though you're flexing your biceps—until the yoyo is almost touching your shoulder. Prepare to push the yoyo away from you.

, Quickly extend your arm at the elbow. When the arm is fully extended, flick your wrist slightly downward and turn your palm to face the ground. Practice each motion individually until you can do it all in one smooth motion. If you have a normal metal-balls-with-springs-inside type of yoyo, the quick rotational energy will release the axle, and the yoyo should start spinning. Make sure that the yoyo doesn't hit the floor.


Note that you should let go of your yoyo as soon as possible after you begin the ""throwing"" motion.
Some find it helpful to lift their arm slightly after the release to prevent the yoyo from touching the ground. Be gentle: imagine that you are trying to move food from a serving dish to your plate without dripping anything.

, The motion of the yo-yo spinning at the end of the string is called ""sleeping"". As the yoyo slows down, the springs overtake the metal balls and squeeze the axle. Eventually, this causes the yoyo to stop spinning in place and begin to climb up the string.

"

Lift the yoyo.,
Grab the yoyo.,
Practice.",How to Make a Yoyo Sleep3," As the yoyo slows down, it should eventually begin to reel up the string—but you may need to help it along. Gently tug the yoyo up with your hand. Make sure that you pull up before the yoyo stops spinning, otherwise it won't come back!

, Let the yoyo return to your middle finger, then grasp it with your palm. It is important that you learn to finish the trick smoothly—if you ""stick the landing,"" your audience will be even more impressed.

, You may not get the trick down on the first try, but you can work on the technique until you master it. Make sure that you don't practice around anyone or anything that could get hurt/broken; try not to swing your yoyo around people or objects until you are confident in your ability to control the yoyo.

You'll probably want to scout out your target area the day before your operation.,
Fencing.,
Lighting, check for porch lights and possible motion sensing lights.

,
If your target zone is a person's house, check for dogs in the back yard and possible signs of dogs, like chewed up tennis balls and bones.

,
Check for windows with open blinds that people might be able to see you from, so you can avoid them.

,
Watch for cars.,
Hiding spots.,
If you are going to ride your bike or drive there, you need to find a good hiding spot for your bike or inconspicuous parking spot for your car a good distance away from the target zone.",How to Do Nighttime Missions1," It needs to be during daytime so you can see, so you don't want to wear something too suspicious, and you don't want to be very invasive into the target area. A hat is good to cover your appearance, and sunglasses are even better. The advantage to sunglasses is that nobody will be able to tell what you're looking at. There are several things you need to find out about your target zone.;
, If you will need to get past a fence, you'll need to check for weak areas of the fence that you can climb over. You need a way to climb in, and a way to climb out.

,,,, If it is a person's house, if there is a car missing at night that was there during the day, it means the people are probably out partying for the night and can come home at any time.

, You'll need to check for temporary hiding spots inside your target area in case someone comes outside while you're performing your mission, and check for better and more long-term hiding spots outside the target area.

, If it is too close to the target zone and the cops are called on you, you'll have cops swarming around your transportation and it will be pretty hard to get to it.

Get into teams.,
Provide each team with the right supplies.,
Determine who goes first.,
Start playing.",How to Play Cranium1," Cranium is a game that is played in teams. To play the game, you'll need at least four players so you have at least two teams. Divide people up into teams at the beginning of the game.As there is no limit on how many players per team, Cranium can be fun to play in big groups. You could play with 4 groups of 3 to 4 players, for example, if you're looking for a board game for a party night.
However, you can play in small groups as well. As long as there are at least two teams, the game is still playable. Cranium is a versatile game, so you can adjust team size based on your personal game night needs.;
, After you've established teams, there are certain supplies you'll need to play Cranium. Make sure all the teams have the right supplies before the game begins.


Choose a playing piece. Your copy of Cranium should come with a variety of pieces. Different versions of Cranium will have different kinds of game pieces. Allow each team to choose the piece he or her wants to play Cranium.
You will also make sure every team member has a paper and a pen or pencil. Cranium should come with some paper and pencils in the box. If you run out, you can use any kind of scrap paper you have lying around your house. Just make sure all players have materials to write with as you'll need them for a variety of activities in Cranium.Cranium boxes usually come with a small bit of clay, used in certain activities. If the clay is missing or dried out, you could replace it with a bit of play-dough purchased at the supermarket. You could also simply not play cards that require clay.

, Ask everyone when their birthday is. The player whose birthday is closest gets to go first., To start playing, the team who goes first needs to draw a character card. Character cards have different activities written on them that a team must perform. If your team successfully completes the character card, the player whose birthday is closest can roll the dice and move the appropriate number of spaces. However, if that team does not successfully complete the activity their turn is passed to the team on the left."
"
Don't be seen.,
Know when to surrender.,
And remember kids, always have an excuse if you're caught.",How to Do Nighttime Missions2," OK, so you see a police car pull up and a cop step out. He hasn't seen you yet, so you have two options, run home, or run to a hiding spot. Whatever you choose, it will probably consist of some running. The main goal, however, is that the cop doesn't see you. When the cop leaves, it's up to you whether or not to continue with the operation. If the cop calls in for backup to look around, it's probably not a good idea to continue with your mission after they leave. If the cop does see you, it's a completely different situation. He will probably chase after you.


So you decide to run home. You need to lose this cop quick. Jump over fences, go through back yards. You may even want to hide for a few seconds just to get this one cop off your tail. One thing to consider while running is that you want to zig-zag your direction so when the cop calls in for backup he won't know what direction you're going so his backup can't cut you off.
If you decide to get a good hiding spot and let things cool down before going home(or continuing with your mission), your number one goal once again is to lose the first response cop. Run like hell, and get to a hiding spot. Most criminals are stupid, so the cop won't expect you to go from running at full speed to stationary hiding. So you're in a hiding spot(this is why planning is so important, so you'll know where all the good hiding spots are), the cop just lost sight of you and he has slowed down to try to find you. One little tactic I've come up with if you're hiding from a chasing cop is to pick up a few rocks off the ground, and when the cop isn't looking in your direction throw one of the rocks at a fence away from you. The cop will hear it and think it's you accidentally banging against the fence, and he'll go check it out. This will give you the chance to get to your car or get home, get to a better hiding spot, or just plain throw the cop off if you decide to stay in your current hiding spot. When it comes to hiding spots, some of the best spots are elevated positions. Trees, and on top of houses are great, because of something I call the 3-D Hiding Theory. This theory takes into consideration that humans are naturally 2-D animals, we live on the ground. Therefore, it is unnatural for us to look for each other hiding in elevated positions. If you decide to take this approach to hiding, remember that you need to be able to get down quickly in case you are spotted, and never get on top of a house with lights on inside. If you decide to get on top of a house, always go very slowly and quietly so as not to wake the occupants.

, Some cops might think you're dangerous when they see you in your ski mask and camouflage. If they pull their gun on you, throw your hands up in the air and scream something along the lines of ""DON'T SHOOT, I'M JUST A KID!!!!"". This will hopefully keep them from shooting you or at least make them hesitate enough to let you get away.

, It's good to have a few rolls of toilet paper in the back of your car, so if a cop catches you, you can just say you were going to toilet paper someones house(I'm young enough for that to believable). And if you run into a civilian on one of your ops, have some excuse like ""Hey, have you seen a dog around here? I'm looking for my lost dog.""

Play Creative Cat.,
Try Data Head.,
Use the Word Worm card.,
Do a Star Performer card.,
Play a club cranium card.",How to Play Cranium2," Each space on a Cranium board corresponds to a certain type of card. The cards contain activities that must be completed before your team can move across the board. There should be a small hourglass timer that comes with cranium that allows players one minute to complete the activity. If you do not have your timer, you can use a watch or phone to keep track of time. One type of card is the creative cat.


The creative cat card involves a creative activity. You may use the clay to make a sculpture and have another player guess what you're sculpting. You may also do a Pictionary-type drawing activity.Unless otherwise specified on the card, you can choose which team member performs the activity. When playing Creative Cat, it's a good idea to pick a more artistically inclined player. If someone is good at drawing or sculpting, allowing that person to engage in the activity will give your team a better chance at winning.

, Data Head cards are simple trivia cards. They have regular types of trivia in addition to true/false and multiple choice questions. To successfully complete this activity, you need to answer the questions correctly.Choose a player with a knack for trivia to complete this activity. If someone is good at something like bar trivia or Trivial Pursuit, they'll be your best bet for this activity.
If you're chosen for a Data Head activity and you don't know the answer, go with your gut response. Many times, trivia answers are things we've learned at some point but do not consciously remember. If you have a gut feeling one answer is right, take a shot. You should be especially willing to take this risk if the answer is multiple choice or True/False. You'll have a 25-50% chance of being correct., Word Worm cards involve challenges with words. Words may be scrambled, for example, or you may have to guess the definition of a given word.Pick a player with a good vocabulary for this card. People who read a lot or who write for a living might be better at defining or unscrambling words.
If anyone on your team has a background in etymology or linguistics, choose them for this activity. Oftentimes, the roots used in words offer a hint to their meaning. Someone who's studied words academically is more likely to pick up on these subtleties.

, Star Performer cards are slightly more elaborate. They come in three different categories.


Humdinger cards involve humming the tune to a popular song. The other player has to guess what song you are humming.If you have a Humdinger, you should pick someone that is able to carry. Also choose someone who knows popular music. Someone who's a classically trained pianist could potentially be great at humming. However, if this person has spent his whole life playing Chopin he might not know the tune to a Bruce Springsteen song offhand.
Copycat cards require you to act like a famous person.Pick a team member who's fun-loving, uninhibited, and somewhat dramatic. The more someone is willing to put themselves out there and perform, the better chance you have of guessing the answer. As with a humdinger card, make sure it's someone well acquainted with pop culture so they'll recognize the name on the card.
Cameo cards are similar to charades in which you have to get the other player to guess a particular person, place, or thing by silently acting out clues.Yet again, someone who is willing to put themselves out there and perform is your best choice.

, Some cards have a ""club cranium"" symbol on them. When a team draws such a card, all players have to join in. Whichever team successfully completes the activity first gets to move across the board.Try to focus on your own team during the activity. Listening in on other players can cause stress, distracting you from your own players.
Remember to have fun. Getting too competitive during board games can take away some of the entertainment value.

Learn about Planet Cranium spaces.,
Advance through the board game's track.,
Win by completing four activities in Cranium Central.",How to Play Cranium3," Some versions of Cranium have special spaces, known as Planet Cranium spaces. Planet Cranium spaces can both help and hurt your team as you move through the board.


If you pass over a Planet Cranium Space as you move through the board, stop. This can be frustrating, as you'll end up not moving across the board as quickly. However, don't get discouraged. Take it in stride and wait for your next turn.
Planet Cranium spaces can also help you. If your version of Cranium has Planet Cranium spaces, your dice will contain a purple space. If you roll purple, move to the next Planet Cranium space on the board. Sometimes, this can mean moving through the board much quicker and without needing to complete an activity., The goal of Cranium is the move through the board faster than the other players. You move through the board by completing activities successfully. When one team finishes their turn, the team on the left plays.Keep in mind that Cranium is designed to be a fun group game for parties. The main goal of Cranium is to get everyone to lighten up and engage with their silly side. Therefore, try to have fun and not obsess over who's moving quickest through the board.

, Once you make it through the outer later of the board, you'll move inward to a place known as Cranium Central. Here, you will have to complete four different activities successfully. Once you complete four activities, you win the game. If you fail at one activity, you'll have to try again on your next turn.Keep your strengths in mind when playing the final activities. Think back on the course of the game up until this point. Which team member seemed to do best on data head activities? Creative cat activities?
Choose a player who has been successful in past activities. This will increase your chances of completing each activity the first time around.
Often, there will be multiple teams in Cranium Central at once. As with the Club Cranium activities, try to remain calm and focus on your own team. Getting too competitive takes away from the fun of the game. It also lessens your chances of winning.
When engaging in activity, focus only on yourself and your team in that moment. Tune out other distractions.

You’ll want to blend in, so if you plan to spy during a school football game, wear the school colors so you’ll seem like just another member of the audience. If you want to learn town secrets at the local pool, wear your swimsuit and bring suitable props, like a towel and pool toys.;
, It will help you get into character if you spend some time thinking about who you wish to become. Maybe you will pretend to be a foreign exchange student, the cousin of a person who lives in your neighborhood, or even your own brother or sister. Think about where the person comes from as well as how they dress, talk, and act., Practice speaking in different tones or accents. You can also use different words than you normally would. Changing your voice is a great way to keep people from recognizing you. This is especially helpful if you are talking on the phone.

, You may want to add a bit of swagger to your walk, change your posture so you seem like a royal, or hunch over like a beggar. You could lengthen or shorten your stride, or fake a limp. Your body language will help others to recognize you, so changing it is a great way to avoid detection., Sometimes the best disguise is no disguise at all! People won’t suspect you of spying if you just look like another kid at the park or mall. This way you can follow someone or eavesdrop without any suspicion.

, You’ll want to blend in with your surroundings, so wear clothes that other people are wearing. Most people aren’t in costume, so you’ll stand out if you are dressed up as a cat in a room full of people wearing jeans.

, You can wear all black or dark colored clothing to go unnoticed. This is especially true if you are spying at night, as you will look like simply another shadow.


Wearing all dark clothing can be dangerous at night if you are near roadways. Be sure to look out for cars and stay out of the street.

, If you wear something that can be turned inside out, you will be able to easily change your clothes to shake off a spy that’s following you. Quickly changing the color of your outfit will confuse enemy spies, as they will be looking for your original outfit.You can also bring extra outer layers to quickly change your look. Grab a hoodie, a long-sleeve button up, or a jacket to throw on over your clothes.

, You can make yourself look bigger by wrapping towels or scarves around your arms and legs, and adding a cushion to your chest and belly area. Use tape or strings to hold the items in place. Then put your clothes on over the padding. This will throw people off your scent because they will be looking for someone smaller than you!Wearing multiple layers of thick clothing is another way to add some bulk to your disguise, and it make look more natural than adding towels or cushions under your clothes.

, Camo is a great way to blend in if you are outdoors. Pick a style that matches your surroundings as best as you can. Use the white and gray camo in winter, and green and brown for other seasons.

, You’ll be sure to throw your enemies off track if you look just like them! Wear the same colors or type of clothing that they normally wear. Be sure to match your accessories too. For example, wear jeans and a black t-shirt with a baseball hat if that’s what your enemies are usually wearing.

, Sunglasses will hide your eyes so no one knows which way you are looking. The darker the better. Oversize sunglasses can also work to hide your face even more. Be sure to ask before borrowing a pair from your parents or siblings.

, Changing your hair is bound to make you unrecognizable! Add a wig you have from Halloween, or make one from paper or cloth. Cut the paper or cloth into strips to make it look more like hair. Put it under a hat if you are having difficulty attaching it to your head.


You could also color your hair, if you have your parents permission. Use a temporary dye to change the color of your hair. Be careful not to get dye on anything other than your hair., Using a scarf or bandana will hide your features from the people around you. Wrap the cloth around your head or neck, but be sure it isn’t too tight.

, Wearing a mask will hide your face from those you wish to spy one. Choose one that makes sense for the occasion - a clown mask will not blend in at a neighborhood pool party, but it might work at the county fair.

, Use pipe cleaners to make an eye patch. Bend the pipe cleaner into a circle a little bigger than your eye. Cover the circle with dark cloth or felt. You may need to glue it on to be sure it holds tight. Add a pipe cleaner on either side to attach the eye patch to your head.You can bend the side pipe cleaners around your ears (like glasses) or wrap them around your entire head.

, A mustache is an excellent part of a disguise! Make one by bending a brown or black pipe cleaner into a mustache shape.You can also get fake mustaches at many costume or party supply stores.

, Add a hat to your disguise to ensure no one recognizes you. Choose one you already have or make a paper hat.

, You can use makeup to make you look older, like by adding wrinkles. You can also use it to create a fake black eye to change your appearance. Be sure to ask the owner of the makeup if you can use it first.


Be careful not to get makeup in your eyes or mouth.

Gather information on your target.",How to Create a Spy Organization," The things to consider include:


What sort of coverage your organization or agency will have––local, national or international?
Who will belong to your spy organization or agency? You'll need at least one friend willing to be a fellow spy with you, and perhaps at least one friend willing to play villain. You could consider including a sibling or two if they are interested.
What sorts of investigations will your organization undertake? Local detective work, international espionage, theft of artworks, solving kidnappings of famous people, missions impossible? Work out what sort of spying you'll get involved in.
How long will your investigations take? You could role play a spy investigation in an afternoon or set up a game that lasts many weeks or even months before finally solving it.;
, Use a name that is cool sounding. Even better if it can be abbreviated. If you can't make it an abbreviation, you could you use a number code- A is 1, B is 2, and so on.

, Use fonts on the computer and print it out or hand write and draw it then scan it into your computer.

, Pick people who has what it takes and who are trustworthy and stealthy. They also need to be keen to spend the time setting up the back story, clues, etc. to make the spying games worthwhile and interesting. You also might want a tech member. Instead of just asking people to join send them an anonymous letter telling them your spy team wants them.

, You could decide these names on your own, but it's usually best to let each member have a hand in deciding their code name.

, Here are some suggestions for possible positions to choose from:


Agent-in-Charge: The leader
Secret Agent: Works with the target (enemy) to gain information but doesn't do to much interaction
Special Agent: Works with the target to gain information and does a lot of interaction
Scout: scouts out the territory first before the team moves out. The team only moves out when this person signals them to.
Wheel Artist: Is the person that supplies transportation. This person also plans the escape routine
Stealth Master: is a small, quiet person who can fit in tight spaces and can move around unnoticed
Social Engineer: is basically a person used to distract the target
Techie: work in the Surveillance group with computers, phones, etc.
Tracker: Observes the Targets habits, routine, and every action.
Disguises Chief: supplies disguises to the team when needed
Announcer: Controls the meeting and announces a mission
Secretary: Works with all the files and other paperwork
Trainee: also known as a newbie in training
Code Master: deals with code related intelligence.

, Make it somewhere safe where you can make your plans and keep your gear. It should be a secure and hidden location. You can add things like a table and chairs, disguise material, and all of your gadgets.


Treehouses or just a platform in the tree works well, as does a bedroom or home study.
The best bases are ones that you can hide and observe from.
Make sure your spy base has easy exits, hiding places and observation devices like binoculars within easy reach.
The hiding places need to fit both people and documents, gadgets and anything else you might have or need.

, The must-have gadgets include: a computer, a clipboard with plenty of paper and a pen, binoculars and any device with a camera and camcorder on it (iPod touch, phone, digital camera, video camera). Some useful and cheap ideas are as follows:


On the back of a portable camera device with a solid back (iPod touch or phone), stick small squares of paper with tape and a tiny pen with blue tack so you can take notes on the go.
Get cardboard boxes of all shapes and sizes - these are so useful for hiding cameras in, hiding yourself and other members of your team in and making a base/HQ.
Use some kind of communication. Walkie talkies are really good but they're loud, so try a Nintendo DS with Pictochat but it only spans about twenty metres away so maybe have some Facebook chatting on their iPod touch/phone or MSN.
You don't need a computer in your spy base but if you have one handy, the best would be a small laptop with Word (or you can just create text documents) or an iPad or other tablet.
Have a clipboard with paper and a pen that won't run out. This will be used to write down anything you see.
Carry a bag of some sort with all the essentials packed safely away.

, Here you should record everything that you and your fellow spies have gathered during the investigation.

, Your team members need training to stay fit, so here are some activities they might like to try:


Sit-ups, pull-ups, crunches, push-ups, squats, dips and jumping Jacks
Running, jumping, parkour, walking and running silently
Trying to controlling breathing
Learning how to read a target's emotions; learning to lie and detect lies
Learning to see better in the dark; building up senses to understand the surroundings well
Reading lips and learn how to eavesdrop in different ways
Learning codes
Tracking and tailing people
Learning how to use the gadgets.

, Here are some codes to train your team members in:


Pigpen code
Numbers for letters
Reversed alphabet
Sliding scale alphabet
Writing each word backwards.

, Form the scenario for the spying operation. Have a meeting with all members to develop the spy game you'd all like to play. Something like the following: Go up to a window and, using binoculars, spy on someone in your house without being seen.

,,


Wherever you go make sure you know all the emergency exits and make sure you know things like the squeaky floorboards/doors.
Learn awareness so that it is easier to notice things and people coming towards you.

,, Keep a spy journal to write down information about your target.

Let out the slack in the yo-yo.,
Allow the yo-yo to spin in place.,
Return the yo-yo to your hand.",How to Do Rock the Baby With a Yo Yo1," Performing ""rock the baby"" will require you to be able to keep a yo-yo ""sleeping"" - spinning in place at the end of its string - for a few seconds. The first step in this process is to throw the yo-yo down and let the string extend fully. Keep your hand still after throwing the yo-yo.;
, Once the string is fully extended, the yo-yo will have plenty of rotational inertia and will begin spinning in place or ""sleeping."" Keep your hand still during this time to avoid jerking the yo-yo and causing it to wind up again.

, After letting the yo-yo sleep for a few seconds, jerk your hand lightly upward and then down again. As the yo-yo moves upward and your hand returns to its original position, slack will be created in the string that will cause the string to begin winding around the yo-yo's bearing. If it has enough inertia, it will return to your hand.

Let out the slack in the yo-yo.,
Grab the string with your free hand.,
Pinch the string with your yo-yo hand.,
Make a triangle with the yo-yo string.,
Sway the yo-yo back and forth in the triangle.",How to Do Rock the Baby With a Yo Yo2," The first step in ""rock the baby"" is simply letting out the slack in the string. Allow the yo-yo to reach its full extension. Normally when performing this trick you would allow the yo-yo to sleep during the entire trick, but to learn the trick it is best to let the yo-yo stop spinning and practice the motions with a stationary yo-yo.

, Once the yo-yo is sleeping at full extension, wrap all 4 fingers of your free hand around the string at about the midpoint of its length.

, Keep holding the string with your free hand and move your yo-yo hand downward, pinching the string about 3 inches (8 cm) above the yo-yo. Use your thumb and pointer finger to pinch the string. It helps to lift the entire string upwards with your free hand to make room for this maneuver.

, To make the triangle, begin lowering your free hand and raising your yo-yo hand, while keeping the string pinched at the same spot. Rotate your free hand towards your body as it lowers, and arc your yo-yo hand away from your body as you raise it.


As you lower your free hand, release your grip on the string and open your fingers, keeping your palm facing downwards. The length of string held underneath your open palm forms the base of the triangle. You can spread your pinky and pointer fingers out to increase the size of the triangle's base.
The top of the triangle will then be formed at your yo-yo hand. The string will meet this hand at the points where it is looped to your middle finger and where you are pinching it. Allow the final 3 inches of string and the yo-yo to hand down into the open space of the triangle.

, ""Rock the baby"" is so named because you are supposed to gently rock the sleeping yo-yo back and forth. Do this by gently moving your yo-yo hand towards and away from your body. Allow the yo-yo to sway back and forth 2 or 3 times. At full speed, you would allow the spinning yo-yo to return to your hand at this point.

"
"
Let out the slack in the yo-yo.,
Perform the motions of ""rock the baby"" as you did in slow motion.,
Return the yo-yo to your hand.",How to Do Rock the Baby With a Yo Yo3," When performing the trick at full speed, you will go through the same motions you practiced at a low speed. This time, allow the yo-yo to begin sleeping at the end of the string so that it will maintain the inertia needed to return to your hand at the end of the trick.

, When performing the trick at full speed, you will need to go through the motions swiftly and smoothly to keep the yo-yo spinning. When you begin swaying the yo-yo back and forth in the triangle, you can visually gauge how much time you have for swaying before the yo-yo runs out of inertia.

, To finish the trick, simply let the string go with both your hands. Allow the yo-yo to drop and jerk your yo-yo hand slightly to wind the yo-yo back up, just as you would with any trick. Note that if your yo-yo stops spinning during the trick, you will not be able to return it to your hand.

Pass sunlight through a prism.,
Turn a webcam into a night vision camera.",How to Build Near Infrared Goggles," Human vision is most sensitive to light with wavelengths up to about 720 nanometers (red light).But if you filter out this ""visible"" light using these goggles, human eyes can pick up signals in the near infrared part of the spectrum, up to about 1,000 nm.Since our eyes can barely detect near infrared light, the goggles will only work in bright sunlight, or around another strong source of infrared light. They are not night vision goggles, but they will give you a weird new perspective on the world.;
, Most welding or soldering goggles fit tightly around the eyes and block out peripheral light. This is important, since any visible light that gets in around the edges will wash out the infrared light. Remove the filters or lenses that come with the goggles, since these block infrared light.If you wear glasses, purchase welding goggles that fit over them, with a single rectangular window.

, This will reduce the amount of visible light you can see while wearing the goggles. Cover the lenses with painter's tape, then spray paint the goggles black, inside and out. Let the goggles dry between the inside and outside coats.

, These stage lighting supplies are a much cheaper way to block visible light than a specialized infrared photography filter. Get a sheet of ""Congo Blue"" to filter out all visible light except for blue. For a purer infrared experience, also buy a sheet of ""Primary Red"" lighting gel to block the blue as well.Congo Blue is sold as ROSCO 382 or LEE C181 by two major brands.
Primary Red or Medium Red is sold as ROSCO 27 or LEE C106.

, Each lens on your goggles needs six layers of Congo Blue and two layers of Primary Red. Trace these shapes onto your sheets of lighting gels, using your goggle lenses or filters as a guide. Cut them out with a pair of scissors.


If you're making multiple goggles and don't have enough room on your lighting gel sheet, you can get away with three blue layers and one red layer per lens.
Handle carefully and minimize contact with the gels. Scratches and oil from your fingertips can damage the plastic., This may require some trimming. The several layers of blue will block out most of the visible spectrum, allowing your eyes to pick up on the IR light that passes through. The red layer, if you are using it, will block out blue light as well.You may want to leave the red filter unattached for now, and see whether you like the goggles better with or without them. If you use only blue filters, you will have an easier time seeing in dim light, and notice a greater variety of colors., Put on the goggles in bright sunlight and look around. The sky should look dark, while trees and bushes become pink.Just take care not to stare at the sun: despite the lack of pain, ultraviolet light can still pass through the goggles and damage your eyes. The goggles make you more susceptible to this, since they keep your pupils wide open.If you're worried about this, a layer of glass in the goggles adds some protection, and a layer of UV filter (available from the same stores that sell lighting gels) adds more. Even then, looking directly at the sun is not recommended, since too much infrared light can cause damage., Some materials are similar colors in normal vision (reflecting the same spectra of visible light), but behave differently in the infrared spectrum. You can take advantage of this to share messages or artwork only visible to people wearing infrared goggles:Cut out squares of blue and red filters from your leftover lighting gels. Layer the two colors to make an opaque black barrier that looks transparent through the goggles. Hide messages behind the barrier.
Most black permanent marker ink still looks dark in IR light. Find a dark T-shirt or other cloth that looks light grey through the goggles. Draw on it with the marker to make a message that blends in with the cloth until you put on the goggles.

, An equilateral glass prism will split a strong beam of sunlight into a rainbow pattern. By putting the goggles on and off while looking at the rainbow, you might be able to see a narrow band of infrared light next to the red stripe of the rainbow. This is similar to how infrared was first discovered in 1800, by an astronomer named William Herschel. Since Herschel did not have the fancy goggles you just made, he detected the invisible infrared light by measuring the temperature where it fell and heated up a thermometer.

, Most webcams have an infrared cutoff filter attached over the lens surface. If you disassemble the webcam and remove this filter, it will detect infrared light (at the cost of lower image quality).In order for the webcam to work at night, it will need an IR flashlight or other infrared light source, but this is invisible to human vision.


Cover the lens with a Congo Blue filter to make the webcam into a daylight infrared sensor.
This works with most digital cameras as well, but do not disassemble them unless you have electronics experience. A camera's flash bulb is connected to a high voltage capacitor, which can remain dangerous even when the camera's battery is removed."

, A girl spy deserves to look good and be comfortable at the same time. Consider borrowing or reshaping the style of one of the role models you have chosen, to create your own spy look. Suitable items include sunglasses for hiding behind, a head scarf or hat, a wig, comfortable shoes, etc. Also opt for a sophisticated look so people will take you more seriously, matching clothing (especially a skirt) will make you look like you only mean business.

, Find a lovely bag in your favorite color and assemble all the items listed below in ""Things You'll Need"". Don't forget to add feminine hygiene items as needed.

,, People may try to befriend or use you just so they can get your secrets, so beware and always take caution of others around you.

,, This is so you don't get caught out. Make a cover story so you seem innocent and people won't suspect you.

, Be aware and watch people, they could be trying to say something through body language , facial expressions, or movement (eg: running down corridors/streets screaming or scared.

, This could make people think and wonder what is matter with you, which could lead people to follow you. You don't want anyone following you home and discover any gadgets or spy gear laying around.

, Getting a partner or a teammate is always for the best, as it doesn't look suspicious at all. (Just make sure you can trust them.)

, You want to wear comfortable, stretchy, light weight clothing, as you don't know what assignment you will be given, you want to be able to move freely instead of been weighed down from wearing heavy jeans and a leather jacket. For footwear wear something comfortable, you don't want to be running around in high heels or dolly flats, go for footwear that have ankle support, as you don't want to be running away and falling over your own feet or losing your shoes.

People, on the other hand, tend to tromp noisily through the woods, alerting others to their presence from half a mile away. The key to moving like an animal is to be tuned in with your environment. Be aware of the terrain through which you're moving, and try to flow with it instead of moving against it.


Notice your surroundings. If there's a low-hanging branch up ahead, carefully crouch under it instead of blazing through and causing the leaves to rustle.
Walk where there's cover. Whether you're walking through trees, buildings or furniture, stay close to cover, like an animal would. Don't walk in open areas where it's easy for you to be seen.
Have steady movements. Think of the way a cat moves when stalking its prey. Move your body in a steady rhythm so that the sounds you make are steady, too. Random sounds will be more noticeable.
Go on stealth runs and practice moving as quietly and unnoticeably as possible. Don't worry about how fast you're going.;
, When you crouch close to the ground, you exert less force with each footstep, making it possible for you to walk almost soundlessly. Practice walking in a crouched position, absorbing the weight of your body with your knees. Engage all of your muscles.

, Stepping down with your heel first usually produces a ""thud"" that others can hear. It also prevents you from being able to crouch easily and distribute your weight evenly across your body. Walk toe first so you can move quietly and fluidly over any terrain. This will feel unnatural at first, so it's important to practice often before you have to put your stealthy moves to the test.


You can run toe first, too. It's easier to do this barefoot or with minimalist shoes that don't have a lot of cushioning. Your body will naturally tend to lead with the balls of your feet rather than striking the ground forcefully with your heels.

, When you're trying to be stealthy, walking the straightest line from point A to point B isn't always the best idea. Consider what path will get you where you need to go with the least chance of being seen or heard. Look for a way to get there without crossing someone else's path, spending too much time out in the open, or stepping on things that might make noise.


If you're in a forest, walk along game trails or dirt paths mostly clear of leaves and sticks. Watch out for puddles, gravel, rustling bushes, and crackly sticks.
If you're on city streets, edge along buildings and weave through alleys. Cross the street with large crowds of people. Avoid gravel, metal grates, and wooden boardwalks, which tend to be loud. Avoid areas where your footsteps might produce an echo, like tunnels and underpasses.
If you're indoors, weave through large items of furniture. Stay out of rooms that have a lot of clutter. Take back entrances instead of front doors. Choose carpeted rooms and staircases instead of hardwood floors and stairs.
If you are walking up wooden stairs, try stepping in the middle of the stair at the edge. It's structurally the strongest point on the stair and should reduce creaking to a minimum.
Do not follow roads if you are running from a car. This should be obvious, but you would be surprised.

, If you're following someone from behind or trying to move to a new position without being seen, there will be moments when stillness is your greatest stealthy asset. When it's clear that someone heard you break a twig or graze a piece of furniture, find cover and stay as still as a log. Wait patiently until the person keeps walking and no longer seems aware of your presence, and then take extra care to move quietly to your destination.

, Breathe slowly and evenly to avoid being heard. Breathe through your nose instead of your mouth. If you're out of breath, try making your throat as wide as possible while remaining comfortable. It may sound strange, but it works. Practice makes perfect.


If you're sneaking for the first time, you may be scared of getting caught, which could cause your breathing to quicken. If you feel panicked, try imagining that you're on a beach on a nice, warm, sunny day, or go to another ""happy place"" in your mind. Stay there until you feel calm.

, When you need to jump over obstacles like fences or benches, land softly by allowing your whole body to absorb the impact, not just your feet and knees. Land on the balls of your feet and immediately move into a crouch. Look for a landing spot clear of noisy materials like leaves or rocks.

, Your footgear can either aid your quest for becoming stealthy or be a dead giveaway of your presence, every time. You need to choose the proper footgear for the environment in when you'll be moving. Practice walking and running in your chosen footgear often, so you'll get used to the tiny noises it makes.


If you're in a house, it's best to wear socks, as they are soft, and they are comfortably fitting. Going barefoot is also a good option. Carry your shoes with you and put them on when you're clear of the house.
If you're in a place with lots of grass or leaves, use socks or go with bare feet, carrying your shoes. You could also wear toe shoes or water shoes, but be careful: if these types of shoes get soaked, they can emit a ""squish"" sound as your foot hits the ground.
To cross a rocky place (pebbles, gravel, etc.), you must use a pair of thick socks or bare feet. Soft socks and bare feet cushion the impact, but shoes will push the stones down and out, making the sound of rocks moving.
For walking in a mixed environment, like a suburban street with a road, gravel, and grass, wear running shoes with soft, flexible soles. Be careful not to walk flat-footed with these shoes.

, The clothing you choose should match the colors of the terrain you'll be crossing, and the time of day should also be taken into account. Wear darker colors at night, and earth tones during the day. Choose fabrics that are comfortable and don't make swishy sounds. Cotton is always a good choice, and soft polyester fabrics also work well.


If you're walking around at night in a city, tight black clothing will do. If you're in a natural area (a field or forest) wear loose clothing to distort and break up the human figure. Wear dark browns and greens instead of black, because black stands out.
Don't wear anything that will reflect light. Remove shiny jewelry, and try wearing contacts instead of eyeglasses.
Try not to wear heavy gear. All it will do is fatigue you and make it harder to move. This will also make more noise.

, Night vision or infrared goggles are useful for helping you see in the dark. Binoculars may also be useful if you need to see objects that are far away.

, Walk the area in the light of day and take note of the lay of the land. Draw out a map of the area you'll be covering and be sure to study it before you embark on your mission. Make it as detailed as possible, drawing every object that could be an obstacle or a source of shelter - groves of trees, empty sheds, dumpsters, and so on.

, If you're going out with a friend, you won't be able to call to one another. Learn sign language or make up your own hand signals to help you navigate the territory without speaking.

, Have you ever played hide-and-seek and been in an excellent hiding place, then suddenly get struck with the urge to relieve yourself? Often the suspense and excitement of being found out, regardless of the situation, will stimulate a reaction in the bowels and bladder. Even if you feel no need to use the facilities ahead of time, it is still a good idea.

, Bring a couple tiny, solid objects that you can throw and that are capable of making some sort of noise. Make sure that they are natural objects like rocks or something that goes with the environment; otherwise the person you are trying to distract may get suspicious. Throwing something can be used as a quick diversion if someone in the vicinity of where you are sneaking thinks they saw something moving or heard something unusual.


Take one of the objects out quickly and throw it at the nearest hard surface that is in the opposite direction to create noise. If the noise you made was louder then the one they think they heard, they are likely to look at where that noise came from, allowing you to slip away undetected.
You can pick up a stick or another object and throw it in a certain direction. The person will move to inspect it while you go in the opposite direction. Just remember that if the object is too big, the person looking for you might see it and find out not only that you're there, but also the direction it was thrown from.

, Don't enter private property without permission, and don't use these guidelines to burglarize a home. If you're doing something illegal, you will most likely get caught. Remember that movies are fiction, and thieves only get away because it furthers the plot.


Do not go into any areas with fake weapons (Airsoft, Nerf, etc.). If you do use airsoft, make sure any gun is not loaded.

, If you are sneaking in a yard belonging to someone you do not know and someone yells at you, don't panic. It is a natural instinct to freeze in panic and breathe heavily. Have a story ready or explain that you were just playing a spy game with your friends. Keeping a small ball with you can be handy. If you spot someone, a good trick is to hold up the ball and explain that it had landed in that yard.

, Be prepared to roll through grass and dive into ditches if you need to hide quickly.

, It's thrilling to go somewhere you do not belong just because you can, with no ill intentions. This may seem odd, but it is true to many people who take part in ""Urban Adventuring."" If you can't get out at night for the extreme experience, try free running.


A fun thing to do with a (stealthy) friend is to set an objective, like getting to a cookie jar in a remote place. It should be something that can be done quietly, but perhaps not easily, such as removing an object from a container. With a friend, sneaking creates intense, exciting memories.

This is also where you'd put your religion (if any) and favorite color.;
, Look inside yourself and see if you can find another person. For example, maybe you've always wanted to not have to worry about behavior. Search deep inside yourself and see if you have another, underlying personality with few or no connections to your first. This is your separate persona.

, Pick a stereotype opposite yours, for example, if you're mostly flower-child hippie, go for Goth or punk.

, It shouldn't sound too much like your current name or be a name you've told friends and family that you'd prefer, but it shouldn't be way too far-out unless you're pretending to be a different race or religion.

, It's best to go without your parents, for example, with friends or alone, but try to stuff things that fit your persona in the basket while they're not looking. If all goes wrong and they find out, say it's for a Halloween costume.

, You will want your persona to have interests (unless they're emo), or at least a favorite band, so with your headphones on, google music that would fit your stereotype. A good-girl might like a pop singer, and Goth might be hard rock. Find something you can do that your parents don't know you can do to be your hobby, whether it completely fits or not. Just remember not to make your persona's hobbies identical to yours.

, Maybe in an opaque bin in your closet, or in a shoebox under the bed.

, Tell your parents you'll be at the mall (or wherever you're going) and act as usual. When you get to wherever you're going, change in a bathroom and hide your bag (with you regular clothes in it) either in the bathroom, or inside another bag that you will carry. Hang around places your persona might go. Would you really see a punk outside Bath & Body Works? Probably not. Instead, stay outside places your persona would like.

, If your disguise is really good, they won't recognize you. If they do, and say something like, ""Hey Kelly. What's with the outfit?"" Respond, ""Who's Kelly? I'm Jasmine."" Or whatever your name is., For example, don't play out-of-character music without headphones or ask questions that are out of your personality or that you haven't asked before.

, If you don't have any fake money, you can just use pieces of paper to serve as money.

, For example, strong pieces of paper can serve as folders. Coordinate them with the names of the agents. For example, one agent could have a blue folder and be called 'Agent Marine'.

, At my store, I sell 'reference sheets'. The general reference sheets include the suspects, locations, and weapons. Players can purchase these to use while eliminating what's written on their card.

, Place them into an envelope. Evenly divide the remaining cards as well as the fake money. If you have any extra cards, as will sometimes happen, you can also sell these at your store.

, When asking questions to one another, have them go the the room in question. However, this is not required to play. The players agree to either exchange questions or they agree on a price for a question. Have fun playing!

They can also be held just about anywhere, including parks, your home or neighborhood, or even a school. When and where you host the hunt will depend on how old the players are, how large the group is, the weather, and what sort of scavenger hunt you are doing. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Warm and sunny days are for outdoor scavenger hunts.
If the day is rainy or cold, it might be better to bring the scavenger hunt indoors.
A park is great for older players or large groups. A backyard might be better for really young players.
A house is great for all ages, but it might be difficult to accommodate a large group. You may also want to block off private areas, such as bedrooms and offices.
Your neighborhood is a great place for a large scavenger hunt. If you plan on involving your neighbors, talk to them first, so that they know when to expect the players to come by and ask for the item.

, Here are some ideas to get you started:


Give the players a list of items. Hide the items around your location, and have the players search for the items. The first player/group to find all of the items wins.
Have the players go door-to-door asking for items off the list. Be sure to plan ahead with your neighbors if you choose to do this.
Instead of hiding items, consider having each team to take a photo of an item from the list. This is great for parks, especially national parks where you can't take things from nature.

, This will act as motivation for each team, especially if the scavenger hunt is timed. You can choose anything you want as the prize, but you might want to keep the ages of your players in mind. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If the hunt is for kids, a good prize might be small toys or candy.
Movie tickets or cash are great prizes for older children.
Adults will appreciate a gift certificate to a nice restaurant, a gift card to a store, or a basket of goodies.
Consider basing the prize off of a theme. For example, if the hunt has a superhero theme, you could have superhero masks and caps as the prize.

, The list can include easy-to-find items, such as a pencil or a sheet of paper. It can also include harder-to-find items, such as a picture frame or a needle and thread.


If the teams will be going door-to-door, choose inexpensive items people will be willing to give, such as a sheet of paper, a pencil, or a paperclip. You can also give your neighbors the items ahead of time so that they don't have to use their own.
If your teams are going around the neighborhood taking pictures of landmarks, tell them the general area the landmark is in, such as “the statue in this park” or ""a red flower.""

, There are different types of scavenger hunts, and some are more appropriate for older players than younger ones. For example, clue-based scavenger hunts might be difficult for very young children, but they'll be more interesting for teens and adults. Door-to-door scavenger hunts also aren't recommended for small children for safety reasons. On the other hand, picture-based scavenger hunts might be more fun for small children than for older ones. Here are other things to keep in mind:


Plan on having adult helpers or chaperons for scavenger hunts involving small children, especially if you have a large group. This will make the kids easier to keep track of.
Consider having second and third place prizes for very young children. This way, the ones who don't ""win"" won't feel left out.
Keep the age group in mind when coming up with a theme. Small children might be interested in themes revolving around nature and animals while older children might be more interested in themes that involve literature, video games, and movies.

, They can pick their own teams, or you can assign teams. If there are children playing, be sure to assign an adult to head each team. If there are many people playing, make teams of 3 or 4. Each team should have an even number of people.


If your guests are all different ages, consider pairing some of the younger guests up with the older ones. This will prevent any advantages and disadvantages between the groups.
A great way to organize teams is by having people count off in numbers, such as 1 and 2. All of the 1s will be in one group, and all of the 2s will be in another.
Another great way to organize teams is by having people pick colored slips of paper from a hat. All of the blue slips will be on one team, all of the red slips on another, and so forth.

, The guests should have enough time to find most of the items. How long the scavenger lasts will depend on how many items the guests have to find. An hour is a good place to start if there are a lot of items. It is also recommended for door-to-door scavenger hunts.


For very young children (preschool age) limit the scavenger hunt to no more than fifteen minutes. This will be long enough to keep the kids entertained, but short enough to keep them from getting bored.
If the item list is very simple or short, 30 minutes should be enough.

, This will make it easier for them to carry everything. It will also prevent small items from getting lost. If the hunt has younger players, have an adult carry the container. This will allow the children to run about freely, collecting the items. It will also prevent the items from getting lost if the child trips, falls, and drops the container. If the players are only taking pictures or writing the item down, you don't need to give them this. Here are some items that you can use as a container:


A basket, especially with a handle, will be the easiest to carry.
A sack or bag will be cheaper than a basket. Consider a paper bag instead of a plastic one. Paper bags hold their shape better, so the items will be less likely to get mushed.
A box can be difficult to carry, but it is also the sturdiest. You can also find decorative boxes to match the theme of your scavenger hunt at an arts and crafts store.

, Most scavenger hunts end after a certain amount of time. The team that finds the most items wins a prize. Here are some things you should keep in mind:


If the scavenger hunt has a time limit, consider giving the players a stopwatch. You can also tell the players at what time the scavenger hunt ends. For example, if the scavenger hunt starts at 1 pm and lasts an hour, tell the players to be back by 2 pm.
If your players are very young, you may want to add a second or third place prize to avoid any hurt feelings, jealousy, or tantrums.

, Having a meeting spot is very important. Some teams may finish before other teams do. You will want to have a place for these players to go to while they wait for everyone else to finish. This can simply be the same spot that you started the scavenger hunt in. It can also be a landmark, such as a statue in the park the hunt is taking place in. Make sure to have a person at the meeting spot to greet the winners and give them the prize.

, This section will give you lots of ideas on how to make your hunt more unique and interesting. It will help you find a theme and design. It will also offer a few creative twists. You don't have to use all of the ideas from this list. Choose the ones that appeal to you the most.

, This will make it a lot easier to come up with items. If you are having a scavenger hunt as part of a party, consider tying the theme to the party's theme. For example, if your party has a superhero theme, give the scavenger hunt a superhero theme as well. Use items that the superheroes would use, such as masks and capes. Here are some more ideas to get you started:


Base the scavenger hunt off of the guests' interests. For example, if the scavenger hunt is for a literature class, base all of the items of the different books the students are reading. If Harry Potter is on the list, consider including items such as broomsticks, owls, capes, and feather quills. You can even set the hunt up in a library.
Base the scavenger hunt off of a holiday. If the hunt is during October, consider giving the hunt a Halloween theme. Have the players search for items that are related to Halloween, such as pumpkins, black cats, bats, spiders, witches, and skeletons.
Focus on your location. If your scavenger hunt takes place in a park, scout out the park first and write down some things you notice, such as a weird-looking tree or a particular statue. You don't want the players to look for something that does not exist.
Invent your own theme. You can base the hunt off of any theme you want. Here are a few just to get you started: animals, books, food, historical time period, ocean, movies, musical theater, rainforest, superhero, video games, and so forth.

, The players will need to figure out what the item is before going to find it. This is great for scavenger hunts that involve taking pictures. You can also make the riddles rhyme. For example:


Instead of writing down ""toaster,"" you could write, ""I make toast crunchy and warm.""
Instead of writing ""bookmark,"" you could write: ""I save your place in a book.""
Instead of writing ""needle and thread,"" you could write: ""We go hand-in-hand as a pair, and your mom might use us to repair a tear.""
Instead of writing ""broomstick"" you could write: ""A witch may use me to get around, but most will use me to sweep up the ground.""

, Start with a bingo grid and write the name of an item in each square. Have the players check off the items that they find. The first person to get five marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line wins.This is great of scavenger hunts that take place outside or in a nature park.
Consider basing the items on your grid off of the location. For example, if you are having a scavenger hunt at a beach, you could include the following: sea shell, sunbather, sand castle, seagull, crab, barking dog, and towel.

, For example, you can tell your players to look for something blue, something soft, and something green. They player writes down what they found (a blue marble, a bunny rabbit, a green leaf) in the blank spaces you provide for them. The first person to complete the sheet wins.This is great for nature walks and parks.
Make sure that your list is related to the location. You don't want the players to look for something green if they are in a desert or rocky cave.

, You don't want to make your scavenger hunt too difficult for young players, or too juvenile for older players. Shorter lists with easy to find items would be suitable for young children while longer lists (with clues) might be more interesting for teens and adults. Here are some more ideas:


For young children, use large fonts and lots of colors. Try to have no more than 10 items. It might also be a good idea to include a picture of the item, in case some of the players are still learning how to read.
For older children, use large fonts and lots of colors, but omit the pictures. Put between 10 and 15 items on your list.
For teens and adults, use a regular sized font. You can use colors to make the list look nicer. Your players may also find clues more interesting than simple item names.

, This will make your list more interesting to look at. You can print your list out on matching stationary paper, or add a picture to the bottom of each list. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If your scavenger hunt has a beach theme, print the list on some beach-themed stationary paper. You can also include a picture of sand, a palm tree, and some ocean waves at the bottom of your list instead.
If your scavenger hunt takes place outside in a part, try to find some stationary paper that has a leaf border.
If your scavenger hunt is for an English class, consider including images at the top, bottom, or around the edges that are relevant to the books the students had read. For example, if the students have just read Harry Potter you could include pictures of owls, wands, and broomsticks.
If the hunt is has a Renaissance or Medieval theme, consider using old-looking parchment paper instead. Use a fancy font that looks like it was written with a calligraphy pen.

Hold the balloon in place to keep it from slipping.,
Slowly and carefully fill the balloon.,
Pinch the neck and ensure that you have enough room to tie it.,
Knot the neck of the balloon.,
Create a spraying water bomb.",How to Blow Up a Cheap Water Balloon," You can find them at drugstores, party supply stores, online, and at some supermarkets. Make sure to buy as many as you need. Look carefully at the price, the size, and the quantity of the balloons, and compare each package to the other options that you have.


You can use regular party balloons in place of water balloons, but they may not pop as readily as dedicated water-fight balloons. Water balloons tend to be smaller than air and helium balloons, and they are usually made from a thinner material.;
, Blow the balloon up with your lungs, or use a pump. Fill the balloon so that it is as large with air as it will be with water. Make sure not to over-inflate, or you risk popping the balloon before you even hook it up to a faucet. It is not absolutely necessary to stretch the balloon before filling it with water, but this extra step may make the balloon less prone to popping.

, Many people traditionally fill water balloons by stretching the opening around the mouth of a faucet. However, these small, thin balloons are liable to rip when they are stretched to their limit straight out of the package. To stretch the neck: insert two fingers into the opening of the balloon to give yourself a grip. Pull the neck open to approximately the width of your faucet, your hose, or whichever nozzle you plan to use to fill the water balloon.


This step is less important if you are using a funnel, a nozzle attachment, or a water balloon-filling device. These nozzles are typically much thinner than the average faucet, meaning that the balloon neck doesn't have to stretch so much to fit.

, Pull the opening of the balloon over the threads of an easily-accessible faucet or hose. Use an easy-fill nozzle attachment, if you have one; some packages of water balloons actually come with a plastic nozzle.


Be careful when you stretch the balloon over the faucet. If you haven't pre-stretched the neck—and even if you have—it is very easy to rip the rubber when you try to snap it onto something.
Make sure that there is a place for water to drain if you pop any balloons during the filling process. Sinks, lawns, and outdoor areas are great for this.

, Pull the balloon over the lower (output) opening of the funnel, and make sure that it is tight. Simply pour the water through the funnel (from a faucet, a hose, a watering can, etc.) for any easy and nearly-foolproof home method. If you don't have access to a screw-on faucet attachment, this is the next-easiest thing.

, Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch the neck of the balloon onto to the water source while you're filling up. This is an important step whether you are using a funnel, a nozzle, or a regular faucet. Even if a balloon fits onto the faucet without breaking, it is common for the sudden burst of water to pop, snap, or dislodge the balloon. Hold the balloon neck tightly, and do not let go until you tie the balloon.

, When you have situated the balloon, turn the faucet on halfway for a slow-to-moderate stream of water. Watch the balloon as you fill it up, and turn the water off before it fills to the top. Leave about an inch of airspace so that you can easily tie the balloon.You can use hot or cold water – or, for that matter, any other liquid with about the same density as water. If you are filling water balloons in the summer, you may want to use cold water for the sake of cooling off.

, Pinch the bottom of the neck—just above the waterline—with the thumb and first two fingers of your non-dominant hand. Pull and stretch the neck a few times to be sure that you can wrap it around the first two fingers of your pinching hand.


If the balloon is too full to tie, let out a bit of water. Release your grip on the neck, but keep your fingers ready to pinch it shut again as soon as you've freed enough space. Tilt the balloon and pour a small amount of water into a sink, a potted plant, or a lawn.

, First, stretch the neck as far as it will go, and wrap it completely around the first two fingers of your pinching hand. Then, tuck the loose end of the neck between the tips of the two pinching fingers. Pull the knotted balloon away from your fingers, by the end of the neck, and your water balloon is ready to use!


Alternately, make a loop with the neck and pull the end through. Pull the wrapped neck of the balloon away from the two fingers, creating a slight gap, and poke the loose end in. Pull the loose end of the neck through the other side of the gap. In one fluid motion, pull the whole neck of the balloon away from your two fingers.

, Twist the neck 10-15 times, until it is tight. Then, fasten it shut with a clothespin or a paperclip. Remove the fastener right before you throw the balloon, then hurl it at your target. Since there is no knot, the balloon should unravel mid-flight and spray water everywhere along its trajectory. This gives the balloon a larger impact area while still drenching your intended target.


This method may come in handy if you're having a water fight with a lot of people. You can use one water balloon to soak multiple friends, making each throw more efficient.

Decide on your size and location.,
Get some balls.,
Enclose your ball pit area.,
Assemble your frame.,
Friend-proof your ball pit.,
Add the balls.,
Add toys, friends and enjoy!",How to Build a Ball Pit," Unless you have an extremely large budget, you will probably not want to fill your living room with playpen balls, as this will be quite costly. A small spare room or a balcony/patio area can be great because you can partition off part of the area for the ball pit, allowing you to keep the size (and therefore cost) to a minimum. If you’re choosing to use your balcony, be sure that it has a roof or that you will otherwise be able to seal the area so no balls to escape and no water or outside dangers (such as bugs) can get in. Also remember that the position of you ball pit is important for both safety and economical reasons. Building your ball pit in a corner, for instance, can eliminate the need for you to build two sides of your frame.


Depending on the number of people you want to fit into it, partitioning a 4′x8′ section will give you plenty of space for 3-4 people to play in, or 1-2 people to really jump around in. 3′ tall should be enough for the average person to climb in and out of. You should also consider how deep you want your balls to be. About 2.5 feet (0.8 m) deep would be enough to immerse a seated person while still not feeling like you’re drowning in balls, or without them spilling over. This calculator, which has been very accurate, will help you estimate the amount of balls you will need and the approximate amount you should expect to pay for them.;
, Using the calculator linked above, you will now know how many playpen balls you need to acquire. The number may seem large at first, as chances are that you – like most people – may have expected to only need a few hundred balls to fill your space. Trust the math here though: a 4′x8′x2.5′ ball pit will need well over 5,000 balls. Search online for cheap playpen balls in bulk. Ebay, craigslist, and kijiji are good places to find balls for cheap. If they are used, be sure to clean them. Wash them in your bathtub and/or spray them down with a one part bleach, nine-part water solution before putting them somewhere to dry. Do not put damp balls into your ball pit.

, The last thing you want is your balls rolling all over the place. So be sure that you can somehow prevent them from either escaping the ball pit itself, or the area that the ball pit is located. If you are building your ball pit on your balcony or in a room with low windows, you will want to put up screen in any area where the balls could escape. Luckily, screen is relatively cheap at approximately $10/roll. The staple gun makes it extremely easy to tack up screen fast, especially if you are outside. If you are building on a balcony, you can screen in the entire area top to bottom, or you can just build the screen around the ball pit itself, leaving a hole or slit in the screen to allow you to enter or exit it. Your screen may come under a lot of stress while people play in your ball pit, so be sure to use a strong material.

, Chances are pretty good that you’re going to have drunk or otherwise easily excitable people playing in your ball pit. And really, what’s the point of having it otherwise? As such, you are going to want to make sure you’ve built yourself a sturdy frame. This is most important in the area you and your friends will use to get into and out of the ball pit. The example in the photo used 8′ long 2″x4″ planks for the top and bottom and 3″ tall 4″4″ posts for the sides. Since people would be hopping over the sides to get into the ball pit, this needs to be extra sturdy. Hammer the frame together first, then reinforce it by adding l-brackets. Nail large plywood boards to all four walls on the inside and the exposed walls on the outside. You can use more l-brackets on the inside corners of the ball-pit itself (these will be covered by the foam padding) to help keep the sides attached, and to keep the walls secured to your floor.

, Now you have a large, heavy wooden box. Not exactly the most fun – or the most safe – for you and your rowdy friends to play in. This is where the foam padding comes in. You can buy packs of 4 2′x2′ interlocking foam pads at Walmart for approximately $20 a pack. This is the perfect material for both the floor and walls of the ball pit as it is soft, durable, and easy to clean. To cover the interior of a 4′x’3′x8′ box you will need 128 square feed of foam padding, or about 8 packs.


Start with the floor of the ball pit first, locking all the pieces together firmly. Once the floor is covered, start your way up the sides, going around the bottom first, interlocking the pieces to the floor pieces as well. Glue the foam padding to the sides of the frame once you have them all positioned. Use large-headed nails (so they don’t just slip through the stretchy foam) to make sure the pieces stay in place. Once you have the bottom level done, you can go around the next level, gluing/nailing the pieces in place as you go along. By this time, you will have noticed that the padding stands higher than the wall of the ball pit itself. If you have used 2 2′ squared pads then you it should be 4′ tall standing up. Since, your ball pit is only 3′ tall, that leaves you with an extra foot of padding to fold over the top of your walls, covering any sharp edges, nails, potential splinters, or anything else that you or your friends could hurt yourselves on while jumping around in your nearly completed ball pit.

, Without doubt, this is the best step in these instructions. Just start pouring them in. If you can get a friend to pour them in while you lay on the bottom, it will be an exhilarating, once-in-a-lifetime experience.

, A small basketball net is a must for any ball pit. Not only because it’s fun to shoot hoops with playpen balls, but because it will also give people something to throw them at other than each other... or you. Also, an inflatable shark just makes sense. Every ball pit should have a shark in it. Now get into your colorful box of awesomeness, call all your friends, convince them that you have actually done this and aren’t just pulling their leg, and have a blast!

Learn how to Play Chopsticks.,
Understand that this strategy for how to win only works with the form of the game ""Splits"".,
The strategy to always winning once you have gone second is to tap the opponents hand as infrequently as possible.,
From (3),(0) against (1,0) and it is your turn, it is ideal to split to (2,1).,
From 1,1 against 1,0, (your opponent's turn) is one of the easiest wins in the game.,
Of course, there is always the person that thinks that they're tricky by starting out splitting to 2,0 as their first move.",How to Always Win Chopsticks,";
, In ""Splits,"" Instead of tapping the opponent's hand, you can split your hand, which counts as a move. For instance, let's say one hand has four fingers and the other has two. That equals 6. During your turn, you can ""redistribute"" those fingers, so that each hand has 3 fingers held out (you wouldn't want to do a 5,1 split because then the hand with 5 would be a dead hand). There are a few ways to govern splits:




The players can split the finger count any way they want. If they have a 4,1 distribution, they can split that to 3,2.
The players can only split a finger count in half. If they have 2,0, they can split it 1,1. If they have 3,1, they can split it 2,2. If they have 3,2, they can't split it because there's no way to split five fingers in half.
A player can be allowed to ""revive"" a dead hand by splitting.



, For example, when your opponent starts the game and taps your hand, split to three on one hand and zero on the other. At this point your opponent has no choice but to tap your hand again as them splitting to two on one hand would lead to an instant win for you. Once your opponent taps your ""three"" hand, you have two options to split (2),(2) or (3,1). It is ideal to split (3,1) because the game will be won more rapidly but it is still possible to force a win from (2,2).


From (3,1), assume your opponent taps your (3) hand. You are left with (4,1). It is then ideal to split (3,2).

If your opponent taps your (3) hand you tap one of their hands with your now (4) hand your opponent will tap your (4) hand and you will be left with (2,0). You split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your (2) hand you will be left with (3),(3). Next, tap either hand with a (3). Your opponent will be left with (4,1)

If your opponent splits to (3,2), tap their (2) hand. (If you tap their (3) hand your opponent will split and you will wind up with 3,3 against 1,1 again). From this point your opponent has to split their (3). You will then tap their (2), your opponent will tap one of your hands and then you will win.
If your opponent taps your hand with a 4, you take out their 4 and your opponent has no choice but to tap your remaining hand with a 1 and you win. If your opponent taps your hand with a 1, you will take out their 4 and your opponent will have no choice but to tap out your 4 hand. You will be left with 3,0 against 1. This scenario will be described later on.





If from (3,1) your opponent taps your (1) hand, it is ideal to tap their hand with your (3) hand. Your opponent will be left with (4,1).

If your opponent splits to (3,2) it is ideal tap out their (2) hand. Then your opponent will have no choice but to split to (2,1). Then, tap out their (2) hand. Your opponent has no choice but to tap your (2) hand. Then, it is ideal to split to (4,2). Your opponent will then tap your (4) hand, you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your (3) you tap their (4) hand, and you are left with (2,0) against (1,0). Your opponent will be forced to tap your (2), and you will be left with 3,0 against 1. This scenario will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your (2) hand, you tap their (4) hand and you are left with (3,0). Your opponent will have to tap you again giving you (4,0) you win by tapping their hand.



,


If your opponent taps your 2 hand, split to 2,2. Your opponent will then tap you leaving you with 3,2. Tap their hand with your 2. Your opponent will have no choice but to split to 1,2. From there tap out their 2 hand and your opponent will have to tap your two hand. Split to 4,2, your opponent will tap your 4 hand and you will be left with 2,0. From there you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.

If your opponent taps your 1 hand, split to 3,1. Your opponent will have to tap your 1 hand. From 3,2, tap their hand with your 2. Your opponent will have no choice but to split to 1,2. From there tap out their 2 hand and your opponent will have to tap your two hand. Split to 4,2, your opponent will tap your 4 hand and you will be left with 2,0. From there you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case will be described later on.


, Your opponent will tap one of your hands leaving you with 2,1. Split to 3,0, your opponent will be forced to tap your 3 leaving you with 4,0. Finally, you tap their hand to win the game.

, This situation, however, can be forced into a win as well. Once your opponent splits 2,0 tap their 2 hand (if you try to split 2,0 as well your opponent will just split back to 1,1 and it will go in a never-ending loop. From 3,0 your opponent has to split to 2,1, you then split to 2,0. Their only option is to hit you with their 2 hand to be 4,0. Now you split to 2,2.


If your opponent taps one of your 2 hands with their 1, tap out their 2. Your opponent will then have no choice but to tap your 2. Then you will be left with 3,3. Split to 2,4, your opponent will tap out your 4, and then you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case is described in step 5.

If your opponent taps one of your 2 hands with their 2, tap out their 2. Your opponent will then have no choice but to tap out your 4. From there, you split (1,1) and (1,1) against just one finger is an easy win. The way to win in that case is described in step 5.

Twist one end of the knot.,
Push the turned end through the knot.,
Pull the knot apart.",How to Untie Tight Knots1," Extending from any knot are two “arms.” Grab one of these arms and start turning it. You can turn it clockwise or counterclockwise. The number of times you’ll need to turn it depends on the tightness of the knot. The arms of very tight knots will need to be turned more than knots that are merely tight., Once you’ve turned one arm of the knot several times, push it through the heart of the knot using your hands. Start as close as you can to the knot itself, since the further from the knot you begin, the less leverage you will have.If you find that you cannot push the turned end through, twist it in the same direction several more times, then try to push it through.

, Once you’ve pushed a bit of the knotted material through the tight loop, pull it apart from the other side. If the knot is still tight, wiggle the bit you pushed through from side to side. This should enable you to bring it through the rest of the way. As you pull, the whole knot should loosen up even more."

, This knot is not very tight, nor large, but it still has uses. Frequently it is used as a stopper, preventing the rope from passing back through a hole or opening (like a rock climbing belay). It can also help prevent the end of a hanging rope from fraying., To loosen the knot, push the ends of the knot back towards each other. Then push and pull to follow the end of the rope back through in the opposite direction as it came. You may have to pull at the edges of the knot to loosen it, but once you can wiggle the end of the rope through you should be able to untangle the knot.

"
"
Take the knot apart with gripping instruments.,
Work something into the heart of the knot.,
Tap on the knot.",How to Untie Tight Knots2," Use a pair of needle-nosed pliers, forceps, or even a wrench to grip one side of the knot itself (as opposed to its “arms”). Hold onto the knot with your other hand or with a second pair of pliers. Tug gently at the knot.This is done to loosen up the knot. Once it loosens, pull the knot apart with your hands.
Do not pull as hard as possible or you might break the knotted material.

, Creating space within the knot will help loosen it. Depending on the nature of the knot, you could use a variety of tools for this. For small, tight knots, try using the fine teeth of a plastic comb or one tong of a fork. On larger knots, you might be able to use a bamboo skewer. Anything pointed and not too sharp will do.Slip the implement of your choice into the knot. Wiggle it back and forth a bit.
Without removing the implement you worked into the knot, pull at one portion of the knot to see it if it comes apart.
If the knot is still too tight to untie, wiggle the implement you placed in it a bit more, or take it out and try to push something with a slightly wider girth into the space you opened up. Afterwards, try to untie it again.

, If you can place your knot on a hard, flat surface, you could attempt to untie it using a hard fist-sized rock or a hammer. Start with a gentle but firm tap using moderate force. After a few taps, test the knot to see if it can be untied. If not, continue, adding force gradually each time you check the knot.Be sure that whatever is beneath the knot will not be damaged by the impact.

"
"
Soak the knot.,
Bite the knot.,
Walk around a bit.",How to Untie Tight Knots3," If you’re working on untying a tight knot in a rope, cord, or other fiber-based material, soaking it in water can help the process along. Just fill your sink or a small pot with water and let the knot sit in it for 10 minutes or so. After the time has elapsed, try to untie it. If it remains tight, place it back in the water for another 10 minutes, then check again., For knots in a medium-gauge cord or rope, bite the knot between your teeth. Work your jaw from side to side a bit. The pressure from your clenched teeth should loosen the knot enough that you can untie it with ease. You might even be able to feel it expanding between your teeth., If the tight knot you’re interested in untying is in your shoelaces, go for a walk or run. The combination of forward motion and stomping on the ground will naturally loosen the shoelace knot over time.The amount of time you will need to spend walking or running before your tight knot is loosened sufficiently varies depending on the severity of the knot. Very tight knots will take longer to loosen than knots that are merely tight.
Start by walking about for 10 minutes or so, then testing the knot in your shoelace. If it is still tight, walk a bit more.

Create a loop in the rope where you want your knot.,
Pass the end of the rope through the loop.,
Take the end back out of the loop and wrap it back under.,
Pass the end of the rope back through the loop a second time.,
Pull on both ends of the rope to tighten in.,
Use the double overhand knot for larger stoppers, or as part of other, more complex knots.,
Loop the end of the rope as many times as you want to increase the size of the stopper.",How to Tie an Overhand Knot2," Simply cross the end of the rope over the rest, creating a basic loop. Again, the bottom of the loop is roughly where your knot will be when finished./images/thumb/9/9b/Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-6.jpg/v4-550px-Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-6.jpg
/images/thumb/9/9b/Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-6.jpg/v4-300px-Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-6.jpg








, Tuck the end of the rope under the loop and pull it through the opening from the back. Note that, up to this point, these are the same steps as a normal overhand knot.

/images/thumb/d/d9/Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-7.jpg/v4-300px-Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-7.jpg








, You're basically wrapping the end of the rope around the loop once. The goal is to pass the rope through the loop not once, but twice.

/images/thumb/1/1c/Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-8.jpg/v4-300px-Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-8.jpg








, For the double overhand knot, you just double the steps of the basic overhand knot. Pass the rope back through the loop a total of two times.

/images/thumb/e/e7/Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-9.jpg/v4-300px-Tie-an-Overhand-Knot-Step-9.jpg








, This finishes your knot. Again, this is no more complicated than the basic overhand knot. Just pass the end through the loop twice and pull to tighten.

, The double overhand knot is simply a thicker stopper knot and is used to keep the rope from passing through large openings or holes. It can also, however, help you create several other knots:



Double Fisherman's Knot: Takes two separate ropes and ties them together with two double overhand knots.Double Overhand Noose: A more complex knot that uses the same basic theory as the double overhand, put provides an adjustable snare at the ropes end., The double overhand knot is a large stopper, but you may want even more size. To do so, simply keep moving the rope through the loop as many times as you want to make a triple, quadruple, or even bigger knot. These are simply called ""multiple overhand loops."""
"
Form a ""bight,"" or U-shaped bend, in the middle of the rope.,
Tuck the bight underneath the parallel ropes to form a loop.,
Fold the bight back over and tuck it into the loop.,
Use your fingers to adjust the ropes so that they all the sets of two ropes run parallel.,
Holding onto the standing ropes, pull the bight down to tighten the knot.,
Use a mid-rope overhand knot to provide a grip or prevent slipping.",How to Tie an Overhand Knot3," Take the location of your proposed knot and bend the rope back on itself. You should have both sides of rope running parallel to each other with a bend at the end. This bend is called a ""bight."", This, again, is almost identical to a basic overhand knot. This time, however, you're working with two ropes at once instead of one.


The portion of the rope that rests there as you create a knot is called the ""standing"" rope.

, Take the bight from under the standing ropes and pull it into the loop. You'll end up curling your bight over the parallel ropes, keeping the shape of the loop intact.

, This knot can quickly turn into a mess as it pulls tight. Tighten it about halfway, then use your fingers to massage the knot into something cleaner and more secure. You want to eliminate spots where the ropes split, instead aiming for clean sets of parallel ropes throughout.

, This will create your final overhand knot. Make any last adjustments to clean the knot and you're on your way.

, This knot can be made anywhere in the rope, meaning it can help pin segments of rope between two small openings. It can also be used to provide a hand-hold if you need to yank hard on a rope and don't have a good grip."

Wrap the narrow end around the neck loop on the right side.








,
The narrow end should be pulled back through the neck loop and then crossed over the front and pulled behind the knot to the left side.




,
Pull the narrow end through the new loop.,
Finished.








",How to Tie an Eldredge Knot," The wide end of the tie should be on your right side. Make sure that the wide end is hanging slightly lower than the narrow end, about 2 inches (5.1 cm). Make a small dimple on the wide end at the central line.





The wide end will not move during the tying process, so place it at the height where you would normally want your tie to end up.;
, Leave the wide end hanging in its original position. Fold the narrow end underneath the wide end to the left.








, Pull it behind to the right. Cross it back in front of the wide end and then pull it through the back of the neck loop. The narrow end should now be in front on your right side.









Make sure the knot is tight at this point

,, Loop it through the new opening created over the wide end. Pull the knot tight, with the narrow end being pulled upwards to the right.








,,, The narrow end will go back through the loop created above the knot, pulled towards the right side. Tighten the knot. There should be a small amount of narrow end left at this point.









Tuck the remaining narrow end into your collar. The tie is complete.

, Have all the participants roll a dice, whoever gets the biggest number goes first the second biggest number second etc. Have people face off if they both got the same number. Have one of your parents think of a number between 1-10, whoever gets the number is first the second closest second etc.

, Sit in a big circle around the icecream and the toppings. Give everyone and spoon for eating the icecream. Have a trash bin handy just in case.

, Have a parent blindfold whoever is going first so they can't see the toppings. The player can take the blindfold off once they're done picking a topping. Use a tablespoon spoon (not the spoon you're going to eat with) and add the topping to the icecream then pass the icecream and the blindfold to the person on your right to continue the game.

, Scoop a spoonful of icecream into your mouth, open your mouth wide to show everyone you ate the icecream.

, Wear a blindfold to pick a topping. Take off the blindfold and add a tablespoon of the topping to the icecream. Pass it to the person on the right.

, Remember this game is just for fun so don't cheat!

, If a person does not want to eat the ice cream, then they are out and will have to do the ""punishment"". These can be laid out before hand so they are appropriate for those who are playing. A good punishment could be having them do something embarrassing or eating something gross.

, To win you can't pass on eating the icecream when it's your turn. Reward the winner with a special prize such as candy or a crown.

Buy the actual model.,
Find a place to work; preferably somewhere you won’t be disturbed.,
Wash all the items in soapy water with a dash of vinegar before you start construction.,
Read the instructions carefully.,
Paint pieces roughly smaller than 1cm while they are still on the sprues.,
Test all your fits.,
Apply the glue.,
Be sure not to glue pieces like turrets and propellers to the model as they will have to move around.,
Put the decal out of the water and onto some tissue to dry off excess water.,
Hold the backing paper and the decal with tweezers up to where it should be on the plane.,
Use weathering effects or gloss to finish off your model.,
Well done!",How to Make an Airfix Model," This varies largely due to preference, but things to bear in mind include the size and scale of the model aircraft, the difficulty stage on the box, and the paints one needs to buy in order to paint the plane.;
, Clear a table or work surface and cover it with newspaper. Tape the newspaper onto the table so there is no chance of it lifting in a draft while you are working. Buying a cutting mat will also help, as it prevents damage being done to the table, and it also is where all the action happens, like painting, gluing and constructing.

, This should be done to remove the oily film on the model from manufacturing, and this will make it much easier to paint.

, These will show you all the different stages of the model and you will be able to work out where and when you should paint details such as interiors and pilots. You should also use the instruction sheet to buy which paints you will need during painting.

, They will be too small and fiddly to paint when cut out of the sprue.

, Before applying the glue or cement, test fit the two pieces which need to be glued without glue first, to make sure that they fit.

, Be sure to look at the instructions when applying the glue. Make sure to apply the glue sparingly, as you don't want excess glue seeping out of the joints of your model.

,


Each decal (stickers for the model) should be individually cut apart from the other decals and placed in a bowl of warm water until they move on the backing paper with a paintbrush.

, It is recommended you also add a layer of decal solution to the area where the decal goes, as it will help your decals conform to your model to give that painted on finish.

, Then use a paintbrush to slide off the decal into its correct place. Use the paintbrush to make adjustments to the location and orientation of the decal as well.

, It is recommended you apply a coat of gloss onto the decals to prevent them from cracking off later on. If you want to, spray a layer of varnish onto the model to give it that extra shiny sheen.

, You have now completed a model plane! Enjoy your work, and remember, your first model is probably going to be your worst, and for most, it only goes onwards and upwards!

Two small balls to make Uranus and Neptune (maximum 2"" / 5 cm)

, Acrylic paint is your best option, since some other paints can dissolve polystyrene. Choose a variety of colors to paint your planets, including orange or gold, yellow, red, white, and dark blue.


If you're not sure whether a paint works on polystyrene, check the label for brush cleaning instructions. If you can wash off the paint with water, the paint is water-based and safe to use. If you need to use a solvent like white spirit or turpentine, the paint is solvent-based and may dissolve polystyrene., Stick a long skewer into your largest polystyrene ball to hold it in place. Paint the entire surface with gold, yellow, or orange paint to make the sun. Place the skewer in a tall jug or stick the end in a polystyrene block and leave the ball to dry.


A stenciling brush or other short-bristled brush will help you get the paint to stick into the nooks and crannies on your polystyrene ball. You might need to let the first coat dry and use a larger brush to paint over it for an even color.If the paint doesn't stick at all, cover the ball with a thin layer of spackle, let it dry, and paint over that., The two medium balls are the two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn. These are called gas giants. They each have a diameter about ten times larger than Earth's, and are made mostly of a heavy layer of gas surrounding a rocky core.Skewer these and place them in a polystyrene block or separate jugs, so the wet painted surfaces don't touch.


Jupiter's clouds form bands and spiral storms. Paint this planet with red, orange, and white paint, swirled into patterns.
Saturn is pale yellow (a mix of yellow and white paint).

, Your last two balls will represent Neptune and Uranus, the smaller gas giants or ""ice giants."" About four times the size of Earth in diameter, these planets formed from balls of ice and heavy elements. Since then these materials have turned into a fluid core, surrounded by a layer of swirling gas.Paint Uranus a pale blue, made by mixing blue and white paint together. White clouds sometimes form over the solid blue atmosphere.Neptune is almost the same color as Uranus, but looks darker because it's farther away and receives less light.Paint it blue.

, Find a drinking glass with an opening the same size as the ball you used to make Saturn. Put the glass down on gold or yellow construction paper and trace around it with a pencil. To make a ring shape, put down a larger glass over your pencil circle, and trace around that as well. Cut out this ring, then glue it around Saturn and let dry.


To cut out the ring, start by cutting out the larger circle. Fold the circle gently in half without creasing it, then cut around the smaller circle.

, You can use polymer clay, air dry clay, or homemade polymer clay substitute. Roll five small balls (maximum 1"" / 2.5 cm across) using several colors of clay:


Mercury is a brownish gray rock, with no cloud cover.You can make it out of red or gold clay instead for a prettier model.
Make Earth out of blue clay for now.
Make Venus out of pale yellow clay.
Pluto is technically not a planet (it's too small), but it can sneak in anyway. Make it out of light brown clay, maybe with some charcoal mixed in to imitate its blotchy surface.

, Use a large needle to pierce each rocky planet through the center. You'll run thread through this hole later to hang the planets inside your box.


Poke the hole through Saturn at an angle, so the rings will be tilted when the planet is hanging down. This will look better and give you a little extra room to arrange the planets.

, Follow the dry instructions on the clay packaging. Air dry clay dries on its own, while other types of polymer clay needs a low-temperature oven to harden.


For light colored clay, it's a good idea to set your oven about 10ºF (~5ºC) lower than the instructions recommend. This can take twice as long to bake, but the chance of breaking is lower., Once the Earth clay is hard, paint on the continents with green acrylic paint., Once the black paint on the box has dried, use a white paint pen or small brush to paint white dots onto the inside of the box.

, Once the sun is dry, stick a skewer all the way through the ball, then remove it. Tape a piece of clear beading thread to the end of the skewer, and push it through the same hole. Repeat for each polystyrene ball.


Each length of beading thread should be long enough to hang a planet from the ""ceiling"" of the box, when the box is on its side. Five or six inches (13–15 cm) should be enough.

, Hold the end of the thread and withdraw the skewer. Knot the beading thread two or three times, then attach the knot to the polystyrene ball using a drop of glue from a hot glue gun.

, Once the clay planets are dry, drop the clear thread through the holes you made earlier. Attach the thread with a hot glue gun, as you did with the larger planets.

, Put the box on its side and hold up the threads on the ceiling. Stagger the position of the planets at different heights (top/bottom) and depths (front/back) so you can fit them all in the box. The balls should go in this order:


Sun
Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
Pluto

, Once you find an arrangement that looks good and fits in the box, mark the box at the ten points where you'll hang the sun and planets. Cut through the box at these points with a sharp knife, and feed the thread the planets are hanging from through each hole. Tape down the thread with strong tape and cut off the extra thread.

, Trace the side of the box onto black paper and cut out the rectangle. Glue this over the top of the box to hide the tape. Now you're ready to display your solar system model.

Decide which planet to make.,
Blow up a balloon.,
Make your adhesive.,
Shred your papers.,
Apply your paper to the balloon.,
Let your papier mache balloon dry.,
Pop the balloon.,
Paint your planet.",How to Make a Planet Model1," This will help you determine how large to make your planet. While this isn't too important if you're only making one, if you decide to make a whole solar system of planets, you may want to make them somewhat to scale.


For example, you'd want to make Mars or Mercury much smaller than Saturn or Jupiter.;
, Don't blow the balloon up too much, or it will become oval in shape. Try to add just enough air to make it circular, while making it as large or small as you'd like.









Place the balloon tied-end down in a bowl. This will hold it still and make it easier to apply the papier mache., You can use either glue and water, raw flour and water, or flour and water that's been cooked. There are different advantages to each: the glue and water is easy to mix up, the raw flour and water paste is stronger, and the boiled flour and water paste dries clear.









For glue and water paste, use about 1/4 cup of white school glue and add water just till it becomes slightly runny.For raw flour and water, mix enough water into flour until you get the consistency you'd like. Remember that thicker paste will take longer to dry and that you'll need to let your paper mache balloon dry overnight.
For boiled flour and water, whisk together 1/2 cup flour of flour and 2 1/2 cups of water over medium heat until the mixture boils. It will thicken into a gel as it cools., You can use newspapers, brown craft paper, or construction paper. Use whatever you have easy access to and be sure to rip your paper into pieces or strips.









Avoid cutting the papers. The straight lines will be visible once the paper mache dries. The torn edges of your ripped papers will blend in better.

, Dip the strips or pieces of paper into your paste. Be sure to completely coat the paper with the glue, but slide your fingers over the paper to remove excess paste. Lay the strips or pieces over your entire balloon. Add another layer of strips over your entire balloon.









Use your hands to smooth out any bubbles or bumps on the surface of your balloon, unless you want to give your planet a bumpy texture.

, Leave it in a warm place to dry overnight. The paper and paste must be completely dry before you begin painting or decorating your model. If you don't let it dry, it may mold.


In some cases, it may take longer to dry. If your balloon has a lot of paste or layers, it may take more time. Try letting it dry a few days.

, Once your paper mache is dry, pop the balloon using a pin or a thumbtack.Remove the deflated balloon and any bits of balloon that may be inside your hollow planet.








, For a simple model, use acrylic to paint your planet with its predominant color.









For the Sun, use yellow.
For Mercury, use grey.
For Venus, use yellowish-white.
For Earth, use blue-green.
For Mars, use red.
For Jupiter, use orange with white striations.
For Saturn, use pale yellow.
For Uranus, use light blue.

For example, you'd want to make Mars or Mercury much smaller than Saturn or Jupiter.

, If you're only doing one planet, make it whatever size you'd like, but if you decide to make an entire solar system, choose different sizes. This will allow you to accurately depict the scale of the planets.


For the Sun, use a 5 or 6-inch ball.
For Mercury, use a 1-inch ball.
For Venus, use a 1.5-inch ball.
For Earth, use a 1.5-inch ball.
For Mars, use a 1.25-inch ball.
For Jupiter, use a 4-inch ball.
For Saturn, use a 3-inch ball.
For Uranus, use a 2.5-inch ball.
For Neptune, use a 2-inch ball.
For Pluto, use a 1.25-inch ball.

For Saturn, use pale yellow.
For Uranus, use light blue.
For Neptune, use blue.
For Pluto, use light brown.

, If your planet has several colors, go back and dab the other color over the surface. If your planet has rings, attach wire or a styrofoam ring around the planet.









For rings, you can also cut the styrofoam planet model in half horizontally and glue an old cd through the center. Reattach the styrofoam halves with glue. The CD should appear as rings around the planet.For craters, you can chip out bits of styrofoam to make a craggy surface. You'll want to dab fresh paint over these areas.

, If you've made all the planets to scale, take dowel rods and cut them to size. This will ensure that the planets are the appropriate distance apart.









You won't need any dowel rods for the sun, since it will be the center of the system model.
For Mercury, use a 2.25-inch rod.
For Venus, use a 4-inch rod.
For Earth, use 5-inch rod.
For Mars, use 6-inch rod.
For Jupiter, a 7-inch rod.
For Saturn, use an 8-inch rod.
For Uranus, use a 10-inch rod.
For Neptune, use an 11.5-inch rod.
For Pluto, use a 14-inch rod.

, Using the trimmed dowel rods, stick the rod into the corresponding planet. Then, stick the opposite end of the dowel rod into the sun. Be sure to stick rods around the entire circumference of the sun. Start with Mercury, closest to the sun, and work outward.Here's a mnemonic to remember the order of the planets:My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas.

Cut a circle from a piece of plywood.,
Cut another circle.,
Cut a hole from the main circle.",How to Make a Hovercraft1," Purchase a strong square of plywood and cut a circle ~36-48"" in diameter. You will probably need to use a jigsaw to cut the circle from the plywood, but you can use another method if you are more comfortable with one.


Sand the edges when you are done to avoid painful splinters.





;
, You will need a smaller circle of plywood, roughly 6”-1’ in diameter. This will be used later.

, About halfway between the center and the edge, trace the end of the leaf-blower onto the larger circle. Cut out the traced circle using the jigsaw (you will probably need to drill a hole first, in order to use the jigsaw). Remove the leaf-blower when you are done checking for fit.


Check for a good fit by putting your leaf-blower in the hole. If it doesn't fit well, you can seal it later using duct tape.

Find a big, cardboard box.,
Color your box.,
Add decorations.,
Fill it with goodies.,
Show your box.",How to Make a Pandora Box," It should be enough to hold lots of goodies inside, like a shoebox or delivery package.;
, Interpretations of Pandora's box have been all different colors, but you can get creative with yours. Take some leftover wrapping paper or tinsel and wrap the outside (but allow it still to open) or get colored duct tape and tape all around, or even color it with markers. Either way, the box should look adorned and fancy, and should not show any bald spots.

, Draw some pictures on it, or add stickers or magazine pictures, but Pandora's box in different interpretations of it is elaborate and elegant, imprinted with gold designs or lovely dancing women. Get crafty and decorate it.

, Whether you are filling it with pencils, grippers, candy, hair bows, coins, jewelry or plastic goodies, the sight of the overflowing box should be tempting enough to lure people to it, just like Pandora was to open her box. You can put silly or scary things inside, like plastic frogs or spiders, to represent the evils of the world that Pandora let out, or you can add fun little things that people should be allowed to take.

, Pandora was given her box and told never to open it under a single circumstance, but she did because it was so tempting. You can give your box to a person and tell them never to open it like Pandora, or you can put it out in a library or classroom, telling people who pass never to open it. Either way, you should tell people the story of Pandora and how she opened the box even though she was forbidden to, and you should put a sign on the box with something like ""Pandora's Box"" or ""Never Open"".

Choose your brand.,
Thing about what you're making.,
Lets say we were making a robot out of Polymer clay.,
Make sure you squash all the pieces together nicely.,
You're basically done with making your model and now all that needs to happen is the baking stage!,
Finished.

",How to Make a Model Using Polymer Clay," Polymer clay brands include Fimo, Sculpey, Primo and often there is a store brand available depending on where you go. You will want to choose your brand according to baking times that suit you and a price that isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg. If you're just starting out with Polymer clay, buy a selection of brands. Work with them for a couple of weeks and then you can pick your favourite. Everyone has their own preference,so just choose what suits You!;
, Luckily with oven-bake clay you have a lot of time to think about what you're making and how you want to do it because it won't dry out for at least 7 months left alone. Even so, it's a good idea to draw a plan or have a general idea in your mind. Keep it simple and to your level. If you're a beginner you don't want to be making fully detailed sculptures. See the tips section for more information on level

, Get a couple of shapes together. Most things can be made from a ball so first start by rolling out a couple of balls varying in size. Play about with them by squashing, pinching, rolling and squishing the clay. When you have the shape you want, make another. Say if I had just made a rectangle then I would now make another smaller rectangle for my Robots arms,it all depends on what your model is.

, You don't want them to fall off once they are backed. You can use bake 'n' bond if you need help doing this. If you're using white clay you can either paint it now or after baking. It makes no difference. If you want this charm to be on a pendant or keyring attach an eye pin through it. These are found it most craft stores or online and are very cheap. Just cut it down to size with wire cutters and poke it through the top of your model but not all the way through! This will be baked in later.

, Look on the back of your packet of clay for baking times and temperatures. These will vary depending on brands. You can always use a glaze afterward to make these shiny.

Cut out your plastic cushion.,
Strengthen the plastic.,
Attach the smaller circle to the larger one.,
Cut holes in the plastic.",How to Make a Hovercraft2," Cut the plastic sheeting in a circle, about 1’ wider than the main circle. Wrap the excess plastic over the edge of the circle and staple it down using a staple gun, about every 4”.


If you want, use duct tape to tape down the extra plastic and seal any gaps at the edge.
The side covered in plastic is the underside of the hovercraft.

, Turn the board over so that the plastic side is facing up. Take duct tape and use it to completely cover the roughly 1"" sq area at the center of the circle. It should be at least a little larger than the small circle you cut out in step 2 of the previous section.


For example, if you just a 6” diameter circle, reinforce a 1” sq. area of plastic.

, Use wood screws to attach the smaller circle to the larger circle, at the exact center on the underside of the hovercraft. These screws should be no longer than the depth of both circles. Use roughly 5 screws to get a tight fit.

, At least 2"" from the edge of the smaller circle but still in the reinforced area, cut 6 holes in the plastic. This will let the air escape, creating the cushion on which the hovercraft floats. These holes should be ~1” wide.

It’s also great if you’re on a budget as many of your building materials can be found around your home. However, models built from cardboard won’t be as durable or sturdy as models built from other materials.


Empty cereal boxes, paper towel tubes, and toilet paper tubes are great cardboard building materials.Adhesives include masking tape, craft glue, and spray adhesive.
Other household materials such as tin cans and scrap paper can be used as well.;
, Craft foam, also called foam core, is sold in thick sheets at craft stores. This medium will create sturdy and lightweight structures. However, some beginners have difficulty cutting the foam. If you’ve never used foam before, buy extra sheets to practice on. To work with foam, you will need:


A sharp craft knife for slicing the foamA heated foam wire cutter for cutting large pieces of foam (optional)
Tacky glue, a hot glue gun, or a liquid adhesive

, Wood is the best choice for large, sturdy castles. These castles can last years if they’re built properly. However, beginners may find woodworking difficult and expensive. Tools for woodworking include:



A circular saw for cutting the wood
A hammer
A screwdriver
Wood glue
Nails and screws of various sizes

, Before designing your castle, consider any factors that will affect your design. For example, consider your space limitations. This includes your workspace and the display space. If your design is too large, you won’t have anywhere to put your castle.Other things to consider include:


What are the limitations of your building medium? For example, paper castles won’t last as long as wooden castles.
How big is your budget? Paper castles are cheaper than foam or wooden castles.
How much time can you devote to your project? Wooden castles are very sturdy, but they will take weeks to complete.

, There are many excellent model castle designs available online and at craft stores. These designs are good for beginners or for those working with unforgiving mediums such as wood. However, if you have a specific design in mind, it may be best to design your own castle.

, When a drawing is “to scale,” it is drawn with accurate proportions.To create accurate proportions, scale the measurements of your castle down. For example, if your castle will be three feet by two feet (.9 meters by .6 meters), your drawing could be three inches by two inches (7.6 cm by 5.08 cm).


It may be useful to use graph paper to sketch your castle.
Include any small details such as turrets or a drawbridge.

, Your castle will be composed of several large sections with many small sections mounted on top. For example, if you’re building a simple square castle with towers on each corner, your large section would be a square shape and your small sections would be cylinders.









Sketch each section separately to help you visualize the building process.

, Use your sketch as a guide. Create measurements for each separate section of the castle. Visualize building the castle with these different sections to help check your measurements. Make sure you include any accent features. For example:









Turrets
Towers
Roofs
A large base for your castle

, This step is optional, but it may be useful to create paper templates of any repetitive forms. For example, if you’re making a foam castle with a lot of towers, create a paper template of a tower. Next, lay the template on each piece of foam to cut out the tower. Each tower will be the same size and shape.


This method is also useful when creating paper castles. Instead of drawing and measuring each repetitive section, make a paper template to use.

, Depending on your building medium, you may need a saw, craft blade, or heated wire foam cutter. First, use a ruler and a pencil to mark the places you need to cut. Next, carefully cut out each piece of the castle, using your design as a guide.









It may be tempting to begin building after the first few pieces. However, if you cut all of the sections out before starting, it will be easier to finish the project.
It may be useful to number each piece to help you keep track of where they belong.

, Before you assemble the castle, cut out any windows, turrets, or doorways. Use your template as a guide. Otherwise, you may cut in the wrong places. If needed, use your ruler to measure any accents before cutting them out or create a paper template. For example:









Measure out and draw small 1 x 1 inch squares (2.5 x 2.5 centimeters) along the top of the wall. Next, cut out every other square to create turrets.Create a paper template of a window. Use this window as a guide to ensure that all your windows look the same.

, These sections are the foundation of your castle. Use an adhesive such as tape or glue (or a hammer and nail if you’re working with wood) to assemble each large section. After they’re assembled, place each section in its proper spot. Remember to use the correct adhesives for your medium. For example:









For foam, use spray adhesive, hot glue, or tacky glue.Use wood glue, screws, and nails to connect pieces of wood.
For cardboard, use white craft glue, glue sticks, and masking tape., These sections are the structural accents, such as towers, rooftops, and large gates. Completely assemble each section before connecting it to the larger base sections. When you have finished assembling these sections, your castle will be ready to decorate









If you use tacky glue, spray adhesive, or wood glue, let the structure dry for a few hours before decorating it.

, If you want to create a large, complex landscape around your castle, you will need a large base. Alternatively, use a small base as a simple mount for your castle. You won’t be able to add a landscape, but the base will help keep all of the pieces together. Attach the castle with an adhesive if you’re building with cardboard. If the castle is wooden, attach it with nails or screws.


Use a strong foam board base for foam or paper castles.Use a strong wood sheet as a base for wooden castles.

, Most castles are painted gray. However, there are many castles that are beige, white, and brown. Additionally, consider using a darker shade of the same color to outline any bricks or embellishments. Each medium works best with specific kinds of paint. For example:









You can use almost any kind of paint on wood. However, spray paint and water based acrylic paint work best.
Any water based acrylic or latex paint works well on foam. However, avoid using spray paint as it will dissolve the foam.You can use water and oil based paints on paper and cardboard. However, use spray paint sparingly as it may make these mediums soggy and weak.

, Once the walls of the castle are dry, you can begin painting any embellishments. Use a variety of colors to paint accents on your castle. For example, use a deep burgundy to paint any rooftops. Other accents include:


Window sills
Window panes
Doors and gates

, If you’re building a simple foam or cardboard castle, consider painting the landscape. This is a quick, easy way to give your castle a colorful backdrop. If you want to create a realistic landscape, visit a craft store for fake grass and small stones. Other realistic touches include:


Creating small hills with foam and covering them with grass
Lining a small pathway with stones
Creating a moat and filling it with clear epoxy to create “water”

, Place small accessories around the castle or on the landscape. Accessories can include small human figures, trees, shrubbery, bridges, and gates. Many of these items can be purchased at a craft store. However, if you’re on a budget or if you’re feeling inspired, you can make your own at home. For example:


Make your own trees by gluing a shredded green sponge to some copper wire.Craft a drawbridge using tongue depressors and hot glue.
Create small bushes by crumpling small pieces of green tissue paper.
Use a small jewelry chain to create a realistic drawbridge.

,
Tape the third and fourth pencils 90 degrees to pencils 1 and 2.,
Superglue a Q tip horizontally to two pencils.,
Superglue the other three Q tips in a similar way.,
Superglue a toothpaste cap to the end on a pencil.,
Superglue the other three toothpaste caps to the other three pencils.Do this the same way that you did in step 11.

,
Name your water tower.,
Find a spot for the water tower.",How to Make a Model Water Tower," The cup will be used to represent the water tank of a tower. We do not want the water tank to be more than 2 inches, so you should mark the distance from the base to 2 inches away from the base.
, Extend the mark so that a black line surrounds the cup at the 2 inch point. Try to your best to keep the line as even as possible.

, Using the scissors, cut into the plastic cup from its open end. Keeping cutting upwards into the cup until you get to the black line. In fact, cut very slightly above the line. Be careful with the scissors, as its sharp edge can cut skin. Also, cup may be difficult to cut. Take your time, and don't be afraid to use a lot of force with your cutting motion if needed.

, You want to separate the base of the cup, which will be the water tank, from the rest of the cup. Cutting the cup into two pieces as described will achieve this. Throw away all but the base of the cup. Cut in as straight a line as humanely possible. If needed, cut off any rough edges with the scissors.

, The toothpaste caps will act as the feet of the water tower. Any toothpaste residue will make our construction of the water tower harder. Rinse the caps with water, and use 1 Q-tip to remove any residue that was not washed off. Use the same Q tip for all 4 caps. Wash the Q-tip in-between caps if need be. Throw away the Q-tip once this step is done.

, The Q-tips, pencils, and caps will combine to form the legs and support of the water tower. You want the legs of the tower to be the same color as the water tank. Using the colored marker, color every part of the Q-tips, color only the wooden part of the pencils, and color the outer-edge of the caps. For the toothpaste caps, run the tip of the marker through the crevices to achieve maximum color. Wash hand with soap and water and dry with the paper towel once done to remove marker residue from them.

, The pencil will act as the legs of the water tower. Taping the pencil inside of the water tower will allow this to occur. Push the eraser to a top edge of the interior of the water tank, and tape the pencil to ensure stability.

,, Again, do this the same way that you did in step 6.

,  Let both ends of the Q-tip be 4 inches from the wooden tip of the pencil it is glued to. The Q tip represents a cable that supports the water tower. Make sure to let the glue dry.

, This will result in all four legs being equally supported by the cables.

, Fill about a fifth of the big hole of the cap with superglue, and stick it to the unsharpened end of the pencil. Make sure to let the glue dry.

,, Most water towers are named after the city that they are located in. For example, you can name yours after your first name. Write the name of your water tower on the water tank with the black marker.

, Be proud of your work. Put it in a spot where everyone can see it.

Read up on how humans lived during the era in question. What materials were their homes made of? How many people lived together in one house? What kind of furniture and features did they have? This step is less essential if your focus isn't historical accuracy, but can be interesting and educational none-the-less.
, This will be your workspace. Check for any bumpy parts on the top of your workspace, and consider moving if there are any - you'll want to make this project neat, so you want a flat workspace., Remove any tapes or attachments. It's okay if it tears off a layer of cardboard as you take it off - the walls of your house will need some texture, anyway (you'll also paint over the tear so no one will see it)., If possible, use acrylic paint - it will cover any words, printing, or tears in the cardboard well, and is thicker than other paints. Select the right colors as well. For a project about historical houses and cities, you might want to use earthy colors (texture will be explained later in this process), such as tan, very dark brown (you can use lighter brown paints to paint streaks for texture if you're using dark brown), a very light tan/beige, as well as several other shades of these colors.

Use dark brown mostly for texture. The same goes for black - consider using this color for streaks of detail or to make 'cracks' on the cardboard in order to make it seem more realistic.
Get the correct paintbrushes. For details, paintbrushes with very small bristles are useful. Medium-sized ones are good for painting bigger details, e.g. cracks in the walls, worn down material in the house, etc. Large paintbrushes can be used for painting the cardboard the main paint color. After the first layer of paint dries off, the second coat of paint can be painted on. Details and texture can be added afterwards.

, Gather materials that would represent what was in the houses during the time period you're depicting. Use household materials if you'd like, or even store bought items, such as other pieces of cardboard that can be folded and put inside of the box, cardstock, paper towels with texture in them, unwanted legos to be painted and built together, etc. You might want to add furniture, such as worn down tables, chairs, and an oven. You might also build a bed, with cotton balls or a similar soft material.

If it suits the time period you're aiming for, use ripped paper, small pieces of wood, and clay in order to create a fireplace for the house as well. Clay could be useful for the actual fire - the other materials are suitable for the wood and fireplace.

, Use light colors - darker colors are better suited for texture later on. Cover all the printing, tapes, etc., on the cardboard box to make sure it looks realistic. Continue on inside of the cardboard box as well as on the bottom and the top. Cut off two of the sides that are across from each other after the first coating dries, but keep the other two - be sure to paint them as well. Repaint any chipped areas and repaint the areas with printing on them for better coverage.

Paint the sides you will cut off before you cut them off; that way, it's already done. This will allow you to easily use the cardboard for the indoors section of the project without having to paint it separately.

, Depending on how much paint you used, it could take from five minutes to more than half an hour to dry. Cover any dark brown areas where the cardboard is showing as well as chipped in areas (sometimes the paint will dry, but it will layer over on top of another layer of paint, causing a clean brown spot to appear)., Use the darker colors paints now and choose a smaller tipped paintbrush. Create thin lines along the edges of the cardboard and add 'branches' of thin lines that come out of them as well - they will look like cracks. Consider using black acrylic paint for this as well. Add lighter or darker brown (but still not too dark) to create spots and bumps along the walls. This would make your project seem more realistic.

Paint tiny pieces of cardstock or bumps of Styrofoam, tape them randomly across the walls, and then paint the tape as well to make real bumps. Be sure to cover up the tape as well so it looks more accurate. You can also use legos and tape them to the bottom edges of the box, then paint the legos and tape to make it seem as if the house was not too stable.

, Make sure its sides are a little bigger than the cardboard box - this will ensure that it will be easier to hold. Add fast drying glue (once the bottom coat of paint dries) or another thick layer of paint in order to stick it to the base.

Buy some fake grass, plants, or real sticks from outdoors and stick them around the base. You can also get a layer of base to stick on the whole entire base to make it seem as if there was real grass around the house. Place some store bought plastic or fake plants and trees, and add fruits to the trees for detail if you'd like. For sticks, paint them a darker color to make them match the scene a bit more. Consider buying straw as well to represent farmland, or straw-colored grass.

, Plan out where you would want to put each appliance or item of furniture on the inside of your project. Aim to fill up as much space inside of the house as possible.

Think about other appliances/furniture you could add other than the main ones. A storage for supplies and food is a good example, or even a working/crafting area to make tools.

, Use cotton balls, other cotton material, or even paper towels that have texture in them to perform this task. Paint it a suitable color, such as dark brown or dark tan, and stick it on one of the sides of the inside area. Do the same with the cotton balls if you're making a pillow.

If your cotton ball or material you are using is hollow, stuff it with some thin sticks found outside, or even fake straw. Paint the outside a suitable color as well.

, Use a bumpy material or something with a line pattern on it for the base of the hearth. Paint it a dark brown or black and stick the wood on there. Put the base of the hearth in a corner of something, but not too close to the bed - be sure there is a wide enough margin for other furniture and appliances as well in the project. Create flames using yellow, orange, and red clay, and use a toothpick to add detail to the clay as if it was a real fire. Place the flames on the wood and allow it all to dry.

Create a shelter for the hearth if you'd like (optional). Tape on of the painted cut off pieces from earlier to the very top of one of the sides of the box. Bend it so that it covers the fireplace and tape the part that touches the floor of the indoors section of the house. Leave the side of it open as that will be where the hearth appears. Be sure it is stable and add some details or texture if you'd like.

, Use legos, plastic toy chairs/tables, or other pieces of cardboard/cardstock that are painted a suitable color. Bend two sides of a large piece of cardboard, but keep a wide area for the top of a table. Do the same with chairs except with smaller pieces. You can also build a table or chair out of legos and paint it, or simply use mini plastic toy chairs and tables., Choose another corner of the inside of the box and paint a square of it a darker brown. Add straw or fake plants at the bottom as well if you'd like. Use the second piece of painted cardboard you set aside from cutting off earlier to make a stove. Add details, such as dents in the top to represent the parts of where food gets cooked.

At the side of the kitchen area, use a jewelry case or any other object that can open and close easily. Paint it a black or dark brown color and fill it with lego foods, colored pieces of paper, cardstock, etc., to represent stored supplies and food.
If you'd like, tape a square piece of cardstock that is painted dark brown to differentiate the color at the front side of the oven. Be sure it can bend back and back up to act as the bottom part of an oven. Behind the bending cardstock, draw out the inside of the oven to make it more detailed.

, Use bumps, legos, and other painted things to stick to the bottom of the project, or even on the appliances included in the project. Add trees, fake plants, etc., on the outside if you'd like. You can maybe even some straw scattered around the floor of the indoors area or some fake plants with tan painted pots. Swipe black and dark brown paint to make it seem old and represent the mud-brick and other materials early humans used to make houses thousands of years ago. Be creative and do the best you can to make it look realistic."

Next, make the floor.,

Paint everything with primer.,
Then the nice bit.,
Windows can be made by simply cutting the shape from clear plastic.,
Axle & Suspension: This can be purely functional, or you can make it look realistic as well.,
Line up the suspension / axle assembly under the caravan.",How to Make a Cardboard Model Caravan2," Getting the caravan in proportion is important, and it's easy to make the floor too narrow. Test this with a few bits of paper to make sure it's how you want it. Very thick cardboard is good for this like cardboard from a ring binder folder. Be extremely careful not to amputate any fingers when cutting this. It does take a bit of time because you need a decent sharp Stanley knife. Scissors are not ideal because they will bend or crease this thick cardboard, or the scissors may even break.

, Follow the shape as closely as possible. When it's done, allow the glue to set, and then sandpaper off any excess so you've got a smooth shape (like it was before you added the balsa wood.

, These are easy, as it's just straight edges with holes for the windows. This can be just done with cereal box cardboard for now.

, Allow the glue to set well before attempting to stick the ends on. And make sure the sides are aligned correctly before gluing the ends on, or the caravan might look like a crooked house or an insurance write off.

, Now you have a choice. Do you want this caravan to have an interior or not. If you have the time and inclination, go for it. If not, it will look fine anyway, but you need to make some curtains. If you're going for an interior, plan it now. Definitely don't wait until you've stuck the roof on.

, Glue this in and you're ready to start putting in the roof beams. These are the same size and length as the two you've just glued in at the top of either end. (parallel to the ends). 5 is a good amount. Distribute them evenly spaced apart all along the length of the roof. After this is done, you can cut sections of cardboard to use as the roof. If you want authenticity, and have a steady enough hand to cut very narrow strips of cardboard trim, do it. Also, this trim is good for covering up the joins in different sections of cardboard used to make the roof.

, This saves getting dust or paint on them. It's slightly tricky to fix curtains in position once the roof is on, but if you've got this far, you'll manage.

, For strength, it can be made to run far enough under the caravan so the suspension can attach to it, but it isn't essential.

, Make a mould of one, using plastic padding car body filler, and then use glass fibre resin. Pour into the mould. The only problem with this is that it's hard to stop the resin from sticking so well to the mould that it breaks when you try to separate them. Use Copydex glue, painted into the mould, as this helps to get the wheel out afterwards.

, Once it's properly dried, and if you want a nice smooth finish, lightly rub it down with some fine (1000 or 1200 grade) wet and dry sandpaper.

, Putting on the top coat. Take care to get rid of all the dust before you do this, or it will show through the paint and spoil the finish.

, To make them look like they have frames, cut thin strips of masking tape, and stick this around the outside edges of the plastic. You will need to do this on the inside as well as the outside because the glue holds them in better if there is masking tape on the inside where it fixes to the walls of the caravan. You can paint the masking tape with aluminum coloured Humbrol paint.

, The quickest and easiest way is a single phone card with a piece of coat hanger wire attached. Put a slight bend in the phone card. A cigarette lighter works well for this, but you may have to experiment with a few until you get it right. Make two holes in one end of the card, attach the axle to the other. Fit the wheels. Fix them on (and to stop them coming off) using small strips of electrical wire insulation. You can expand this so it fits properly by sliding it over a wooden cocktail stick. A brief bit of heat from a lighter helps it to stay the size you need it to be. Once the wheels are on and you're happy that they're in the right position, you can put a tiny bit of glue on to hold them, but this is optional.

, When the wheels are lined up with the wheel arches, mark the position, and then glue it on. To give it some extra strength, you could glue a layer of cereal box cardboard over this to hold it. You could use very short self tapping screws to hold this on.

Learn the different kinds of football wagers.,
Familiarize yourself with key statistics in football betting.,
Keep up to date on emerging trends.,
Manage your bankroll properly.",How to Learn Football Betting," Football gamblers have a wide array of bets to choose from, ranging from straight wagers to proposition bets. All can play a role in the player's betting arsenal.


Spread: This is the most common football bet. A team may appear on a sports book's betting board as ""101 New England -3."" This means that a player who places a bet on New England (by calling 101 to the teller) can only win if New England beats its opponent by 4 points or more. If New England wins by 3 points, the result is declared ""no action"" and all money is returned. If New England wins by 2 points or less or loses the game outright, the bet is a losing one. Spread bets are generally 11/10, or $11 wagers to make $10. So a winning bet returns $21.
Money line: This is a straight wager on who will win the game. Teams that are favored require a larger bet to make a smaller profit. For example, if San Diego is favored in its game with Kansas City, its money line may be ""San Diego -160."" That means the player must bet $160 to win $100. ""Kansas City +260"" means that the bettor collects $260 on a $100 wager if the Chiefs win.
Over/under: This is a bet on whether the combined score of a game will exceed a predetermined figure or not. A bettor choosing the over in a game with an over/under of 45 wins the bet if the 2 teams combine to score 46 points or more. Payouts are the same as with point-spread wagers.
Parlays and teasers: These wagers involve 2 or more teams. All bets must be winners for the player to collect. The greater the number of bets, the larger the payout. A winning 5-team parlay, for example, pays 20-1. Teasers also involve multiple teams but allow you to alter the betting line slightly in your favor.
Propositions: These exotic bets usually are offered only during special games, like the Super Bowl. Players can make bets on virtually any game occurrence. Some prop bets can be on the type of play that results in a score, whether a quarterback will throw an interception, the score at the end of the first half, or even who will win the opening coin toss. These wagers are difficult to win and offered at generous odds.;
, There are thousands of football websites providing detailed information on every phase of the game. While most fans concentrate on touchdowns, rushing yards and completion percentages, serious bettors focus on other data that historically has a greater impact on the outcome of games.


Average yards per attempt: Many professional sports bettors use this figure to determine the effectiveness of a team's skill players, but it also points to the overall performance of the offensive unit. Bettors generally prefer quarterbacks who average 8 yards (7.3 m) per passing attempt and rushers who average at least 4 yards (3.7 m) per carry.
First-half scoring trends: Football bettors try to isolate teams that build early leads and take control of the game. These teams tend to manage the clock well in the second half and force their opponent to take chances to close the gap, often resulting in turnovers.
Negative pass-play percentage: This is the combination of 2 important defensive statistics � sacks and interceptions � that often uncover teams sitting on a victory. Teams with an NPPP higher than the league average have disruptive defenses that take opponents out of their game plan.
Turnover ratio: Few statistics have a greater influence on the outcome of a game than turnovers. Teams that don't protect the football lose field position and very often, games.

, Effective sports bettors consider a variety of factors before making their wagers. Professional sports gamblers are keenly aware of personnel changes, the extent of player injuries, and even weather forecasts.

, Professional football bettors are dispassionate gamblers. They understand the innate volatility of the game and therefore, never risk a large portion of their bankroll on any single contest. Professionals try to grind out profits over the long haul, capitalizing on their experience and insights into each contest. In general, bettors will only risk 20 percent of their total bankroll each week. For example:


A player has a starting bankroll of $5,000. He can make $1,000 in bets for that week. If the bettor wins $2,500, increasing his bankroll to $7,500, he can make $1,500 in wagers the following week.
Professional bettors also vary the size of wagers on games based on the strength of their opinions. If the player wants to bet $1,000 on 3 games, he may put 4 units on the bet he is surest about and 3 units on the other 2 games. In this example, each unit represents $100.

Tip whenever you feel generous.,
Tip whoever you want.",How to Give a Tip to a Dealer," The dealer will then tap the chip and put it into a transparent tip box. The dealer will appreciate this, but it's not very exciting. In most games you can just slide the chip across the table to the dealer, but in craps you should toss the chip anywhere on the table and say ""for the crew"" or something to that effect.;
, In craps, you make a small second bet next to whatever bet you're making and you say ""for the dealers"". In card games, you place a small chip in front of your own chip, facing toward the dealer.


Craps: There are a few popular ways to get the ""boys"" (the house crew of either gender) in on the action by placing a bet for them. The way to give them the best odds is to bet exactly how a shrewd player bets for himself: on the pass line, with maximum odds played once the point is set. To do this, place a chip of lower value next to your pass line bet and say ""dealer money"". This dealer bet can be lower than the table minimum. Then, when the point is established, put a few chips behind the dealer's chip. If the shooter makes his point, the dealers win and get a nice little payout.
Craps: Another traditional bet is the ""two-way yo"". (""Yo"" is craps slang for 11). Throw two low-value chips on the table, say ""two-way yo"", and the dealer will place two yo bets: one for you and one for the dealers. A yo bet is a long shot at 18:1 odds, but it pays out at 15:1, so if you ever hit a yo for the dealers they will get a nice tip from you.
Card games: In table games with cards, you can also make a wager for the dealer on the next hand. Simply place a low-value chip toward the dealer, in front of the spot where your own chip goes. If you win the hand, the dealer will pay both your bet and his bet and then tap his winnings into the tip box. If you lose, the house gets it all back.
Roulette: The expected value playing Roulette is so awful that you should just give the tip to the dealer directly. Better yet, you should get up and play craps or blackjack. When played with a basic knowledge of proper wagers and decisions, craps and blackjack have about a 1% house edge. Roulette will always have at LEAST a 5-6% house edge on you.

, Traditionally, not very much. Most casino gamblers, especially at low limit tables, tip nothing at all. Most dealers will thank you earnestly for any tip. It's up to you. When playing for the house it is quite customary to use $1 or $2.50 chips, while you are playing with $5 or $10 or more. Don't be afraid to play for them with even only $1, that is quite common.

, Some people like to throw a $1 bet for the house pretty frequently, some will play all night and then hand their dealer a more substantial tip at the end. It is much more customary to tip when winning than when losing.

, Most people who do tip at all tend to tip any dealer who is courteous and competent. A dealer who is fun to chat with, pays good attention to you, saves you from forgetting to place a bet, or helps you refresh your memory as to the optimal move to make in your situation is a good dealer. A dealer who does most or all of these things is a great dealer. Tip quite a bit more if your dealer is making your time more fun or saving me from committing errors in a fast-paced game. Of course, you are not obligated to tip anyone. If a dealer is rude or screws up placing your bet, that's bad news. If you have to call his pit boss over because he insists you waved ""stay"" when you were showing a 3 and a 4, he definitely does not get a tip!

Bet the maximum amount of money.,

Press the “Bet Max” button to bet the maximum amount of money possible. This is the only way to be eligible for the jackpot or to spin the Wheel of Fortune.Look at the indicators and make sure your bet is valid each time you play, that each bill and ticket is accepted.

, Pull the lever or press “spin” to start gambling. Each type of slot machine has a different winning combination to get the jackpot. To spin the Wheel of Fortune, you have to land on a “spin” picture (old style), or 3 SPINs on a payline (new style). Keep gambling until you either lose all your money or come out ahead.


Trust your instincts. If you’re not feeling lucky, either switch to another machine or take a break from gambling.
Never gamble with money that you can’t afford to lose. Never bet with rent money, mortgage, utilities, car payment, or other funds you need to live. Do not use credit cards for cash advance; there are fees and the interest rate can approach 50%.

, If you land on the “spin” picture you’ll have an opportunity to spin the Wheel of Fortune. Some machines have a special “spin the wheel” button while others let you press the regular “spin” button. After you press the button, the large wheel over the game will begin to turn. Whatever dollar amount the wheel stops on is yours to keep. The wheel sections may be stated in dollars or credits; multiply credits x the machine denomination to determine your winnings.


The lower maximum bet machines will have lower dollar amounts on the Wheel of Fortune, and vice versa. A new version of the $100 Wheel has a top spin prize of $40,000!

, Any amount won that exceeds $1200 will be a hand pay; the machine will lock up and flash its candle, and an attendant will come over to handle the win. If you win the progressive jackpot, you can choose to accept your money in payments over time or as a lump sum. If you accept the money in payments, you will lose less to taxes. However, most experts say to choose a lump sum. Even though you will lose a larger amount to taxes, you can invest a larger sum of money at once and make it all back ."

Choose a machine with a smaller minimum jackpot.,
Pick out a Wheel of Fortune game.,
Understand your odds of winning on these machines.,
Do not try to muscle a slot machine!",How to Improve Your Odds at Wheel of Fortune Slot Machines3," Different versions of the Wheel of Fortune games have different minimum jackpots. Some gamblers believe that smaller jackpots are easier to win.Even if this isn’t the case, machines with smaller jackpots have smaller maximum bets, which will allow you to stretch your money further. Note that the $25 and $100 Wheels have fixed jackpots that are not progressive.


For example, lower maximum bet games often have a minimum jackpot of $200,000, while the higher maximum bet games usually have a minimum jackpot of $1,000,000.

, Over two dozen kinds of Wheel of Fortune slot machines exist.These games will have different winning combinations and symbols, but they’ll all include a bonus ""spin"" option that lets you spin the Wheel of Fortune. Almost all of the versions have the same odds, so choose one that looks fun to you.


You can identify these games by the large spinning wheel over the main part of the machine.
All of these machines use random number generators to determine outcomes.

, Many professional gamblers avoid slot machines because the chance of winning your money back is low.Furthermore, no matter how high the jackpot gets, slot machines aren’t required to pay out. A larger jackpot doesn’t give you a better chance of winning.


Because the machines use random number generators to decide outcomes, your odds won’t ever change no matter what time of day you play.

,


Slot machines are built to take daily use. They are armor-plated, have tempered glass, and are equipped with sensors that detect tampering and abuse. They are tested against various types of behavior before leaving the factory, including zapping it with a Tazer. You cannot affect the outcome by slamming it, banging it, hudging it, lifting it off its foundation, or other forms of physicality. What will happen is much like the pinball machines of old: the machine will detect the abuse and shut itself down, which also voids any credits you have left. You will then find yourself surrounded by security or police, who may arrest you but will more likely escort you off the premises.
Remember, cameras are everywhere, so whatever bad behavior you exhibit is recorded and can be used against you in court. Those of us who play regularly have had our bad days and our good days; if you arent having a good day, there is always tomorrow. Walk away, go have a meal, or a massage, or a swim, or go shopping.

Decide how many picks you want in your parlay.,
Pick your teams and totals.,
Decide on an amount.,
Make the bet.,
Give the clerk your picks.,
Give the clerk the amount you are willing to risk.,
Listen to the read back.,Enjoy the games!",How to Make a Parlay Wager," A parlay is a group of two or more straight bets, in which the outcome of all the individual picks affect the outcome of your wager. To win the parlay, you’ll have to win all the straight bets in it. Why would you want to take a parlay? Easy, it pays much more than a straight bet, because it’s harder to hit.
, Different sports books have different rules regarding parlays. The two most important rules you’ll want to ask about are:

1. Up to how many picks can you take in a parlay? The more picks you take, the more it will pay.
2. What happens with cancellations? Some sportsbooks will cancel a parlay if one of the picks tie or the game is cancelled, while others will just turn the parlay into a smaller one (a five-team parlay with one cancellation will become a four-team parlay with an adjusted pay out).

, After the clerk’s initial greeting, give him your account number and password, and ask for the lines you’re interested in. If you want to hear the complete board, you may ask for a rundown. Have a pen and the sports’ schedule with you! You can make a parlay with only one game, using the total and the money line or the total and the point spread. Most sports books won’t allow you to parlay the money line and spread of the same game., A complete rundown can vary anywhere between two lines to up to more than fifty in college football or basketball. You’ll want to write the lines down to study them. There are many different lines you can bet on: money-lines, point spreads, totals, first halves, second halves, props, futures, match-ups; the list goes on and on. Parlays are exotic bets and as such will have some restrictions such as what kind of lines you can take or what kind of odds. The most usual restrictions are that you cannot parlay props, or that there is a limited amount of dog lines you can parlay together. This is done to avoid a high payout., Remember, the more picks you add in the parlay the more it will pay, but it will also be harder to hit. You will also want to be careful with taking too many money line favorites, as this will lower your payout. Sure, a favorite with a -400 money line will probably win, but it will also lower your payout considerably., You can take a parlay with only teams-to-win, or combined with totals. You can also combine sports and halves of games (different sportsbooks will have different restrictions on parlaying the whole game with the halves)., There are plenty of parlay calculators available online, which can help you decide how much to bet to win the amount you’re hoping for. The more money line dogs you take in a parlay, the more it will pay. Study the example below (based on Vegas parlay payout).
Parlay $20/138
Ravens -4 -110
Ravens Over 40.5 -110
Steelers -275
H Jets -167
In this example a parlay with the Ravens point spread -4 points, the game going over 40.5 points, the Steelers money line -275 and the first half Jets money line -167, $20 would bring back $138.
Notice how a change in a money line or juice will affect your payout:
Parlay $20/370
Ravens -4 -110
Ravens Over 40.5 -110
Bengals +235
H Jets -167
In this example a parlay with the Ravens point spread -4 points, the game going over 40.5 points, the Bengals money line +235 and the first half Jets money line -167, $20 would bring back $370., Begin by telling the clerk what kind of play you want and the number of picks in it. For the example above, you’d say: “I want a four-team parlay.”, It will take the clerk a second to set everything up to take your play, so give him a moment and then start listing your picks. It is not necessary to give the clerk the lines, for the example above you would say:
“Ravens, Ravens over, Bengals money line and first half Jets money line.”
Notice that for the point spread it is not necessary to specify what kind of line it is, as opposed to the money line picks. This is because the point spread is the main line on football. The only time you must specify you want the point spread is if during the call you have asked for the money line as well as the point spread., A simple “for twenty” is enough to let the clerk know that you want to risk twenty dollars on this parlay. If you say nothing after listing your picks, the clerk will prompt you by asking “for how much”, if you prefer you can wait for this moment to give him your wager’s risk., The clerk will now ask you if you need anything else. If that’s the only play you want to make, say “no thank you”. The clerk will proceed to give you the read back. Listen carefully and make sure you’re taking the teams, the lines and the amount you wanted. If everything is in order, confirm your parlay by giving the clerk your account number and password one last time. The clerk will then thank you and end the call.,"

Play the maximum number of coins.,
Test the payout of your machine.Whenever you sit down to a new machine you need to test the payout percentage.,
Play multiple machines at once.,
Know when to stop playing.",How to Find a Loose Slot Machine at a Casino1," Many machines require that a player gamble with the maximum amount of money to have a chance at winning the jackpot. Make sure you check the payout table to find out. The payout table is a small printed sticker displaying the percentages of likelihood for the winning combinations.If you don’t want to pay the maximum, consider finding a less expensive slot machine.


For example, if you play on a machine with a 25 cent minimum but a one dollar maximum, you should play with one dollar to see the best results.
This technique is best for machines with a jackpot. However, this is a good method for regular slot machines as well.;
, Put in a few dollars and see how much you get back. After some time has passed, figure out whether or not you’re breaking even. If you are, stay put! It could be a loose slot machine! If not, move to another machine.


For example, if you spend about twenty dollars at a machine over half an hour and only get about ten dollars back, that’s probably not a loose machine. Leave and find a better one.
Avoid choosing a “favorite machine.” If you devote a lot of attention to one particular machine, you won’t be as likely to leave it when it stops paying out.

, Experienced gamblers will often play two or three slot machines at the same time. This is based off of the belief that loose machines are situated right next to tight machines.These gamblers believe that increasing the number of machines they use increases their chance to find a loose slot.


Don’t spread yourself too thin. If you use machines that are too far away from one another, you may lose track of which machines you’re gambling with.
Take care when using this method as you might lose your money that much faster!

, Before stepping foot into the casino, figure out how much money you can afford to lose. Never spend money that you need for other obligations. Similarly, if you make a big profit, consider pocketing the profit and limiting your gambling to the money you came in with. Adopting this system will minimize your losses."

Play machines with good payouts.,
Don’t play progressive jackpot machines.,
Don’t play multiple payline slots.",How to Find a Loose Slot Machine at a Casino2," Typically, the more money you have to use to play, the higher the payout percentage is. For example, machines that require $1 or more generally pay out 95% to 99%, where 25 and 50 cent machines usually pay out 92% to 95%. Be wary of casinos advertising that their machines payout “up to 99.5%.” To make this claim they only have to have one machine that pays out 99.5%. All of the rest can be standard machines.


Slot machines don’t usually post their payout percentage publically. Look in the machines “help” menu or try to find the information online.
A machines payout percentage doesn’t change throughout the night. This is a common myth. The payout will stay the same over the course of a few weeks, if not years.

, Progressive slot machines slowly accumulate money from players and display the total as a jackpot.When playing on these machines, there’s a possibility that you may win millions of dollars! However, the odds are very, very slim.These machines make the casino money by reeling customers in with promises of a million-dollar jackpot and then fleecing them. Don’t be fooled by these marketing tactics.


If you simply can’t resist playing a progressive jackpot machine, remember to play the maximum amount of money. Otherwise, you may not be eligible for the jackpot.
Some people will avoid progressive jackpot machines unless the jackpot is very, very high. To reach the payout percentage a machine has to pay out money periodically. Therefore, if the jackpot is large, the machine might be ready to pay out.

, These machines display multiple paylines, or the line of numbers or symbols that determine your winnings. These machines typically have many possible winning combinations across the different paylines.This can seem like a tempting offer but don’t be fooled! These machines usually have a lower payout percentage than your standard slot machine.To spot these machines, look for multiple rows and columns of symbols that advertise “many winning combinations.”The most common kind of multiple payline slot has five rows and five columns of symbols.

"
"
Gamble in casinos.,
Ask an employee.,
Find “loose slot spots” in casinos.,
Avoid low payout locations.",How to Find a Loose Slot Machine at a Casino3," Casino slot machines typically have the highest payouts at 95%. This means that for every dollar you put in, the machine is programmed to give back 95% of it at some point. Other gambling locations such as airports, bars, grocery stores, and service stations typically stock machines that have a 50% to 75% payout.


Las Vegas is famous for having looser slot machines than other gambling cities.
Many gamblers theorize that the older casinos in Las Vegas tend to have looser slot machines to compete with the flashier, newer casinos.

, Casino employees see thousands of people gambling every week. They probably have a good idea of where the “hot” machines are and may be willing to share this information for a good tip. Ask them if there have been any big slot winnings recently and if so where those machines are. Similarly, ask them which machines they prefer to play themselves.


Remember to tip them generously if they help you out, especially if they’re also serving you drinks.
If they refuse to help don’t press the matter. It may be against their company policy to pass that information along and doing so may cost them their job.

, Many people believe that casinos strategically place loose slots in high-traffic areas to encourage passerby to play. Therefore, choose machines that are in highly visible places such as near the change booths or on elevated platforms.Slots in the “crosswalk,” or areas that other players must cross through to reach other parts of the casino, are famously loose.


Keep in mind that this is just a theory. Don’t stick to a bad machine just because it’s in a high payout location.
If you’re having trouble finding a good machine ask another gambler if they know where the “hot” machines are.

, Many experienced gamblers avoid the main slot areas. This is the location that the highly visible slot machines are trying to draw you to, and these machines are notorious for having low payouts. Similarly, avoid the machines next to gaming table areas and ticket lines.These machines might distract the customers that are spending lots of money on other things; therefore, the payout will be low to avoid drawing attention.


Make a special effort to avoid the slot machines near the poker tables. These machines are notoriously tight."

Deal out the cards.,
Arrange your cards.,
Bet your way out.,
Start trading.,
Play your hands or pass.,
Go out.,
Perform the coup de grace.,
Count your points.","How to Play ""La Dame Noire"""," The cards can be dealt in any way, but we usually deal them in 3-2-3-2-3. Deal counter-clockwise.;
, Although the potential combinations (see below) are very organic, since they can change at any minute, the fact that any combination is beat by a higher one, means that you can arrange them by combo power, weak to strong. I usually arrange them by face value, but it's entirely up to personal preference.

, After cards have been dealt and arranged, the player to the right of the dealer has the opportunity to bet that he is going to be the first to go out. This decision is taken based on combo power and the Singletons you have (see combinations below). A lot of Singletons means low chance of going out first, while an 11-card Libra (again, see combos below) means you just have 2 Singletons to throw away, so it's a sure bet. If the first player does not bet, everyone else in turn has the right to bet. If someone bets, the others have the right to take the bet on themselves, raising the stakes. Betting starts with 20 points and can only be raised by other players in 10s, eg. if Player A bets a 20, the next player can only bet a 30 or higher. The betting can't go over 100, which means the player who bet 100 keeps the bet on himself. Remember that the grand total of the points that can be amassed in a game of La Dame Noire is 37, so if you lose a 100-point bet, you are going to be set way back!


If no bet is placed, the cards have to be collected and re-dealt.

, You trade one face-down card to the player at your left, with one face-down card from the player at your right. The trading continues until someone calls ""Stop"". When ""Stop"" is called, everybody takes back any cards they had prepared to give out and the showdown starts.

, The player who has the bet starts the showdown using the following combinations. Each combination is beat by the next one and also by stronger cards of the same combination. If everybody passes, the player takes the trick and leads a new one. The combinations are as follows:


Singleton. The weakest of the combinations. It consists of a single card and is beat by any higher Singleton. 2 is low, Ace is high. A Singleton can only be beaten by a higher Singleton, not by a Singleton of the same value but different suit. There is only one exception to this. The Queen of Spades (""La Dame Noire"") is the highest Singleton, and therefore beats even Aces.
Beggar. The second combination in power. It consists of a low card and its respective high card, the ""brother"". Valid ""Beggars"" are the following:

2-A
3-K
4-Q
5-J
6-10
7-9
8-8
As you see, the high card is selected by calculating the same distance the ""low"" has from 8, but going upwards. Also, the ""Beggar""'s power is calculated by the low card, so 8-8 is the highest ""Beggar""


Straight. A 5-card only straight, consisting of cards of consecutive face values. Again, suit does not matter.
Quarto. A 4-card combo consisting of four-of-a-kind of any card.
Libra. The most powerful combo that beats any other. Also, is the only combo that can be extended. It consists of a minimum of 5 cards and can go up to 11 cards. The Libra is made as follows: a pair, followed by the next card in face value as a Singleton, then the next card in value as a pair. The Libra can be extended with the last pair's next card as a Singleton and again the next card in value as a pair. A Libra always starts and ends with a pair. An example of a Libra would be 22-3-44-5-66. Note that Libras with more cards beat Libras with less regardless of face value (eg. QQ-K-AA is beaten by 22-3-44-5-66).

There are no Pairs or Trios, so if you have Three of a kind, you either have to break it up to three Singletons, or combine it with other cards to make a better combination. Also, try to keep your high combinations in cases where there are a lot of points, not just for show! (see Scoring below)



, Try to go out first playing your cards wisely. With skill and luck you can go out first.

, The first player to go out, whether he is the player that kept the bet or not, has the right to perform a strategic move to try to take more points. Normally, the last hand he played and the cards below it (from the previous players) is collected immediately after he plays it, instead of leaving it on the table for showdown. However, if the trick contains points and he performs the coup, he can take the whole trick and give it as tricks to the player he thinks will go out last. See scoring to see how this affects the points.

, Each Spade counts as 1, each Queen counts as 5 but the Queen of Spades counts as 10. The Grand Total is normally 37, but there could be less points counted (see below). Also count the bet, if the better did go out first, he also takes the points he bet, else, he loses those points. Nobody else benefits from the bet.


After the normal points have been counted, the first player takes +20 points as a bonus. The second player takes +10 and the third takes +5.
The last player takes the most damage. His whole pile of tricks is trashed, which means he takes no points from tricks, no matter how many tricks he earned. If he does indeed have tricks, that means the Grand Total is reduced from 37, since the last player's points do not count. Also, the last player gets no bonus. This means the last player can only go negative, if he also lost a bet!
The coup de grace is a special type of bet. If the first player to go out did indeed perform it, then when the game finishes, if the player he gave out his last trick to did come last, then the first player takes all of his tricks and adds them to his pile. If not, then the first player just sacrificed his points at a wrong call.

You'll need a table saw, a band saw, a drill press, sandpaper, spray adhesive, a brush, and wood finish.You'll also need a framing square, a clamp, some paper, a printer, and some scissors.;
, Go to your local hardware store and purchase a block of wood. The length and width of the wood block don't matter, as you'll be cutting it down. Just make sure it's roughly 3/4"" thick, and definitely no thinner than 1/2"".The type of wood isn't important, but generally lighter wood will work better.

, There's no lack of free cribbage board templates online. Search for one you like and print it out on plain white printer paper.The template on this website will work just fine: http:








This cribbage board template is of the 120 hole type. There will be 397 holes to drill in total. The main 360 holes follow along three rows of 120 each that go around the curved end of the board and back up the middle. Most of the holes are about 1cm apart from one another.

, After you've printed out a cribbage board template, cut it out with scissors. Then spray the blank side with spray-on adhesive. Wait a few seconds, then place the adhesive side of the template on the wood block. Place it so that one corner of the template lines up with one corner of the wood block.







, Use your table saw to cut the wood block so that it's the same size as the template. Lay the wood on the table and use the guide of the table saw to cut straight lines, getting the board down to the width and height of the template. For the rounded side of the template, cut the wood down to the highest point of the semi-circle, so that you make the wood block as small as possible without cutting the template.








You should now have a block of wood that is the same size as the template that's glued to it, except for the rounded side of the template.

, Use your band saw to cut out the corners of the wood block that extend from under the template. Move the wood block slowly and carve out those corners with the blade of the band saw. The wood block should now be the same size and shape of the template.







, To make sure your holes are aligned when you're drilling, use a framing square as a guide. You'll want to clamp the framing square to the table of the drill press. Then when you're drilling, you can move the block of wood along the edge of the framing square to make sure the holes are lined up with each other.

, To get clean holes with minimum tear-out, use a high-quality 1/8"" brad-point bit. These can be found at hardware stores. Set the drill to its highest speed. Place the wood block against the framing square so that the drill bit is lined up with one of the holes on the outer most row., Spin the drill at full speed and drill out all of the holes in the template. Move the drill bit down slowly. Drill the holes 1








Every couple of minutes, turn the drill off and touch the bit to check its temperature. Let it cool for a few minutes if it's hot.

, Remove the paper template. Use sandpaper to smooth all the sides of the board. Work your way through several grits of sandpaper, starting with a rough grit and up to at least an 180-grit, preferably a 220-grit. Rub the sandpaper firmly into the wood until it feels smooth to the touch on all sides.







, Use acrylic paint and a small paintbrush to paint the board however you desire. The most common way to paint a cribbage board is to paint over the three rows of holes as three stripes in different colors. You can use a ruler as a guide to help you paint the stripes with clean edges.


You may also want to use a small sharpie, pen, or a very small paintbrush to write the different labels on the board as shown in the template.

, Use a finish of your choice. A water-based poly­urethane finish will work well. Apply three coats to the board with a medium sized brush. Wait for each coat to dry in between coats. Apply each coat quickly to minimize the amount that gets into the holes.







, You can buy cribbage pegs online, or at a board game store. You can also use 1/8"" double-headed nails, or even something like the pegs from a battleship game. Then all you need is a deck of playing cards and you're ready to play!"

You start with two cards face-up(the dealer has one face-up and face-down).You try to get close to 21 without going over it(called bust). On your turn you either choose to get another card(hit) or keep the same amount of cards(stand). After everyone is done, the dealer flips up his own card and he keeps hitting until he gets to 17 or up.;

,, And lower the value the more of a chance you get 2-6

, The book was based on his experiences working as a ""big player"" (BP) on Al Francesco's teams. In big-player blackjack teams a number of card counters, called ""spotters"", are dispatched to tables around a casino, where their responsibility is to keep track of the count and signal to the big player when the count indicates a player advantage. The big player then joins the game at that table, placing maximum bets at a player advantage. When the spotter indicates that the count has dropped, he again signals the BP to leave the table. By jumping from table to table as called in by spotters, the BP avoids all play at a disadvantage. In addition, since the BP's play appears random and irrational, he avoids detection by the casinos. The spotters, who are doing the actual counting, are not themselves changing their bet size or strategy, so they are relatively inconspicuous.

Know what your friend is offering you.,
Know what Nevada offers you.,
Examine these two propositions.,
Do the math.,
Look at the win percentages of successful professional gamblers.,
Note what they call big sports bettors - whales.,
Compare the win percentage, to break even in Nevada, to your hometown friend - 52.4% to 54.5% respectively.,
Make small bets with your hometown friend offering you 6/5 odds and save your big bets for Nevada where you have a good chance of breaking even or winning.,
Review math (adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing fractions), probability and algebra and apply this to the other bets like parlays.",How to Calculate the Break Even Point for Spreads and Totals," To win $100 you bet $100, but if you lose you owe your friend $120.;
, To win $100 you bet $110.

,


In the first case you win even money, but pay 20% more if you lose. It seems like the 20% is spread over winning and losing and equals just 10%.
In the second case, you have to pay 10% more to win $100. You might conclude that these two propositions are equal.

,


With your friend, you have to win 54.545 out on 100 bets to break even. 54.545% X $100 = 45.454% X 120. With your friend you have to win more than 54.5% of the time to break even.
In Nevada, you have to win 52.38 out of 100 bets to break even on their 110/100 proposition. 52.38% X $100 = 47.62% X $110.

, Their number are between 55% - 60%. With work or school demands you cannot achieve their win rates. Do not believe the tipsters with win-rates of 70%. Take the advice of authors with a background in finance, math (especially statistics) or computer programming and an established reputation. There are successful sports bettors without that heavy academic bent but they are doing their research and spend long hours at their craft. Experience is a hard teacher, quantification of thoughts (put a percentage number on Jets should win or Boise State will cover the spread) and doing the math will bring better results for most people.

, They bet enormous sums of money because at the end of the season they will have just a small amount of wins over losses. Conclude that their win percentage is not very high. In blackjack, your average bet is smaller than your football bets because you make more bets in a weekend than you do in a season.

Always split aces.,
Always split eights.,
Always re-split aces or eights if you are dealt a second pair.",How to Know when to Split Pairs in Blackjack2," There are a few situations in Blackjack when it always makes sense to split, no matter what card the dealer is showing. For example, you should always split when you get a pair of aces.Splitting gives you a much better chance to get a strong hand. See below:


If you play your two aces as one hand, you'll start with a value of 12 (one is played as an 11 and the other as a one). Only a nine will give you 21. A 10 or face card will force you to play the second ace with a value of one, bringing you back to 12.
On the other hand, if you split, you have four ways to get a 21 in either hand (being dealt a 10, J, Q, or K).

, Besides aces, the other pair that almost every Blackjack expert will tell you to split on is eights. It's difficult to get a good hand when you play your eights as one hand. Your chances aren't fantastic when you play them separately, but you do stand a better chance mathematically. See below:


Playing your two eights as one hand starts you at 16 (a very weak hand). Hitting at this point is a risky proposition. Anything above a 5 will cause you to bust, so you have about a 60% chance of losing the hand from the get-go.On the other hand, if you split, it's impossible to bust out on your first hit, so you at least have a chance of getting a more favorable hand.

, When you split, the dealer gives you two cards — one for each of the new hands. If this gives you a second pair of aces or eights, treat it as its own hand and split again.


Note that this requires you to triple your original bet (splitting the first time requires you to double it).
House rules may vary here. Most Blackjack games will allow you to split a maximum of three times (to play a total of four hands)."
"
Never split tens.,
Never split fours.,
Never split fives.",How to Know when to Split Pairs in Blackjack3," This is a common rookie mistake in Blackjack. Splitting 10s essentially sacrifices a great hand for a very slim chance at an even better one.See below:


If you play a pair of 10s, your hand has a value of 20, which is quite good. If you split 10s, you need to get an ace to improve your stance — anything else will give you a hand that has an equal or lesser value. Statistically speaking, splitting tens is most likely to give you two hands worse than the first one.
Some card-counting experts suggest splitting 10s in very specific situations. For example: if you're counting cards and know that there are lots of 10s left in the shoe, it can make sense to split 10s against a dealer showing 5 or 6 (which suggest a weak hand). This way, you stand a reasonable chance of getting at least one 20, while the dealer will have to get lucky to match or beat you., Splitting a pair of fours just gives you two weak hands, so it makes no sense. Remember that splitting requires you to double your original wager — this means splitting fours is usually a money-losing proposition.


When you hit on a pair of fours, it's impossible to bust out — the highest you can go is 19 if you get an ace, which is a pretty decent hand. If you split your fours, you're likely to get left with a less-valuable hand (if you get a two or three) or a hand that is possible to bust out on if you hit (if you get an eight or higher). You need to get a five, six, or seven to be better off than you were originally.

, When you see a pair of 5s, forget that they're a pair and treat them like a single 10. Double down on a 10 against anything but a dealer's nine, 10 or ace. For these three possibilities, just hit.Splitting a pair of fives is like splitting fours, only worse — you give up a strong starting hand for a very slim chance at getting something better. With a pair of fives, you can't bust out and you have a chance of getting 21 on the first hit. If you split, you'll be left with a weaker hand (if you get a two, three, or four) and/or a hand that it's possible to bust out on if you hit (if you get a six or above). There's really no way to come out ahead by splitting on fives.

"
"
Split twos, threes, or sevens if the dealer shows a seven or lower.,
Split sixes when the dealer shows a two through six.,
Split nines against two through six, eight, and nine.",How to Know when to Split Pairs in Blackjack4," The examples in the sections above are hard and fast rules that should rarely (if ever) be broken. For other pairs, the best course of action usually depends on the card the dealer is showing. For example, pairs of twos, threes, and sevens should be split when the dealer shows a relatively low card. If the dealer has an eight or better showing, just take a hit.


Some resources recommend splitting twos and threes (but not sevens) when the dealer shows an eight., If the dealer has a seven or better, just take a hit. Mathematically, you're more likely to beat weak dealer hands if you split your sixes. If the dealer is likely to have a stronger hand, your best bet is to hit and improve your hand — you'll only bust out if you get a 10 or face card.

, If the dealer has a seven, ten, or ace showing, don't hit — instead, stand. Hitting on an 18 is borderline-suicidal. Anything but a two or three will make you bust out.

Start with a nice even deck of standard playing cards.,
Place entire deck between your first and middle finger, as far down in the V as comfortable, so the cards rest at the joint closest to your hand.

Search for ideal cards using an overhand shuffle.,
Float ideal cards to the top of the deck.,
Reverse the order of the cards for a bottom deal.,
Order the cards to fall in your hand.",How to Cheat at Card Games1," Place the long edge of the deck of cards along the base of your last three fingers. Your index finger should support the top edge of the deck. Wrap your pinky around to support the bottom edge. Your thumb should be resting on face of the cards, with the cards held vertically, and the back of the cards resting on your fingers.Grab the deck with your shuffling hand by placing your thumb in the center of the bottom edge of the cards and your forefinger on the center of the top edge.
Pull a majority of the cards from the center of the deck into the shuffling hand while gently sliding some of the cards off the top with your supporting thumb to keep them in the palm. Press those cards with your thumb toward the fingers of the supporting hand and drop the the cards from your shuffling hand back onto the top of the deck in the supporting hand.
Repeat this shuffle. Peel off more cards from the deck in your shuffling hand with the thumb of the supporting hand, until most of the cards are back in the supporting hand. When there are not enough cards left to shuffle in the shuffling hand, drop the rest of the cards on top of the stack in the supporting hand.
Tilt your supporting hand slightly past vertical so that you can see the face of the cards. Search for the cards you want in your hand.;
, When you identify a card you would like in your hand, drag the rest of the cards off of it, so that the card you want is at the bottom of the deck. Pull your thumb across the card you want in your hand. Pinch it between your thumb and forefinger to drag it to the top of the deck.Continue to shuffle the rest of the cards after floating your card to the top to hide the move.
Keep the card on top by performing a slip to hold it in place. Firmly place your last three fingers on the top card as you shuffle the others through the deck.
Use a second card deal to deal yourself the top cards and deal the second card to everyone else. For instance, if you are playing Poker, you will want to have 5 cards on top which set up a good hand for yourself.
If you are playing a partner game, like Euchre, consider placing more complimentary cards on top of the deck and dealing off the top to your partner as well.

, If you have placed all your ideal cards at the top of the deck, use the overhand shuffle to reverse the order of the deck and place your cards at the bottom. Grab the entire deck with your shuffling hand and slip one card at a time off the deck with the thumb of your supporting hand until you have gone through the entire deck.Now that the ideal cards are on the bottom, you can use a bottom deal to set yourself up with a good poker hand, while dealing to everyone else off the top.

, Cut the deck in half and place each half on the table to perform a table shuffle. Press the bottom half of each deck with your fingers while lifting the inner corners of the deck upward. Control the cards as they fall and shuffle. When you get to the top of the deck, drop the number of cards you need between the two cards you want in your hand so they will fall to you when you shuffle.The number of cards between each one you want in your hand will be the number of players minus one, which is you.
It is better to get too few cards in between on your first shuffle, because you can always shuffle again to add more.
This is especially useful for a game like Poker where you will be dealing a hand to several people at the table.

Deal yourself the top card by “second dealing” to the rest of the table.,
Deal your hand off the bottom of the deck.,
Stack the deck with the cards in order.",How to Cheat at Card Games2," Stack the deck with the best cards on top. Hold the deck in the palm of your hand with your thumb on top. Using your thumb, slide the top card at an angle slightly off to the side so that you can grab the corner of the second card with the thumb and forefinger of your dealing hand.


Continue this process as you deal cards to everyone else, then deal the top card to yourself.
Practice this move slowly and continue to increase the speed of your deal and decrease the distance you slide the top card as you improve.
Keep this trick out of the view of the rest of the players by bending your wrist so that the top of the deck of cards tilts slightly toward you. This will utilize the back of your hand to shield the deck of card from the view of the other players.

, Stack the best cards on the bottom of the deck. Hold the deck in the palm of your hand with your thumb on top. Keep the tip of your middle finger poised on the corner of the card on the bottom of the deck. Deal to the other players off the top of the deck. When it is time to deal your own hand, apply slight pressure to the corner of the bottom card, using the middle finger you had poised and ready. Gently push that corner toward the corner diagonally across from it. That corner should press against the palm of your hand, creating a slight bend in the card and separating it from the other cards at the bottom of the deck. Slide the bottom card slightly out from the deck and grab it with your dealing hand.It is important to separate the card from the others at the bottom of the deck to be sure that only one card slides and doesn’t take some of the others with it, leaving you with a deck which isn’t square and potentially giving away your trick.
Keep the deck slightly tilted with the top of the cards facing the rest of the players and hiding the bottom of the deck and your bending cards.

, Use an overhand shuffle to float the cards you want to the top of the deck, then table shuffle the number of cards between the ones you want in your hand to stack the deck in your favor. If you have stacked the deck with the best cards ordered to fall into your hand, you can deal as you normally would off the top to yourself and everyone else.


Count the number of players, not including yourself. This is the number of cards you will need to place between the cards you have stacked for yourself on the top of the deck. For instance, if you have four other players in the game, and five cards stacked for your Poker hand on top of the deck, place four cards between each of the five cards you wish to keep for your hand.
Avoid giving yourself a perfect hand and focus on giving yourself an edge with the best starting hand, so you don’t give yourself away.

Assign a point value to the cards being dealt.,
Calculate the point value of the deck with each hand that is dealt.,
Practice counting an entire deck of cards.,
Play your cards right.,
Assess the true count.",How to Cheat at Card Games3," Cards 2-6 are considered low value cards. These add one point to your count. 7-9 are neutral cards and do not carry value. 10-Ace are high value cards and subtract a point from your count., Continue to add and subtract point values for each round dealt from the deck. You will better be able to assess the deck after several hands have been dealt and you have an idea of the value of cards remaining in the deck according to your calculations.For instance, if you have 5 players and the cards dealt to each player were: The count for this round would be: This leaves you with a deck count of: -4.

, Deal through an entire deck of cards on your own and count the value of each card as you go. If you count correctly, your final count should be zero.

, Dealers have to draw on hands of 12-16, therefore a deck full of low value cards is beneficial to the dealer making it less likely that they will bust, or go over 21 on a hard draw. This means, if you have assessed the deck at a negative point value, it is more beneficial to the dealer, and there are more low value cards left in the deck.Do not bet against a dealer on a hard draw with a low value deck.
You may also benefit from “hitting” or drawing a card if the dealer is showing a face card and you have a hand with a hard draw.
Make larger bets when you have a high value deck, meaning there are more 10 and face cards left in the deck making it more likely to be dealt a blackjack or 20.

, Most casinos deal several decks at one time. Take your running count of the cards being dealt and divide it by the number of decks left in the dealer’s hand or “shoe.” This will give you a better idea of the actual probabilities of being dealt a good hand, or the dealer going bust.For example, if your running count is +4, and it appears there are 2 decks left, you would divide 4 by 2, leaving you with +2. This is still a positive count and means you can bet higher on this deal.

Arrange an order for the suits to be marked on the card.,
Use the cluster method to identify the suit.,
Mark the numerical value in the fan.,
Repeat the marks on the opposite corner.",How to Cheat at Card Games4," A common system of ordering cards uses the consonants from the word “chased"" to order the suits. This code stands for: Clubs, Hearts, Spades and Diamonds., There are five hash marks in the pinwheel under the man at the top corner of each card. Using a fine tipped red or blue sharpie, depending on the color of the deck, color in the hash mark within the pinwheel on the right side which represents the suit of the card according to the “chased” order.If the card is a Club you would color in the first hash tag, for Hearts the second, Spades the third and Diamonds the fourth.
Mark the right side of the card because when they are fanned in your opponents hand in a game like Poker, it is most often the right corner of the card which is showing.

, The fan is the flower shape being held by the man at the top corner of the card. If the flower is completely unmarked, it is an Ace. Use a red or blue pen to mark out the petals on the fan.Start marking with the petal to the right of the top/center of the fan, or what could be considered “one o’clock.” Color in this petal to signify a 2. Continue around the flower with 9 being the petal on top of the fan.
Color in the circle at the center of the fan to identify it as 10. Any face cards should also have this center circle colored in. The circle plus the top/center petal colored in will be a Jack, the circle and the next petal to the right would be a Queen. The center circle plus the third, or horizontal petal would be the King.

, Each card has the value flipped on the face of the card, meaning that it can be held in your opponent’s hand “upside down” from where you made the mark. Repeat your marks on the opposite corner of the card to be sure it is visible regardless of which way your opponent holds the card.


This also makes the card look consistent, making it less obvious that the deck is marked.
Make your marks on a new deck. The color of the deck will fade and you want your marks to fade with it and not be darker than the color on the deck.

,
Double check the amount of cards distributed.,
Know that for the next game, the person to the left of the previous dealer is the new dealer.",How to Deal Playing Cards,"


Read the game rules, to see if each player gets an even amount of cards or a different amount.
Check to see if the game requires a separate pile on the side. This extra pile is known as a ""kitty"" or ""discard pile"". It can be used as extra cards to play in the game, a discard pile for unwanted cards, or leftover ones that aren't going to be used in the game.;
, The smaller amount of people that play, the more cards a person gets, as well as the higher amount of people, the less cards a person gets. Assuming that the entire deck without Jokers are dealt, this is a general guide:


2 people = 26 cards each with 0 leftovers
3 people = 17 cards each with 1 leftover
4 people = 13 cards each with 0 leftovers
5 people = 10 cards each with 2 leftovers
6 people = 8 cards each with 4 leftovers
7 people = 7 cards each with 3 leftovers
8 people = 6 cards each with 4 leftovers

, Make sure that the cards are facing down to ensure that no one can see what other people are getting.

, Move clock-wise in a circle and give yourself a card last. Repeat the process until the amount of cards specified in the rules are distributed.

,, Once the discard pile is made, do a card count. Everyone should have the same amount of cards, except if the card rules says differently.

, The previous dealer then gets the 2nd to the last card of the ""round"".

Grab the bottom edge of the deck with your thumb.,
Use three fingers, close together, to grab the top edge of the deck.,
Squeeze the deck towards your palm to create ""air pockets."",
Position the deck sideways, with the face of the deck showing to your viewer.,
Open your fingers back up, like an opening clamp, to let them waterfall.",How to Do the Waterfall Card Flourish," On the bottom, grab the deck with your thumb at your first knuckle. The top edge of the deck fits into the crease. The tip of your thumb should overhang just a bit below the deck.






;
, On top, grab the deck with your first, middle, and ring fingers wt your first joint (the joint right after your palm). Your fingers will drape over the deck. Bring them close together so that you can pinch the deck firmly, bending it back into your palm.








, You'll get a hill-shaped deck, with little pockets of air between the cards as they bend upwards. Having air pockets creates space in the deck that allows the cards to fall one by one, instead of in chunks.








, Turn the deck so that the bottom card is exposed and your longer edge of the deck is on top.








, This is the only part that could take some practice. You want your hand to open up even and straight. Your thumb and fingers should slide apart at the same rate, though it will takes some practice to figure out just how fast this is.









Note: This trick cannot really be performed slowly. It looks best with a quick but fluid motion."

Know what to buy.,
Don't bend your cards.,

Cool the cards.,
Rest the cards.",How to Care for Playing Cards," Do not get the brand Royal. They fade extremely fast. These are the best cards (in the order of best to worst): Bicycle, Tally Ho, Accro, and Aviators. Bicycle is the most popular playing card.;
, You really have to care for your cards if you want them to stay good for a long time. Watch the result of when you do a riffle shuffle or a spring. You'll actually notice that your card is starting to bend.

, Know when to replace your cards. Don't use them if they've gotten wet from rain or if you see that the edges are starting to split. These are signs that they are going to fall apart. You might as well replace them now instead of waiting until you have 104 cards instead of 52.


Yes, Bicycle cards can be used for years. But even they will wear with bad handling.

, If you notice, new cards tend to have a sliding attribute. Place a brand new deck out on the table and the top card will slide slightly. This may not seem like a big deal, but when you try to do something like a Charlie or Swivel or some other cut, it will matter. The cards will just slip out most of the time because it hasn't been worn in. You know that it's worn in well when the top card doesn't slide or when you can riffle shuffle comfortably.

, If you look, whenever you don't wash your hands, they feel kind of sticky. It will get your cards dirty and sticky.

, You may notice a while after that your cards get sticky. The best way to unstick them is to take a few cards out of the box first and let them sit for a couple weeks/months. The reason for taking the cards out of the box is to let the cards inside and out air out.

, The other option you have is to spread the cards in a cool environment and allow them to sit for 24 hours or more, face up for half the time, and face down for the other half. You can also do this by laying the cards individually instead of spreading them.

, All of this is good, but the best way to get cards back into usable condition is just simply not to do anything with them for extended periods of time.

Decide what deck is going to be used.,

Find a name for your game.",How to Create a Regular Deck Card Game," It can be a standard 52-card deck, a 54-card including 2 jokers, a 32-card Belote deck, a 24-card Euchre deck etc. You can decide this later on, but keeping in mind how many cards will be required will be helpful with later sections such as scoring.;
, Normally, the power goes from 2 to Ace, although there are numerous variations, such as Ace to Ace, 7 to King then 10, Ace, 9 and Jack (for Belote), or Joker is highest power. Make sure to keep at least a portion of the order in face value (for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 are in the usual order). If you rearrange all of the cards in power then it may be difficult for prospective players to remember the order.

, It is not unusual to mix styles to create new games. Tichu, for example, combines Trick-Taking, Matching, Shedding and Showdown. Usual types of games are the following:


Trick-Taking, like Euchre or Jack, where one tries to win rounds by taking all the cards.
Matching, like Rummy or Biriba, where one tries to form combinations, usually runs (eg. 5 6 7 8 9) or equals (eg. 4 4 4).
Shedding, like Uno, where one tries to get rid of all of his cards as fast as possible.
Showdown or Comparison, like Poker or Blackjack, where one tries to overpower opponents with his cards.
For fun, like Ring of Fire. These games are mostly played in parties, with prizes or penalties like drinking or taking dares.

, If it is a trick-taking game, it could be beneficial to have teams in it. On the other hand, most showdown games are each for his own.

, The most usual combos are high card, pair, 2 or more pairs, trio, quarto (or four of a kind), runs (or straights) and fulls. You may want to add your own combinations, or eliminate existing, but make sure not to make the combinations overly complex or they may be too difficult to remember.

, Some games, such as Gin Rummy, require matching suits, some others, like Jack do not. There are also games that give some bonuses to players choosing to match suit instead of playing a mixed suit hand, like Poker, where a same-suit run is more powerful than a mixed run.


This is also the phase to decide if there are trumps (also known as atout, which in French means, ""over everything"") in your game. Trumps are a suit that is decided either randomly (like in Biriba) or ""bet upon"" (like Belote) and is more powerful than the other 3.

, Maybe a player is very confident of his hand and wages his winning. Give him the opportunity to bet points in this, which he of course loses if he does not win. Avoid irrational bets which may frustrate the players. Also, you may choose to allow players to wage based on luck or skill. Poker betting, for example, is mainly based on luck, since normally you cannot see other people's hands. Euchre on the other hand, requires that you bet thinking about your hand and the visible trump in order to bet, thus you are betting based on skill.

, This is largely based on your gameplay style. One may win if he has gotten rid of all his cards, or lose if he has accumulated a lot of points. If the game is played with more than 2 players, you can also add a bonus for the first winner(s) and a penalty for the last one(s).

, Also decide if you have to get points, or lose points to win. For example in Jack, accumulating points is the goal, whereas in Rummy, points count as damages. Also, decide if the points are acquired by specific cards or ""tricks"". This is also the phase to decide the points required to win (if any). There are four ways of counting points:


Set points, which means in the game there is a grand total of points, so if one player or team has X points, then the opponent(s) points equal Total-X.
Set points with bets, which is exactly the same as the previous, but also counting any wages from the players.
Divided Set, which means that each player can have any amount of points from the total, but also that there are burnt or trashed points. Trashed points are points that can't be counted because of a condition, thus every player must count their points and the total could be less than the grand total.
Upwards Counting, which consists of counting the points of a player without a limit, like for example in Rummy. Theoretically, a player of such a game could lose from the first round.

, Many of the classic games' names originate from the ""Wild West"" bars and saloons where people spent their time playing games, or from the French royalty which did the same in their parties. Some are also way more recent than that, but the creators have given them like-sounding names for flavor.

The player dealing will deal out two cards and pass them to the table banker, usually a casino representative who is in charge of the chips. The first hand dealt is usually the Player hand and the second hand is usually the Banker hand.
Sometimes, when the shoe is shuffled, the first card turned over will reveal how many cards the dealer should ""burn"" (toss away) in between deals for each hand. So, if the first card over is the 2 of Hearts, the dealer will burn two cards between each hand until the shoe is reshuffled.;
, Basically, the card values are added together to result in a score for each hand between 0 and 9. Suit is ignored. Face cards are each worth 10, Aces are worth 1, and all cards 2-9 are worth their face value. When the cards are added together, the digits in the tens places are dropped, making the ones place digit the score. In other words, face cards are essentially worth zero.


Say the Player hand reads 5 and 7. Since the sum of the cards is 12, the value of the hand 2. It's impossible to ""bust"" or go over in Baccarat, like in Blackjack, though hits are guided by a particular set of rules.In the event of a tie, the hand is passed and the bets are returned and the hand is redealt.

, A third card will be drawn for the Player hand and the Banker hand under the following conditions:


If either hand reads 8 or 9, both hands must stand. This rule overrides any other guidelines for hits.
If the Player hand reads 5 or less, the Player takes a hit. The Player card will be hit first in the rotation.

, If the Player stands (because the hand reads 6 or higher), the Banker takes a hit on hands that read 5 or less. If the Player hits, it depends on the value of the Player's hit card and the Banker's score.


If the Player’s third card is 9, 10, face-card or Ace, the Banker draws when he has a 0-3, and stays with a 4-7.
If the Player’s third card is 8, the Banker draws when he has a 0-2, and stays with a 3-7.
If the Player’s third card is 6 or 7, the Banker draws when he has a 0-6, and stays with a 7.
If the Player’s third card is 4 or 5, the Banker draws when he has a 0-5, and stays with a 6-7.
If the Player’s third card is 2 or 3, the Banker draws when he has a 0-4, and stays with a 5-7.
At most casinos, the Banker at the table will call for extra cards according to these rules. Much like roulette, the only decision you've got to make in a game of Baccarat is whether or not you bet on the Banker or the Player, then the cards are controlled by the dealer and the table banker. It's good to know these rules, but not essential to play.

, Playing Baccarat is a lot like a super-sophisticated and classy version of betting on coin tosses. You're betting blind, essentially, deciding to put a sum of money on either the Banker hand or the Player hand before the cards have been dealt. It's part of what makes the game exciting, dramatic, and unpredictable. You can't really sway the cards with strategy, which makes the game popular among high-rollers.


Practically-speaking, the odds favor the house but only slightly in an 8-deck shoe: 1.06% on the banker bet, 1.24% on the player bet.

, Often, casinos will provide players with a scorecard to keep track of their wins on particular hands. Since the game exists over many hands, learning to develop a strategy of betting and alternate between a pattern and breaking your own pattern is a good way to win money in the long haul.


Mark whether or not you bet Banker or Player and place a check mark next to your correct calls. Watch for patterns to develop. Follow them. Feel the board and the way the game seems to be swinging and place your bets accordingly.
Vary the number of units you bet. Because the odds are almost, practically speaking, 50-50 of winning any particular hand, up the ante when you've been buying in cheap and losing. Start betting slow (a unit or two) and working your way up as the losses mount. You'll eventually make the right call and make some of that money back.

, Betting Baccarat is much more instinct than science. Traditional wisdom, especially in online Baccarat, suggests that you shouldn't break a run. In other words, if you're betting Player and the Player continues winning, don't start betting Banker. Stick with a strategy and bet consistently. If the pattern switches, switch. If you make a few hasty switches, try to stick it out. Learn to adapt to the flow of the game and stay in it for the long run.


Baccarat isn't typically a game that people only play for a few hands and move elsewhere. Baccarat is typically a game played by big betters with particularly high table minimums, who'll play for several hours, letting lots of money change hands. Often, the game is even roped off from the rest of the casino. Bring a full bank account and plan on investing enough time and money into the game to make it worthwhile.

, Traditionally, it's customary for the player dealing to always bet Banker and to continue dealing until the Banker loses. Even if you're not dealing, however, it's usually the safest bet to go with the house odds and bet for the banker. While there's no strategy to the card-play itself between the Banker hand and the Player hand, there's still a slight numbers advantage that can work in your favor.

, A lot of money can change hands very quickly in Baccarat. Decide on a set amount you're willing to play to win and get out while you're ahead. Like any game of chance, it's difficult to ride a successful streak for very long, so make your money and get away clean.


Again, often the table will enforce betting minimums and often those betting minimums are quite high for Baccarat. Check out the game and understand the specific house rules before you sit down and play your chips.

, In Baccarat, the science only goes so far. You can't read the hand, so feel free to play as superstitiously as you want, as loose as you want, and have fun. Like craps, the guy who wanders into the game for the first time and doesn't know what he's doing typically has the most fun and wins the most money. The seasoned vet grimly placing bets and over-thinking it is the one doing all the losing.

, Neatly stack the deck of cards on the table in front of you. Use your right thumb and forefinger to pick up approximately half the deck.Move it to the right, then pick up the left stack with your left hand in the same way.








, Arrange the two stacks so the long edge of the cards is facing you. On the right stack, place your right thumb along that edge, near the right-hand corner. Place your index finger lightly on top of the stack. Place your middle finger against the opposite long edge, with your other fingers resting next to it or on the table. Repeat these motions to grip the left stack.








, Move the two stacks nearer each other, so the short edges are nearly touching. Rotate the stacks slightly away from you, so the corners nearest you are nearly touching.

, Bend the closest, long edge of each stack upward with your thumbs, while leaving the far, long edge against the table. Simultaneously move your thumbs upward along the edge, releasing cards to snap back onto the table. The cards from each stack should overlap each other as they fall.









The cards will probably not alternate perfectly from one stack, then the next. A perfectly interlaced riffle shuffle is called an out shuffle or in shuffle.This is incredibly difficult to accomplish, and is typically only used by skilled card trick magicians.

, If you are having trouble getting the cards to overlap, try this method instead. Grip the outer, short edge of each stack with their pinky and ring fingers, and the inner, short edge with their thumb. Bend the inner side of the stacks upward with your thumb, using your index fingers to press the outer side down flat on the table. Release the cards gradually by moving your thumb upward and outward, so the cards snap back down onto the table in an overlapping pattern.









This bends the cards more severely, wearing them down faster and potentially making them easier to view during the shuffle.

, The simplest way to finish is to push the two overlapping stacks together into one. Alternatively, skip ahead to the bridge finish section to learn a fun, flashy ending.








, Riffle shuffling in your hands is a bit more difficult than using the table, and it's more likely that the people you play cards with won't know how to do it themselves. Once learned, you can quickly end with a flashy bridge finish for additional effect.


This method is not used in casinos, since other players can often see the cards during the shuffle.
Like any riffle shuffle, this does bend the cards, and can wear them out faster than other shuffles.

, Stack a deck of cards neatly in front of you. Separate them into two stacks, roughly the same size. Hold one stack in each hand, face side down.








, Follow this step for each stack. Place your middle and ring fingers at the short end of the stack, curling around with your fingertips on the bottom of the pile. You can place your pinky and index fingers wherever you like, depending on what feels stable to you. Here are a couple common options:


Use your pinky finger to curl around the cards next to your middle and ring fingers. Place the knuckle of your index finger on top of the pile.or Place your pinky finger and index finger on the long edges of the stack, keeping it stable from side to side., Move the stacks close together. Place your thumbs on the short edges next to each other, and bend each stack upward. Release the cards in a ""riffle"" by slowly moving your thumbs upward and outward, letting the bent cards snap back into a straight position, interlacing with the cards on the other stack.









You may use your index finger to help bend the cards, pushing downward near the middle or the finger-gripped edge of the card.
This step can take a fair amount of practice, so be prepared to pick up cards that get flung around the room.

, You can simply push the two interlaced stacks together to finish the shuffle. Alternatively, use a fancy sign off by continuing on to the bridge finish instructions.








, To perform a bridge finish, you'll need to start with a stack of cards that have just been riffle shuffled. The riffle shuffle leaves you with two stacks of cards, interwoven along one short edge. If you've riffle shuffled one corner together, rotate the stacks slightly so they are aligned in one, straight line.









The bridge finish is also called a ""waterfall"" or ""cascade"" finish. There is no standardized system of terms, so you might see other finishes referred to by the same names.

, Use your middle, ring, and pinky fingers to grip the outer, short edges of the riffled cards, curling them around onto the bottom surface. If you just performed the riffle shuffle in your hands, you can keep the same grip.


You may use your index fingers to help grip, or to stabilize the cards by placing them lightly along the edge., Position your thumbs on top of the center of the stack, directly over the edges that have been interwoven together. You'll be using these to press the top arch of the ""bridge,"" preventing the cards from flying apart upwards.

, Use your hands to push the two sides of the stack together, forcing them into a high arch. This shape is what gives it the name ""bridge finish.""








, Release your grip by letting your fingers fall into a flat position. Gently move your hands apart by a tiny amount to release the tension, causing the cards to fall down in a ""cascade"" or ""waterfall"" pattern.Keep your fingers together and flat so you can catch the cards.









Remember to keep your thumbs pressed on top of the arch the whole time.

Each player is dealt a pile 10 to 30 cards, depending on the number of players. Each player's pile of cards is called a stockpile. The point of Skip-Bo is to play every card in your stockpile in numerical order. The first person to play every card in their pile is the winner.Even though the cards are multi-colored in Skip-Bo, these colors are irrelevant. All you need to worry about is the number on the cards.;
, Aside from each player's stockpile, there are three other types of piles used for three different purposes. However, it is important to understand how each one works before you start playing the game.After all of the cards have been dealt, place the remaining cards in the middle of the players. This is called the draw pile. Each player will draw from this pile at the beginning of their turn, and use the cards to create building piles.
When play begins, players start getting rid of their cards by making building piles in the middle of the table. There are four building piles, and each one must start with either a 1 or a Skip-Bo card.
At the end of each turn, players discard a card into a discard pile. Each player can have up to four discard piles, and the cards in these piles should be facing up. The cards in the discard piles can be used in succeeding turns to add to the build piles.

, Throughout the game, the goal is to get rid of all of your cards as quickly as possible by putting them into building piles. The first person to play every card in his or her stockpile wins the game.You can strategize against other players by preventing them from getting rid of their cards more quickly than you get rid of yours. Since you can see what cards other players have in their discard piles, you can play cards that will block them from being able to play these cards.
You'll get rid of your cards faster if you play the cards from your stockpile before playing those in your discard pile.

, Keeping score while playing Skip-Bo is optional, but it can be a great way to extend the game to multiple rounds. To keep score, have each player count their remaining cards at the end of the game and multiply this number by 5. The winning player gets these points plus 25 for winning the game. The first player to reach 500 points wins.500 points is just a starting point recommended for score keeping, but you can go for a higher number if you want to play more rounds., After you have mastered the basic rules of Skip-Bo, you might consider playing on teams. This adds some extra strategy and cooperation. To play in teams, follow the same rules as normal Skip-Bo, but you can use your teammate’s discard piles to help you with your turn.Divide your total players evenly to play in teams. For example, if four people are playing, then you could play in teams of two.

, Since Skip-Bo involves so many different piles of cards, it's best to play at a large, round table. That way everyone has room for their stockpile and four discard piles, and there's room in the middle of the table for the draw pile and four building piles. Things can get pretty crowded if you try to play at a small table.

, Since the deck is so big, you may need to divide it into more than one stack to shuffle it properly. When it comes to dealing, deal cards based on how many players you have. If you have two to four players, each player gets 30 cards. If you have five or six players, each player gets 20 cards., Each player should place their pile of cards directly in front of them on the table, face down. These are the players' stockpiles., Put the extra cards face down in the middle of the table. This is the draw pile. Make sure that there is extra space next to the draw pile for the building piles. You won’t have anything to put into them yet, but you will build them as you play., Whoever is sitting to the left of the dealer is usually who goes first in Skip-Bo.However, if you prefer to have the youngest player go first, or choose another method of picking who will go first, then you can do that., Begin your first turn by flipping over the top card in your stockpile. Everyone will start their first turn in the same manner., Next, draw five cards from the draw pile. You will always need to have a hand of five cards at the beginning of your turn, so you may need to draw between one and five cards every turn., After you have revealed your stockpile card and you have five cards in your hand, then you can examine your cards to see if you can add to a build pile. Each build pile is the beginning of a sequence, and the pile is ""built"" when more cards are added in sequential order - a 2, a 3, a 4, and so on. You can fill in any gaps with Skip-Bo wild cards. Remember that the colors do not matter in Skip-Bo, and only pay attention to the numbers. On your first turn:If you have a 1 or a Skip-Bo wild card in your hand or at the top of your stockpile, then you can start a build pile.
If you don’t have a 1 or a Skip-Bo card, then discard one card to form your first discard pile. You can form up to four discard piles in subsequent turns.
If someone else went before you, then you can also add to their build pile.

, Play all five cards in your hand if you can. If you have any cards left, then discard one card to form a discard pile before ending your turn., In subsequent turns, players draw enough cards to add up to a hand of five cards. For example, if you play all five cards in one turn, then draw five the next turn; if you have three cards left after a turn, then draw two for your next turn.After the first turn, players may use cards in their discard piles to add to the building piles.
When a building pile reaches the number 12, scoop it up and set it aside to be added to the draw pile when it runs down. A new building pile may be started in its place with a 1 or a Skip-Bo card.

, Go around and around the table until a player runs out of cards in his or her stockpile. This player wins the game."

Learn basic strategy.,
Get so good at blackjack it's like breathing.,
Familiarize yourself with the concept of counting cards.",How to Count Cards1," First things first, you can't really be an effective card counter if you don't know the ins and outs of basic blackjack strategy. Sure, you could count the cards, but it wouldn't result in you winning anything. Try to walk before you run.


It's in your favor to practice in casinos, if you plan on counting cards at casinos. Unlike at your kitchen table, there are a ton of other factors going on that must be considered -- like hiding the fact that you're hustling everyone.
When you play blackjack with a well-practiced strategy, you get the house's advantage to relatively 0.All casino games are in favor of the house, so this 0 is pretty good!
;
, You should be a machine when it comes to this game, spitting out the best thing to do in split seconds. You shouldn't need a book open, you shouldn't need a second to think, and you should be able to do it with one eye closed and both arms tied behind your back.


Knowing this game like the back of your hand is the only way you'll make money. Counting cards gives you a one percent edge. If you're betting $100, that's $1 you make per hand. The only way this 1% will result in you banking millions is if you have it down to a legitimate art.

, General strategy for card counting uses the Hi-Lo strategy. High cards are given a specific value (-1) and low cards are given a specific value (+1). When added up, they total the running count. That's it. The simpler you can keep it, the less your brain will want to explode -- so think of this simplicity as a good thing.


Understand why card counting works. It works because high cards (tens) improve a player's chances of hitting a blackjack, which pays out at 3:2. They also increase the dealer's chances of going ""bust."" Low cards, on the other hand, are bad for the player (who wants a blackjack and to beat the house) but good for the dealer (they prevent them from busting on 16 or lower).

Understand how it works.,
Learn the values.,
Learn how to bet accordingly.,
Test yourself.,
Take in pairs.,
Get the true count.,
Practice with distractions.",How to Count Cards2," If the ratio of high cards to low cards is higher than normal (that is, there are lots of high cards still in the shoe), the player can make bigger bets to increase the amount he/she can win when the deck is favorable. They keep a number in their heads that tells them when to bet and how much to bet -- or not to bet at all!


A deck with a positive number is good. The higher the number, the more you want to bet. The higher the number, the more high cards are left to be played.


, To track the ratio of high cards to low cards (thus knowing whether the deck is in your favor or not), you'll need to assign the cards a value. Start at 0 and as each card comes up, add it to your tally.


Cards 2-6 have a value of +1.
Cards 7-9 have no value.
Cards worth 10 have a value of -1.
Aces also have a value of -1.


, Increase your bets when the count is running positive (that is, about +2 and above).The higher the count, the more you should bet, but keep in mind that if you range your bets too much, you might draw some heat from the casino.


Generally speaking, you want to increase your bet by a unit of 1 for each point that the tally goes up. If you do it any more drastically than that, those eyes in the skies will be on you like a hawk.


, Grab a complete deck (sans the jokers) and rifle through it, keeping track. You should end up at a very round 0 if you've counted the cards accurately. Aim to get through the deck in under 25 seconds. That way, even Dealer McSpeedy won't get by you.


Start timing yourself when you can get through the deck and end up at 0 every time. Even though the math is very simple, it's easy to get side tracked. Don't be surprised if you end up with a different number consistently in the beginning stages.
Take a card out and leave it face down. Run through the deck and get your tally -- what's the unturned card?

, If you look at a jack and a 4, your thought process should not be, ""-1 and +1 = 0."" It should simply be, ""0."" When you see a low card and a high card, they cancel each other out. Keeping this in mind will make it much easier as the cards fly by you at lightning speeds.


Counting cards is about remembering a tally. Counting cards well is about accuracy and speed. To be a good card counter, it has to be like riding a bike -- you can go on autopilot at the drop of a hat. Taking in pairs gives you a lot less to worry about, making it easier for you to be accurate.


, Long gone are the days when casinos work with just one deck (mostly, at least). It's a lot more common to run into a game that is working with 5 or 6 (in what's called the shoe). Because of this, your running count may not be the true count.


To find the true count, divide the running count by the number of decks waiting to be dealt. If your running count is +4 and there are 4 decks left, the true count is actually +1.

To know how many decks are left, you're gonna have to take a covert look at the discard tray. Do this between hands, when you have the extra bit of time.


If you are working with a single deck, you invert and multiply. Say you have 3/4 of a deck left and the count is +4. You would then multiply 4 x 4 to get 16 and divide it by 3 (a little over 5). Some people choose just to go with the running count in a single deck, but know that the true count is always a little bit different (higher, regardless).

, It's all well and good if you can count cards in the comfort of your own home, door locked, curtains drawn, and telephone off the hook. But when you do it at a casino? There will be a thousand and one distractions taking place at the same time. Doesn't matter how simple the math is -- if you get off by 1, you're shooting yourself in the foot.


Start by turning the TV on. Then add the radio. Throw in a dog and a few kids and you'll almost be at the level you'll be dealing with at any hopping casino. Not to mention you'll have several sets of eyes watching you at all times -- you've got to be accurate and low-key.

Consider learning other types of card counting.,
Know the statistics of each variety.,
Learn the concept of ""wonging,"" or back-counting.",How to Count Cards3," For the record, Hi-Lo is the most popular for a reason -- it yields good results and it's simple to master. However, there are a number of varieties.


In KO, the difference is that 7s are worth +1.
In Omega II, 4, 5, and 6 are worth +2. 10, J, Q, and K are worth -2 and Aces are worth 0.
In halves, 2 and 7 are worth +.5. 5 is worth +1.5. 9 is worth -.5.

, Statistical analysts have these numbers all figured out and it's not a simple, ""Does it work or not?"" There are a number of factors to take into account:


When it comes to betting correlation (BC), Halves has the highest correlation. This is used to predict betting situations.
Hi-Opt II and Omega II have the highest playing efficiency (PE). This determines decisions and deviations (when you change from basic strategy) in play.
Hi-Opt II has the highest insurance correlation (IC). This tells you when it's best to buy insurance (because Hi-Opt II has an additional Ace count).

As you can see, Hi-Lo is not mentioned. This is because it falls in the middle of the pack for every factor. Hi-Opt II has an additional Ace count and Halves is just tedious (adding further distraction) and Omega IIs playing efficiency doesn't match the betting correlation. Unless you're the best blackjack player this side of the Mississippi, stick to Hi-Lo., It is called ""wonging in"" when you stay away from a table until it's hot enough to warrant joining. When the table grows cold, you ""wong out."" It's typically done on bigger decks, otherwise you'd be getting up as soon as you sat down.


Lots of casinos have banned mid-shoe entry for this purpose. If you do consider doing this, know that it looks fishy to even untrained eyes. How else would you know when to swoop in for the kill if you weren't counting cards?

The suspicions you do avoid, however, are changing your bets. When you're wonging, you bet the same exorbitant amount every time.

Act like a tourist.,
Let your bet ride, if you need to increase the bet.,
Appear to be interested in other things besides the game.,
Tip the dealer.,
Know who's watching you.,
Do everything slow.",How to Count Cards4," Card counters are notorious for playing blackjack for hours and hours, often without eating or enjoying the amenities available at the resort. Acting like a tourist just looking for a simple good time may take the suspicion off of you.


You want to blend in. Busting out your three-piece Armani suit is not what you want to do when starting your card counting career at your local casino. Leave the Italian suede at home and act like a regular Joe.

, Dealers are trained to shuffle the deck upon an unexplainable increase in the bet. For this reason, only up your bet in small increments and at seemingly random points in the game.


This may seem counter to making money, but if you get thrown out, you'll be making zero. No, card counting isn't illegal, but it is heavily frowned upon and you can be asked to never return.


, This is why we had you practicing with the TV, radio, and several messy, loud-mouthed children. If you are so busy counting your lips are practically moving, it's a dead giveaway. Go ahead, get a drink, make small talk. Enjoy yourself.


Counters have a reputation for being ""zoned in"" to the game. He will remain fixated on their cards while everyone else is looking at a gorgeous woman. Don't be that guy.
You need to be proficient enough at counting that you can carry on a conversation. Chat with the dealer about how their day is going. If the pit boss comes up, chat with him, too.


, Many dealers know how to count cards. A dealer that likes you will be more likely to wait before shuffling on a favorable deck and shuffle sooner on a bad one.


A dealer can help you or hurt you. Motivate the dealer to be for you. Same goes for the entire pit crew -- get them on your side, your not-so-heinous crime may slide under their radar.

, At any time, there are hundreds of cameras going on in the casino in addition to the eyes of the dealers, those in the pit (behind the tables), and the security staff. If they'll catch a waitress for serving a customer every 18.37 minutes, they'll definitely have the attention span to monitor you. Because of this, it's very important to be on your best behavior.


If a casino suspects you're counting, they probably won't come right out and say it. They may have someone start a conversation with you to distract you, assign you a high-speed dealer, shuffle spontaneously or change the betting rules.If any of these happen, back down slowly, but immediately.

, When you hit a table, stay there for a spell. Why would you leave? And when you make your moves at this table, take a second to think about it. Normal blackjack players haven't spent the past three months staring at this exact set up in black and white. Everything you do needs to be nonchalant and casual.


Do not jump from table to table every time the deck sours. This will bring you to the attention of the casino personnel fast. Make minimum bets until the deck is richer. Increase casually because you're doing well -- not because you know what's about to come.

For now, deal the cards face down. When the game begins, each player will quickly flip the cards over and will look at his hand. The players should not look at each other's cards.


Speed is traditionally played between two opponents. Three- and four-way speed are popular, but require additional decks of cards.

, The piles on either edge should have five cards in them, and the inside two piles should have one card each.


The piles on the outer edges are the side piles, and will be the reserve piles that each player will use to replace the two inside piles if both players run out of moves.
The inside two piles are the active piles will be flipped over when the game begins. The players will then try to place appropriate cards from their hand of five cards onto this pile.

, This is the pile that players will draw from after their hand of 5 cards has less than 5 cards in it. As soon as they are able to play one of the cards in their hand, they can draw for more cards from this pile. Each player has to draw from his own draw pile.

, Each player can look at his hand of five cards to see if any of them can be placed on the middle cards in ascending or descending order. Note that each player should keep his hands hidden from the other player -- the open hand is displayed for your convenience.

, On each of the cards in the active pile, you can play a card of one higher or one lower value regardless of suit (you can place either a ten or an eight on a nine, a ten or a queen on a jack, and so on). You can place as many cards as you want to at a time, and you do not have to wait for the other player to place a card down before you.


The ace can be played as a high or a low card. It can be placed above the king or below the two. This makes it so that the game can be played in a loop.

, When you play a card, immediately draw another one from your draw pile. The only time this shouldn't happen is if a player runs out of cards in his draw pile; then, he should just try to play the remaining cards in his hand to win the game.

, This will create two fresh cards in the center that will hopefully allow them to place one of their cards on them in ascending order. Any time no moves can be made, this process should be repeated. If this keeps happening and there are no cards left in the side piles, then the players should shuffle the cards in the center piles and place them face-down as the new side piles. Then, they can each flip one card over from these piles and continue playing.

, to win the game. Some players don't think this is mandatory to win the game and that a player automatically wins if he runs out of cards. But this isn't nearly as much fun! Yelling ""Speed!"" makes for the perfect ending to this fast-paced game.


Typically, speed is played as a best-out-of-three game. The first player to win two games wins the set. But you can play for as many games as you like!

, This variation just adds one more rule to the game — not only can you place down cards of ascending or descending order, but you can also place the same card on top of another card of the same value. You can place your king on top of another king in the pile, your seven on top of another seven, and so on. This will make the game go by even faster because you'll have more options when it comes time to put down your cards.


Because this version makes the game slightly easier, it is also known as the ""children's version.""

, This can be a little tricky to pull off, but if you agree on this rule, it can raise the stakes of the game. With this variation, if you have a 3, 4, and 5, you can wait until you see a 2 or a 6 and then put down all three cards at once. You can surprise your opponent with a sneak attack that suddenly leaves you low on cards.

, If you use the two jokers in your deck to play the game, then these jokers can serve as ""wild cards."" If you've got one, you can place it down on top of the deck at any time and then place another one of your cards over it — since it's a wild card, you can put any other card down over it at all. After that, just continue the game as normal. Don't be too eager to pull the trigger on those jokers, though. Wait until you can't make any other moves to put down the card so you make the best use of it.


Typically, when you use jokers as wild cards, you make the draw piles have 16 instead of 15 cards each.
The joker has to be used when you have run out of moves with your other cards. You cannot draw from the draw pile if you still have a joker in your hand.
The joker cannot be the last card you play. It cannot ""top"" a deck.

, You can expand this exciting game to include more than just two players. If you want to have extra players, just create an extra pile of cards in the center. So, if you have three players, you should have three piles in the center for the players to place their cards on. You can still deal 5 cards to each player and distribute the rest of the cards evenly so each player has his own draw pile.


If you want to make things extra fun and exciting, then you can even use two decks instead of one when you're playing with four players. The extra cards will become part of the draw pile, allowing for even more combinations of play.

, Though some people refer to the game of ""Speed"" as ""Spit,"" this actually makes up a different, more complicated game with different rules. In this version of the game, the entire deck is split between two players, where each player has five stacks that each have one card face up, and 1-4 cards facedown. Each player has 11 cards face-down in a stockpile, and there are still two cards face up in the center of the game. The goal is for the player to shed all of the cards from his 5 stacks of cards, using cards in the stockpile when necessary.


The same rules -- placing cards over the cards in the center pile in ascending or descending order -- still apply, but the game is more complicated because each player can play the cards from the 5 stacks of cards instead of just playing the cards in his hand. If you really want to know how to play spit, see the instructions below for further clarification.

, Though people often confuse the game ""Speed"" for the game ""Spit,"" the latter is actually a more complicated version of the game, though the same principles do apply. The first thing you have to do is to split the deck in half so each player can begin to organize his piles.

, If you're familiar with Solitaire or Patience, then 5 of the piles will be set up in a similar fashion. You may only have 5 face up groups. Each player should set up the stock piles and spit piles like this:



The stock piles:

Stack 1 has 0 cards face down and 1 card face up
Stack 2 has 1 card face down and 1 card face up
Stack 3 has 2 cards face down and 1 card face up
Stack 4 has 3 cards face down and 1 card face up
Stack 5 has 4 cards face down and 1 card face up



The spit pile:

Stack 6 is each player's spit pile and can be placed out on the side. These are known as the player's spit cards.



, Each player should also say ""spit!"" as he or she does this. These cards will begin the spite pile, where each player will try to place cards of ascending or descending value from his or her stockpile.

, When they play one of the cards in the 5 stacks, they can then flip a card that is face down into the empty space to create a new active spit card. Think of these 5 stacks as being each player's ""hand"". In this game, unlike in Speed, the players don't have a hand to hold.

, When this happens, the players should draw a card from the stock piles and place them in the center of the pile at the same time to continue the game.

, If the other player sees this and hits the center pile of his choice first, he gets it. The idea is to take the smaller pile, if there is one, so the other player is stuck with more cards. The player who does not slap the spite pile in time takes the other pile. Whoever gets his hand on the pile first gets it.


If neither player can play and one of the players has no spit cards left, then the other player has to spit alone into only one spit pile. This player can choose either of the piles, but then he has to keep spitting into only that pile for the remainder of the round.

, Now, each player must take the remaining cards in his stockpile as well as the cards that he now owns from the spit piles and reshuffle them. The player should then place those cards into the set-up of 5 stock piles just as he did at the beginning of the game, using the remaining cards as his spit pile. One of the players may have more cards than the other. If one player doesn't have enough cards to create a spit pile after dealing all of the cards in the 5 stock piles, then there will only be one spit pile in the center of the game.

, To win the game, a player must get rid of all of the cards in his stockpile and spit cards. Once a player has no cards left at all, he has won the game. This game can take a lot longer to play and win than ""Speed,"" but the feeling of victory can be even sweeter!

,How to Play the Card Game 131,
"
Clarify the rules beforehand.,
Understand the cards you can play.,
Learn how to play the card combinations.,
Learn how to win instantly.",How to Play the Card Game 132," A lot of people play with slightly different rules in different geographical areas or cultures, and it's best to be clear about what you can and cannot do before the game begins to avoid confusion or frustration during the game. In this version, the rules are as follows:The strongest to weakest goes in this order: 2,A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3.
The strongest suit is hearts followed by diamonds, clubs, and spades, but this rule only works when playing the same card. For instance, a 2 of hearts beats a 2 of diamonds.
The 3 of spades is the lowest card in this game. The 2 of hearts is the highest. This also runs the works across all the suits. Twos are higher than threes.
The card is higher than the suit. For instance, the 9 of spades is higher than the 8 of hearts.
The object is to play a card that beats the previous card on the table until you get rid of all of your cards. So, a 5 of spades beats a 3 of spades. A king of clubs beats an 8 of hearts because even though the hearts suit is higher than the clubs, the king is higher than an 8.
This game is best played with four players as each player gets 13 cards, which evenly divides a standard deck. Note this is also how the game derives its name.
Some play with rules that would normally be considered cheating. So, depending on the rules, it is okay to look at other player’s card or play out of turn if you can get away with it. , You can play your hand a number of ways. Hands can be played in singles, doubles, triples and runs. A higher single card -- a solo card -- beats a lower single card. For instance, a queen of hearts beats a jack of hearts. A higher double -- two cards -- beats a lower double. A higher triple -- three cards -- beats a lower triple.

There also are runs -- a combination of at least three cards in sequential order. To beat a sequence the sequence must be higher than the previous sequence., The object of the game is to get rid of your hand as quickly as possible, and card combinations help you do that since you can put down more than one card at a time. A pair or double is a combination of two cards with the same number but different suits. For instance a 5 of spades and 5 of hearts are a pair. To defeat a double, the opposing player needs a pair of cards with a higher rank, for instance, a queen of hearts and queen of diamonds.








A triple is three cards cards with same rank and different suits. So, a 5 of Spades, a 5 of hearts and 5 of clubs is an examples of a triple. To beat this triple, the opposing player has to put out three cards of the same rank higher rank, for instance, 6 of spades, 6 of hearts and 6 of diamonds.
A run or sequence requires at least three cards in numerical order. ( The suits can be mixed.) It can only be beaten by another sequence where the rank of the highest card is ranked higher than the last card in the previous run. The lowest card a run can begin with is a 3 of spades For instance, a 4 of spades, 5 of hearts, 6 of diamonds and 7 of spades is beaten by a 4 of hearts, 5 of diamonds, 6 of hearts and 7 of hearts because a 7 of hearts is higher than a 7 of spades.

, In this game, certain hands win the game instantly. No trading is allowed.These cards must be in your hand after the initial deal: four 2s, six pairs ( 22,44,33,66,77,88), three triples, and a dragon’s head. A dragon’s head is special run from a 3 to an Ace of the same suit. The hearts dragon’s head is the highest because hearts is the highest suit and cannot be beaten by another.








Holding four 2s in your hand after the deal is an instant win because it is four of the highest cards in the game. Twos are the highest cards in each suit.
In some cases, four 2s is the only instant win that people play when they this game. In other cases, people agree that if someone receives four 2s during the deal, then the dealer re-shuffles and re-deals the cards.
If you are holding six pairs, this means that 12 of your 13 cards form pairs.

"
"
Determine which way the turns will be going -- clockwise or counterclockwise.,
Get a standard 52-card deck and shuffle them.,
Deal out 13 cards to each player.",How to Play the Card Game 133," Decide this ahead of time because it determines the way that you will be dealing the cards. Also, it will cut down on arguments over whose turn it is. So, when someone asks, “Whose turn is it?” you will know.








, Count the cards to make sure there are actually 52 cards. Shuffle anyway that you like. Generally, the rule of thumb is to use the riffle shuffle, but if you don’t know how to do it other shuffle techniques such as the Hindu shuffle, weave shuffle or strip shuffle are fine as well. Ask the person next to you to cut the deck.









Note the person who shuffles first because the person to the right or left --depending on if you choose clockwise or counterclockwise -- will shuffle next., Be sure to deal in the order that you have chosen. For instance, if turns are to be taken clockwise, then the cards should be dealt clockwise as well.The dealer gets his or her card last.









Players are allowed to look at their cards. They don’t have to wait until a certain time to flip the cards over as with some games.
If you are playing with three players instead of four, each player can still be dealt the standard 13 cards, or you can deal the entire deck. It’s up to your own discretion.
You might find it easier to organize your hand into pairs, triples and single cards.
If this isn’t the first game, then the winner of the previous game goes first.

"
"
Identify who has the 3 of spades.,
Place a higher card, pair or triple than the player before you.,
Skip if you cannot place a higher card on the table.,
Bomb the pile.,
Play whatever type of hand you want.,
Declare that you’re on your last card.",How to Play the Card Game 134," This person goes first and may play a single, double, triple other combo as long as the 3 of Spades is included. For example: 3-4-5, double 3s, etc., will work fine.The next person will try to beat the previous person's hand.









If this isn’t the first game, then the winner of the previous game goes first.

, Play the same type of card. For example, if the player before you places a pair on the table, you have to play a pair that has a higher value than that pair. If the person plays a single, then you must play a higher ranked single.







, The turn will go to the next person. Once you skip, you cannot play another card until the round finishes. If everyone skips, the last person who didn't play a card can play any card he or she wants.







, If you have three pairs, or something greater like four of a kind, now is the time to play them. (Remember you want to get rid of as many cards as possible.) A bomb refers to four of a kind. To get rid of your cards, you could play a set of six that forms a triple straight (e.g. 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5) or four of a kind. Four of a kind beats all triple straights, which is beaten by a higher ranking four of a kind sequence. So, four aces would beat by four kings.









When you play cards with such a high value that no one can beat, nearly everyone has to skip. Runs and straights cannot contain 2s even though they are the highest cards.

, If no one can beat the high cards that you are playing, then you can play the cards you want since no one can beat them even if they are not the highest cards -- or even a bomb. You could play a pair of the highest twos, for example.







, Once you have played all your cards except for your last one, you should declare your last card to the group. Remember that you can only play a single on top of another single. However, you also could end the game with a pair, triple or straight. No matter how many cards are in your hand, always try to get rid of them as quickly as possible. So, think in terms of pairs, triples the game may end on a double or straight card play. Try to be the first one out of cards, as this is how you win the game.

The game is played using a game board, 40 track cards, four large LOSE cards, two dice, four scoring pegs, and four playing pieces.
Players will roll the dice to move their playing pieces along the linear track on the game board. The track cards are played where you land, and each track card adds new instructions to each space and allows you to move forward or backward. Once played, track cards remain on the track and continue to be in play for that space.Points are earned and lost depending on which tracks you land on. SCORE spaces are worth one point each, but landing on the LOSE space will cause you to lose a point.

Your next action will depend on the type of space you land on, whether or not that space is already occupied by a playing piece, and whether or not that space already has a track card lying beside it.

, Generally, your turn does not end until you land on a second unoccupied track space with no track card next to it.Your turn will also end when you land on an unoccupied SCORE space or the LOSE space.
You can only place one track card on the board during your turn, but you will need to follow the instructions of previously placed track cards each time you land on an unoccupied space with one previously placed track card beside it.

, Each time you play a track card from your hand, you must take a new track card from the deck.


Wait until the end of your turn before taking a new track card.
If all of the cards are placed on the board before anyone wins, continue playing with only those currently placed on the board. When you land on an unoccupied track space under these conditions, your turn will end without any further action from you.

, If you roll a six on both dice during one turn, you automatically earn one point.


The scorekeeper must move your score peg one space forward on the score track.
Move your playing piece 12 spaces forward as instructed by the dice. Play the track square you land on as you usually would.

, There are times when you may fall into a loop based on the track cards played and the position of those cards. You will not remain caught in this trap indefinitely, though.


For example, you may land on a space with a ""Back 2"" card assigned to it, and that card may send you to a space with a ""Forward 2"" card assigned to it. Following those instructions precisely would cause you to remain trapped in between both spaces for the rest of your game, and your turn would never end.
When something like this happens, you will actually score one point. Make sure that the scorekeeper moves your peg forward one space on the scoring tray.
Leave your playing piece on the forward space of the trap and end your turn. At the start of your next turn, roll the dice as usual and move your playing piece forward according to the number of spaces indicated on the dice.

, The first player to score 12 points will win the game.


Usually, the game will end once one player wins.
If desired, though, you can continue to play until you have a second, third, and fourth place. Second place is assigned to the second person who reaches 12 points. Third place is assigned to the third person who reaches 12 points. Fourth place is assigned to the remaining player.

, If the space you land on during your turn does not have an opponent's playing piece on it, you will need to play a track card for that space.


If there is no track card next to that space, place one of the track cards in your hand next to the space. Follow the directions on the card during that same turn.
If there is already a track card next to that space, follow the instructions on that card during that same turn. Do not play a new track card.

, When you land on an ordinary track space that is currently occupied by an opponent's playing piece, you should roll the dice again.


Do not play either a new or old track card for this space.
Roll the dice again and move your piece the number of spaces indicated on the dice. Treat the new space you land on as the space you'll play. If you land on another occupied space, continue rolling and moving until you land on an unoccupied space.

, When your piece lands on one of the three SCORE spaces, you will earn one point.


The scorekeeper must move your score peg ahead by one point on the scoring tray after you earn this point.
If the SCORE space is currently occupied by an opponent's playing piece, you still earn a point, but you need to roll the dice again and move off this space.
If the SCORE space is currently unoccupied by any other playing pieces, you earn your point and your turn ends.

, When your playing piece lands on the one LOSE space, you will lose one point.


The scorekeeper should move your score peg back by one point on the scoring tray in response.
No one's score should drop below zero. If you do not have any points and you still land on the LOSE space, do not use negative points or apply the loss to future points. In this case (and only in this case), you should ignore the LOSE space.
After you land on the LOSE space, your turn ends. This is true even if an opponent's playing piece is already on the LOSE space.
Note that the LOSE space is the only space of the game board that can be occupied by more than one playing piece at a time.

, When playing a normal track card, you will need to move forward or backward based on the instructions written on the card itself.


Track cards will either say ""Forward"" or ""Backward"" on them. This indicates the direction your piece must move in. The direction will be followed by a number. That number indicates the number of spaces you need to move, regardless of which direction you're moving in.
Other possible track cards include ""Roll Again,"" ""Go to Nearest Score,"" and ""Go to Start."" Follow the indicated instructions when these cards are played.

, There are also two exchange cards in the deck. When you play or land on a space assigned to one of these cards, you can exchange it for any other card already on the board.


Note that you can only exchange cards already on the board. You cannot trade an exchange card for a card on someone's hand or a card from the deck.
After swapping the exchange card with the track card of your choosing, follow the instructions written on the card you just traded for.

, The large LOSE card you receive at the beginning of the game can be used against other players to slow them down.


You can play a LOSE card against an opposing player at any time during his or her turn. Playing the card stops the other player's turn immediately and forces him or her to move to the LOSE space on the board.
Upon moving to the LOSE space, the player must lose one point and pass the dice along to the next player.
You can only use a LOSE card once per game. After a LOSE card is used, it is completely removed from the game and no one else may use that same LOSE card.

Know what it is.,
At the beginning of the game, each player receives $6000 in cash.,
The player whose tile is in the topmost row (closest to row A) goes first.,
Then, starting with the first player, each player draws six tiles.,
Place tiles.,
When a player founds a chain, he receives one free share of stock in that chain.,Chains are deemed ""safe"" if they have 11 or more links; placing a tile that would cause such a chain to be acquired by a larger chain is also not permitted.,
After a player places a tile, and the results of that placement have been handled, he may purchase up to three shares of stock.,Finally, the player replaces the tile he played, ensuring that he has six tiles at the end of his turn.",How to Play Acquire," Acquire is a game for three to six players, though earlier editions included special rules for two players. Standard tournament games are played with four players.

The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains. When a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain, players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain. At the end of the game, all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money.;
,

Each player draws a tile and places it on the board.

,

If more than one player selects a tile in that row, then the player whose tile is in the leftmost column (closest to 1) goes first.
All players place these tiles on the board.

,

A turn consists of three steps:

1. placing a tile
2. buying stock
3. drawing a replacement tile



, Tile placement falls in one of four categories. The tile placed could be an orphan, adjacent to no other tile on the board. The tile could create a new chain of tiles, and the player who placed it on the board would have the opportunity to found a new chain. The tile could increase the length of an existing chain already on the board. Or the tile could link two chains, causing a merger of two or more chains. Since there are only seven hotel chains in the game, placing a tile that would create an eighth chain is not permitted., If, however, there are no shares left when the chain is founded, then the founding player does not receive the free share.,, A player may only purchase shares of stock in chains that have already been founded. The price of a share depends on the size of the chain, according to a chart that lists prices according to size. A player may purchase shares in one, two, or three existing chains (assuming at least three chains are currently in play), in any combination up to a total of three shares.,"

Consider the ages of the players.,
Think about the interests of the players.,
Decide how long you want to play.",How to Choose Board Games1," If you’re playing with very young children, they are likely unable to read, which limits the games you can play. Older children are likely able to play games that require reading and basic math. Teens will want something that is fun and complex enough to hold their attention. Either way, there are lots of options!


For young children, try Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, Hi Ho Cherry-O, Don’t Break the Ice, or a Memory game.
For older children, consider Checkers, Connect 4, Guess Who, Operation, Boggle, Twister, or Sorry!
For teens, consider Chess, Speak Out, Clue, Life, Trivial Pursuit, or Monopoly.;
, Some children may love to draw while others enjoy math. Considering what the kids like to do on their own time will help you choose a game that they are sure to enjoy.


For artistic children, consider Masterpiece, Pictionary, or Cranium.
If your players are good at math, Yahtzee, Battleship, and Mancala are good options.
For readers and writers, play Scattergories or Balderdash.
If your players enjoy sports, consider Tipp-Kick Cup, Pocket Rugby, or StratoFootball., There are some games that go on for hours, while others can be played in 20 to 30 minutes. If you have a limited amount of time, choose a short game or set a time limit on a longer game.


Quick games include Blokus; Hey, That’s My Fish!; and Red7.Games that take a bit longer include Scrabble Junior; Race to the Treasure; and Charades for Kids."

Figure out the best day and time to have your game night.,
Poll family members on what games they want to play.,
Decide on snacks.,
Choose a place to play.,
Consider other aspects of the game night that will require planning.",How to Have a Successful Family Game Night1," Before you start planning your family game night, decide on a day and time frame that works for everyone. Family game night should be attended by your whole family, so check with everyone in your household to find out when would work best for everyone.Make sure that your family members know that their presence is important to you and that family game night wouldn’t be the same if someone was missing.;
, Once you have nailed down a day and time that will work for everyone, figure out what games everyone wants to play. If everyone agrees on a game, that’s great! But if not, you may need to take a vote or select a game at random. Keep in mind that some games take less than an hour to play, so you may be able to play few different games and make everyone happy. Some popular choices for family game night include:Monopoly
Pictionary
Apples to Apples
Scrabble
Sorry
Candyland
Clue
Cranium
Jenga

, It’s a great idea to have some things to munch on during family game night. Ask your family members what snacks they would like to have around to munch on. Or, you might even want to eat dinner during your family game night. Choose something easy to eat while playing a game such as pizza or sandwiches.Try having everyone help prepare dinner or snacks to kick off the family game night.

, Make sure that you choose a good location to play your games on family game night. There should be enough room for everyone to sit and the location should work with the board game. For example, if you plan to play Monopoly, then sitting at the kitchen table might be the best way to go. But if you plan to play Pictionary, the living room might be a better setting., Do you plan to invite any family members who are no longer living in your house? Do you need to purchase a game? Think about any other things that you need to do to get ready for the game night."
"
Choose a type of game.,
Determine how many people will play.,
Pick a level of complexity.,
Consider your players’ personal preferences.,
Think about the time frame.",How to Choose Board Games2," You can pick economic and resource collection games, party games, bidding and auction games, trivia contests, card games, and cooperative games, among others. Typically, party games and cooperative games tend to be fast paced and don't require a lot of analytical thinking, while economic and auction games can be slower paced, as they require more critical thinking to perform well.

, You’ll want to be sure that everyone is able to play together, so pay attention to the number of players. Games with teams are often great for large groups.


Some games, like Takenoko, Lost Cities, YINSH, and Hive are better for smaller groups.Others, such as Been There Done That, Code Names, and Quiddler can be played with lots of friends., You may want something that’s easy and fun, or something that takes skill and strategy.


Consider Double Ditto, For Sale, and No Thanks! If you’re looking for fun games that don’t require a ton of strategy to win.Games such as Car Wars, Europa Universalis, and Magic Realm are more complex games that take time to learn and win., Think about the people you will be playing with, as well as what they like and what they are comfortable with.


If you have a more conservative group, stick with games such as Apples to Apples, Acquire, or Roots.
If your players don’t mind a game that’s more risque, try Cards Against Humanity, 5 Second Rule Uncensored, or Smart Ass., Some games, like Monopoly, can go on for hours. Consider how long you want to play before choosing a game. Alternatively, set a time limit and decide to call it quits when time is up.


Games that can be played quickly include: Incan Gold, For Sale, and Eight Minute Empire.Games that take a bit longer include: Through the Ages, Risk, and Diplomacy."

Create a tournament.,
Be a good sport.,
Offer prizes for the winners.",How to Choose Board Games3," If you have a large group, or a lot of time to play, organize a tournament. Draw straws to see who will play who, or let the group decide. Agree on rules before the tournament begins (e.g., decide if you will set a time limit and the person with the most points/assets at the end will win, or if you will play each game to completion before moving on).

, It’s easy to get competitive, but the goal is to enjoy yourselves. Remember to make fun the main factor, and don’t worry too much about winning or losing. Congratulate the winners of the game, and always accept congratulations graciously if you are the one to win.

, Pick up a few fun prizes, such as candy bars, bubbles, or Play-Doh for children. You could even get cheap scratch tickets or mini bottles of booze for an adult game night.


To stick with the theme, hand out dice, cards, or even a board game to the winners.

Determine if you need to make rule adjustments for young children.,
Be clear about the consequences of cheating.,
Ban cell phones and other electronics.",How to Have a Successful Family Game Night2," While some games are well-suited to young players, other games give adults an unfair advantage. For example, a young child may not stand a chance in a game of Scrabble against an adult because of the vast differences in their vocabularies. One thing that you can do to ensure that all players have a chance at winning is to make rule adjustments to suit the needs of younger players.Try teaming up younger players with an adult or older child player to help even the playing field. Or decide on an exception or rule adjustment for younger players, such as giving younger players a flat 20 points for each word played in Scrabble, regardless of size or complexity.

, Cheating can be a problem for some children because they really want to win the game. Make sure that you have some clear consequences for anyone caught cheating to help make it clear that it is not okay. For example, you might specify that anyone caught cheating has to do the dishes at the end of the night., Since the goal of a family game night is to spend quality time with your family and enjoy their company, it is a good idea to ban all electronic devices during game night. That means cell phones, TVs, tablets, or anything else that might distract players from the game should be shut off and out of sight.If you have trouble getting your family members to observe this rule, try setting a consequence. For example, you might say that anyone caught using a device during family game night has to wear a silly hat for the rest of the evening. If that doesn’t work, try a more serious consequence like losing a turn or getting a points deducted. Just make sure that you make the consequence clear before you start the game night.

Be a good sport.,
Enjoy the conversations.,
Make game nights a regular activity.",How to Have a Successful Family Game Night3," Model good sportsmanship for younger players by accepting defeat with grace, applauding your fellow players for clever moves, and offering to help other players if they are stumped. Showing that you value your time spent with your family members more than you value winning the game will set a good example for the rest of your family and take the focus away from winning the games., Family game night is a great time to engage in casual conversations with your family members. Playing a game helps to relax people and you may find your family opening up to you about things that they might not usually talk about. Make sure that you listen well and enjoy these little conversations throughout the evening., To get the most out of a family game night, it should be a repeat affair. Keeping game night on your schedule and encouraging your family members to do the same will demonstrate that you value this time with them. Over time, it may continue to be something that your whole family looks forward to as a time to bond and have fun!Try to hold your game night on the same day and time each week and prioritize it in your schedule.

Adhesive-backed ""photo corners"" are used in scrapbooking and photo albums to mount pictures to scrapbook or album pages. Putting two corners each on the bottom of Agricola Action Spaces allows cards to be kept in place and still easily removable for randomization or during the game when the cards need to be flipped.
, If you don't already own some photo corners, buy some: they are available at most brick-and-mortar craft stores and online., Holding the two photo corners in place, put the card onto one of the game board action space areas, to position the corners., Then you can remove, randomize, or flip over the card in that space easily while the photo corners stay securely on the game board.,, The ones used to store embroidery floss can be repurposed as Agricola game piece organizers.


For the original Agricola game pieces, a 17-compartment, 7"" x 10"" x 1.5"" plastic organizer works perfectly. The organizer used here is a Darice brand embroidery floss organizer, model number 10674, which is available from Walmart, Amazon, and similar outlets.

, The room/field tiles fit in the larger compartment, and the wooden components and cardboard markers (such as the ""1 food"" and ""4x"" markers) fit in the other 16 compartments.

, Trading card sheets or card display sheets can store the 3-, 4-, and 5-player Action Spaces and put in place simply by laying a cut-to-fit card sheet over the area of the game board where they are usually placed. Keeping them in their own cut sheet means that you don't have to keep them all in a single card stack, and that you can choose which page or set is needed when playing with that number of people, instead of having to separate the needed from the unneeded cards before each game., Card display sheets are regularly sold at game stores, and if you don't live near a game store, you can always buy them online. You only need three 3x3 card display ""pages"" for this Agricola modification.,, This will produce two 2-column x 3-row sheets, one for the 4-player and one for the 5-player cards.

If you keep a 1-row, 3-column cut-out from the 3x3 page used for the 3-player cards (the bottom row, for example, if the top two rows are used for the 2x2 ""square""), you can use this left-over card-sleeve row as a sorter e.g. for ""begging"" cards, scoring cards, and Major Improvements.

Collect the other materials needed.",How to Make a Hunger Games Board Game1," Each player will need to have a game piece that they will use to move around the board. You can use everyday household objects as game pieces (such as coins, beads, etc.) or to get really creative, you can make your own DIY board game pieces using pictures of characters from the Hunger Games.
, During the game, players will be receiving damage from attacks and receiving objects from the Cornucopia. Before the game starts, you'll want to make a chart to track both the damage and the Cornucopia objects:


Damage: Write the name of each player down, then write down all the potential damages each player could suffer (these are listed below). When a player is hit, indicate with a check mark where the damage occurred. Note that each successful attack only counts for 1 hit. It's essential to keep track of damage, as this will indicate when a player is dead and out of the game.

Cornucopia: Players will also be receiving different objects from the Cornucopia that will give them advantages during the game (these are also listed below). Each player can only receive 1 of each type of item from the Cornucopia, so it's important to track which player has which objects. Below each player's Damage tracker, write down the name of each object in the Cornucopia. When a player receives an object, put a check mark beside the object's name.

, To play the game, you will also need a 6-sided dice. To create the game, you will need paper, pencils, and markers/pencil crayons to color the map."

Use cheating websites to look up words.,
Download cheating applications.,
Use the Terminal on OS X.,
Use Wolfram Alpha's ""Scrabble"" query feature.",How to Cheat at Words with Friends1," There are several websites that can output all the possible words that can be made with the letters in your hand. You can search for websites specifically meant for Words with Friends. This will often tell you which word will score the highest out of the ones possible. You can also use tools meant for Scrabble or solving anagrams.


These websites are each formatted slightly differently, but most ask you to enter in the tiles from your current game, and then click ""enter"" to calculate the potential words you can use.;
, Programs are available for most platforms that can tell you where to place letters on the board to maximize your score. These applications work similarly to the cheating websites, but are more convenient so that you can access them directly from your phone in the middle of a game.


Some apps allow you to take screenshots of your board so that you don't have to manually enter the tiles in yourself. Others can be programmed to automatically play words for you without you having to do anything.
Examples of such apps include: Free Cheats With Words, Words with free EZ Cheat, and Cheat Master 5000.
Be very cautious when downloading new programs. If you're going through your operating system's ""app store,"" check the reviews in case the program has unwanted features. When downloading directly from a website, make sure that it is reputable and that your anti-virus software is up-to-date. Avoid giving any applications administrator permissions on your computer or access to personal data on your phone.

, If your computer is a Mac, there is actually a built-in application that can be used to cheat at Words with Friends. Only use this method if you are familiar with using the Terminal application.


To search for a word beginning with a specific sequence of letters, type the following into the command line (using the letter sequence ""erg"" as an example and ""yourtiles"" for the ones in your hand): grep –x ""^erg*"" /usr/share/dict/words
Likewise, you can also search for a word ending with a few particular letters: grep –x ""*erg"" /usr/share/dict/words, Simply type ""scrabble YOURTILES"" into the text box without quotes and press the ""="" button. This will return a list of possible words in order from highest score to lowest. While these scores are for Scrabble, they correlate well with Words with Friends.Using Wolfram Alpha has the advantage of being quick and free from advertisements and possible malware.

Learn the pros and cons of cheating.,
Know the game you're playing.,
Recognize the people you're playing with.,
Discreetly cheat.,
Go easy on other players.,
Cheat sparingly.",How to Cheat In a Game," In order to cheat, you need to know the benefits and disadvantages. Look at the following for some advantages and disadvantages, and decide whether or not you should cheat or should not.


Some Pros include:

Showing the other players that you're good at the game
Getting back at another person for cheating
Winning the game and being able to brag about it


Some Cons are:

Other players not trusting you
Not having the feeling of really winning the game
Getting kicked out of the game for cheating

;
, Become good at the game and learn how to play the game well. Find the tricks of the game and see where you can cheat. For example, you don't want to do an obvious cheat that people will point out immediately, but you do want to do a cheat where nobody will recognize it and you can get away with it easily. Find a spot in the game where you can cheat and where it seems appropriate to do.

, Will they get really mad at you and never play again if they find out, or are they pretty easy-going and will accept a simple apology? Try to find out what they will be like and see if they will be able to take your cheating.

, When nobody's looking or they aren't paying attention, do something small, like in ""SORRY"", do an extra space, or in ""BS"" put down an extra card. Be careful to make sure no one notices.


If someone notices that you're cheating, say something like, ""Oh, sorry about that. My mistake."" Cover up yourself quickly but confidently. Look at ""How to Think of Quick Witted Comebacks"" for more information.
Poker face. It's all about body language. Don't be obvious, but avoid being too discreet.

, You are cheating, so if they cheat, don't say anything to make it fair. Don't point out any mistakes that they made, and just have fun with the game.

, Don't cheat too often or people will not want to play with you. Once in a while, cheating can be okay, because everyone does it at some point, but you don't want to have the reputation of a cheating cheater.

Pick your paper.,
Draw the pathways.,
Draw bridges and spaces.,
Add the Cornucopia.,
Label some spaces.,
Draw the terrain on the map.",How to Make a Hunger Games Board Game2," Any size paper will work, but it's recommended to use a large piece of paper (ie. 11x17"" or larger) in order to avoid a cramped playing area., Using a pencil, draw a pathway that goes from the edges of your map and spirals around into the center. Because the point of the game isn't to reach the end of the pathway, make your pathway circular so that there is no start or end and players can continue moving around as much as possible., To make things more complex, you can draw ""bridges"" that link together different parts of your pathway and create many different ways to get to the same place. From there, divide your pathway up into individual spaces of about 1 inch that each player will land on during their turn., In the center of your map, draw the Cornucopia. It plays an important role in the game, so make it fairly large so that it really stands out on the map and is easily visible for all the players., You can now add labels to certain spaces if you'd like. Because there is no specific ""Start"" and ""End"" points, you can label a few different spaces around the board as ""Start"" points, where players will begin the game. To keep things fair, ensure that your ""Start"" points are all equal distances away from other ""Start"" points as well as the Cornucopia. From there you can get creative and label other spaces with anything you'd like, for example ""Invisible"" (where you're safe from attack), ""Miss a Turn"", ""Roll Again"", etc., Once you're finished labeling your pathway and spaces, you can then get really creative and draw the terrain around the pathway. The way your map looks is up to you, but suggestions of terrain you could include are:

Desert
Forest
Ocean/islands
Tropical rainforest
Swamps
Abandoned city
Mountains

Understand the basic premise of the game.,
Figure out how players will move.,
Know when you're able to attack.,
Keep track of the damage each player gets.,
Understand the role of the Cornucopia.,
Write down the above rules.",How to Make a Hunger Games Board Game3," The goal of the game is to be the last player alive. Players roll the dice to move around the board, trying to get close enough to other players in order to attack them; run away from other players who are trying to attack them; and reach the Cornucopia, which has items to help protect themselves and to make their attacks deadlier. There is no end space, so players continue moving around the board until only one player is alive. That player is crowned the winner of the Hunger Games., Players begin at any of the ""Start"" spaces. To move, players roll one dice and move the number of spaces indicated by the dice., Once a player rolls, if they're within 3 spaces of another player, they can launch an attack against them. However, the attacks aren't always successful. To attack, roll one of the dice - if the number rolled is higher than 3, you hit. If you hit, roll the dice again to indicate the damage. The damage chart is as follows:

1: Hand
2: Foot
2: Arm
3: Leg
4: Shoulder
5: Chest
6: Heart

, At the beginning of the game, nominate one player as the Director. This person will keep track of damage as well as Cornucopia items on the tracking sheets as explained above, and let players know when they have been hit enough times to die. Note that some damages are more severe than others, so players need to be hit in that place a different amount of times before they die:

1: Hand/Foot - 4 hits = death
2: Leg - 4 hits = death
3: Arm - 4 hits = death
4: Shoulder - 3 hits = death
5: Chest - 2 hits = death
6: Heart - 1 hit = death

, While players are moving around the board, they're trying to get to the Cornucopia, as as it gives you items to help you in the game. When you get to Cornucopia, roll the dice to indicate what item you'll collect. The Director will then check this item off on your Cornucopia tracking sheet. Note that you can only get each item from the Cornucopia once, so if you roll a 1 for example, and you already have the item corresponding to it, you get nothing. None of the items from the Cornucopia expire, so they can be used multiple times throughout the game. Items in the Cornucopia are:

1: Armor - gives you the ability to block any heart and chest hits. If your opponent rolls a 5 (Chest) or a 6 (Heart), no damage will be counted against you.
2: Medical Kit - gives you the ability to lessen the severity of any damage against you by -1. For example, if your opponent attacks you and rolls a 5 for damage (Chest), armor lessens this severity by -1, so the damage is actually a 4 (Shoulder).
3: Food & Water - gives you ability to move 1 extra space after each roll.
4: Gun - gives you the ability to increase the severity of any damage against your opponent by +1. For example, if you attack your opponent and roll a 5 for damage (Chest), arrows increase this severity by +1, so the damage is actually a 6 (Heart).
5: Arrows - gives you the ability to make 2 hits per attack. For example, if you roll a 3 (Arm), your opponent will get hit 2 times in the arm rather than once.
6: Sword - gives you the ability to counterattack. If you have a sword, you can attack your opponent immediately after they attack you.

Use a ""brute force"" method of checking random combinations of letters.,
Check a dictionary or thesaurus.,
Look up acceptable two-letter words.",How to Cheat at Words with Friends2," While this usually won't win you any games, it can help you out if you're stuck and give you some better tiles to work with. It is arguable whether or not this method is considered cheating. People who do assert that you should know any word you play. Others consider it a legitimate strategy in normal gameplay.Find an open area of your game board that you can potentially build a word on. Try adding one to three of your tiles in different combinations next to or around a letter you can incorporate. Click the ""Play"" button when you think you may have a word. If you don't, the game will simply tell you to try again without the other player knowing. For more points, focus on letters that would make a word overlapping one or more bonus tiles.
Open up a word browser or another program with a spellchecker. Try typing different combinations of your tiles in various orders until either the program doesn't underline them (meaning that it is a viable word for you to use) or suggests a corrected spelling of a word that fits the game board.

, If you choose to use a physical book, this is the ultimate low-tech method. Browse words that begin with a letter on the board followed by one or two that you have in your hand. While some don't consider this cheating, others contend that using an outside reference goes against the spirit of the game.


Leafing through a thesaurus is much more efficient than using a dictionary. This is because thesaurus entries are generally much shorter than those in a dictionary, fitting many more words in a page. Run a finger or piece of paper down the page to quickly scan for an appropriate word.

, There are dozens of very short, obscure words that are recognized by the dictionary that Words uses. Many users have compiled lists of these online for free use. This tack can be a lifesaver when you're stuck with a bunch of difficult letters and no idea what to do with them.


Some common examples that seasoned Words players should know: qi, xu, gi, xi, zo, and oi."
"
Develop an extensive vocabulary.,
Focus building on bonus tiles.,
Block your opponent from using bonus tiles.,
Pluralize high-scoring words on the board.",How to Cheat at Words with Friends3," The best tool you can have when playing Words with Friends is your own knowledge of different words. You can expand this through a few different routes.


Play the game more often. While you may need to cheat now, over time you will likely rely on these methods less. As long as you are paying attention to the game (rather than using automated cheating software), you will start to memorize words you may use in the future.
Use vocabulary-building tools and software. There are many tools available online designed to help students of all ages actively broaden their vocabularies.
Read more. Studies have shown that the best way to improve your vocabulary is through reading. Every time you come across a word you don't know, look up its meaning. Soon, you will pick up words you can use to play Words with Friends without even noticing., Bonus tiles are the colored blocks labeled DL (doubles the value of the tile), TL (triples the value of the tile), DW (doubles the value of the entire word), and TW (triples the value of the word).Putting your words down on these spaces often makes or breaks the game for a player.


Remember that the effects of these tiles stack, so try getting multiple tiles with one word. For example, the word ""TAG"" would normally be worth only 5 points. However, if you managed to play this word with the three-point G over a TL and another letter over a TW, you would end up scoring a respectable 33 points instead.

, As previously mentioned, bonus points are crucial for a high score. If you can't come up with a word to reach the nearest bonus tile, put down a word that can't be added to that runs up right next to it. This will prevent your opponent from snagging those extra points during his or her turn. Additionally, try to avoid playing words that can be built off of onto bonus tiles., This is a great strategy if you can't think of a word but happen to have an S tile in hand. You will both net a ton of points and give your opponent less to work with during his or her turn. Without much to build off of, your opponent may need to pass on his or her turn."

Think about the benefits of becoming evil; do the pros outweigh the cons?,
Take into consideration your class.,
Decide just how 'mean' you want to be.,
How evil can you ""be"" in the campaign?,
How chaotic is your character?,
How chaotic can you ""be"" in the campaign?,
Finally, look up stories of Dungeons and Dragons adventures that had successful evil or chaotic players.",How to Be Chaotic Evil in Dungeons and Dragons,"


PRO: you don't have to buddy up with any alignment, killing evil enemies is as natural as killing neutral or good enemies; the same goes for law/chaos.
PRO: it's just cool to be this feared badass who takes no bunkum and backhands the occasional passerby.
PRO: you have no qualms with being selfish or dastardly, it is definitely in character for you to do what evil you can get away with.
CON: rewards for ""evil"" actions as opposed to ""good"" action are usually artificially low. The solution to this is to try to milk what you can out of the NPC by using your wits (after all, a GOOD person wouldn't grab someone by the neck and have them open the family coffers...)
CON: clerics will have harmful rather than healing spells, you won't have to use ""protection from good/law"" that often, and there might be odd circumstances surrounding you fighting the forces of evil rather than joining them for better pay.
CON: you will have a tough time making friends, most evil NPCs are already part of little ""clubs"" that are exclusive of players and those working for good.;
, A lot of it depends on the class you play:


The chaotic evil wizard could be diabolical or downright sadistic while realizing that he is among kindred spirits in the party.
The chaotic evil cleric can be an agent of the evil god that opposes the enemy, while still supporting the party's actions.
The chaotic evil fighter will feel right at home, his intimidation tactics and martial might synchronize well with a dark agenda or the pursuit of riches.
The chaotic evil thief won't care about the job, only that they get it done quickly and quietly with as much compensation as possible.

, How evil is your character? Is he just incapable of compassion or does he find 20 gold pieces a good cause to murder his fellow man?


NO MORALS: The lowest (highest?) form of evil, the only real evil thing about you is that you don't feel compassion or sanctity for life, and would consider almost any number of people below yourself. However, be careful about how much you juice this up. Nobody will want to play with you if you try to kill your party every chance you get.
RUTHLESS: You care little at all for others wants and needs and would hire a mercenary only to slit his throat when he dares to ask for a cut of the loot from a dungeon.
DISPARATE: Your willingness to slaughter is unbelievable and your brutality is a sight to behold, this has the most punch so to speak of all the degrees of evil as it isn't common for players to be the monster in the game.

, If you find your DM or fellow players deliberately countering your evil actions with slapstick or goofy behavior then you might not have much luck being CE.


Scaling up your evil actions may show the DM and other players that you are serious.
Don't be afraid to bring this to the DM if it is really cutting in to your enjoyment, Chaotic Evil doesn't always work in a campaign and it is best to try another alignment when evil doesn't work well.

, Is he like a barbarian, simply accustomed to the unstructured life; or is he a chaotic marauder, championing the downfall of law and only recognizing ""authority"" as a challenge to his power?


LOW CHAOTIC: the law chafes you and you don't follow it if there aren't any repercussions you would care about.
MEDIUM CHAOTIC: disrespect for ""authority"" and ""law"" is common, your word will only go as far as you let it go.
HIGH CHAOTIC: personal power is very important. This often makes you downright capricious, your battle-axe has the final say and you know it.

, Again, if your DM/fellows are trying to trip you up with railroading or other herding tools then it might not be worth playing the character.


Try to make your chaotic decisions matter or be irreversible, that should prove that you aren't doing it as a joke.

, Examine what made the characters ""special"" and how they affected the world around them. This will give you vital insight on how to play a Chaotic Evil Character.

Keep your social abilities sharp.",How to Be Sneaky," Sneaking isn't just about moving quietly and not being seen. Equally important are the ""social"" sneaking skills - skills that will help you get what you want out of people and help you get out of trouble if you're caught sneaking around. Chief among these skills is your ability to tell quick, convincing lies. You need to be able to provide a logical, benign explanation for your behavior at all times.


One way to become a good liar is to take an acting class or to sign up for a theater production. Actors are, in a sense, professional liars - good actors use their faces, voices, and bodies to weave a convincing story.;
, A simple poker face can get you surprisingly far! When you're sneaky, it's essential that you appear serious about whatever lie you're crafting, even if it's a wild one! ""Sell"" your lies - your voice, face, and body should all support the idea that what you're saying is the truth. This doesn't mean merely keeping a stern expression at all times - to support your lie, it might be necessary to practice appearing jubilant, sad, preoccupied, and as many other emotions if you can!


There's a reason it's called a ""poker face"" - to help develop stone-cold control over your facial expression, get together with friends to play a little Texas Hold'Em or another poker variation, most of which encourage players to hide their emotions.

, When sneaking, you're bound to get eventually caught - how you handle this situation can make the difference between whether you can keep sneaking or whether you're laughed out of the house. Make up an excuse for why you're sneaking beforehand - one that's logical for the place you're sneaking in. For example, if you're caught sneaking around upstairs while there's a party going on downstairs, say you're looking for the bathroom.


If you're sneaking around people who don't know you, you can pre-plan your excuse to the extent of having a fake name and/or backstory. Support your story with your choice of wardrobe and demeanor - if you're pretending to be a religious missionary, for instance, you might want to wear clean slacks, a white button-down shirt, and a tie (if you're male) and to carry religious literature with you.

, Naturally likable people have an easier time getting what they want - if you're extra-charming, you'll have the option of talking your way past people you'd otherwise have to slip by unseen. Keep a friendly, interested demeanor. Look at people in the eyes. Joke with them - about the drudgery of your jobs, if you're looking to build a quick rapport. Pretend to support their opinions. Make them like you - remember, you won't have to be their friend after you've snuck your way past them, so use every opportunity at your disposal.


Don't be afraid to flirt! If you think you've got this person's ""attention,"" seize the opportunity! A few choice words from an attractive female can, for instance, convince a bouncer to open the doors to an already-crowded nightclub.

, People are shallow - sadly, often, people will make a judgment about you based on how you look. When you're sneaky, use this to your advantage! You might want to dress in starched slacks and a polo to appear as clean-cut and non-threatening as possible so people will overlook you. Conversely, you might want to shave your head, wear a nose ring and a dirty leather jacket if you want to look intimidating. Use common sense - ask yourself, ""what sort of person will have the best shot of getting past obstacles in this situation?""


If you're really brave, you can even create a disguise and pretend to be someone you're not - keep in mind that impersonating a police officer, etc. is a serious crime!

, When you want to reveal the fruits of your sneakiness to someone, make sure they don't see it coming for maximum impact. Make your behavior and environment appear as normal as possible until the last second. For instance, if you're planning a surprise birthday party at someone's house, keep the house exactly as it was before, except for the room where the guests are hiding. As you lure the birthday boy to the designated room, use the poker face you've practiced to appear as nonchalant as possible.


In the example scenario, be sure to keep up your façade until after he's been surprised! If you give into giggles even a few seconds too soon, you could give the surprise away.

, A truly stealthy individual is aware of his or her surroundings. S/he listens and looks for obstacles, whether they're animate ( for instance, a person or dog) or inanimate (for instance, a chain-link fence.) When you're sneaky, keep your eyes peeled and your ears listening!


If you have a chance, study the location you're going to sneak around in and the people you'll encounter. Take notes. Even consider sketching simple maps - these will help you plan a strategy for sneaking around this place and getting around these people.
Look for patterns in peoples' behavior. For example, if you see that your friend gets home from work at 6 PM every day, you'll know to have your prank set up before then.

, You can learn information you're not meant to learn if you look for opportunities to ""overhear"" private conversations. If you're at a friend's place with a couple of buddies, and you think your friends are planning a prank on you, quietly sneak up to the door when they're talking in another room, then listen at the keyhole or silently hold a cup to the door to listen in.


If someone's talking on a phone on a land line, try picking up another phone on the same line to overhear easily their conversation from another part of the house. Just be sure to do it very, very quietly - don't breathe into the receiver.

, The most essential aspect of sneaking is not to be seen doing something bad! Whether you're stealing fries from a friend's lunch or sneaking out past curfew, you'll want not to be seen. Always keep something between you and other people who might see you. If you need to, crouch or contort yourself to conceal yourself behind counters, trees, skinny pieces of wall, or any other environmental features you can use to block other peoples' lines of sight.


Avoid large, open areas. You can't see in every direction at once, so in these areas it's hard to keep track of other people and, thus, easier to get spotted. Stay near walls when possible - you know you can't be seen through the wall, so you can focus your attention on the angles from which you're more likely to be spotted.
If you can, learn a building's floor plan before hand. Even a basic understanding of where most of the rooms, windows, and doors are located can help you make good choices about which areas to avoid and where to hide if the need arises.

, People can hear you even if they can't see you, so one of your first concerns while sneaking around the house should be to make as little noise as possible. Use as many of the following techniques as possible to dampen your audio profile and decrease the chances people will hear you coming from miles away!


Walk with delicate steps. Keep your knees slightly bent as you shift your weight slowly from one foot to the next. Use a gentle heel-toe step.
Wear quiet clothing. Don't wear clothes that make noise when they're ruffled or when you move in them. Soft fabrics are best - sweatpants and many types of athletic wear work well.
Wear soft footwear. If you must use shoes, wear a pair with soft soles that won't squeak on wet surfaces. Slippers are better. Bare socks are better still!
Don't touch noisy surfaces. Most carpets are quieter than hardwood floors, which can squeak and amplify the sound of your footsteps. Also, avoid bumping into any glass or metal or stepping on twigs if you're outdoors.
If possible, make significant movements only when there's another noise to cover it up (for instance, when an airplane flies overhead).

, If you're going to be sneaky somewhere where there are already dozens of people, you're bound to be seen and heard. Instead of avoiding detection, you should instead focus on creating no memorable impression on the people who see you. Dress and act inconspicuously for the situation. Appear friendly and open, but don't talk to anyone you don't have to - the fewer people who remember you, the better.


When trying to avoid conversation, try to look like you have something to do. Walk with purpose - like you're on your way to something important and can't be bothered to talk.

, When being sneaky, you'll often need to grab or snatch something from someone without being noticed. Good sleight of hand practitioners have steady, nimble, silent hands. Practice simple magic tricks to improve basic techniques such as palming which will help you steal away with your new prize.

, Learn to create distractions to divert the attention of people it would otherwise be difficult or impossible to sneak by. If you're trying to sneak out of your house after your curfew and your dad's watching TV in the living room with a great view of your only exit, you should devise a reason to make him leave his post! For instance, knock over a shovel in his workshop, making as much noise as possible. Quickly run to a hiding spot (hopefully one you scouted out beforehand), and then wait for him to investigate the noise. When he does, quickly slip out the door!


Pickpockets use misdirection to steal wallets - you can use the same principle to sneakily mess with your friends! Keep your friend's attention focused on one thing - a funny video or a card trick, for example - while you stretch one hand out of their line of sight to snatch what you want.

, Expert sneakers can benefit from a good workout - a good physical condition can make a huge difference when trying to lift yourself over a fence and out of sight. Similarly, a flexible body can squeeze into tiny hiding places much more easily than an ungainly, inflexible one. There's even a benefit in improving your cardio stamina - if you're caught and you need to dash, that is!


If you haven't already, start a well-balanced exercise routine to start on the path to personal fitness.

, When you're just beginning, try to be sneaky in a small, barely-noticeable way. If you're in a small space, for instance, if you're riding in a car, you can concentrate on improving your sneakiness without having to take your surroundings into account.


Try this sneaking exercise: While sitting in the passenger seat, see if there are any coins in the cup holder. Slowly but surely, (over the course of the car ride) take the coins out one at a time. Be sure the driver is not watching you, and try not to make any noise. Later, try to place all the coins back in the cup holder. This exercise will improve your hand steadiness, your ability to move silently, and your ability to read the body language of people you're sneaking on!

, When you're confident being sneaky in small, controlled environments, it's time to practice sneaking in larger, more active environments. Every additional person in your surroundings is a variable you'll have to account for - being able to account for other peoples' position and line of vision even when you aren't looking at them using clues like the sound of footsteps, etc. is a vital sneaking skill.


Try this exercise: at a social event, watch someone who has a drink out of the corner of your eye. Wait until their back is turned, and then move the drink to another room. After you have moved the drink, go back and watch them as they try to remember where they put it. Make sure you keep a straight face - don't give away that you had something to do with it. This exercise improves your ability to keep inconspicuous in crowded areas as well as your ability to control your emotions in the face of someone you've duped.
For a good test of your ability to move silently, stay awake late at night and try to move around the house silently when everyone's asleep - pick a point in your house to sneak to, then sneak back to your room, going through as many rooms as possible. In the stillness of the night, you'll be able to hear even smallest movements.

, You want to be able to craft lies, excuses, and personal information on the fly to talk your way past troublesome folks who might interfere with your sneaking mission. Practice your ability to lie and charm people - often, it's just as important as your ability to move without being seen or heard.


Some people have a visceral negative reaction when they tell a lie that is detectable by others. To start getting over this, begin by telling inconsequential, harmless lies. When someone asks for the time, tell them it's one minute later than it is. You'll eventually work through your reluctance and, if you gradually scale up your lies, soon you'll be able to tell convincingly ""real,"" consequential lies.
If you're not socially squeamish, try talking your way into a members-only gym or country club as a good test of your social sneaking abilities. Craft a good excuse beforehand - maybe you left your wallet in the locker room, or maybe your friends are inside waiting for you but they can't let you in because they're in the pool away from their phones!

Question anyone who looks suspicious.",How to Be a Teenage Detective,";
, Being a detective requires you to disguise, spy, dust for fingerprints, ask questions, and do research. Does someone or something seem as if they have something to hide? To get to the bottom of it, first take a notebook and write down what the case is about, your suspects/suspicions, and a checklist of what you must do to solve the mystery.

,, That might give a hint or two without you even knowing it! Even if you don't learn anything new, you will be able to cross off any suspicion, or add suspicion there. If you are stuck, try researching on the internet about everything you learned. You might learn something that you haven't learned from your case like myths or secrets leading to secrets. If you are positive of your suspicions and you have seen something that defines your answers, grab a friend or two for back-up, and a cell phone in case your suspect tries to harm you, and reveal your evidence. If you witnessed something but don't have evidence at hand, all your work goes down the drain, so always have a video tape or an audio recorder on you to record your findings. Lastly, you do not actually want to confront the suspect. This can be very dangerous. If you are positive that you know who it is, tell an adult or a police officer.

Notebooks (Sometimes a notebook is just what you need when you're hiding behind a bush, trying to remember what the person being spied on is saying)
Tape recorder (It may be a better choice than the notebook if you have one lying around, as it will be much easier to record conversations.)
Binoculars (Always good when the action is happening far away)
Walkie-Talkies or Earpieces (Very convenient for communication)
Disguises: dresses, wigs, glasses (Good for being someone you're not!)
Clothing : Camouflage or dark blue clothes if in the night. (never wear black at night, your silhouette will be outlined.)
Anything else you think your spy group would benefit from having.

, This person can be a random family member or friend if you're being spies just for the fun of it, or a suspicious person that you think may need a bit of watching. Just make sure, you and your friends are spying at your own risk. It's important to be very careful and stay away from anyone potentially dangerous. If you believe that your ""victim"" is actually may be a bad person that will harm you, stay away and call the police.Make sure that when your spying you have all your gear ready, and usable. Never try anything dangerous like trying to climb a roof, spying on someone who could seriously hurt you, etc

"
To begin, the first step a teenager spy must complete is to establish a team.",How to Be a Teenage Spy2," An ideal spy team will have three or four members each with distinct roles. Enlist friends who are interested in becoming teenager spies, and are good at it. People who can be quiet,keep secrets and blend in. Now, assign each friend a role. The four key roles are the following: the Leader, the Diverter, the Collector and the Sneak-in. Each position has a distinct role that includes multiple responsibilities. We will discuss this later.;
"
"
Now you have your team established, the next step towards becoming a teenage spy is to create a spy kit.,
However, when carrying out missions additional items might be needed.,
A spy kit should also contain distinct items needed for your position in a team:


Now for the 4 Main Jobs:

The Leader, or Head Spy, should have a clip-board and an agenda for the current mission.",How to Be a Teenage Spy3," A spy kit should be a compact, light container filled with supplies needed in order to act out your spy work. Basic supplies needed would be spare cash (about $25 is enough), a cell phone (bug-free), a scarf (for a quick disguise), a tape recorder (only if you do not have one on your phone), a digital camera along with additional batteries,a dust rag (clean off finger prints), and a notebook and pen. These supplies should be carried always even when not carrying out missions or attempting to sleuth. Also, this is not something you carry around, but is essential to have: To be a good spy, you must have a wealth of knowledge at your fingertips. Knowing a few languages is always helpful, so is being able to do semi-hard math in your head. You must be very, very smart, and have good common sense.

, Some suggestions for additional items are floss, string, tape, super glue, flour (for finding fingerprints),black construction paper (for fingerprints), Swiss army knife, flashlight, compass, safety pins, rope, and batteries (whatever type you use the most). Adjust this list and you will eventually know what type of kit you need for specific types of missions.

, This should be used to keep track of the details and inform confused team members of their purpose at that time. A Leader might also like to keep a stopwatch to keep track of time throughout the mission and a first aid kit in case of emergencies. ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR LEADER. YOU ELECTED THEM FOR A REASON, THEY KNOW BEST.
The Diverter should have multiple disguises at hand. Possible items used to disguise yourself include scarves, glasses, hats, wigs, costume make-up and large sunglasses. Be creative and try to establish a few strong disguises to turn to in an emergency. The Diverter might also need props such as Girl Scout cookies, dog photographs, etc. The Diverter is usually the most outgoing, the one who has all the connections, and knows everybody.
The Collector will collect all of the data and try to make sense of it. They will also collect the gadgets that you and your team are going to use.
The sneak-in will scout the place out, and know the shortest, safest route to the destination. They will also be the first to go into the room, and give a signal. The Sneak-In knows the town like the back of their hand, they know where to run to make the escape.

The key of being a spy isn’t about fancy equipment and high tech gear; it is all about your brain power. Investing in a good quality pen will encourage you to write more. You should also have a portable notepad for all your thoughts on the go.You could use a larger notepad, but you might find it more effective to use a pocket-sized notepad.;
, Portable recording devices are very useful for spying on subjects. Plant the recording device in a room, or conceal the device on your body to capture a conversation. You can find cheaper digital “voice memo” devices that you can use for recording people.


You can also use a smartphone’s recording function to record conversations. You probably wouldn’t want to plant your smartphone in a room to pick up a conversation, but you could.
Voice recorders can be found at most office supplies stores and other generalist stores.

, Once you begin spying you might find that you need a long distance listening device. This type of spy equipment is available in most spy kits or sold separately. The devices sold separate from spy kits are usually higher quality than spy kits.


There are bird watching and other nature tools that include long range audio devices. You might be able to find a cheaper device by looking at outdoor and nature stores.

, Your school probably has a policy against cameras at school, but you may be able to maneuver around this rule. Acquire a small portable camera, or a “spy camera,” that can be easily concealed. For more money, you can even buy a real spy cameras like a camera pen, or a dog tag necklace camera.You might already have a suitable device like an iPod mini or a GoPro that could work. Both these devices have video capabilities that can be useful in the field.
If you get a small camera, you should also find a way to conceal the device. You could cut out a hole in your pencil box, or cut a hole in a tissue box.
Hiding your camera depends on what rules your school has and what type of camera you have. Teachers will probably confiscate your camera if they find it.

, One of the best resources for how to be a spy is in detective novels. If this is a true passion you wish to follow, read as many spy novels as you can. Start with the classics like “The Purloined Letter” by Edgar Allen Poe, and move into reading Sherlock Holmes books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Here are some other essential detective novels you can read:


The Hardy Boys by Franklin Dixon
A Coffin For Dimitrios by Eric Ambler
The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett
Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie
Fade out by Joseph Hansen, The first step in becoming a good spy is to prove your credibility as a spy. One way to do this is keep your ears open in the hallways at school. Actively listen out for opportunities that you think you could work on. For instance:


You hear that a lot of janitors and teachers are frustrated by a graffiti tag in the boys locker room. Once you find a lead, chase it down until you find the culprit.
You find out that a girl from school likes someone, but she can’t be certain that he likes her back. This is a matter of gossip, but you can work it as a professional.
The football team is missing the championship trophy. This could be a good opportunity to blow the truth wide open., Once you’ve been put on the job for something, you should learn everything there is to know about this person. One way to learn about this person at school is by following them around at a distance. Find out their schedule for the day and who they surround themselves with.


Once you begin to learn their group of friends, you can interview some of the friend group. Don’t ask if you can interview them directly, but instead ask them some questions you’ve been building.
Be careful not to overstep your bounds in the school environment. You’ll probably be forced to do some detective work outside of school.

, Eavesdropping is a major aspect of spying. This is the way you can acquire information without interviewing reluctant subjects. You’ll always need to watch your back, or have an accomplice watch your back. People don’t like to be spied on, so you’ll need to keep your guard up.


A safe way to eavesdrop is by planting a recording device where you know your subjects will be congregating. Be sure to conceal the device before the subjects come to the meeting place.

, The best way to develop spy work is by recording all the information you’ve gained. Even if the information seems minuscule, you should include the information in your notepad. Once you start reviewing your notes, you might find that a small detail connects the larger pieces you overlooked.


Keep all the information you record organized by keeping track of the date and time of each detail.
Lots of detective work is all about tracking information about a small time slot that happened weeks ago, A key to being a spy is being stealthy. Your work is about secrecy and your methodology should reflect this. You can become a social chameleon by acquiring different clothes to fit into different friend groups. You should also know the schedule of classes at your school and when the hallways will be open.


You can accomplish a lot in a three minute window while the hallways are clear.
You can mask your identity by wearing a wig. Get a wig that is a different color than your hair. If you have blonde hair, get a brown wig.
Use a newspaper or a book to conceal your face while spying. Open the book or newspaper so that it covers your face.

, There are different types of detective work you can become involved in. You can try to go after social cases that involve information about other schoolmates. Other work you can do is exposing the identity of someone who vandalizes school property. You don’t need to be restricted to one type of detective work over another.


It might help you to define your spy vision while you're getting started. This will help you decide if you want to include other members into your spy work.Think about what needs your classmates have.
Consider working with a group of students that regularly gets misrepresented in school.

, Take a bit to reflect on people or groups in your school, from the past year or months, that could benefit from a spy.It might help you build your portfolio if you spy on cases that are relevant to your school. Try talking to employees of the school to see if they agree on an area of need. Don’t present yourself as a spy looking to build cases.


Some people may be alarmed if they find out you are an aspiring spy.

, You don’t have to work on cases from clients, or fellow classmates and school employees. The spy work you conduct could be a personal activity that you do for fun. You can also develop a network of contacts who can benefit from your work as a detective.


You can even plan a consultation conversation for potential clients. You can get a list of questions that you could ask every new client like: “What’s your current issue?”, “Is anyone upset with you that you are aware of?”, and “What is your timeframe?”
You probably won’t get any money working in your school, but at least it is a start. If you’re interested in becoming a private investigator when you grow up, practicing amateur spying will teach you a lot.
Some people might give you things like candy or baked goods for your work. They might just say, “I owe you one,” which can help you out in your future spy work.

, If you are having trouble getting clients, you may have to be proactive in acquiring them. You can make business cards explaining what type of detective work you have done in the past, and what you’re comfortable doing. Another way to get the word out is to post flyers advertising your services.


Don’t put your name or picture on the advertisements. This way you can keep an anonymity while working different cases.

, Once you start working as a spy, you may find that you need help. Include some of your trusted buddies to help you develop and improve your spy work. They need to be told that secrecy is the utmost priority, especially when it involves a classmate’s personal information.

Before you think you can be any kind of good detective, you've got to be ready. Take notes and be ready to stick your nose into any business to get what you want.;
, This means being able to easily converse with people you don't know, putting people at ease and asking questions. You will also need to think logically and keep a track of the information you've been told in your head. While you can write down information later, it is always better to retain it first, as you may not find an appropriate time to write notes when questioning people.


Learn to ask lots of questions. Learn how to come back to the question when people reply evasively or try to throw you off topic.

, For example, if there is a detective, a police officer or an investigator in your circle of family or friends, ask them about their work and the sorts of things a good detective should be on the lookout for.

, Be ready to take risks and get ready for anything. Make sure all your evidence is correct or people will get the wrong idea and you'll get in a big mix.


Have a friend train you on finding small details or play a thinking board game such as; Mastermind, Cluedo, Cluedo (Masters), etc.

, Learn what small details to notice and follow through on. How does the detective in the book think? Use the fictional character's approaches to help you learn how to stand in the shoes of other people and work out how they think, looking at things from a different perspective. That is the value of such fiction, learning to place yourself inside other character's feelings and motivations.

, Make sure it is something you find easy to move in or most comfortable. That way, it's easier sneak around and get into tight positions..

, You'll need a magnifying glass, a notepad and pen, a brush - to maybe find fingerprints, etc. Sunglasses can help keep you less conspicuous, while a hat or hoodie can help you look like just one of the crowd. A flashlight is a definite must-have and a digital camera for images that you can study later, back in your room.


Gloves and resealable bags come in handy for handling evidence which might have fingerprints. Handle objects with clean gloves do you don't mess it up. You can also use a handkerchief. Use either to put important evidence into a small or large sized resealable bag.

, Make sure it's a safe place to keep all your evidence and clues. You must keep them safely, because no evidence means you're just telling tales.

, side kicks are very helpful too. If you'd rather be independent,it's always nice to get a little help once in a while.


Get your own Dr. Watson! You can get a smart friend to help you solve a case (it is more fun)!

, Just because you are an amazing detective that doesn't mean you can't ask for help. Even Sherlock Holmes needs help sometimes!

, What strange happenings are going on around you? Maybe a family member has lost something important. Perhaps a cat has gone AWOL. Or there might be a mystery at school, your local sports club or at a friend's house.

, Inspect the area where the theft, loss, incident, etc. is thought to have happened. What can you find there? Do things look as they should or can you see small details that don't gel with normality?

, The steps in this article are just for fun and for mainly helping people find things or fix small issues. They are not intended to involve you in anything that requires real detective and law enforcement skills.

, Get yourself 2-4 associates. Purely optional. But it's is great to have backup if you need it. Also make sure that you get a team of good spies. Not your best friends.

, If you go to one, remember, the opposite gender is a spies worst enemy. Love makes the world go round, but it can be very dangerous.

, Someone's stolen a pen. Investigate. The school's key is missing? Find out who took it. The more cases, the more expertise.

, Keep on spying, (while being on the side of the law of course), and maybe once you're the spy expert you can join MI5, MI6, FBI, CIA, or be a private detective.

Do not tell any non-spies what you’re up to.",How to Be a Spy Kid," Spying is safer and more fun with two or more people. Your teammates can back you up and can help complete your mission faster (with the right group, of course!). If you decide to be alone, that’s okay, too. Secrets can definitely be kept a lot easier when it’s just you.


If you do decide to form a team, you should have one teammate who knows a lot about technology, such as computer shortcuts and knowledge of gadgets. The tech member can also make maps, plans, charts, and notes about the secret mission.
Being clever doesn't hurt either. If you have a friend that’s great at thinking outside of the box and is quick on his or her feet, add them to the mix.
Sometimes it's good to have a teammate that's strong, like for heavy lifting or hard tasks that involve strength. But don't let just anyone into your team; you need skilled spies, not grunt men.
Having a younger sibling is always helpful too, because they can usually out cute any foe you might come across- or to infiltrate the enemy's hideout, because they are smaller and a lot more trustworthy because of their age.;
, Make sure each of your members has a purpose. They'll feel like they're a valuable part of the team, too, if they have a specific role. Here’s the basic positions you should have filled:


A captain who is in charge of the team
A vice captain to help the captain make decisions and take their place if they are ill
A tech person in charge of the computer, surveillance equipment, and maps, etc.
A few general spies who go out in the field to do most of the spying
Make sure there are other spies at the base ready to back you up on your mission. Also, have another spy at a computer to write things down and get and record information.

, Remember, being a spy team means helping each other through thick and thin. If you have a few gadgets to your name, dish them out evenly. The more successful your team is, the more successful you and the mission are.


Everyone needs a way to report back to the base. It could be a cell phone, a walkie talkie, or even just a whistle – if they get in trouble, someone can come running. They also need whatever devices would help them debunk their case, like a camera.

, For a successful mission, you need equipment. The bigger your team is, the more you’ll need communication devices, too. Consider taking the following with you on your next mission:


Intercoms
Cell phones
Video equipment
iPods and other communication devices
Walkie talkies
Whistles
Cameras

, Do several practice runs in a different location than the actual mission to test and get used to your gadgets and clothes. This way, you will know the shortcuts and limits of your equipment. It can also help you predict what problems will likely arise.


Make sure everyone knows how to use the devices and is comfortable with them. If someone doesn't like using the computer, for example, send them out into the field. You want them doing a job they like, after all.

, Two things to consider: you either want to go totally spy-worthy or totally incognito. It’s more fun to dress like a spy, but sometimes it makes more sense to blend in. Which is appropriate for your next mission?


You might need special clothes like gloves and boots to make your missions possible. Wear dark colors, and don’t forget hats, too.
If you don’t want to be suspected of being up to no good, wear your ordinary clothes. That way you’re just a few kids having fun.

, Encrypt your written messages with a simple code. They can be as simple as substituting a letter for another or you can use numbers for letter or make up entirely new symbols that correspond to the alphabet. An advanced method (and harder to decrypt) would be to flip the word backwards and substitute the letters. You might even want to write the code in invisible ink.


Why is this useful? You don't want anyone figuring out your classified information, right? Should someone (like a pesky sibling) ""accidentally"" go through your stuff, you want them not to suspect anything. Or if they do suspect something, you want them to have no idea what they've seen.

, A locked room? Not a problem. A tree? Easy. A crowded room? Don’t even worry about it. You and your spy team can escape from just about anywhere – including sticky situations.


Never use elevators – if you get trapped in one, you’re trapped. Stairs allow for more exits.
It will be easier to escape places (and to sneak into them) if you learn how to pick locks.
Work on ways to talk your way out of things, too. Practice being confronted by a parent or someone with authority and use your sweetest words to talk your way out of it.

, This could also help with disguising, especially if your mission is in public, you’re around people you know, and you need to talk to your team. If you can disguise your voice, no one will suspect it’s you.


This will mainly be helpful if you're using cell phones or walkie-talkies. Code names are a necessity, too!

, For example, you might figure out where your guardians hid something, figure out the password to a friend’s club, or find out which neighborhood dog has been dirtying your dad's prized lawn. There's no mission too small, either.


Don't know of a mission? Keep your eyes and ears peeled. You'll hear someone complaining of something or talking about a problem they have they need solved. That's when your team can jump right in.

, Scout out the surroundings of your mission's location for any hiding spots or escape routes. Make a map and take notes, denoting where everyone will be posted and what they will do. Just like the Boy Scouts, you should always be prepared.


Make a backup plan or two. When plan A and B go terribly, terribly wrong, your team still knows how to handle the pressure with plan C. And be sure that whatever happens, everyone stays safe!

, Each member should have a communication device, preferably with headsets, as to minimize noise. When everyone is ready, commence the mission. They all go to their spots and begin their career as a trained spy kid.


Make sure they all know the rules. When can they go to the bathroom? When do they switch posts? At what time is everyone meeting back up and where?

, Have a good hiding spot for each member, such as a large tree, bushes, or boulders. Also, you can inconspicuously have a teammate casually stroll by, with a book or something in hand. Don't do this too much, though, or it will seem suspicious.


If you're incognito, dressed as a normal kid, make sure you're acting normal, too. What would a normal kid do at the park? He or she probably would make noise, laughing and playing around. You can also be suspicious by being too quiet.

, Make sure you and your teammates don't leave anything behind. Destroy any footprints on dirt or mud, (and destroy any accidental finger prints if you notice some). All papers at the scene should be recycled and definitely no clothing or anything else personal left for curious eyes to find.


Cover your digital tracks, too. Delete any text messages, emails, or phone calls made about the mission. Though it's likely no one will see these, it's always better to be safe than sorry.

, There should be a meeting place after the mission to gather information from each team member. The team should then brainstorm, determining if another mission is necessary or if this one can be considered case closed.


If members don't show up, return to your posts and try to find where the missing member is. If necessary, get out of spy mode and go looking for them openly. Have one or two people stay at the base in case they come back on their own.

, The last thing you want is all of your retrieved intelligence and data compromised by a non-spy discovering what you’ve found. Make sure you put it in a place no one will think of to go but you. But you also want a place that's easy to remember.


Try a locked box or a password-protected computer.
Are there are secret locations in or around your house, like under a loose floor board, that no one knows about but you? This also makes good storage space.

, Don't avoid the enemy; if you do, they'll think something's up. Try your best to act normal and make sure you meet as if nothing happened.


If you've discovered information that they need to know (like which dog is digging up the yard), present this information as calmly and as casually as possible. You didn't go on a secret ops mission with your team – you just happened to be walking by when you saw Mr. Fluffy doing the deed.

, If the enemy finds out what you are doing or sees you spying, make sure you have a backup plan to explain what you’re doing there. Or if you get asked later where you were while you were gone, be ready with details. You sure don't want to be caught spying!


Keep it as close to the truth as possible. Say something like, ""I was there out with my friends (your team) and we were playing a game in the park. It's like hide and seek, but advanced. It's too difficult to explain; there are lots of rules. You wouldn't like it anyway.

, Only friends who are being initiated into the program should be told about your activities. Otherwise, keep it secret and low key. Some might be jealous and some might blab your secret. The fewer people who know, the better.


Be careful in initiating in new team members. Make sure they're trustworthy and up to the challenge before they become a spy kid with you. Your team needs to be all top-notch, honest, talented spies.

This will give you a good advantage when you spy on people. You will have your gadgets close by your side, and your hands will be free. Do not label it; this will only attract attention to your bag.


Purchase a small handbag to avoid attracting attention. Make sure it is big enough to hold your gadgets. Refrain from using large, clumsy handbags.
To keep your hands free, obtain a bag with a strap that can be slung across your chest.;
, Studies show that women talk about three times as much as men do, which is very helpful to female spies. Simply insert yourself into a group of girls and listen for the information you need. If need be, shift the conversation towards the desired subject. Words and text speak that girls are well known (such as ""OMG"" or ""LOL"") can be used as secret code.


Create your own hand signals and codes. Practice these with your fellow agents until all of you know them well. You may also want to make an item with all of the motions to have a quick reminder in case you forget. Do not make it a piece of paper or poster; instead, mark everything on a scarf or the inside of your bag. If you make it a paper, people will want to read it and possibly see your secret.







, Most people believe the quieter people are more likely to be the spies, as spies tend to stay in the shadows. However, the popular, outgoing females frequently receive attention. Therefore, throw yourself in the public eye, and no one will suspect you're a spy.

, Be sure only you and your fellow agents are aware of the location. Have basic supplies stored in there (ex: food, water, medicine, etc.) to use in case of an emergency.

, Keep at a distance from them, and always have a cover story or an excuse at hand (ex: ""I'm in a foreign government's embassy because .""). There is always a chance that someone catches you spying, even though you didn't plan for them to.

, The spy gear kit at Target includes: DVD holder, secret compartment, flashlight, darts, periscope, and a motion detector. There are other gadgets too, such as the spy gear ear flashlight and the spy gear camera car. Spend your money only on the basic necessities.


To be a good spy, carry a small weapon (ex: pencil/pen), small purse, global cell phone, extra cash, and appropriate identification.






If you're spotted, hide your face behind a magazine or book. Do not hurry and quickly hide, though; this will seem awkward and make you even more suspicious. You could also pretend to be taking clothes to the changing rooms at a store or browsing a rack of shirts at the mall. Your targets will automatically label you as another girl at the mall.







, To live in a world of spies, one must be a spy. You can no longer behave a regular citizen, and you must always be on the lookout for danger.

, It's safer and more fun to work with agents. It's recommended to allow your trustworthy friends to become your fellow agents, but they must be able to keep secrets. If someone you know is a good friend but has spilled the beans before, you should question yourself before recruiting them.


Have at least one male partner at your side during missions. He may be able to access certain places that you cannot (ex: the men's bathroom). Additional strength can also come in handy. However, he must agree before recruiting.







, Learn to keep your ears open for important information. It may come at unpredictable times. Avoid getting easily distracted, and remember to observe your surroundings. Use peripheral vision to your advantage.

, All spies are masters of disguise. This doesn't mean dressing in camouflage; it means blending into crowded places and fitting in. Your goal is to remain undetected and not stand out from the crowd. Dress appropriately for the place you are heading to (ex: wear a bathing suit when you head to the beach).

When heading out at night, just wear normal clothes.






Several other ideas for disguises are:
Dressing up as a girl from another state or area
Posing as a skateboarder in the park
Carrying bags full of random items to give off the appearance that you went grocery shopping

, If you're a beach girl from the warm parts of America, appear occupied with your cell phone and give off a friendly air by smiling. However, as you follow your target around, change your appearance each time you go to a new place. This way, your suspect won't recognize you.

Consider including strategy tips.,
Include any extras or possible game variants at the end.,
Format your pages so that people can easily read the instructions.",How to Write Game Instructions," Whether you’re writing your game rules on a notepad, whiteboard, or printing in a pamphlet, take a look at how your favorite games format the instructions for inspiration and examples.


Take notes of how other instructions are formatted. Notice the hierarchy of the information explained. How the structure allows you to see the big picture. When writing your own rules try to follow a similar format.
Make a checklist of sections to include that you see in other instruction books. You can even emulate the style if you want.;
, When you write the instructions and information of your game, assume that people will be reading aloud. One person usually reads the instructions to the group.


Have the tense reflect someone reading out loud during the play of the game. This means that your tense and tone should default to present tense, active voice, and be pithy, or quick. Whether you’re explaining the game that you created for the first time, or someone else is explaining it with your rulebook, you want to make the text quick and easy to understand.
For example, if you have a board game about two countries at war, you might explain the objective like: “You are a member of one of the two countries at war. You are assigned a role to aid your country. The goal of the game is to work together to defeat the enemy country in one of three ways: You can win by destroying the country through war, assassinating the country’s leader, or being the first country to go into space.”
With simple descriptions and an active voice you can easily get a good amount of information out. Players now know the objective and winning methods of the game.

, Try to talk to the active player as much as possible with “you” statements.


Instead of saying “When a player…” or “The player…” Try saying “When you…” as much as possible. Speaking in the second person will help you to convey the rules of your game. The second person helps you when reading, as well as other players learning the game in the future.
There are times when you don’t have to use the second person. When describing what certain objects or tokens may do for a player, you can use “The player…” if it makes more sense.
To avoid situations where using the second person sounds awkward, remember to try and use active voice. Instead of “The cards are shuffled.” Say “You shuffle the cards.” This active voice also gives the players strong direction of what to do.

, When using a game term, such as a type of card, action, piece, etc., reference it right away. But don't over explain it.


If you are explaining the objective of your game and reference that one of the ways to win is to assassinate the enemy’s leader, you should notate where the instructions on how to accomplish that task can be found. You will have a separate section that fully explains this method of winning.
If you have room, you can also briefly explain the term before continuing on. Never include a term that new players won’t understand without explaining it. And always show players where to find more information on the term.

, How does a player win? How does a player lose? Before players dive into the long list of instructions, you want to reward your players with a preview and overview of how the game works.
You may want to start with a brief summary of the game. It can be a quick history of the world of your game. It should be brief but serve as a way to help players understand the objective that follows.
If we’re using our warring countries example, the summary will explain why the two countries are at war. It could be that these two countries used to be one. And one country rebelled and started a revolution. Now both countries are using all available resources to win the revolution. This gives you a good starting point for then explaining the objective and ways to win.

, When actually writing your game instructions in whichever format you have chosen, do it in order. Writing in order means that you follow a logical path of explaining the mechanics of the game. You may want to start with a brief summary of the game. Then include up at the top which pieces are included. Then move on to the objective, the setup, how the play operates, and what each piece or character does. After explaining how you win, you may include more sections that deeper explains objects, moves, or player types you touched on earlier. Your instructions should work like a book or story. You start with a table of contents. After that you may have a preface or forward, something that outlines your game. This can be your objective. When explaining the rules and different parts of the game’s flow, do it in the order that it will happen. It should follow a beginning, middle, and end.
You'll also want to include a brief section early on that details how many players can play, and the age range.
Explain the setup before you explain the start of play so that players can set up the board. When the players finish reading about the setup, the next section should explain how to start playing. Following, you will have a style of play. For example, if you have a turned based game, next explain how the turns work. If the turns lead to combat, you will next explain combat and the components of that.

, Make sure that there are sections of your game instructions that are easy to understand and follow. You shouldn’t start explaining how to move on your turn and then go on a tangent on what each possible outcome of every move is.


Write your instructions so that players can understand how to play in the easiest way possible. Put all the ways to score points together. Explain the turns in one section.
If you are explaining how a turn works and then need to explain that at the end of every turn a player draws one type of card, that's’ ok. You can even explain the types of cards the player may draw. But refer the reader to a separate section that details what each card means and does.

, It’s crucial that the player understands what the cards, pieces, units, etc., represents.


You will have most likely explained how some of your game’s contents and objects work when explaining the play of the game and objective. This section acts more like an encyclopedia, used to further explain all objects. You will go into much further depth here than when you mentioned objects in earlier sections.
You may even want to consider drawing or sketching your pieces, even if this is just for fun, to serve as a visual aid. Separate the objects and group like ones together.

, Wear the hat of someone who doesn’t know anything about your game. Be honest with yourself and take note of how well you would understand these instructions.


Do you not explain the objective well enough? Are you using second person and active voice consistently? Do you understand how the setup, turns, and winning work?
If there are trouble spots make note of these areas and revise. Your instructions should be easy to understand so people can play your game as soon as possible.

, If your game has a turn-based structure or some form of turn-taking, show how an example turn should go.


This example should cover most if not all of the scenarios and interactions between the game elements, if possible.
It might be necessary to include more than one turn to fit all the interactions. If this is the case, you may want to include a notation when explaining this part of the game. And include a separate section that goes into fuller detail.

, Sometimes the descriptions of the rules or how the board is setup can seem hard to understand. In order to avoid players becoming disinterested, help your players by including some tips on strategy.


List any and all special scenarios that might otherwise confuse the player. Include strategic methods for winning in the scenario. This step can either be really quick and easy; or it can be the bulk of your explanation, depending on how your game works.
This step is really a judgment call. But if you suspect that a certain aspect of the game might be unclear, take the time to fully explain the outcome of that scenario.

, If your game can be played alternate ways, list the alternate ways here.


If your game includes other elements that aren’t used specifically for the main game, explain those. Also, explain how to use such elements here.
All the instructions and elements that you didn’t cover before should be presented after the main instructions. The main instructions explain the operation of the game.

, No matter where you are writing your instructions, and how you will present the final ones, make sure that your pages or documents are easy to read.


Formatting includes the layout and order of the instructions. But it also includes the kind of font and spacing you include. If you are typing, don’t pick a crazy font that’s hard to read. If you are hand-writing, write legibly.
Don’t clump all your instructions into block paragraphs. Use bullet points when you can. Break up the text with a visual aid if possible.
Have someone read over your game instructions. Get a second pair of eyes to read your instructions and check for any errors. This person can also tell you if your instructions make sense and where to better explain things.

Master the classics before attempting exotic knots.",How to Tie a Trinity Knot," The skinny end will likely fall out higher up along your torso.


The trinity knot is considered to be an ""exotic"" knot or special occasion knot, but as far as special knots go, it's actually fairly simple. The movements needed to create the knot are somewhat basic and easy to perform; it's just that there are a few more than you would find with a standard tie knot.
The trinity knot consumes a moderate amount of fabric as you tie it. As such, it can be a little more difficult than a standard knot, but it is not quite as hard to adjust as many other exotic knots, like the Eldredge knot.;
,


Pinching is not an absolute essential part of the process, but it can make it easier to weave the smaller end around the thicker end without the fabric bunching up.

, Wrap the thinner side of the tie over the thicker side, then pass it beneath the underside of the thick end so that it circles around it completely.

,


In a sense, this action closes the loop around your neck.

, There should now be a v-shaped loop around your neck. For the next pass, you need to bring the same side you've been working with behind the hanging portion of your tie.


Note that in this step, you are not directly affecting the loop.

,, Take it back down through the loop of the smaller end you just formed.


Your knot will begin to form right around this step. At this point, and throughout most of the process, you should keep the knot pretty loose so that you have plenty of material to adjust with. You can tighten the knot as needed once you complete the basic structure of the trinity knot.

,,,,, Make any adjustments needed, such as straightening the tie out or tightening the knot, before stepping out your door in style.

,


When done correctly, the trinity knot should be somewhat hexagonal in shape with three-way symmetry.
You can wear this knot loosely or tightly. A loose knot will appear bigger and easier to see, but the choice is really a matter of personal preference.
You might need to make adjustments on a trial-and-error basis until you figure out how you like it and what makes it look best.

, Certain patterns can highlight the knot while others drown it it.


A solid color tie is usually the best choice, especially if you are just learning to tie the trinity knot. With a solid tie, you can see the trinity pattern rather well and there are no patterns you need to match up.
Once you get comfortable with the trinity knot, you could try a tie with diagonal stripes. It takes a little adjustment and a little practice, but if the knot is tightened in just the right way, you can get the stripes to converge in the center like a pinwheel or go out toward the edges like a triangle.
Light patterns, like small polka dots or diamonds, can work with a trinity knot but start to drown out the look of the knot itself.
Stay away from paisley patterns and other bold, loud, large patterns. These tend to hide the knot's folds, making all your effort stand out less.

, The best type of shirt collar to wear with a trinity knot is a narrow spread collar, while wider spread collars tend to work less favorably.


A narrow spread or pointed collar has a narrow opening between the two sides of the collar, so the trinity knot is framed rather nicely. Medium spread collars can also work.
Once the spread or gap starts getting wider, though, the style compliments the trinity knot less. Avoid widespread collars, cut-away collars, and club or rounded collars.

, In other words, keep your outfit simple so that the eyes of others are automatically drawn to the fancy trinity knot rather than other components of your attire.


Avoid shirts with patterns or wild colors. Instead, opt for a solid colored shirt in a fairly classic color or a pastel.
You can also wear a vest with this knot to accent the trinity knot more effectively.

, A trinity knot can be a great fashion statement, but as with most style statements of this nature, there's a time and a place for it. In general, a trinity knot is easier to pass off during an occasion that is either lighthearted or mundane.


You can pass off a trinity knot at work if you can be casual about it. This means wearing it at random to break up the monotony of standard tie knots. It does not mean wearing it every single day of the week.
You can also wear this knot at lighthearted special occasions, like wedding, anniversary parties, or functions at which you are the guest of honor.
You should avoid wearing it at serious formal events, however, like an important trial, political dinner, or reception for someone of great power. The knot could be an unwelcome distraction from the serious matter at hand.

, As a general rule of thumb, it's a wise move to know a few classic knots like the Windsor or four-in-hand before moving onto something exotic like the trinity knot.


Classic knots are more suited for everyday use than the trinity knot or other special occasion knots, so they tend to be more versatile.
Additionally, learning the easier classic knots can help you prepare for more exotic options, ultimately making these special knots easier to learn. For instance, the beginning of a trinity knot is very similar to the beginning of a Windsor knot.

Though you could create the knot with a free-hanging rope, it is easier if one end is fastened down.


If you're just practicing, tape some rope to hang over the edge of a desk, or have a friend hold it up.;
, You'll need the object getting ""hitched"" to make a good knot. While practicing, anything roughly a half-inch thick and at least six inches long is a good start. Try out a wrench, drumstick, wooden dowel, etc.


The thickness of the rope doesn't matter., Pinch the rope with two fingers, then pull the bottom of the rope up and to the side so that you have a small, roughly 1"" diameter loop at the bottom of your rope.


Where you create this loop determines where your knot will be.
Unless you're putting your hitch at the very bottom of the rope, you should still have free-hanging rope underneath your loop.

, Bisected means cut into two pieces. Flip the loop up so it lies against the remainder of the rope going upwards. Your fingers will be pinching the knot together from the bottom.


The cross-over of the rope, the part you're pinching together, must be on the bottom or the knot will fall apart.

, Take your long object and slide it into the right side of the loop, coming from the front.

, Now, come back towards your body with the hitch., You'll be going over, under, and over again to thread the hitch into your rope. This ensures it won't be going anywhere if you tug on the rope.

, Holding onto your hitch, pull the rope from below to tighten around your object You have just made your first marlinespike hitch!


Make sure your ""knot,"" the folded over rope is underneath the hitch, not above."

Wrap your rope around a your object (example: tree) so that the long end (standing end) is on your right side and the short end (bitter end) is on your left.,
Cross the bitter end over the standing end.

,
Bring the bitter end under the standing end and up through the loop.,
Repeat the turn.,
Pass the bitter under the standing end.

,, Bring the bitter end to the right.

, Bring the bitter end under the standing and up through the loop. Bring the bitter end to the left.

,, The purpose of this extra turn is to lock the knot when you need to make sure it holds.

, You can slide the knot up and down the standing end.


Loosen the tension on the standing end, and the knot will slide to adjust the size of the loop.

Tie an overhand knot.,
Tie a bowline knot.,
Tie a square knot.,
Tie sheet bend knots.",How to Tie a Knot1," Overhand knots are probably the easiest, and first, knot that people learn to tie. 








Make a loop that looks like the loop of a roller coaster. Insert one end of the string into the loop. Pull both ends in opposite directions so that the knot becomes tight.;
, This knot, also called a bowline hitch, makes a fixed loop at the end of a rope or string. The loop can be secured over an object like a post or passed through a ring or hole before the knot is tied.








Hold one end of the string in each hand. Make a loop with the end of the string in your left hand. The end should be under the main portion of the string.
Put the end of the string that is in your right hand through the loop that you have made with your left. The right hand end should come towards you as it goes through the loop.
Bring the right end up and around the left end (that should be pointing up since you created the loop with it.)
Pull the right end back through the loop. This time the end should go away from you. Pull the two ends away from each other so that the knot is tight.

, Square knots are also called reef knots. The square knot is a simple, handy knot for temporary ties.








Hold an end of the rope in each hand. Cross the end in your right hand (end A) over the end in your left hand (end B) so that the rope forms an X.
Wrap end A so that it goes under end B and comes up again. Bring end A back over end B to form a half-knot.
Place the top of end A over the top of end B. Bring end A back over end B to form an overhand knot. Pull tightly on all four ‘ends’ coming out of the knot. The result should be a knot that looks like a loop stuck in another loop.

, Sheet bend knots are used to tie two ropes together.








Form a loop (also called a bight) out of one rope (rope A) and hold the loop together with your hand. Take the other rope (rope B) and run one of its ends through the loop.
Pull the end of rope B so that it goes up through the loop and wraps under both parts of the loop.
Take the end of rope B and pull it up and under itself where it comes up out of the loop. Pull both ropes away from each other to secure the knot.

Use a marlinespike hitch to get greater power pulling on a rope.,
Keep vital tools nearby by hitching them to your ropes.,
Use two ropes to make a ladder, tying a hitch to the end of each rung.",How to Tie a Marlinspike Hitch2," Traditionally, marlinespike hitches are used to get a good grip on a rope. Instead of wrapping the rope around your hand and pulling, you create a handle with a wrench, dowel, etc. Since the knot is so quick and easy to make, you'll save a lot of time and energy for serious pulling, towing, or yanking.


The knot is even used to tie other knots tighter. Instead of yanking on the end of a knot with your hands, tie in a marline spike, tighten the knot, and then remove it.

, This is especially helpful at sea, where there is an abundance of rope but a serious risk of tools going overboard. Keep them secure and at an easily grabbed height with a marlinespike., If you have two identical ropes hanging down, you can make marlinespike hitches at identical heights to create a rope ladder. The actual knots are the exact same, but you should test each set with a vigorous pull to ensure they are all weight bearing. Note, however, that You must start from the bottom up. The final hitch you tie needs to be your top rung for the greatest strength and durability.


Test the ladder every time you use it. Over time, all knots may loose some of their strength and start to become loose.
Secure the rungs, especially the top ones, with clamps that prevent the rungs from falling off for longevity and added safety.
Ensure that your rungs are as horizontal as possible, with evenly spaced rungs."

Double Bowline knot is used in climbing.,
Tie a re-threaded figure-of-eight knot.,
Tie a prusik knot.",How to Tie a Knot2,"








Make two loops of equal size stacked on top of each other. Take the end of the rope farthest from the two loops (end A) and wrap it over your tie-in point (wrap it from the back over to the front.)
Thread end A through the hole created by the two loops. Wrap end A around the other end (end B) that is shorter and near the two loops.
Thread end A back through the two loops, making sure that it is wrapped around end B.

, The re-threaded figure-eight knot, also called a figure-of-eight follow-through, is used by climbers to tie into a harness.








Make a loop in the rope so that there is about five feet (1.5 meters) of loose rope at one end (end A). Make the loop so that end A wraps around the bottom of the loop and over the rest of the rope (end B.)
Thread end a through the loop and pull tight. This should form a figure-eight in the rope where the loop was. Loop end A through your harness.
Thread end A through the top loop of the figure-eight. Wrap end A around end B and pull end a up through the bottom of the figure-eight, loop it over the top of end B and back through the top of the figure-eight so that it comes out the bottom of the figure-eight.

, Prusik knots are used to tie a loop around a rope so that a rope can be climbed. It is a classic ascending knot that is often used for self-rescue.








Take a small rope or chord (rope A) and pull it under the rope you want to climb (rope B.) Form a loop with rope A and pull the loop over rope B. The two ends of rope A should hang down under rope B.
Pull the loop over rope B and around again so that it is back up on the other side. Repeat this step three to five times, depending on the thickness of your rope.
Bring the ends of rope A through the loop. Doing this will secure rope A to rope B. When you pull on the ends of rope A, the knot will stay in place. When you loosen the knot, the knot will be able to slide up and down rope B.

Tie clove hitch knots.,
Tie a trucker’s hitch.,
Tie an anchor bend knot.",How to Tie a Knot3," Clove hitch knots are fairly simple knots that can be useful for securing ropes to trees, posts, or other things that stand upright or horizontal.








Wrap the running end of the rope (end A) halfway around the pole or object that you are tying the rope to. The running end of the rope is the end that will be loose after you tie the knot.
Wrap end A over the part of the rope resting against the pole. This should form an X. Wrap end A back over the pole.
Lift the X that has been formed up off of the pole. Slide end A under the X and pull on end A firmly to secure the knot.

, Trucker’s hitches are used for lifting heavy loads and tensioning lines. On a boat, it can be used to lash things to the deck or secure them down below. Use it in combination with a bowline and half hitch for a very secure knot.









Wrap the end of a rope (end A) around the object you want lifted. If you want to place a tensioned line between two objects, wrap the end around one of them (object A).
Create a bowline knot (or some other fixed knot) high up against object A with end A. Take the other end (end B) and wrap it around an anchor, such as a heavy rock, tree or pole, and then loop it up through the bowline (or other fixed knot.) If you are working with two objects, loop it around the other object (object B.)
Pull on end B to lift the object or add tension. You should be able to lift with two times the power you would normally have.

, Anchor bends are used to tie rope to a ring or other similar object. It is used particularly when securing a boat to a ring or other form of anchor.








Loop the end of the rope through the ring twice. This will give you an end rope and the standing line (the part of the rope that is fastened to your boat.
Wrap the end around the standing line and pull it under the first loop around the ring. Pull it so that there is no sagging part of the rope.
Wrap the end around the standing line again and then tuck the end under itself (this is called a half hitch.)

Palomar knot is used to secure a fishing line to the hook.,
Chinese Sliding knots are useful when making adjustable necklaces.,
Quick release knots are used to tie a horse up so that when required the rope can be released by pulling the loose end.",How to Tie a Knot4,"








Put one end of the fishing line (end A) through the round hole at the top of the hook. Pull the same end back through the hole but be sure to not pull it all the way. You should have a loop on one side of the hole and the two ends of the line on the other.
Create circle by bringing the loop over and forming a loop on top of the two ends. Wrap the end of the loop through the hole created but do not pull it tight yet.
Pull the hook through the end of the loop (which should be rather small now.) Pull the hook and ends of the line in opposite directions so that the knot is tightened. Cut off the end of the line that is not connected to the fishing pole.

,








Lay the ends of the string so that the ends lie parallel to each other. They should run parallel for about four inches (10 cm).
Pull the end of the right chord (end A) so that it doubles back four inches (10 cm). It should make a long C shape. Hold the chord down and loop the same end back four inches (10 cm) leaving some chord at the end of end A (you will need it to finish the knot.)
Wrap end A around all of the stacked up lengths of switch-backing chord. Wrap the end from front to back several times. Feed end A through the loop.
Slide the wrapped loops down so that the knot is tightened. End B (the left end) should be able to move freely when pulled. Make another of these knots if you wish.

,








Take a rope and fold it in half. Take the loop made in the middle and wrap it around a pole from the back of the pole to the front. The left side of the rope will be the quick-release end (end A) and the right side of the rope with be the standing end (end B).
Make a loop (loop 1) using end B. Pull that loop through the original loop that is wrapped over the pole.
Make a loop (loop 2) using end A. Pull loop 2 through loop 1. Pull down on end B to tighten the hitch. Pull end A for the quick-release.

Fold the rope over on itself to create a ""bight,"" or a U-shape in the rope.,
Lay the bight over the rod you want to create the knot on.,
Tuck the bight back under the rod, back towards your body.,
Take the left-most strand of rope and tuck it through your bight, creating another bight.,
Take the right strand of rope and create another bight.,
Pass the third bight back through the second one.,
Still pinching the last bight your made, grab the rope leading back to your body and pull to tighten.,
Pull the ""tail,"" or the shorter right end of the rope, to quickly undo the knot.",How to Tie a Painter Hitch," A bight is simple a curled piece of rope, with both strands pointing in the same direction. For a painter hitch, form the first bight so you have roughly one foot of rope to the right of the bight and the rest of the rope to the left.


For this knot you will need to create three interlocking bights.;
, Usually, this is a horizontal bar, but you could also push the bight through a metal ring as well and secure the rope to this. Either way, you want the bight to hang over the object you're tying it to.

, There will be two strands of rope on top of the bar, and the bight coming underneath it back towards your hands.


As long as you have something to lay the bite over and tuck under, you can use it to make a painter hitch.

, You have a bight in a bight. It sounds complicated, but it doesn't have to be. Simply pinch the left strand with two fingers to create a U-shape, then pull this U through your first bight.


The two bights should be roughly perpendicular to each other. It almost looks like the outline of half a sombrero.
The fact that the rope is on the left is not important. What is important is that you use the side with a lot of rope slack left, not the shorter side. The longer side is called the ""standing"" rope., Holding the two bights in your left hand, create a third with the small strand of rope in your right. Again, it is simply a U-shape bend in the rope.

, Again, pinch the rope, then pull it through the bite you just made with the leftmost strand of rope. You should now have three interlocked bights. There will be one strand of rope leading back to your body and a small tail of rope hanging off.

, Hold onto the knot to keep it in place, then yank on the standing rope to tighten it.

, This will almost instantly collapse the knot. If you're in a position that requires a sturdier knot, there is really no reason to use the painter hitch.

, It should be level with the first button on your shirt, the one below the collar. You can make the dimple by pinching the sides of the tie against the center, so you get a sort of fan-fold, with the side edges pointing towards your chest.

, Pull it upward towards you shoulder so that both sides of the tie cross snuggly in front of your neck. There will be a gape between the crossed ties and your neck. This is the neck hole., Bring the narrow end under the neck hole. Feed it up through the hole. You will have the beginning of a knot., Bring the narrow end back under the knot. Pull it upwards and feed it back down through the neck hole. Tug it downwards and to the left again., Place your finger over the knot. Wrap the narrow end over the knot and your finger.

, Bring the narrow end under the knot. Feed it up through the neck hole. Remove your finger, leaving behind a loop. Pull the narrow end down through that loop., Gently tug the knot upward so that it is resting against the base of your neck. It should be snug, but it should also be comfortable., This will create a crease that will eventually form the petals on the bud., Keeping the narrow end folded, pull it upward. Feed it down through the neck hole. Tug it downward and to the left. Position the wrapped part as far to the right as you can., Position it just below the knot, so that it is resting across the front of the wide end. You should still be keeping it folded.

, This time, tug the narrow end upwards and to the right. Feed it down through the neck hole, positioning it as far to the right as you can., Shift the first looped part to the left. Bring the narrow end upward and to the right. Feed it down through the neck hole and tug it to the right. Adjust the two wrapped layers so that they are overlapping each other., Pull the narrow end towards the tie that's wrapped around your neck. Wrap it around the band a few times until you have nothing left. This gets the tail end out of the way. Don't worry, it won't be visible in the end.

Bight: Simply a U-shaped bend, where the rope turns back on itself

Standing Line: This is the extra rope at the end of your knot. For example, if you were tying the noose at the end of a roll of rope, the standing line is the part leading back to the roll.;
, The longer the rope, the bigger the noose. Longer ropes also allow you to get more of the infamous coils around the top of the knot, which also makes it stronger.

, Take the end of the rope and create two bends, forming an S-shape with the rope. The standing line should be left long so that you have some string left at the end.

Tighten to finish.",How to Start a Lanyard1," Bend the cord into a loop with its bight (the U-shape) at roughly its midpoint.


The diamond knot is sometimes called a lanyard knot.Use a cord that is roughly twice the length of the lanyard you plan to make.
In general, the best type of cord for making this type of lanyard is a specific kind of nylon rope called paracord. Paracord is both incredibly strong and highly durable while also very light and soft against the skin.;
, Take the left end of the cord and slide it back around under itself using a circular motion. The loop you form should be much closer to the left end of the rope compared to the right. Make sure to keep the cord flat against your work surface., This is the first step to join the two ends into a carrick bend. A carrick bend is a particular type of knot that is both practical and decorative., The left half of the new bight should be draped over the portion of cord to the left of the first loop., Keep in mind that before you do this step the right tip will also be the right half of the second bight.


At this point, both end tips should be facing the same direction. What was originally the right end will now be to the left of the original left end., Bring the right tip of the cord end down so that it crosses overtop both sides of the first loop while sliding under the segment in the middle. Tug on the original right tip to pull it through.

, Bring the original right end up and around with a clockwise motion. Slide the right tip underneath the top half of the knot. Pull the original right end up through the center and then across to the right.


The knot should remain slack at this point., Bring the original left end around across the right side of the first bight. Slide the tip underneath the left half of the knot. Thread the original left end back up through the center of the knot and across to right half.


The right and left ends should now be parallel to each other., Pull both tips of the cord with one hand while holding the remainder of the first bight in place with the other. This should tighten the cord into a secure knot.


Use the free ends to attach the lanyard to your item of choice. This style of lanyard is typically used to hold a knife."

Overhand knots can be used to add extra grip to a potential lanyard.
Overhand knots can also be incorporated into more complicated lanyard-starting methods., Place the bight anywhere along your lanyard cord you would like to have an overhand knot. When you've finished, your knot will be roughly at the bight's apex. The free ends don't need to be even, but they should be parallel to each other.In knot-tying, a bight is a U-shaped loop on the cord.

, Draw one side over the other. Wrap the working cord around the opposite side. Pull its end back around through the bight, which should now be a loop., Pull each end at the same time.When working further on your lanyard, you may choose to add more overhand knots along the cord or over top the first to further strengthen its grip. Keep in mind that this is a ""jamming"" knot and will be incredibly difficult to untie."

Continue this pattern to create the main part of your lanyard.",How to Start a Lanyard3," To start a ""king cobra"" lanyard, you will need roughly 13 feet (4 m) of paracord, a metal clip, a tape-measure, a rubber band, a pair of scissors, and a lighter.


The king cobra paracord lanyard is popular among hikers and survivalists, as it allows you to conveniently carry a long amount of rope in the palm of your hand.This same style of braiding is also used in scoubidou, also known as gimp, a popular knotting craft among children. When made using plastic strings, it can be used as a decorative lanyard in its own right., Fold your length of paracord in half. Tie your rubber band around the loop that forms in order to mark its center.You can substitute other markers for the rubber band as long as the alternative is both secure and temporary. Twist ties and bread clips are good options.

, Position the knot so that it is roughly two inches away from the rubber band marker. You may remove the rubber band once the knot is secure. Two potential knots you can use are:



The diamond or lanyard knot – This type of knot is both very secure and aesthetically pleasing.

A simple overhand knot – This knot is much easier to do but is also bulkier and less decorative compared to the diamond knot., Push the two free tips of paracord through the solid loop portion of your metal clip. Pull them through until the knot is roughly five inches from the loop. Position the two long portions of the paracord so that they are on either side of the central five-inch stretch., This will start your first cobra stitch.In knot tying, a bight is a U-shaped loop formed by the cord.

, Keep the knot slack.

, Make sure to leave the knot slack at this point.

, Grab the long tail, or working end, and wrap it around your fingers three times. Start the first wrap on the area of your fingers closest to your palm. Each successive wrap should be closer to the tips of your fingers.
Try wrapping the paracord around your first three fingers, or even just your first two to make it easier., Be sure that you maintain the orientation. Keep this same hand positioned so the loops hold.


With your free hand remove the rope from the hand you wrapped it around, keeping the first set of turns in place.
Keep the first three turns intact by pinching the rope together with your forefinger and thumb.
You can also keep the rope on your hand if you wish and thread the next horizontal loops through your finger. , Grab the long tail and wrap it perpendicularly around the three vertical loops just created. Do this three times. Each subsequent horizontal strand should be above the last. When done, you should have three turns of rope looped vertically and cinched loosely by three horizontal wraps.


Do not pull tight, these wraps need to be loose.
Finish the horizontal turns by creating a loop, with the remainder of the rope, going through the three vertical strands. Here, you’re taking your final turn and passing through the middle, not the outside., Again grab the long tail and wrap it around the three newest horizontal strands. Pass the rope through the opening. Go over the horizontal wraps but between your first three vertical loops. Continue with this motion three times.


Weave the rope through the top and out the bottom.
You should notice the monkey fist shape coming into place.

, To add an extra weight to your monkey knot, add a small marble to its center. This is an optional step, but it is recommended for a sturdy monkey knot.


Any small spherical object will work. But a marble is easiest to work with.

, Spend a few minutes gently tugging each loop to tighten your knot. Start with the first loop you cast and end with the last.


You have to cinch the slack by tightening each loop in the order in which you created it. Start with the vertical loops, then the horizontal loops, then the last set of vertical loops.

, Start to mold the head in a bit of a cone, but try to flatten the tip of the head a bit.

, Cut the piece in half.

,,, You will need 2 pairs of 3 legs, 3 on each side of the lobster cousin. Make the small snake just a little smaller or bigger than your middle finger. Then about a quarter down the leg, bend it so it looks like the crayfish is actually walking on something. Once you've done this, repeat this step 5 more times.

, If you aren't sure what the tail looks like, look up lobster or crayfish on Google images to get a good idea to make your model more realistic.

, Thin out the bottom for the start of the claws. Take out a piece from the clay claw so that one side of the claw is smaller than the other side.

Create the monkey fist.,
Create a hangman’s noose using the other side of the paracord opposite your monkey fist.,
Place the monkey fist through the loop’s opening, the hole in the noose.,
Weave a keychain into your paracord.",How to Make a Monkey Fist2," First you’ll need to construct a standard monkey's fist with three strands.


Leave enough slack on the tail to create the additional hangman's noose for the keyring.
Make sure you also have a keyring for your keychain.

, Create an even ""S"" shape with the remainder of the slack.


Now wrap the monkey fist around the S-shaped portion of rope three times, Like you would when making a monkey's fist.

, Take the loose strand and wrap it three times around, moving up towards the hole.


Super glue the wraps to keep a firm hold.
Cut off any excess rope.

, Take a keyring and weave it around the hole you’ve created from the bottom of the monkey fist.


Once you’re done you can attach it to your keys or pass it on to a friend.

Give yourself enough length of paracord with the short tail so that its doesn’t slip out of your monkey fist.
Pull the short end down far enough so the it goes just passed your bottom finger.

, Grab the long tail and wrap it five times around your fingers.


Each successive wrap should be closer to the tips of your fingers.
On the final wrap you will loop around your finger before wrapping the paracord around the back of your fist, then drawing it around toward you.

, Be sure that you maintain the orientation. Keep this same hand positioned so the loops hold.


Alternatively, if you find it easier you can keep the paracord on your fingers. You’ll just have to loop the horizontal turns between your finger and palm.

, Grab the long tail and wrap it perpendicularly around the five loops just created. Do this five times.


Each subsequent horizontal strand should be above the last. When done, you should have five strands of rope looped vertically and cinched loosely by five horizontal wraps.Finish this portion of the fist by wrapping the last loop around the vertical strand.

, Again grab the long tail and tuck it above the five newest horizontal strands facing you, and follow through underneath. Continue with this motion five times. Weave through the top and out the bottom.


You want to wrap your paracord in between your first vertical loops but over and under your horizontal ones.
Finish this portion of the monkey's fist by wrapping the last loop around the original vertical strand.
Insert a large marble. To add an extra weight to your monkey's fist, add a large marble to its center. For the five strand monkey knots, you’ll need something in the core to add to the bulk of the fist.

, Spend a few minutes gently tugging each loop to tighten your knot. Start with the first loop you cast and end with the last.


You have to slowly tighten each part of the paracord in succession.

Decide the length you want your doubled line to be.,
Bring the free end back to the standing line, making a loop.,
Twist the free end around the standing line multiple times.,
Spread the loop slowly apart.,

Wrap the free end around both loop strands 4 times.,
Spit on the knot.,
Pull the free end slowly to tighten the knot.",How to Tie a Bimini Twist," Measure twice this length, then add a little extra.;
, You may wish to wrap the line around something to keep the loop formed, such as a partner's hands, a boat cleat or your own foot or knee.

, Make at least 20 turns or as many as 60. The more turns, the stronger your knot will be.


In general, the lighter the line used in making it, the more turns you should make when tying a Bimini twist.

, This will bunch the twists together. Spread the sides of the loop evenly, so the turns don't overlap each other. Once the twists have gathered about 10 inches (25 centimeters) below the free end of the line, you're ready for the next step.

, Let the free end first relax to a 90-degree angle with the twists, then let it roll over the twists. Keep pressure on the loop while holding one hand over the twists to keep them from unraveling.

, If you're right-handed, this will probably be the right-side strand; if you're left-handed, this will probably be the left-side strand. Draw this knot tight.

, Thread the free end of the line through this new loop to form a locking hitch.

, Your saliva will lubricate the line to prevent the knot from breaking as you draw it up.

, Once the knot comes together, trim off the free end. You may want to apply a drop of super glue or rubber cement to the knot to prevent it from unraveling.

Label your model.,
Write a brief description of each organ’s function.",How to Draw a Model of the Digestive System," You need a piece that is large enough to accommodate a large, detailed drawing, preferably at least 8.5"" by 11”. You can use a piece of plain white paper, lined paper, or graph paper. Graph paper has the added advantage of guide lines to help you size your model appropriately, but plain white paper will allow you to look at the drawing without any other lines hindering its clarity. It is simply a matter of personal preference.;
, You will need a pencil to draw the model initially because a pencil is easy to erase in case you need to make any changes. To polish off the model, it will look nice if you trace over it with a black pen or black marker so that the organs stand out. Finally, to complete it, choose either colored pencils, crayons, or markers. Coloring each organ a different color will help you to differentiate between them.

, This will help your model look professional by making straight lines and smooth curves. A ruler is especially helpful if using white paper that lacks guidelines so that you can draw straight lines to label your model.

, If this drawing is for one of your classes or is something you’ve been studying school, have this material with you. Your teacher might want you to focus on specific parts of the digestive system over others and your school materials will also provide you with valuable information.

, You only need to draw the head and torso. Make sure you are using a pencil rather than a pen so that you can erase if necessary. This outline should take up most of space on your paper. Draw the head in proportion to the body as it would be on a human. It doesn’t have to be a very involved or elaborate outline, a simple circle for the head and somewhat rectangular torso will do. This is just to provide a frame of reference for your digestive model.


Draw the head as a profile rather than straight on to make it easier to show the digestive organs in the head.
If you wish, feel free to be creative and embellish this outline a bit. You can draw eyes and a nose and ears and hair. You could even give your person a name if you feel like it! Just don’t draw over the torso or you will obscure your model.

, You can draw the mouth open as a sideways “v” and add a small curve on the bottom for a tongue and some small squares for teeth on the top. Your first step of digestion is now complete!Digestion begins in the mouth. Salivary glands release saliva to begin breaking down food while you chew. The tongue helps the food to move back in your throat while the teeth break it down.

, At the end of the mouth, draw a small tube that extends straight down into the center of your model’s torso. It should be fairly narrow, about 1/5 the width of your model's neck.


The food moves from the mouth into the esophagus, which carries it down into the stomach. The esophagus is made of muscles that relax and contract to move your food down with a wavelike motion.
If you wish to make your model more advanced, you can include the pharynx. The pharynx is located behind the mouth and moves food into the esophagus. You can feel it when you swallow. In your model, you can simply draw a small diagonal line towards the top of your esophagus and the part above the line can be the pharynx and the part below can be the esophagus.It you wish to make your model more advanced, you can also include the epiglottis. The epiglottis is a small flap just below the pharynx that directs food into the esophagus. If you drew a pharynx, the diagonal line can be the epiglottis.

, At the bottom of your esophagus, draw a small balloon-like organ that is the stomach. It should take up about a third of the width of the torso and be slightly towards the right. Include a small tube going up into the esophagus and a small tube going straight down on the left side of the stomach, which will lead to the small intestine.The stomach helps churn and digest food using gastric juices to help break it down. The food remains in the stomach for about 3-4 hours. At this point it is no longer food, but has an oatmeal-like consistency and is called ""chyme.""

, Draw it towards the left of the stomach and slightly above it. It should be about twice the size of the stomach and look a bit like an elongated triangle with rounded edges.The liver produces bile to help break down fats. While the food doesn’t enter the liver, it goes past it and the chemicals produced in the liver play an important part in digestion.

, Attached to the liver, draw a small nodule called the gallbladder. Draw the gallbladder as a small oval towards the bottom of the liver. It should overlap the liver. To show that the gallbladder goes over the liver, draw the gallbladder with a thick line.The gallbladder stores the bile produced in the liver. It then mixes the bile with the food that passes by, breaking down fats.

, It should be a small carrot-shaped organ that goes behind the stomach. To show that the pancreas is behind the stomach, draw it with a dotted line.The pancreas releases digestive juices that aid in breaking down carbohydrates, protein, and fat as the food leaves the stomach.

, The small intestine is a large curving tube that you can draw as squiggly lines beneath the stomach in the center of the body, taking up about half of the width of the body. Draw it a couple of inches below the stomach because the large intestine will end up going on top of it. The end of the small intestine should be towards the bottom of your paper and towards the left side.


The small intestine is about 18–22 feet (5–7 m) long! This is where the majority of digestion takes place. The small intestine contracts to move food through it while releasing enzymes and absorbing nutrients with villi.
To make a more advanced model, you can distinguish the different parts of the small intestine. The duodenum is a small tube connecting the stomach to the jejunum. The jejunum is where the majority of digestion takes place and is the middle part of the small intestine. The ileum is the last region of the small intestine that connects to the large intestine., It should be located at the end of the small intestine. Simply draw a small pouch at the end of the small intestine towards the left side of your paper.


The appendix is a small pouch-like structure that is thought to have lost its purpose and become more of a liability than an aid in digestion. But it is part of the digestive system and sits where the small and large intestines connect.

, Extending from the end of the small intestine, right above the appendix, draw the large intestine. It should look like two squiggly tubes side by side and should go straight up on the left side of the small intestine, then go across the body below the stomach, and then go straight down towards the bottom of the body on the right. It should form the top three sides of a squiggly, tubelike- square.


The large intestine processes whatever cannot be used in digestion. It absorbs whatever it can, especially water, but then the rest will expelled as waste after about 12 hours.
To make a more advanced model, distinguish between the different parts of the large intestine. The cecum is attached to the appendix and connects it to the ascending colon. The ascending colon goes straight upwards and connects to the transverse colon, which goes across the body. The transverse colon connects to the descending colon, which carries food down into the sigmoid colon, which goes directly to the rectum., At the end of the large intestine is the rectum. The rectum connects the large intestine to the anus. To draw these, simply draw a wide tube that is the rectum leading to a narrower tube that is the anus. This should go to the bottom of your sheet of paper. Congratulations, you have drawn a digestive model!The rectum stores feces until expulsion. The anus then expels waste.

, Now that your model is finished, take a black pen or marker and draw over it to create the final version. This is a nice finishing touch that will make it look more professional and will help it to really stand out. Simply trace over all of the pencil marks that you wish to keep.

, This helps your model to stand out and also helps to distinguish between the organs. For some of the organs, simply by looking at the drawing, it can be hard to tell where one ends and another begins, but if you color code them, it will be clear.


For overlapping organs, try using using lighter and darker shades of the same color. The areas where they overlap will be darker, and the areas where it is a single organ will be lighter.

, Draw a thin line to each organ and write its name at the end of the line, outside of your model. This is great for reference so that you can study your model and learn which organ is which.


If you prefer not to write the names of the organs on your model, you could instead make a key at the bottom or on another piece of paper where you draw a little square of each color and write the name of the organ next to it. This will allow you to quiz yourself on the names of the organs because they won’t be written right next to them.
If you wish to make your model more advanced, you can differentiate the parts of the small intestine. Simply draw a small line towards the beginning of the small intestine to show where the duodenum turns into the jejunum and then draw a small line towards the end of the small intestine to show where the jejunum becomes the ileum.
If you wish to make your model more advanced, you can also differentiate the parts of the large intestine. Simply draw a small line to divide each part. The cecum is attached to the appendix and connects it to the ascending colon. The ascending colon is the part that goes straight upwards. It connects to the transverse colon which goes across the body and is the largest part of the large intestine. The transverse colon connects to the descending colon, which carries food downward. Finally, there is the sigmoid colon which goes directly to the rectum.

, To learn even better, you can write a short description of each organ either with the labels or with your key. This will reinforce their functions and help your model to be very educational. It’s great to learn not just what the organs look like, but also their specific functions.

Choose the design which you want to be made into a model.,
Make sure the design is properly put together, and completed.,
Select the type of material you would like for your model to be made of.,
Map out how you plan on building your model on its structure, track, and supports.,
Be sure to build your model on a material (preferably green or brown to resemble the ground) which will stand firm.

,
Check to make sure all parts of the track and supports are in the model such as supports, and all track segments.,
Depending on the type of roller coaster, the difficulty of applying the lift hill may vary.,
Begin placing 3-4 wires next to each other in the center of the track on the lift hill.

,
Select 2 places at the top and bottom of the track, where the lift will go through to meet under the track.

,
Using great caution, on the side of the first hill begin to thread the wire under the supports, until both ends meet.,
Take 3-4 wires, and begin applying them with glue to the top side of the lift hill.,
The launch sections are usually simple to place on models, since majority of roller coasters with them are flat.,
Apply 2 or 3 wires onto the launching section of the model, up to the hill, inversion, turn etc.,
These types of roller coasters use magnetic mechanisms to launch forward.,
Hydraulic launched roller coaster models require more attention, because the launch section requires dozens of brakes.,
Small metal plates are a great choice, but if you aren't able to get a hold of them, chips of plastic will do.,
Once the lift or launch section is completed, you are now ready to begin painting your model.,
Design a train for your roller coaster, that has a reasonable amount of cars, depending of the size of the model.,
Gather all types of scenery which you purchased earlier, and begin to bond them onto the surface which the model is built on.",How to Design a Roller Coaster Model," Is it the cute children's design, or the big beastly monster that will have everybody screaming with delight and fear?;
, You wouldn't want your work to collapse into a giant pile of garbage.

, Clay, metal, some people even make them out of Popsicle sticks and toothpicks! Create a list of all the materials which you selected in the previous step, and purchase them. These can be found in most arts and crafts stores.

, These categories, are very important for completing the entire project, and supporting the model. Using Plexiglas, layout the shape of the model first with a regular marker. once the layout of the model is properly put down, go over the layout in permanent marker. Now you are ready to begin the building process. Begin to gather all necessary supplies for the model such as glue, the material used for the model itself, paint, and scenery pieces. Take time to carefully put the model together, so that you are sure that it is securely constructed, and strong.

Now the lift hill, or launch sections will be applied.
Lift Hill

,


A wooden roller coaster will be harder to apply, as the chain of the lift must squeeze in between the supports underneath the track.

,,, Glue both together, and allow to dry.


Steel roller coasters are much easier to apply the lift to.

,


Launch sections

, The following will explain the most common forms of launches.


LSM
Linear Synchronous Motor is basically the simplest to apply, and can be found on the recently opened roller coaster Maverick, at Cedar Point.

, As easily as that, you're done!


LIM
Linear Induction Motors are fairly easy to apply, and are often featured inside of the coaster's station. Most launched roller coasters are LIM roller coasters.

, Small pieces of plastic can easily do the job. Begin to gently squirt glue onto the inner portion of the designated track. begin placing each piece on the track individually, and hold each into place for a short amount of time.


Hydraulic

, Kingda Ka, Top Thrill Dragster, and Storm Runner are all hydraulic launched.

, begin applying glue and the plates/plastic onto the track. Make sure the brakes are the closest to being perfectly aligned.


NOTE: Hydraulic launched roller coasters must have a rectangular track.

, The type of paint that you choose isn't the most important thing in the world, but you do need to make a good choice however. Watercolor is acceptable for wood, but less useful for metal. The choice is yours, and yours alone.

, Make sure that it is able to be placed on any part of the track, however, it does not need to roll.

, This final step is important, to grab the eye of your company. without scenery, the roller coaster will often look droll, and the viewers will have a lack of interest.

, Poke one small hole on each side of the window (with a toothpick this time) that is big enough for a rubber band to fit., On the other wall make two windows that are smaller than the last wall., Bend the walls so they connect at the top. Leave the bottom open., If you used clay to build your model's walls, let it dry (usually, a full day is best). If you used cardboard, skip this step., Make the wall with the one window look sharper, more pointed.

Use brown, gray, silver, gold, or yellow.

,, Use the holes you poked earlier of the rubber band. Cut the rubber band in half. Put on the side on in one hole, and the other side of the rubber band in the other hole. Tie a knot in the outside of the clay, so you should have two knots. Make sure not to tighten the rubber band too much, so that it has enough room for the marble., Use a toothpick and red, yellow, and orange paper. Cut the paper in points. Tape or glue the paper to the toothpicks., Use a marble and the rubber band to throw a marble into another clay house. For the toothpicks, you can throw the sharp end at the clay house that is not dry, that way you can have the point of the toothpick stick in the clay."

Prepare your work surface.,
Mark your cut lines.,
Use a steel ruler and blade for straight cuts.,
Score when needed.,
Extend the lines for clean cuts and corners.,
Remove the piece gently.",How to Cut Cardboard or Balsa Wood for Model Making," Make sure the cutting mat is flat to the table top and that there is a nice even, stable surface to work on. Clear a space to the side to make room for cut outs and have a bin nearby to toss small unusable scraps into.
, Using the drawing tools if necessary, lightly draw the desired shape at least a 3/4 inch from the edge of the card. Do not be heavy handed with the pencil - draw the line just so that it can be made out clearly and cleanly erased., The majority of cuts made in model making are straight lines. It is important to know the best way to hold the steel ruler and blade. Place the ruler under the cut line. Put pressure on the ruler with fingers; it should be hard to the card or balsa surface. Use the blade lightly, applying minimal pressure to the material surface with it. Keep the blade perpendicular to the card surface to achieve an even, un-slanted edge., Using the blade lightly in this manner is known as scoring. Repeatedly score along the cut line, using the ruler to guide the blade and keep it straight, until it cuts cleanly through the material. Card and balsa are made of many tiny, thin layers. Scoring allows the blade to cut through each layer cleanly. Applying a lot of pressure to the blade crushes these layers. This, along with uneven pressure application along the cut line, leads to frayed, uneven edges., When scoring along a cut line, begin an inch or so before the cut line starts and keep cutting after it ends i.e. Score a longer, extended line than the one actually desired. As lighter pressure is applied naturally at the beginning and at the end of the cut, an even edge is assured along your cut line. This method also ensures cleaner corners when cutting your perpendicular lines., If cut cleanly and correctly the shape should simply pop out of the card or balsa with a gentle push. If it doesn't, don't force it out. Run the blade in the cut lines again, remembering to extend beyond the lines, to cut any remaining fibers."

,
Wait until dry.",How to Create Basic Model Train Scenery," Draw up scenery ideas on paper using a pencil, so that you can erase the elements that don't work. Ideas for scenery can include countryside, farmland, mountain areas, villages, and even a cityscape.


Consider the season or climate as well as the landscape. This provides you with an opportunity to develop scenery around specific themes, such as a snowy winter, a colorful fall, a bright summer or even a tropical setting.
Look up famous train lines on Wikipedia or train hobbyist sites, for inspiration.;
, Good supplies include grass, trees, buildings, people etc. You will also need a shaker to put the grass into the scenery. If you don't know what to products to buy, ask for help.


Also gather items from around the home that can be repurposed as model train scenery. This requires imagining what could be turned into scenery, such as making seating and tables from toothpaste caps, a mountain from cereal box cardboard or snow scenes from foam.

, Such things as soil, sticks, little rocks etc., depending on your scale of choice and if you think it will work.

, It needs to be strong and flat, so that the train can run on it with ease and it can hold all of the scenery without bending. Size is also a consideration, as you'll need to decide whether or not the scenery can stay in place or needs to be moved to make way for other things in the house.

A wooden board is recommended, as it is strong and not likely to bend. Cardboard would need to be thick or layered and is not likely to be as effective as wood.

, Hobby brands such as Woodland Scenics have a great range of scenic cement but if you want a cheaper option, make your own using PVA glue, detergent, a glass jar and an eye dropper. Mix half glue half water and two drops of detergent in the jar then shake the mix.

Learn the chip denominations.,
Understand the Pass Line Bet and its variations.,
Learn the Field bet.,
Try Place Bets.,
Learn Proposition bets.,
Learn Hardaways.",How to Bet on Craps1," Chips are used in gambling in the place of real money. When you go into a casino you'll be able to buy chips at the table using cash. If you want to get more chips than money you have in cash you'll have to visit the register. Ask an employee at the casino where to buy more chips and they will be happy to direct you.


The chips will be labeled by how much they are. Try to learn which chip is which before you start playing so you don't find yourself fumbling with your bets.;
, The Pass Line Bet is the most common bet in craps. It’s a very easy bet and you can easily get through a whole night of gambling only knowing this one bet. All you have to do is put your chips on the pass line on the table. You'll be able to tell were that is because it will say 'Pass Line' in big letters.


You can make the Pass Line bet on a come out roll, which is designated by a black marker on the table that says ‘off’. If you see a black marker on the table with the word 'off' on it then you'll know you are allowed to make your bet.
You win even money if the come out roll (when the black marker is on the table) is a 7 or an 11 and you lose if it is a 2, 3 or 12.If any other number is rolled that number becomes the ‘point’ and person rolling the dice continues rolling until they hit a 7 or that number that the rolled the first time again. The point is the term for the number you want to roll again. If a 7 comes first, you lose. If the other number comes first, you win.
Even money means that if you put one dollar down you win one dollar.
Do not make a Pass Line bet after the come out roll. Your odds of winning go down.

, Field bets are simple. You can place your chips on any of the word ‘field’ in the center of the table. You win if a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12 is rolled. You lose on all the other numbers. These bets can be made at any time before the subsequent roll.
On many tables 2 and 12 pay you double your money. On some tables 12 pays you triple the money you bet. , By making a Place bet you’re establishing your own ‘point’ in the middle of a roll. Basically this means that you’re choosing a number that you want to appear before a 7. The numbers you can choose are 4, 5, 6, 8 , 9, and 10. If one of these numbers is rolled before the person rolling rolls a 7, then you win.The best odds are on the 6 and the 8., You’ll know if you lost a Proposition bet after the very next throw, so if you’re in no mood to wait around this might be the bet for you. These bets are located in the center of the craps table. You choose one of these bets and hope they occur on the next roll. For example, if you choose Snake Eyes you're betting that two one's will be rolled on the very next roll.


There are a number of proposition bets that change depending on what casino you’re playing in and in what country. Some common bets include Snake Eyes (you win if the shooter rolls a 2), Any seven (you win if a 7 is rolled), and hi-lo (you win if the shooter rolls a 2 or a 12).Proposition bets have very low odds and are not considered a good bet for the player.

, Although many don’t think highly of these bets, it’s certainly another option. You can win if 4, 6, 8, or 10 are rolled in pairs, but you lose when the number rolls not in pairs or the shooter rolls a 7. Rolling in pairs means that the same number has to appear on each of the die. So to get a 6 you would have to roll two threes.

Begin with the bankroll.,
Set a loss limit.,
Set a win goal.,
Accept the fact that gambling is a tough business.,
Practice good money management.",How to Be a Successful Gambler," Before you can use knowledge of the game, money management techniques and eventually discipline, you must begin with bankroll. Most people will scrape up whatever money they can find and think that luck, law of averages or some other illogical theory will make them a winner. It doesn't happen that way.


A small bankroll causes you to play scared and you will make decisions that coincide with your shortage of money. A small bankroll is such a disadvantage that you will make bad moves just to stay in the game instead of beating the house when you encounter a good hot or cold streak.
In craps, for example, let's say a bet calls for taking or laying odds and you don't have enough money to do it. So you merely make the flat bet. The bet wins, but look what your lack of bankroll has done to you! It affected your play and caused you to change an appropriate betting decision because you didn't have the proper bankroll, which could range anywhere from $100 to $5,000 or more depending on your current financial situation.;
,


A loss limit is a limit you set on what your losses will be for a certain day, game or table. It's the limit of what you can comfortably afford to lose. You never bet down to your last chip. A session should last until your win goal is achieved or your loss limit is reached. When you lose that predetermined amount your play is over. Loss limits completely eliminate the possibility that you will ever go broke. A loss limit of at least 50% of your bankroll (and no more than 60%) should be observed. This means I can lose anywhere up to 60% but never more. The reason you take more money with you than you put at risk is to eliminate playing with scared money. If you are tempted to play with the extra money then you have no discipline. You can make the loss limit lower, but never below 25%. You give up your recovery power the more you lower your loss limit. When you are losing you don't have to wait for your exact percentage to be reached to quit. When I'm losing at a certain point and can't get going, I realize I'm in the wrong spot and pack it in at less than my established loss limit.

,


Just as important as a loss limit is the win goal. This is the amount of money you set as the goal you want to reach. This win goal must be set before your first bet, not after you get ahead. It must be set on your starting bankroll, the same as the loss limit. I usually set my win goal at 50% but never more than 60%. That is not to say I can't win more than 50% or 60%. When I reach my goal I will continue playing until I have a loss. I will continue as long as I'm still winning or breaking even. The win goal is only a point you want to reach and then guarantee your profit for the session. Win goals must be small so we can attain them easily and then go for the bigger returns.

, You must accept the fact that gambling is a tough business and that winning small amounts consistently is better than always going for that big hit. You'll have your big days when you least expect them, but the main thing is to minimize losses. If you learn and observe the money management and discipline techniques presented in the numerous Benson systems, you will see how much longer your bankroll will remain active. As long as you have sufficient bankroll allowing you to compete, you're a threat to the casinos!

,


Money management is one of the four key ingredients to winning at gambling. Money management is in essence a system in and of itself. It is your ability to control, manage, preserve and build the bankroll you started with. Every bet you make must be automatic and predetermined. There can be no emotion, no guesswork, no hunches and no depending on luck. Every bet must be logical and calculated, whether you are progressing or regressing. Your ability to properly manage your money must always focus on minimizing losses.
Money management must be practiced at all times. A lot of gamblers practice good money management until they get ahead. That is when greed takes over, after people get ahead. Greed pushes them to try to win huge amounts. Greed replaces good money management and causes the player to make dumb bets. Greed erodes the small profits that had been accumulated and leads to disaster. It has happened to all of us. How often have you been ahead in a casino and instead of quitting a winner you gave your profits back to the house along with your original starting bankroll?

Understand the house edge.,
Try a free odds bet during the Pass Line Bet.,
Avoid Hardaway and Proposition bets.,
Place on the 6 or 8 to win.,
Avoid field bets.,
Finished.

",How to Bet on Craps2," The house edge is the casino’s average profit on any bet. For the basic Pass Line bet the house edge is 1.41. The idea is that you’ll lose on average 1.41 % of whatever you’ve wagered when you play this bet. This is actually one of the best odds in craps. However, in a free odds bet there is no house edge. The odds aren’t stacked against you. , Once the ‘point’ has been established you can do what is called ‘ taking the odds’. Remember that the point is the number that you want rolled before a 7.


This means placing additional chips behind the pass line, sort of like doubling down in blackjack. Free odds is the only bet in a casino where the odds aren’t against you.There is no house edge because if you win the bets are paid at true odds. This mean that if there is a 3-1 chance of winning your bet you’ll get paid 3 dollars for every 1 dollar you bet. Most bets don’t pay true odds.

, The house edge on Hardaways is between 9 and 11 percent and the house edge on Proposition bets can go as high as 17 percent. Although they might be fun to try now and then when you’re feeling lucky, you need to understand the odds are stacked against you.


These bets are known as ‘sucker bets’.

, If you want to switch it up between pass line bets and free odds bets, try placing your chips on the 6 or the 8 to win.You place your chips on one of these numbers on the table before the roll.


If you place to win the house edge is only 1.52 %, which is only .10 % worse odds than the Pass Line bet.

, There are sixteen ways to win a field bet and twenty ways to lose. Those are bad odds right there.


Although you may be drawn to these field bets because of the double money being paid out on 2 and 12, it is still a bad idea. The payout might seem enticing but the odds are far worse than 50/50 that you’ll end up winning.This isn’t a terrible bet. The house is only 2.77 %. However there are certainly better bets that you could make.,"

Cut the façade out of 5mm feather board with a sharp scalpel blade.,










Create a punch matrix the size of a single brick, to emboss the surface in the foam.,










Emboss the bricks.,










Paint the façade.,










Apply two coats of enamel paint.,





Paint the brickwork with a wide brush and near dry paint, much like a quick dry brushing.,










Now add mortar between the bricks.,





Shade and define the bricks.,





Apply an aging effect to the model's brickwork.,






Enhance the façade with small details.",How to Create Brickwork for Small Scale Model Buildings," Draw the positions of windows and doors very precisely and lightly incise their openings using the scalpel. Once it's done, peel off the feather board from the side to be embossed by slipping the sharpened blade between the cardboard and the foam at one of the corners. Hold the sheet firmly with a large metal rule and then take off the cardboard, avoiding any possibility of the foam being torn away.
, Make the punch matrix from an old brush with no more bristles - for 1:72 scale bricks, use an old fine No.3 brush. Hollow out the ferrule (the metal band that goes around the bristles) and shape the open edge to the desired size with a pair of small pliers. Then sharpen and refine the edge with a flat file to obtain a perfect rectangle., Begin without applying too much pressure into the foam. Do this in a staggered way using the metal rule as a guide for the embossing tool.

To give a more realistic aspect for eroded brickwork, stamp deeper into the foam. This will create eroded joints in the brickwork's mortar. You can also carve off missing bricks or simulate fissures. Make these tricky operations in 1:72 scale with a refined point of a needle.

, Paint the base of the façade as well as small details like wooden and metal lintels. At the same time build and add fittings like shutters, gutters, down pipes, grilles, and doors using styrene, brass tube, and copper wire., For a good, basic paint, use Humbrol Camouflage Grey 28. Apply it with a wide brush so as to cover all the recesses. The foam is porous and will fully absorb the first coat of paint, so you do need a second coat. When the paint is dry, apply a generous overall wash of acrylic matt black.

After 48 hours, when the foam is tough enough, gently sand it with 400-grade paper. This polishes the surface and gives the bricks a texture true to scale. Carefully wipe off the dust from the recesses with a soft wide brush.

, Generally, it's best to use two shades of red - Burnt Sienna 411 and English Red 339. Mix the paints with matt black or simply use these two colors to achieve the nuances of real bricks., Simulate the mortar by applying white pigments onto the surface of the bricks with an old wide brush. Blow away any excess pigment, and then embed whatever remains into the joints with your fingers. Finally, clean the bricks with a slightly dampened rag to remove excess pigment., Re-use the two red paints from above, but this time apply each shade alternatively to each brick with a fine No.2 size brush. This step will give infinitely more shades to the bricks and give them a definitive appearance., Show the places where rainwater or humidity have eroded the mortar in the courses and given the bricks a greenish aspect. To do this, apply black pigments into the mortar courses with a fine No.0 brush. Add light green pigments on the appropriate surfaces. Blow off the excess of powder and brush Sienna Earth-coloured pigments onto the raised parts of the bricks., Paint and age the final details you added using a micro painting technique, which gives a realistic old touch to the brickwork."

Research slot payouts.,
Know your limit.,
Make a long-range plan.,
Have a few back-up plans in place.,
Pocket any winnings you earn.,
Join the club.",How to Beat the Slots1," There are a number of websites that will tell you the payout percentages of slot machines at different casinos. While the casinos do not make this information available to the average player, some insiders get access to this information and publish it online or in specialty magazines and newsletters.


Percentages can range anywhere from 80% to 98% and spell out your best chances of success. Choose the slot machines with the highest percentage of payout to increase your odds of winning.;
, Set a ""lose limit"" and a ""double my money"" amount before you enter the casino. If you're winning, stop when you have doubled your initial amount. If you're losing, stop when you reach your lose limit.

, If you'll be vacationing in a gambling town or spending several days to play, it's best to figure out how you'll budget your funds to cover the length of your visit. Here's what you can do:


Decide how many days you'll make it to the casino and how long you'll gamble during each session.
Divide your total bankroll by the number of days and then divide that daily allowance by the number of hours you plan to play each day. This will tell you how much you can afford to lose per hour.
For example: You arrive in Atlantic City with a $2000 bankroll and plan to stay for five days. That allows you to wager $400 per day. You decide that you want to play a total of four hours per day. This means you can afford to lose $100 per hour.

, You may be surprised at how quickly you can go through your bankroll by playing the slots. And with ATMs conveniently located throughout the casino floor, you may find yourself spending more than you intended on your quest to strike it rich.


Bring a pre-determined cash amount with you to gamble and leave credit and debit cards at home or in your hotel room to reduce your risk of overspending.
Buddy up. Make a pact with a friend that you'll stop each other from spending more than an agreed-upon amount.
Play with coins. Playing with coins rather than feeding bills into the machine will extend the time of your play.

, Play only with the money from your initial bankroll; that way, you won't walk away empty-handed.

, Join the slot clubs if you are playing at a land-based casino, or take advantage of bonus money offerings that online services give to their loyal customers. These offers are based on how many coins you play in the slot machines or your rate of play.


Compare the benefits of different casinos or sites and choose the casino that offers the best benefits or freebies for your level of play.
Some casinos even give some of these points back as cash, making your gambling dollar stretch even further.
Be sure you always have your club card inserted in your slot machine before you spin. You want to get credit for every bit of your play time.

Play video keno.,
Keep the progressive jackpot in mind.,
Try packaged keno.",How to Play Keno," These are generally found at keno lounges in casinos. The numbers on the card (1 through 80) match the numbers on balls in the aerated keno machine.


Certain places or lotteries have different versions of their cards. Some have special bonus or jackpot cards, in addition to their regular cards. Ask if more than one type is available.;
, Each number you select is called a keno spot and the keno card is arranged with 8 rows and 10 columns of numbers. The card will specify how many numbers you're allowed to choose.


Some cards will allow you to choose anywhere from 1 to 10 numbers, while others will say anything up to 20 is okay. The more numbers you bet, the same the ticket costs, so you might as well bet more!
Some will have a ""quick pick"" section where you can have the computer do it for you. The odds of winning remain the same.

, Indicate your choices on your keno card. If you bet $1 on your selected numbers and want to play 7 games, that's $7. Obviously, the more money you bet, the more money you can win.


You can wager as little as $1 on a single bet and usually up to $20, but it all depends on where you're playing.
Players can wager on groups of numbers within the same game using a way bet. This tends to get complicated because you have to pick combinations from groups of numbers, making it difficult to keep track of your picks. We'll cover that in the next section.

, An electronic ticket copy of your card will be issued back to you so you can follow along with the games as they are announced. Be sure that everything is correct before you hand it over!

, Most modern keno machines use computer software to generate winning numbers. The numbers are then displayed electronically on keno boards throughout the establishment. If you're playing a handful of games, you can wander around and not miss a thing.


The number of the game you're playing will appear somewhere on your ticket and on the screen (usually in the bottom corner). Make sure they match up!
See if the numbers you selected on your ticket match the numbers the keno machine pulled. If you have a match, you win. How much you win will depend on how many numbers you matched and how much you wagered.
The payout depends on the number of keno tickets in each game. In some instances a single dollar can net a payoff of tens of thousands. Ask a keno worker for an explanation if you're unsure. Some keno parlors also utilize a special payoff for selecting a bonus number.

Every house is different; there is no average. But payouts tend to range from below 70% to around 80%.For the record, that's not good. You want it to be as close to 100% as possible.



, You'll have to submit your electronic keno card for verification. It'll be pretty clear that you've won if your numbers are on the screen! This is also when you throw up your arms and start shouting -- that gets them to come to you right away.


And then play the next game! It's probably about 4 minutes later. That's the best part about keno -- it's constantly going non-stop.

, This is where it starts to get a little complicated. It's where combinations enter the mix. Here's an example:


You choose six numbers.
You circle them in two groups of three.
On the side of the ticket, you mark ""2/3"" and ""1/6"".

This means you want to bet $3. $1 is on one group of three, $1 is on the second group of three, and $1 is on all six. Think of it like horse racing. Hitting the winner is good; hitting win, place, and show is better.



, The numbers can overlap in combinations, too. Let's say you have a group of 2, a group of 3 and a group of 4. Well, that's three groups right there. But then you can also have a group of 5 (3 and 2), a group of six (2 and 4), a group of 7 (3 and 4), and a group of 9 (all the numbers). At $1, what would this cost? $7. Keeping it spicy!


Remember to write on the side of your ticket what you want! Otherwise your keno writer might get a little confused.

, When a number is circled all by its lonesome, it is ""king."" It can then get inserted into combinations. Let's take that first example of 2/3 and 1/6 -- add the king on top to all combinations at it's 2/4 and 2/7. The king joined each group of three and is added to the total, equaling 7 numbers in final.

, Many state lotteries or casinos have some type of bonus in all keno games. Sometimes it's called a bull's eye, sometimes a booster, sometimes just a bonus. But you'll know it when you see it. It's another number and if it comes up, you win big. It does cost a bit more to bet on, of course; this can be anywhere from $1 to double your wager.


The bonus varies, too. It can be anywhere from double the winnings to 20x the normal rate. Ask the keno work at your station how it works.

, Some online keno games allow you to single bet up to 40 numbers. But you can also play it on screens at casinos and various other locations now. The payout tends to be a bit better, but you also play faster, so it sort of evens out.But with video keno, you play at your own pace.


You select your numbers just by touching the screen -- it's super easy. And sometimes there are even keno video games at the nickel level. Make sure you know what your minimum bet is before you get started.

, If there is one, of course. Many casinos offer a progressive jackpot -- if no one hits it big, it keeps growing and growing. It can even get high enough to where the payout is over 100%! But since everything is so random, it's hard to predict anything. However, if you see one, it can be a lot of fun to play!

, This is the same thing as ""buying in bulk."" The more games you buy, the cheaper they are. Some areas offer ""packaged"" keno, where you can buy, say, 60 games at a quarter a piece. The games you play can then be whenever you want, so long as you give your ticket to a keno retailer beforehand. Otherwise it'd be too good to be true!

Choose machines with the smallest jackpots.,
Play the highest denomination possible.,
Play max credits.,
Bet the maximum amounts if you choose to play progressive slots.,
Play in a premium location.,
Play to suit your style.",How to Beat the Slots2," The bigger the jackpot the harder it is to hit, so you're better off choosing a machine with a smaller jackpot.


Double check the machine's maximum jackpot. Two machines might look exactly the same, but one may pay out a 1,500 credit jackpot and the other 10,000 credits, so be aware of the maximum you can win on your machine.

, Play the highest denomination slot that you can afford, as these machines pay back at a higher percentage. In other words, dollar machines pay more than quarter machines, which pay more than nickel machines, which pay more than penny slots.

, Most machines only pay bonuses and progressive jackpots when the maximum credits are bet. Even on non-progressive machines, the jackpot payout for the maximum credit bet is typically markedly higher than on any other level.


Since you can't win a progressive jackpot if you don't bet the maximum, it makes sense to spend your money wisely. Most casinos have several banks of progressive machines, each with different payout percentages and jackpot amounts. Always choose the combination of highest payout percentage and biggest jackpot amount.

, You cannot win the jackpot if you don't. Look around the casino for the biggest payout in your betting range. There are oftentimes several banks of progressive machines, each with different payout percentages and jackpot amounts. Always choose the combination of highest payout percentage and biggest jackpot amount.

, Machines that pay out more frequently (known as ""loose"" machines) are typically located in high visibility areas to attract maximum attention when players win and entice others to play.

, Some people believe the odds are better on the simpler machines with a single payout line. Others gravitate toward machines with bonus features, such as free spins, bonus rounds or extra features for the right combination on a payout line. Remember that luck plays a major role in your slot success, so while your strategy is to win, you want to have fun while you play.

Pick a reel-spinning slot or a video slot.,
The symbols on a reel-spinning slot machine include brightly colored images of fruits such as lemons and cherries, numerals or shapes such as diamonds, hearts and bells.,
Some players like the reel-spinning slots with the pull handle because of their retro feel, but they can be difficult to find as more casinos modernize their slot selection.

,
Despite the difference in style, there is no difference in the payout between reel-spinning and video machines of the same denomination.,
Choose a machine with a fixed or a progressive jackpot.,
Place your bet.,
Pick your paylines.,
Familiarize yourself with the rules for the machine before you sit down.",How to Beat the Slots3," A reel-spinning slot machine typically features three or five reels or cylinders on which there are imprinted symbols as well as spaces left blank. There are 22 symbols/blanks or ""stops"" on each reel. Matching these symbols in certain combinations lead to a winning payout. Video slots may have up to seven reels, each representing three rows of five symbols. Video slots have 32 to hundreds of virtual stops on their reels.

, Video slot machines may use some of these traditional images but are likely to feature characters or symbols from popular TV shows, cartoons or movies or images of popular actors, singers or sports figures.

,, Both are controlled by a program called a random number generator (RNG) that determines the outcome of each spin and makes it impossible to determine the outcome of future spins.

, There are two main categories for progressive slots machines: “top payout” and “progressive”. With top payouts, that’s how much you could stand to win for “regular” best machine combinations. Some slot machines are known as ""flat-top"" machines; they have a fixed, maximum payout. Progressive machines feature a meter that indicates a jackpot that gets progressively higher. These machines are linked together and the amount of the jackpot is determined by how much they're being used. The more people play them, the higher the jackpot amount.


Among flat-top machines, the overall odds are generally similar no matter how high the jackpot is.
Sometimes a bank of progressive machines in a single casino are linked together. In other cases, the machines are linked throughout the entire state, which explains why they feature such a high jackpot amount.
Because of the number of people all vying for that jackpot, your odds of winning at a progressive machines are lower. That goes not only for the jackpot amount, but the odds of winning smaller amounts are lower as well.

, To play a slot machine, you must first insert bills or coins. When you insert your money, the equivalent amount of credits is displayed. Your next move depends on the type of machine you've chosen.


On reel-spinning slots, push a button marked ""play one credit"" until you've reached the number of coins you wish to play. Then hit the ""spin reels"" button or pull the handle. If you want to bet big, you can hit a button marked ""play max credits,"" which will play the maximum coins allowed on that machine.
On video slots, you must push two buttons to complete your bet. First, push one button for the number of paylines you want to activate and then push a second button to chose how many credits you want to bet per line. Video slots generally have five reels spinning on the screen.

, Your payout is determined by a winning combination of symbols that appear on what's called the payline. On classic reel spin machines, only one payline is displayed on the face of the machine, but video machines offer more paylines.


Modern multi-line slots may offer 9, 15, 25, 50 and even more paylines.
Paylines can be represented horizontally, vertically, diagonally and even in zigzags. Look closely to see what lines you have bet and check carefully as it can be difficult to tell if you have a winning payline.

, If you don't understand them, ask an attendant or call customer service if you are playing online. You need to understand what combinations will win you money, especially the jackpot.

Get the necessary materials.,
Decide which side you want to weight.,
Drill straight into the die.,
Insert a small nail or lead pellets.,
Add glue to seal the weight.,
Paint over the weight.",How to Load Dice1," The most traditional way of loading a die involves simple tools and supplies that you can get at any home repair store or hardware outlet. Try to get a big package of dice so that you'll be able to try a few different techniques to get it right. It's also good to have:


Power drill
Small gauge drill bit (no larger than the size of each dot on the die)
Small gauge nail or lead pellets
Super glue
Paint or white-out
Several dice for weighting;
, The most straightforward way of ""gimmicking"" or ""loading"" a die is by drilling into the plastic and weighting it on one side to try to make that end land down more often. So you need to pick which side you want to come up most often, and weight the opposite side.


Any number that you know and your opponents don't know will be effective, but if you're going to gimmick some dice for the purposes of playing craps, you might want to weight them so that six comes up most often, or else you might want to weight another number to ensure that other rollers will crap out. It's up to you.

, You want to hollow out as little of the plastic as possible, to avoid drawing attention to the gimmick. Ideally, a drill bit should be used that’s no larger than 1/16th of an inch. You can use it to gently open up the hole and clear space for the weight.


Clamp the die in a vise to protect your fingers. Never try to hold the die while you drill into it at the same time.
Drill into the center of the die, staying as straight as possible to avoid drawing attention to your hole. Leave the edges smooth so you can easily pass the weight through it.

, A common weight is a thin nail or pin, used to load one side of the die. It needs to match the diameter of the hole, usually about a sixteenth of an inch.


If you use a nail, take wire cutters or small bolt cutters and snip some weight off the end after you've inserted it into the die. If you use tiny bearings, push them in and use a needle to set them deeper into the die. It should be as close to the edge as possible though, or you'll ruin the effect of the weight.
Go back over the end with some sandpaper or a metal file to smooth it out. If any of the metal extends past the end of the die, you need to smooth it off. Nothing will get you caught more quickly than some rough metal sticking out.

, Use a small amount of super glue to seal up the end of the hole that you just loaded. You'll need a small amount of super glue to plug the hole and make sure the weight doesn't come back out.


After adding glue, let it dry thoroughly and go back over it again with fine-grain sandpaper to smooth out any little bumps. Use your finger to feel the other dots on the die and make the gimmicked spot match it.

, Use a little bit of dark ink, Sharpie, or gun-black to color in the fake spot that you've weighted. Make sure it matches the other spots as closely as possible. Coloring over the weight will help make or break the trick. Don't get caught in your gimmick by messing up the color and getting it on the white part of the die. Be especially careful to keep your coloring in the lines of the dot, making it evenly marked and uniform.


The dots on standard dice are usually shiny and pure black. India ink is likely the smartest choice for the job. Use a new, fine-tipped brush and maintain a very sharp point. If you want, you could even outline the dots with very thin strips of masking tape, to keep ink from getting on the white part of the die.

",How to Bet a Point Spread," You might be interested in several games, in which case you can ask for a rundown. In football and basketball, the point spread is the main line, so that’s the first thing the clerk will give you after giving you the favorite team. In any other sport you will have to specifically ask for this line (be it the run-line in baseball, the puck-line in hockey or the goal-line in soccer).;
, This is a good idea if you need time to study them, or so you can compare them later on and learn how the lines moved during the day.

, You might have already asked for the lines a minute before or seen them online, in which case you can place your bet immediately. But if you’re just getting started, you might want to take a minute to study them. Thank the clerk and hang up. This is what the clerk said and what it meant:


Sport

a) Football
b) Basketball
c) Baseball
d) Hockey
e) Soccer

What the sportsbook clerk said
a) Packers seven and forty-seven and a half
b) Spurs seven and forty-seven and a half.
c) Mets one and a half dog twenty.
d) Bruins one and a half dog thirty-five.
e) Arsenal two and a half flat.
What he (or she) meant
a) Packers -7 points. The total is 47.5 points.
b) Spurs -7 points. The total is 147.5 points.
c) Mets -1.5 runs and if you bet the dog you must risk $120 for every $100 you wish to win.
d) Bruins -1.5 goals and if you bet the dog you must risk $135 for every $100 you wish to win.
e) Arsenal -2 goals and you will risk the same amount (most probably $110 to win $100—this varies from sportsbook to sportsbook) if you take the favorite or the dog.
What it means: The point spread will take away points from the final score of the favorite team or add them to the underdog to even out your chances of winning.
For example, say the Packers are having an amazing season, but the Jets aren’t. A line for a game between the two might look something like this: Packers -10 on the point spread and 50.5 on the total. Now, you know the Packers are going to win the game, but you’re sure they won’t win by more than five points. This is when you can take the Jets +10. This means that if the Packers win by nine points or less, you would win your bet on the Jets.
For example, if you take the Jets +10 $110/100 (risking $110 to win $100) and the score at the end of the game is Packers win 24 to 18, the score for betting purposes would actually be Jets win 28 to 24, and you would be $100 richer.





, Once you decide what you want: either the favorite minus the points or the dog plus the points you let the clerk know by saying the team you want and the amount. For example: “I want the Jets for eighty.” This lets the clerk know you want the Jets plus the ten points and you’re willing to risk eighty-eight dollars in order to win $80. (You would win this bet if the Jets win the game or lose by nine points or less.)

, The clerk will ask you at this point if you need anything else. You can get more lines, or ask about your balance. If you’re done, say so, and the clerk will proceed to read your play (or plays) back to you. It is very important to listen to the read back carefully. Make sure you’re getting what you asked for (team, line and amount); otherwise you might end up with a play you didn’t want.

, If the readback is correct, confirm your play by giving the sportsbook clerk your account number again. He will thank you and end the call.

Place aluminum foil on a cookie tray.,
Heat a toaster oven or convection oven to roughly 200 °F (93 °C).,
Place the die in the oven with the number you want up.,
Test the dice a few times.",How to Load Dice2," If you don't want to drill, a quicker method is melting. To make sure you don't get smelly, stuck-on plastic all over your oven, line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil to keep everything safe. Do this in a well-ventilated area with the windows open, and keep close watch on the die while you do this. It's easy to go too far, so you need to watch closely.


Another easy way of weighting the die is to melt it gently, just enough to shift the weight slightly onto the bottom of the die and change the effect of the rolling. You have to be extremely careful to avoid melting the die too much and changing the appearance of the die. It won't take much just to soften the plastic, widen the base of the opposite side, and land more regularly on that side.

, Keeping the temperature at a low setting will help ensure that you don't overdo it. 200 degrees isn't much, but it'll be plenty to heat and soften the plastic and change the shape of the die slightly.


Do not use the microwave. It will not melt the die the way you want, and you're more likely to warp the plastic and make it look funny. It's also dangerous. Avoid microwaving dice.

, Keep a close watch on the die and remove it before 10 minutes have passed. Remove the die using gloves, and dump it immediately into icy water to set the plastic and make sure it won't continue melting.


If you notice any bubbling or see that the shape has changed slightly, remove the die immediately and try it again, going for slightly less time. You should ideally remove the die before you notice any change, so it might take some practice runs. Keep the room properly ventilated. Inhaling melting plastic fumes is hazardous, and you need to be extremely careful that you only melt the plastic but don't burn it and start a fire.

, Go for a few rolls and test your new gimmicked die. If you're more consistently landing on the side you want to land on, you've got a good loaded die. If it's not working like you want, you can try to re-melt it, or you can just start over with a new die.

Drill out several dots.,
Hollow out the die carefully.,
Plug all the holes but one.,
Drop a few lead weights into the center of the die.,
Mix paraffin and coconut oil.,
Seal the last hole.,
Palm the die to cheat.",How to Load Dice3," If you want to get really elaborate by making a die that is adjustable, you have to open up the inside of the die without visibly altering the outside. This will take some practice and some patience to get it right, but it's possible if you start by drilling out several of the holes on different sides of the die, using a thin drill bit.


Make as few holes as possible. If you're struggling to scrape out the interior, however, you will need to make several holes. In that case, it may be better to drill out all the holes, so at least they'll be uniform.

, The best tool for hollowing out a die is a dentist’s pick or another small poking device. Carefully and gently scrape out the interior of the die a little bit at a time. If you can work the pick into each hole, scrape out as much as possible from each different angle. Eventually you should be able to hollow out the entire interior.


From each angle go as deep as you can and try to scrape out as much as you can. You won't be able to hollow out the entire die from one side, but you can get it all by approaching it from several directions.

, Smear some super glue over each hole and let it dry. This will help contain the weight you insert. Don’t worry if the glue makes the die look different. You can smooth it up later using fine-grained sandpaper and some care. Now, you're just trying to get the weight correct.

, Fit a few small bearings into the middle of the die. You want to get the final weight of the die to match the basic weight of a normal die, so keep a normal die on hand to compare while you're working. The average handler won't notice subtle differences, but you don't want your weighted die to feel hollow and fake.


Insert a few small lead bearings into the open hole. Feel the heft of it and add more if necessary. They'll be rattling around on the inside, but don't worry about the sound. You'll take care of that with the next step.

, You're going to fill the die with a mixture of waxes that will be hard enough to secure the bearings and hold them still at a cool temperature but soft enough that you'll be able to melt it with body heat–the heat from your clenched hand. The ideal mixture is paraffin and coconut oil, both commonly available and relatively cheap. You will mix them together to form a solid but meltable mixture that you can create quickly at home.


In a pan melt your paraffin to liquid. Add 80% more coconut oil to the wax and mix thoroughly in a bowl. Let harden.
Test the consistency of the mixture by holding some in your hand and letting it melt back to liquid. If it’s too difficult to melt, add more coconut oil. If it’s too easy, add more paraffin.When you're satisfied with the consistency fill the die with the wax mixture.

, Go back over the hole thoroughly with glue, taking care to fix up any cracks, gaps, and other little leaks that might have resulted from your drilling. This is a much messier process than the single-hole method, so it'll take some work to clean everything up, color it, and make it look like a normal die. Spend some time making it look right.

, When you’re ready to use the die, hold it firmly with the side you want facing up. The wax will slowly melt, allowing the weights to sink to the opposite side, weighting the die. Let it sit on the counter, or put it in the fridge for a few minutes to reset the wax and keep the die weighted.

Spin a die.

,
Analyze the result: if favorable, spin the second die; if not, read step 3.

,
Grip the die between the thumb of the left hand and middle finger of the right about two or three cm off the table.

,
Practice the next part a lot.,
Slowly wind up the die to the point where it comes to the tip of the palm, then thrust the thumb out toward the pre-thrown die.,
Never weight a die before trying this.",How to Load Dice4,",,, It doesn't come naturally.

, If the die connects well, the other one should spin end-over-end or go off the table. In this case just say, ""That's no good. I'll roll again.""

, It really stuffs up the entire process.

Grab a standard deck, a few friends, and some scratch paper.,
Play ""tricks"" by attempting to ""follow the suit"" of the card that led.,
Avoid taking tricks by trying not to play the highest-ranking card during the trick.,
Avoid Hearts and the Queen of Spades.,
Calculate your score at the end of each hand.,
Be aware of common rule variations.",How to Play Hearts2," Hearts is a versatile game - it can be played by 3-7 players, though 4 is the standard number. Hearts uses a normal 52 card deck (minus Jokers). Other than your cards, all you'll need is some scratch paper (or something else to write on) and a pen to record your score. Players are all dealt the same number of cards - usually by having one player deal in a circle until no cards remain.











The first dealer is either pre-determined or selected via some other method -- for example, having players draw cards at random, the lowest being the first to deal. The deal proceeds to the original dealer's left at the start of each hand.
Note that, if you're playing with a number of people other than 4, you may have leftover cards at the end of dealing. These are called ""hole"" cards. Once you're sure everyone has the same number of cards, remove the leftovers from the game without looking at them and shuffle them back into the deck before the next hand.

, In Hearts, play proceeds in a circle, each player playing one card from his or her hand at a time, face up. The cards from one such ""cycle"" are called a ""trick"". In Hearts terminology, whoever plays the first card of a trick is said to ""lead"" the trick. This person can play whatever card s/he wants (with exceptions - see point below). The players following this leader must play cards of the same suit as the leading card if they have them - if not, they may play cards of another suit.









The one exception to the lead card being able to be anything is that the lead card cannot be a Heart until Hearts have been ""broken"". Hearts are broken when a player is unable to follow the suit of a lead card and plays a Heart instead.

, After all players have played a card, the highest-ranking card that matches the suit of the card that led the trick ""wins"" and the person who played that card takes all the cards in the trick and keeps them face down in a pile in front of him or herself until the end of the hand. Whoever wins the trick leads the next trick - play proceeds in this way until all players have no more cards in their hands. As we'll see below, usually, you don't want to win tricks.









In each suit, the cards are ranked from the Ace (the highest value) on down, with 2 being the lowest value. For example, the Ace of Clubs is the most powerful Club, followed by the King of Clubs, the Queen, and so on.

So, for example, if the person who led the trick played a Queen of Diamonds and we have an Ace of Diamonds and a Five of Diamonds in our hand, we have to play one of these Diamonds. The Ace will win the hand for us because it's the highest card of the same suit as the lead card, while the Five won't beat the Queen. In most cases, since we usually don't want to win hands, we'll probably play the Five.



, In Hearts, like in golf, all players want to gain the lowest amount of points possible - whoever has the fewest points at the end wins. The cards that are worth points are the Hearts and the Queen of Spades . These are the only point cards. All other cards are worth no points, so you may collect these without fear. Since it's difficult to tell whether another player will play a Heart or the Queen of Spades after you, usually, you want to avoid taking tricks altogether, even if no point cards have been played yet.









There is one important exception to the goal of avoiding points. If, in a given hand, a player manages to collect ALL the points from that hand (this is called ""Shooting the Moon"" or ""Running""), s/he receives a score of 0 and all other players receive 26 points. So, if a player is losing badly and has collected every point card in the hand so far, he or she may risk an even-worse score by trying to collect every Heart and the Queen of Spades. If he or she can do it, he or she will have scored a major victory, but if one of his/her opponents gets just one of the point cards, he or she will be left with a bad score for the hand.

, When all players have played their last card, the hand is over. Players look through the cards from the tricks they took during the hand and calculate a score for the hand based on the number of point-scoring cards they took. As noted above, each Heart is worth 1 point and the Queen of Spades is worth 13 points. The players add their score from the most recent hand to their cumulative score from previous hands and, finally, the person to the left of the last dealer deals a new hand.











Play continues in this fashion until one player reaches some agreed-upon number of points (often 100 points). When one (or more) players reach this point limit, the game stops and whichever player has the fewest points wins.

, The rules outlined above constitute the most ""basic"" version of Hearts. Though these rules are accurate and perfectly acceptable for play, in reality, many variations on these standard rules exist. You may or may not want to incorporate these into your game. Listed below are some of the most common rule variations.









After being dealt cards, each player passes three cards of his choosing to another player. Usually, in a 4-person game, players pass to the player to the right at the start of the first hand, then to the left on the second hand, then across on the third, then refrain from passing on the fourth, then repeat this cycle.
The player who is dealt the Two of Clubs (or is passed it) starts each hand, rather than the player to the left of the dealer. This player must lead with the Two of Clubs as her first play of the game.
The ""hole"" cards leftover after dealing the deck out to a number of players other than 4 are given (face down) to whoever takes the first heart.
On the first trick of each hand, no point card may be played.
In some variations, if a player shoots the moon, he has the option to subtract 26 points from his score rather than adding 26 points to the other players'. This is a good idea if adding 26 points to everyone else's scores would put one or more players over the score limit, ending the game and causing the shooter to lose.

"
"
Start the game by passing your highest cards.,
Begin playing, following suit when you can.,
If you lead a trick, try to play a card that is likely to be beaten.,
If you don't lead a trick, follow suit with a card lower than the lead card.,
Try to ""short-suit"" yourself.,
Only try to shoot the moon when you have a reasonable chance of doing so.",How to Play Hearts3," After the cards have been dealt, each player looks at their cards and then chooses three cards to pass to an opponent. When everyone has selected their three cards, everyone passes at the same time. Usually, since you want to avoid taking tricks, it's a smart idea to pass your highest-ranking cards to another player. This minimizes your trick-winning potential.









Another passing strategy is to ""short-suit"" yourself (see below).
Passing direction changes every hand. On the first hand, pass to the player left of you. On the second hand, pass to the right. On the third hand, pass to the player across from you. On the fourth hand, no cards are passed. At the fifth hand, the cycle starts again.

There may be different house rules on passing depending on where you play.



, The player with the Two of Clubs must lead with this card as the first play of the game. Each player after the lead must follow suit if he can. If a player cannot follow suit (on any trick), they may play a card in any other suit. A player wins a trick when he or she plays the highest card of the suit that is led. The winner of the trick leads the next.











On the first trick of each hand, no points (Hearts or the Queen of Spades) may be played, even by a player who can't follow suit. Such a player must play a card of a non-scoring suit.

, It's ""tricky"" to have to lead a trick. Unless you're starting a hand off by leading with the Two of Clubs, most of your cards are valid possibilities, so it can be difficult to decide how to proceed. When in doubt, go low - play a low-ranking card from a suit that hasn't been played heavily in the current round. Odds are that most, if not all of the players will have cards of this suit in their hands. If you play a low-ranking card, most of the time, someone will be forced to play a card of the same suit that's higher, ensuring that you don't take the trick.









There are exceptions to this generality - for instance, if you're trying to shoot the moon, you may want to play high cards, or if you've been keeping track of the cards being played and think it's likely that everyone has at least one card of a certain suit, you may want to lead high. You also may be forced to lead high as you run out of cards.
As noted above, you can't lead with a Heart until Hearts are broken when a player lacks a card in the suit that has been led, so he or she throws down a heart instead. As also noted above, most common Hearts variations don't allow Hearts to be broken on the first trick. The exception to these rules is when a player has voided all other suits and possesses only Hearts.

, If someone else leads the trick and you have one or more cards that are the same suit as the lead card, you have to follow suit. If you can, play a card lower than the lead card so that you won't take the trick. This is especially important if other players have yet to play their cards, as you have no way of knowing whether they'll play hearts or the Queen of Spades, leaving you to pick up the points









If you don't have cards of the same suit as the lead card, you usually want to either play a point card so that whoever wins the trick will gain points or get rid of a high-value off-suit card so that you're less likely to win tricks in the future.

, Generally, it's a good idea to get rid of all of the cards of one or more suits in your hand as quickly as possible. This is called ""short-suiting"" yourself. Once you've eliminated all the cards of one suit from your hand, you'll be able to play whatever you want when other players lead with cards of this suit. This can give you an opportunity to get rid of high-ranking cards, ""dump"" point cards on other players, and so on.









One way to short-suit yourself (or, at the very least, prepare to do so) is via the ""pass"" at the beginning of the hand. If you have, for instance, four Clubs in your hand and you pass three to another player, you'll have only one Club left to get rid of before you're short-suited (assuming another player doesn't pass you any additional Clubs).

, Shooting the moon can completely upend the dynamic of a game of Hearts, allowing you to move up several places in the rankings. However, shooting the moon is very risky, so you'll want to think carefully before you do it. Obviously, you won't want to try to shoot the moon if someone else has already gotten at least one point. You also won't want to shoot the moon if you have lots of low-ranking cards, as the likelihood that you'll be able to win every trick with such a hand is quite low. Generally, you should only try to shoot the moon when you have lots of high-ranking cards (not necessarily Hearts), especially if you're already well on your way to winning all the points in a round or most of your cards are of one suit.









Remember that if no one can follow the suit of the lead card, the player who leads wins the trick automatically. Use this to your advantage. If it seems like everyone is out of a certain suit, lead with cards of this suit, starting with your highest and working to your lowest, and you'll collect tons of points.

Gather four people and then divide into two teams of two.,
Create a Euchre deck.,
Determine which player deals first.,
Deal counterclockwise following these guidelines:


Dealing must take place over exactly two rounds
The dealer must deal two or three cards at a time to each player, including themselves
The exact pattern of card distribution does not matter, but the most common is 2-3-2-3 for the first round, followed by 3-2-3-2 for the second round.,
Understand the concept of a trump suit.,
Know how to keep score.,
Think about your partner's cards.,
Deal the cards.,
Turn the top card of the kitty face up, for all players to see.,
Have the dealer pick up the card.,
Have the player to the left of the dealer lead.,
Go for strategy.,
Know when you're ""in the barn."",
Tally up the final score.",How to Play Euchre," Partners may be chosen by any method agreed upon by the group.


Teammates should sit in alternating positions so that each person is seated diagonally from their partner.

, Euchre is played with 24 cards consisting of the 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A cards from a standard 52-card deck. Although the remaining cards are not used during the game, set aside the 4 and 6 cards of a black suit as well as the 4 and 6 cards of a red suit to use for keeping score.


Each team should use one of the sets of 4 and 6 cards to keep score by hiding/revealing one suit symbol for each point scored (Euchre goes to 10). For example: to show a score of five, the 6 card should be face up and the 4 card be face down, covering one of the suit symbols on the 6 card so that five suit symbols are showing.

, Shuffle the deck and then continuously deal one card face up to each player until someone receives one of the black jacks. This person is the first dealer.

,
Players can look at their cards once they are dealt, but they cannot discuss them with anyone, including their teammate.
After each player has five cards, the dealer should confirm that there are four remaining cards (these cards are known as the kitty). Once confirmed, the dealer places the remaining cards face down in the center of the table, and then flips over the top card to begin the hand.

, Trump is the dominant suit in Euchre. Any trump card beats any non-trump card. If a player leads off with the trump suit, the highest trump card wins the trick. In the trump suit and only the trump suit, rankings are a bit different.


The order in trump cards goes as so (for explanatory purposes assume trump is spades): Right Bower (jack of spades), Left Bower (jack of clubs), Ace (spades), King (spades), Queen (spades), ten (spades), and nine (spades). The jack of the same color but not the same suit as trump is the left bower. The order of the non-trump cards is sequential, nine being lowest and ace being highest in rank.

, The unit of Euchre is a ""trick."" There are five tricks (or rounds) in a hand of Euchre. The first pair to win 10 points is the winner of Euchre.


If a team chooses the trump suit and then proceeds to win at least three tricks, they get 1 point. If they get all five tricks (sweeping the hand), they score 2 points.
If the team that chose the trump suit does not get at least three tricks, the opposing team gets 2 points. They have successfully euchred the other team.
If you choose to go solo (when you have a really good hand) and make all five tricks your team gets a whopping 4 points.

, Avoid playing good cards when your partner has already laid down a winner; your team will probably take that trick without your help. Start by playing a good card so your teammate doesn't waste potential winning cards unnecessarily. If you have a bunch of good cards, however, consider ""going alone.""


If one partner decides their hand is very valuable and they are confident they can win all 5 tricks, this player can ""go alone."" (This usually only happens when that player has both trump Jacks, as well as an Ace and another trump suited card in their hand. This gives you extremely good odds of winning the trick.) This means that their partner sits out for one trick. Once the first card of the trick is flipped and the players are calling to pass or pick it up, when your turn comes you announce you are ""going alone."" Play proceeds as usual, but if the player going alone wins all 5 tricks, then that team wins 4 points. If the player wins 4-1 or 3-2, then they only get one point.

, As discussed earlier, sit in team formation and designate a dealer. Grab your Euchre deck and have the dealer give each player 5 cards and assemble the kitty.

, Starting to the person left of the dealer, rotating clockwise, ask each player whether or not he wishes to declare the suit that is showing as trump until someone does (or a new cycle begins).


If he does wish to declare this suit trump, he says ""pick it up.""
If he does not want to declare this suit trump, he says ""pass,"" or declares a pass by knocking on the table.

, He/She then discards one of their other cards (usually a low card of the non-trump suit). If a rotation of the circle is completed without anyone telling the dealer to ""pick it up,"" the card is turned face down and another rotation ensues. During this rotation, a player can call trump of any suit other than the one that was originally turned up. If the rotation completes without anyone calling trump, the deal is forfeited and passed clockwise to the next person in the circle.


It's generally wise to only call a trump suit if you have a good hand. Otherwise, stay mum.

, Each player must follow suit -- meaning if a player has a card of the same suit as was led, he must play it on that trick. If a player does not have a card of that suit, he can trump the trick, or simply throw a card off suit. The highest card of the suit that was led takes the trick, unless a trump card is played. The highest card of trump will win any hand.


If you lay a card that does not follow suit but you do have a card that does, this is called a ""renege."" If another player calls you out on what you've done, they receive 2 points. If you are going alone, however, the penalty is 4 points (for whichever side is guilty).

, Because each game of Euchre is so short, it's a little easier to memorize the cards. Think about what cards you believe your opponents are holding to determine how to lead off and what to throw away. For example, if the dealer adds the original trump card to his hand, don't forget it.


If you are leading and have two or more trump cards, go with those. Always lead a high trump if your partner called it; it'll help them locate the missing cards. Otherwise, work in a sequence. Say diamonds are trump -- lead with the Ace of Spades or Clubs to try to win it.
Don't hold onto your good cards. Euchre goes fast -- if you act slowly, you'll miss your opportunity to use them. When opportunity knocks, answer the door.

, Once one team gets to 9 points, this means they are ""in the barn."" You must announce this with great enthusiasm, since it typically indicates that you are about to win the game.


If you really want to have fun with it, have one partner interlock their fingers together, and flip upside down with the thumbs making ""udders"" and let the other partner ""milk"" them.

, The five tricks of Euchre can go by pretty fast, so it's best to keep score as you go. Use the 6 and 4 cards to keep tabs.


Once a team reaches ten, you'll probably want to play again. Switch teams if skill sets are better suited in different combinations.

,How to Play Blackjack1,
"
Take along a wide angle set of binoculars.,
Situate yourself within throwing distance of the betting counter.,
Have your choices picked out before viewing the horses on the track.,
Observe the horses without judgement.,
Consider some key elements after making your observation.,
Go through a mental list of the various aspects that you are looking at when observing the horses.,
Eliminate certain horses from contention.,
Look for horses that look vibrant and rearing to go.,
Check the odds to see that it is a normal.,

Make your betting efficient.,
If after you make your bets, the race starts in a minute, then the time you spent watching the horses go to the starting gate was adequate.",How to Bet Late in Horseracing," It is difficult to zoom in on a horse when time is short and your hands are shaking from nerves and excitement. With a wide angle binoculars, you can spot a horse's number quickly. With powerful binoculars, you could see the horse just as if you were a few yards away, which is very desirable because you'll get a better sense of the horse's behavior pre-race.;
, Besides looking at the horses and jockeys, look at the line at the counter. Depending on the length and ease of getting into the line, you'll need to be ready to dash to the betting window before the race starts.


It is also recommended that you situate yourself so that you can see the horses as they go around the track to the starting gate. Go as close to the fence as possible––this will let you see things that the people in the stands cannot.

, What you know in advance about the form of the horses is very useful. Before going the races, here are some things to have already studied:


Study the Daily Racing form.
Research the horses before going to the track.
Factor in the track conditions and the weather.
Compare the odds vs the payout.
Study all parts of horse racing. We make mistakes because we are human––but this also applies to horses and results can be spotty, so studying the horses intently and at the latest possible opportunity will give you great insight as to what will happen a few minutes into the future.

, Setting aside all that you've already learned about the horses, now simply observe them as you see them coming around the track toward the starting position. Be aware of your initial reactions and thought processes after viewing them. After each race, you will notice that the horses that stood out before the race were the ones that finished well. Horses are living, breathing creatures much like humans, and they have their ups and downs and unexpected occurrences. Their condition just prior to a race is up-to-date and if you take the time to observe them, you'll be able to use your senses to help interpret this condition for each horse viewed.

, Look, but not stare, at the horses with your inner eye and be insightful, then consider the following:


Horse racing is a group activity––is the horse you're looking at ready to run in a pack, ahead of it or behind it?
What is the inclination of that horse for the present moment?

Football and boxing are dangerous sports but horse racing is multiple times more dangerous for jockeys. It is safer for a horse to be in the rear, so use your sense to see whether the horse you're observing can overcome that fear and go to gun for the lead and be ahead of the pack.

, The list is long but you'll get better at checking it off very quickly the more you practice. Consider: bone structure, muscle size, height, weight, type of runner in relation to the pack, sweating, awareness, are the muscles pumped up, etc. Consider the disposition of the horses you'd like to bet on.


Apply the lessons you've learned from life apart from horse racing, looking for things that are similar. For example, can you put out maximal effort without warming-up? How does the horse look, is he cold, warm or too hot? And so forth.

, Although there are occasional exceptions, there are some things that you can use to eliminate horses from your choice. Here are some suggestions:


Eliminate any unruly horses. These are the horses that look like a child throwing a tantrum in public that the parents can't control. Look for inability to calm, snorting, kicking, stomping on the ground, etc.
Eliminate any horse that is complacent and docile. Differentiate between: 1) a complacent horse and 2) a horse that is controlled yet not moving but ready to run. You must concentrate and focus in on horses that are not moving, yet have potential.

, These should be your best choices as far as late considerations.

, A lot of money on the favorite is not normal. Another example of an abnormal odds are when the favorite's money is not large. Look at all the odds and you must decide fast because your time is limited. Bet only when you have an overlay. Additionally, you're not betting to win a race––you're betting mathematically to win money over a long period of time.

, Ask the cashier how to make your bet in as little words as possible. This will allow for more time observing, less time transacting., You want to spend the maximum of time in the final viewing of the horses before placing the bet but still have a short minute left to get ready to watch the race.

Continue until a player cannot lay down another card without exceeding 31.,
Count up the cards to get your final score.,
Consider the ""Muggins"" variation.,
Play until one person reaches 121.,
Don't start off with a 5.,
Think about what you put into the crib.,
Avoid landing on 21.,
If you're close to winning, don't worry about the crib.",How to Play Cribbage," For this game, the jokers are not used. Each player will need two pegs for scoring -- these can be found underneath the board. The set may include additional pegs for keeping track of match scores. If a proper board is unavailable, the players can keep score with pencil and paper.









The two pegs for each player are used to indicate the score in the previous turn and the score of the current turn. This way, any math can be easily checked and double-checked.
The first to accumulate 121 points wins. This often occurs in the middle of a deal; the game then ends immediately. Two trips around the board (with your pegs) is equivalent to this. If you are playing a short game, one trip signifies the end, with a player winning at 61.
;
, To determine who deals first, any player picks up the deck and shuffles it 2 or 3 times. The deck is placed face down on the table; each player pulls out one card. The person with the lowest card is the dealer. The dealer deals 6 cards to each player.









Being the dealer has its upsides and downsides. The dealer gets the advantage of the crib; however, the non-dealer(s) immediately gets 3 points (for compensation) and can ""peg out"" before the dealer even gets a chance to tally his/her score and win (because the dealer goes last).
If you're playing multiple rounds, rotate dealers just like you rotate turns.


, Each player looks at their 6 cards and decides which 4 to keep in his hand and which 2 to discard face-down into a pile near the dealer called ""the crib."" This is a hand that is looked at at the end of the game and is reserved for the dealer and the dealer only.









The crib is an enormous part of cribbage strategy. If you are the dealer, you can save away your good cards in this crib for later. If you are not the dealer, you must try to give the dealer as weak of a hand as possible, while not jeopardizing your own play.


, The player who did not deal cuts the deck to determine the top card. Then, the dealer should flip it over. Both players will use this card, called the ""cut,"" as a wild fifth card to count points at the end of the round.









If this ""up-card"" is a Jack, the dealer gets to peg 2 points immediately. This score is called ""his heels"" or ""his nibs."", Players alternate laying cards down in their own piles, starting with the non-dealer. As they play each card, they call out the value of the total. Face cards have a value of 10; all others are worth their numeric value. Aces are always only worth 1 point. Suits do not matter in this round; only numeric values. Play stops at 31 (or when no one can lay down a card).









If the first player lays a 3 and the second player lays a 4, the first player calls out, ""3"" and the second player calls out ""7."" Though they're in separate piles, it's the cumulative total of all the cards.
The cards are kept in these separate piles because at the end of the game, each person's hand is tallied on its own. However, all players should be able to see every card played.


, Make pairs, runs, and other combinations to score points. While you're laying cards and thinking about not going over 31, use what your opponent(s) is laying to your advantage. You get extra points for pairs, runs, and certain numbers. As you score, move your peg around the board.









If either player reaches 15 points exactly, this earns him 2 points.
Points are also earned and pegged for pairs (and triplets, etc.). For example, player 1 lays down a 7 and Player 2 immediately follows with another 7, which would earn him 2 points. If Player 1 then lays down a third 7, he earns 6 points. The fourth seven would be worth 12 points. (Note: if Player 2 is not able to lay down any other card without exceeding 31, and Player 1 has the fourth seven, he can lay it down and earn the 12 points.)
Sequences also score points. They must be consecutive cards, but not necessarily in order. For example: The first player plays a 4, second player plays a 6. If the first player now plays a 5 he would score three points for completing a run of 3. If the second player now plays a 3 or a 7 he would then score 4 points for making a run of 4.
After ""31"" (or as close as possible in the hand), the person laying down the last card takes a point for having the final card. If the last card makes exactly 31, the player gets 1 additional point.

, At this point, he says ""Go."" If the other player can still lay down another card without exceeding 31, he must do so for as many times as necessary. Once he lays down as many cards as he can without going over 31, he says ""Go"" and earns 1 point. However, if the total he ends up with is exactly 31, he earns 2 points.









It is 1 point per ""Go,"" not 1 point per card able to be laid down without exceeding 31. If you can lay 1 card without exceeding 31, you get 1 point; if you can lay 3 cards without exceeding 31, you still get 1 point.

This player can also get extra points for runs and the like during this time.



, Once all cards have been played, it is time to count them up. The person to count first is the non-dealer(s), then the dealer, then the crib. Your hand consists of the four cards you played, plus the cut card. This is why you kept them in separate piles! If you are the dealer, count your original hand and the crib separately.









You score one point if you hold the Jack of the suit that was cut.
Pairs, triples and quadruples count -- 2, 6 and 12 points, respectively.
Sequences (e.g. 6-7-8) do not have to be the same suit, and count as 1 point per card. They must consist of at least three cards.
Any combination of cards that add up to 15 counts as 2 points (even if it took all five cards to do it). You may use a card more than once in different combinations.
A flush (all four cards are the same suit) is worth 4 points.

The cut cannot give you a flush. It gives a fifth point if it extends a 4 card flush to a 5 card flush, but 3 spades and a heart don't score flush points if you cut a spade. (When counting the crib, only 5 card flushes score.)


If all four cards in the crib are the same suit, no points can be taken unless the fifth card is also that same suit. Then 5 points are pegged.

, Because patterns and scoring are so intricate in this game, lots of players like to take advantage of the possibility of their opponent flubbing up and missing would-be points in their hand. This is called the ""Muggins"" rule.









Each player tallies up their hand aloud. If they finish and another player notices points they missed, they call out, ""Muggins!"" and receive those up-for-grab points. If playing this variation, it's important to be thorough!

, If no player has made two trips around the board (or one trip for a short game), play another round. The next person then deals and the game continues as normal. When someone does reach 121, the game immediately stops. That person is the winner, even if other players have yet to take their turn.








, Odds are the next player has a card in their hand worth 10. If you start off with a 5, they'll probably be able to land on 15, scoring them 2 points. Ideally start off with a 4 -- it has the least amount of value to you.









Aces or deuces should be kept to make a 31 or to upset your opponent's ""Go.""Generally lower cards are useless, but not in this case.

, If you are not the dealer, it's best to avoid putting 5s into the crib (if there are any tens in there at all, that's an automatic 15). Obviously, avoid putting in pairs and numbers that are consecutive (6 and 7, for example, to avoid sequences). Ace and King are pretty safe to put in, as they are too low and too high to be any real threat.









If you are the dealer, it's a magic touch between ""salting"" your crib with good cards but still keeping a decent hand for play.Try to envision what you think the other players will toss away and working off of that.

, Cribbage is very much a game of thinking ahead. You are setting your opponent up for each play they make, allowing or not allowing them points. In as much as you want to avoid 15, also avoid 21. A ten or a face card and voila! 31 they've got.








, You've played four rounds already and you're at 116 points? Great -- toss whatever you'd like into the crib, just keep the best hand possible. Odds are you won't make it to the end of the game, so don't worry about crib strategy. Just play your best cards and get out of there! The game ends as soon as you win, no crib counting allowed.

Learn the value of the cards.,
Learn your choices: There are two basic options when it's your turn:










Hit: Get another card.,
Start winning.",How to Play Blackjack2," In Blackjack, each card has a value that remains constant throughout the game. The goal is to beat the dealer and also not bust with a 22 or more. Here are their values:










Number cards: The number is the value of the card.

Face cards: The value of face cards is 10.

Ace: Either 1 or 11. It is counted as 11 (...generally) unless it would put you over 21, in which case it counts as 1.

Therefore, an ace and a ten card are 21 in two cards, which is Blackjack/Natural.
A hand containing an ace is called ""soft"" hand.



, You are able to hit until you go over 21.

Stand: Keep your current cards and do nothing. You do not receive more cards.
There are also a few extra possibilities you can use for certain hands:


Taking insurance: This is only available when the dealer is showing an ace. You place a new bet that will then pay at 2-1 if the dealer does indeed have a blackjack. You lose your other bet (which would pay 1-1) but win the insurance, resulting in breaking even.

Double Down: You double your bet, and get only one more card. This is generally only used when your initial two cards equal 8-11 or soft 12 to soft 19.

Split: Make two hands from one hand, if both cards are the same value. Tens, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are usually counted as 10 each. If both of your hands win, you get double the amount of money. If only one wins, you break even. If both hands lose, you lose double the money. Split the hands by separating the cards and placing a duplicate bet.

Surrender: In many casinos, you can (before playing and after determining if the dealer has a blackjack) choose to give up half of your bet without playing. Surrender is only desirable when the dealer is showing a 9-A, and the player has a 5-7 or 12-16.

When the dealer has an ace, he or she automatically checks to see if a blackjack is had. Early surrender is when you opt out of half your bet before the dealer checks for a blackjack on his/her behalf.





, In order to win, the player has to be closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over. If the player goes over, he has ""busted."" If it's a tie, it's a ""push"" -- neither the player nor the house wins. A blackjack is when your starting hand is an ace and 10, or face card.









The dealer will go around the players until each one decides to stand. He then plays his own hand, which determines the outcome of the game. Obviously, each hand is different. Generally, players using copy the dealer hit on 16 or less. This is a bad strategy. The never bust strategy is a little better, but it is still a bad strategy.The casino's greatest advantage (the ""house edge"") is that the player has to act first. If a player ""busts"" (goes over 21), the casino immediately takes the player's money. If the casino then ""busts"" on the same hand, the player still loses. The dealer is the last one to play the hand.

"
"
Understand the ""House rules."",
Recognize the implications of insurance, splitting, doubling down and surrender.,
Understand card counting.",How to Play Blackjack3," Most casinos always ""stand"" on 17 and greater. Some will ""hit"" a ""soft 17"" (any 6 and an ace). Some casinos (though rarely) require an ""ante"" like in poker (play in those casinos favors the house as much as 20%). You'll quickly gather your casino's rules when you sit down to play.









Casinos have varying rules on insurance, splitting, and doubling down when it comes to how and when you can do it. Your dealer will surely let you know it if comes to this. For example, some casinos won't let you split a third Ace; for surrendering, some abide by early or late surrender only., All of the extra actions favor the house when used incorrectly -- it wouldn't be a casino game if the opposite were true!









When making an insurance bet, you are betting that the dealer's hole card is a 10, Jack, Queen or King. There are 13 potential ranks of cards in the deck. You have less than a 1 and 3 chance of it paying. The best time to make an insurance bet is when the count is (whatever you found it to be.) If the dealer turns out to have a blackjack, you will have a ""push"" (tie) with the dealer; your insurance bet will pay 2-1 which pays better than the original bet of 3-2!
When doubling down, you only get one card. You may not like the hand you end up with. In fact, that is what the casino is counting on! Never double down if the dealer is an ace or a face card (unless you have 11).
Splitting can turn an excellent hand into a terrible one, and vice versa. Here are some rules of thumb: Never split 5's -- your total is 10; you are likely to end strong. Always split 8's and Aces. Splitting 8's will change probable losers to probable winners. Splitting Aces is advantageous, but understand this: You are only allowed to split Aces once (sometimes), and you can only take one card for each new hand (sometimes.) Some casinos did this because splitting Aces, without any restriction, is a great advantage.
Once you have ""surrendered"" your hand, the dealer's actions are unimportant (to you). If the dealer's hand goes sour, you have already given up.

, You're not literally counting the value of all the cards. What some players do (when they're really good) is count the ""value"" of the deck, or, more specifically, how many aces and tens are left to be played (or this and that.) If lots are still to be seen, they up their bets, knowing the likelihood of them getting a good hand is better.









Casinos have caught onto this however, and most now use multiple decks in the shoe or cut the deck or both. With six decks in play and more cards taken out, it's not likely with low penetration to track the number of good cards in the deck.

Because of this, card counting will not be outlined here. Refer to wikiHow's card counting page if you're interested in the details.

Grab a seat at an open table.,
Start using your hands.,
Assume the dealer has a ten.,
Know when to walk away.,Basic rules of thumb are to always stand hard 17 and over, never stand a soft 17, double soft hands A,2 and A,3 vs 5-6, A,4 and A,5 vs 4-6, and A,6 and A,7 vs 3-6.",How to Play Blackjack4," When the hand is over (if you're not alone at the table), whip out your stack of money and tell the dealer what denomination of chips you'd like. (S)He will take your money and exchange it for a pile of chips. Then, you place your bet in the betting box and away you go!









If you're a newbie to the blackjack game, you may want to avoid the seat on the far left of the table (third base.) Since this is the spot that comes right before the dealer, you're likely to get a lot of heat if you're the reason the dealer turns up a 5, or any good card for themselves, though you may be congratulated if you make the dealer bust. Though obviously not logical, no one said humans, and gamblers especially, ever were., At a casino's blackjack table, being mute would go entirely unnoticed. You don't need a single word to play the game. In fact, you'd blend into the crowd more if you never opened your mouth.









For hitting, either tap the table with a finger or two or scrape the table with the edge of your cards. For standing, place your chips on top of your cards, face down or wave your hand palm down horizontally over your cards. For splitting, add another bet and point 2 fingers. For doubling down, add another bet to your betting box and point 1 finger., When it comes down to it, that card facing down has better odds of being a ten (or worth 10) than any other value. If he or she is showing a 6 or lower, the idea is they'll bust. That's the basic strategy.









You should take into account both your cards and their cards. If you have sixteen and the dealer is showing a six, stand. They have to take a card unless the have an A. But if you have sixteen and the dealer is showing a 7...well, that decision is up to you. If you're alone at a table or with a friendly group, people and/or the dealer will probably be happy to give you advice if you ask.

, Just like in poker, blackjack has hot and cold tables. It doesn't take a pro to be able to recognize this -- you'll know when you're running out of chips! If you're observant, you'll probably be able to tell which table is running hot just by watching.









A good rule of thumb is to up your bet in increments. If you win two $5 bets and then lose a $10 bet, you're still even! When your winning streak stops, resume your initial minimum bet until the table goes hot again.

Points are bad! Make sure everyone knows the goal of the game is to get the lowest score, not the highest!

, If possible this should be someone who has played the game before, so the new players can learn by watching them.


After that player is finished, play continues clockwise, each player taking a turn in order.

, You can take the top card of the discard pile if you think it will be useful. Otherwise, draw a card from the top of the draw pile (the rest of the deck).


Read the rest of these rules or see Strategy to help you make this decision.

, You can replace any card, whether it's face up or face down.


Pick up the card you want to replace from your grid and put it face up in the discard pile.
Place the newly drawn card face up in its place. You cannot shift the position of your grid around before you do this.
If you don't like the card you just drew, you can discard it face up in the discard pile instead of replacing a card in your grid. You cannot do this if the card you drew just came from the discard pile.

, If the two cards in a column share the same number or letter (for instance, a Queen above another Queen), they cancel each other out and are worth nothing (zero points).


Remember, you're trying to get the lowest score possible!
If you like, you can take columns that have canceled out and place them on the bottom of the discard pile (NOT the top). This makes the table less cluttered.

, Once someone replaces their last face down card, each other player turns their grid face up as well and takes one final turn in clockwise order.

, Wait until the last player takes their turn, then flip every card in front of you face up.

Hold this card in your hand. If it came from the face down draw pile, don't let anyone else see it.

, You can replace any card, whether it's one you've peeked at or not.


Pick up the card you want to replace from your grid and put it face up in the discard pile.
Place the card you just drew face down to fill the empty space in your grid. You may not move the cards in the grid to different positions.
Remember to memorize the card you just put down! This variation tests your memory, so you are not allowed to peek at a card after the beginning of the game.
If you don't like the card you just drew, you can discard it face up in the discard pile instead of replacing a card in your grid. You CANNOT do this if the card you drew just came from the discard pile.

, A pair of the same card in a row or column are worth zero points. Don't show the other players or turn any cards face up to ""cancel"", though. They remain a face down secret until the end of the game.


If you have three of a kind, only two of them will cancel out. The third will still be worth its usual value.
If you have four of a kind, your entire grid is worth zero points.

, Instead of taking your normal turn, anyone can knock on the table to signify that they think they'll win. That player skips their turn, and each other player takes one final turn. Then the round ends.

, For this optional variation, shuffle in 2 Jokers for each 52 card deck. If you don't have Jokers, instead designate a specific card the ""bonus card"" (usually Twos or ""one eyed Jacks"").


The Joker or bonus card is worth -2 (negative two) points instead of its usual value.
A pair of Jokers or bonus cards cancel each other out just like normal pairs, increasing your score from -4 to 0.

, This optional rule punishes players who try to end the game too early, and rewards players who correctly guess when they're ahead. Here are a couple variations.


The player who ends the game (by ""knocking"" or by flipping their last card face up) gains 10 points if they do not have the lowest score this round.
If the player who ended the game does not have the lowest score this round, that player gains a number of points equal to the player who did.

For example, Scrooge ""knocks"". After each player takes their final turn and counts up their score, Scrooge has 17 points and Marley has 12. Because Scrooge didn't win the round by getting the lowest score, Scrooge is punished for knocking and adds Marley's 12 points to his own. The final scores are Scrooge 29 and Marley 12.



, Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 4x2 or 5x2 grid.


This will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).

, Follow the rules for 4-card golf, but give each player a hand of four cards instead of a grid.


Players can look at all cards in their hand at any time.
Any two cards in hand cancel out if they have the same value. There is no ""grid position"" in your hand.
This creates a short simple game with no need to memorize cards.

, Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 3x3 grid.


Each player turns up 3 cards instead of 2 at the start of the game.
A player can only cancel cards by getting 3 of a kind in the same row or column. When they do, they can remove those 3 cards and place them at the bottom (NOT the top) of the discard pile.
This will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).

, There are many different ways to play 6-card golf, and different families and gaming groups will have their own rules. Here are some common ones:


When you flip over your first two cards, they have to be in the same column, or they must be in different columns.Two of the same card anywhere on the layout cancel out, not just in the same column. This makes the game easier for younger players or beginners.If you have two columns next to each other with FOUR of the same card in them, they cancel out to zero points AND each other player gets 10 points added to their score this round.Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns, not the discard pile.

, Again, there are many ways to play. Here are some common additions or changes to the rules:


You can only peek at the two cards closest to you.
Pairs across from each other diagonally also cancel out.
Pairs don't cancel out at all. The only goal is to take the lowest cards and try to end the game when you think you're ahead.
Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns.

, If you're playing a variation that allows you to start with face up cards, choose cards in different columns. This gives you more chances to ""cancel"" out a column.

, Unless you can cancel out your high scoring cards, you want to get rid of them so they don't add their high values to your score.


This is especially important as the game draws to a close. If your opponent is almost out of face down cards (or is looking smug), toss out your liabilities as quickly as possible!

, Much of the strategy in Golf comes down to paying attention to the other players.If the player to your right is picking up Sixes, you should give up trying to cancel your own Sixes. They aren't likely to discard any.
If the player to your left is trying to finish a column of Nines, try to avoid discarding your own Nine.

Learn the object of Hex.,
Set up your board and markers.,
Decide who will go first.,
Take turns placing one piece or marking one hex on the board per move.,
Block your opponent whenever possible.,
Win the game by connecting a row of adjacent hexagons between your two opposite sides.",How to Play Hex," The object of Hex is to create a row of hexes going from one side of the board to the other. Before the game begins, each player should claim two opposing sides of the board. For example, one payer might take the top and bottom the board, while the other player might take the right and left side of the board.To win the game, a player must create a line of hexes going from one side of the board to the other. The player who completes a line of hexes first is the winner.;
, Lay your board on a level playing surface, such as a hard table. Make sure that both players can access the board with ease. If you are playing on a paper board, then each player should choose one color to use on the board, such as red or blue.


If you are playing on a paper board, then one player could use a red marker to mark all of his or her hexes and the other player could use a blue marker to mark all of his or her hexes.

, The player who goes first has the advantage in a game of Hex, so you and your opponent may want to take turns going first. For example, you could let the person who goes second in the current game go first in your next game. If you wish to be fair, Flip a Coin to determine who gets to go first., Once a piece is played or a hex has been marked, it stays that way for the rest of the game. Either player may play a piece in any hexagon that is not yet occupied., One way to increase your chances of winning hex is to prevent your opponent from winning. If your opponent is close to finishing his or her path, then you may need to devote some of your play time to blocking your opponent. You can block your opponent by placing tiles in his or her path, thereby making it harder for your opponent to win., The first player to create a path from one of your sides of the board to the opposite side is the winner. Any continuous path will do, and the pieces need not have been placed in any special order."

Figure out the amount of times someone can play.",How to Make a Prize Wheel," You can cut a circle out of a ¾ in thick piece of plywood or you can also purchase a plywood round at most home improvement stores. You will need a three-foot (90cm) round with a thickness of 3/4-inch to 1 inch (2cm to 2.5cm) is ideal. The round should be big enough to develop some momentum, and still small enough to carry around.


If you decide to make the round yourself, then draw a line from one corner of the plywood to the other. Then, draw a line between the other two corners. The central “X” that these two lines create can serve as your center point for cutting out your wheel.You can cut out your wheel using a straight bit with end cutters that you attach to the center of your plywood. Make sure that you go slowly as you cut out the round.;
, After you have created or purchased your round of plywood, sand it well to ensure that there are no rough edges on the side you will be painting or on the outer edges of the wheel. You can either use a power sander or sand the wheel by hand. When sanding wood, it is best to start with a coarser grit and then move up to a finer grit to get rid of minor imperfections., After you have sanded the round, you can begin measuring and dividing the wheel into wedge segments. Just place a small pencil mark to designate the space for each wedge. Then, draw a small circle between each of the lines about an inch or two from the outer edge of each wedge. These circles will be where you will drill holes for the spinner nails.








Use a protractor to get more accurate measurements.
If you want, you can adjust the shape of the pie wedges, making some larger, and some smaller. Larger slices will have a bigger chance of winning, and smaller slices will have a smaller chance of winning!

, You will not be adding the spinner nails yet, but you will need to drill holes so that you will know where to put them when it is time. Drill into the spots you marked, but do not go all the way through the wood. Only drill a hole that goes about 1







, Before you connect your wheel to the base with your lazy Susan, you will need to use the lazy Susan to create a template. This template will help you to determine where to drill holes on your wheel and base.








Get a piece of plain white paper and place the lazy Susan on the paper.
Then, turn the lazy Suzan so that it looks like two squares overlapping each other at different angles. You should see eight points instead of four.
Trace the outer edges of the lazy Susan and create a dot for each of the holes as well as the center point of the inner circle.

, After you have created the template, use it as a guide to drill holes through the spots you have marked on the wheel and the large piece that you will be using for your base. You can screw the wheel onto the base to make sure that it works, or do this later. Just keep in mind that you will need to remove the screws to paint your wheel and base.







, Paint the wedge sections different colors, or alternating colors, or any color scheme that suits your fancy. You can use a large piece of butcher paper and some tape to make it easier to paint the sections. 








Cut a wedge out of the butcher paper in the desired size and then use masking tape to tape it onto the wheel. Then, apply spray paint or apply paint with a brush. Allow each segment to dry before you start a new one.

, Depending on how you plan to sue the wheel, you will need to assign a prize or number to each wedge. For example, if you plan to use the wheel for a raffle, then you might assign a different number to each wedge. Or, if you plan to give away certain prizes with the wheel, then you might attach a picture of a different prize to each wedge. 








You can either glue numbers or prize images onto the wheel or draw/paint them on. It is up to you!

, Next, you will need to add a nail to each wedge. The nails are necessary for stopping the spinner. Do not nail the nails in all the way, most of the nails should be sticking out of the wheel. However, make sure that the nails are secure.









After you add the nails, you can paint the tops of the nails if you like. Try painting the tops of the nails white or gold to add some contrast to the wheel., It should be about an inch (2.5cm) thick, and as wide, or wider than the round. For our example, using a 3-foot (90cm) round, you'd want a base that's approximately three or four feet (90-120cm) wide. Make sure it's deep enough to be able to support the weight of the round (plus the force used when spinning the wheel). Anywhere from 20 inches (50cm) to three feet (90cm) is good.








, It should be 3/4-inch to 1-inch (1-2cm) thick, and at least a foot (30cm) longer than the round's diameter. For example, for a three foot round, the backing should be at least four feet tall, and the same width as the base.








, Draw a straight line across the bottom of the base, perpendicular to the long edge and about two-thirds of the way from one side to the other. Draw another matching line across the top. (This offset will keep the spinning wheel unit from tipping over when you spin vigorously).









Drill four guide holes across that line using a 1/16th-inch bit. Measure the distance between the edge of the base and the first hole and last hole. Make the same measurements on the bottom of the backing piece, and drill guide holes there too.
Draw a bead of glue along the top line, place the backing perpendicular to the base, and using a wood screw that's at least twice the thickness of the base, screw the two pieces together.
Use your drill bit through the base to set guide holes for the middle two holes, and then insert those two last screws. Tighten up all the screws, then let the base dry for 24 hours.

, When everything has dried and set, decorate the backdrop as you desire. You might just want to paint it all one color, such as black or brown, so that the wheel will be the center of attention. Make sure that you let the paint dry completely before you attach the wheel to the base.








Try using only primary colors or arrange the colors like a rainbow: blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and purple., After you have completed the wheel and the base, then you can connect them with the lazy Susan bearing. Drill through the holes that you have already created to connect the two pieces.








Make sure that the lazy Susan bearing is well lubricated before you attach it or it may not spin well.Spray some WD-40 on it if necessary.

, To complete your wheel, you will need to create a flapper. When you spin the wheel, the flapper will slow down the wheel gradually until it stops. You can make a flapper by creating an arrowhead shape and a couple of square wood pieces about twice the size of the arrowhead.








You can use a piece of plywood that is the same thickness as your wheel to make these pieces.
When you create the arrowhead shape, cut three notches into it. Cut two notches on each side of the arrowhead base and one notch on the bottom of the arrow. Make each notch about ½” to 1” deep. Cut one ½” to 1” deep notch into the side of one of your square pieces as well.
Paint the wood pieces however you want. You may want to paint these all one color, such as black, or brown, or white. Allow the pieces to dry completely before you go on to the next step.

, Rinse out an empty two liter soda bottle and then cut it into two strips about one inch wide and four inches long. One of these strips will go into the notches on either side of the arrowhead to cover the pointed end. You can attach this piece now.








The other strip will go into the bottom of the arrowhead to connect it to the base, but do not attach it yet.

, Next you will need to put everything together and attach your flapper to the base. Start by drilling the square without a notch onto the top left corner of the base. Then, drill the square that has a notch onto the top of this square. Make sure that the notch is pointing down towards the wheel.








Then, insert the soda bottle piece into the square notch and insert the other end into the bottom of your arrowhead.

, After you connect your flapper, you can give your wheel a test spin to see how it works. Spin it gently the first few times to ensure that it is sturdy. If your wheel seems wobbly in any way, stop it from spinning. You may need to check the screws and reinforce the wheel in some places.








, You can figure this out by taking the cost of making the wheel and buying the prizes, the number of people who are going to play (this can be an estimate), and the probability of people winning the grand prize.

, People sometimes ""get into a groove"" and start to win prizes by the boatload. To prevent this, designate a number of times a person can spin the wheel.

Unzip the banana-shaped pouch and dump out all of the tiles onto a flat surface such as the floor or a table.,
Flip all of the tiles face down, so no letters are visible.

,
The number of tiles each player takes is determined by the number of people playing the game.,
Once everyone has counted out his or her tiles, say, ""Split!"",
Arrange your tiles into an interlocking crossword.,
Once you have finished making words with all of your tiles, yell ""Peel!"",
Work in the new tiles.,
Continue playing in this manner until all the tiles in the bunch have been used or the number of tiles left is fewer than the amount of players.,
Flip the tiles over, mix them up in the center of the group, draw new tiles and play again, and again, and again...

",How to Play Bananagrams1,";
,, For 2-4 players, draw 21 tiles each. For 5-6 people, draw 15 tiles each. For 7-8 people, draw 11 tiles each. Group the leftover tiles into a middle pile or ""bunch"".

, This is the signal for everyone to flip over his or her tiles., Tiles may connect vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. The goal is to create complete words out of all your tiles.


Note: If you have a tile you do not wish to use, not enough vowels, too many consonants, etc., try ""dumping"". Place the single tile you are dumping back in the bunch, exclaim, ""Dump!"", and draw out three new tiles.







, (It's always a good idea to double-check first to make sure all your words are valid and spelled correctly.) Everyone must draw one new tile from the bunch.

, Tiles can be moved, rearranged, rotated, etc. In this example, the player has a newly drawn T. By replacing the D in FOOD with the T and creating FOOT, the player was able to place the D at the end of TIE to make TIED, effectively using all of his or her tiles.

, At this point the player with a finished crossword, proclaims ""Bananas!"" He or she is the winner!

Use a standard 19x19 grid.,
Have 361 black and white stones ready.",How to Play Go1," There are 19 horizontal and vertical lines. You can use a board or make a grid yourself.


Sometimes smaller boards are used. Often 13x13 or 9x9 boards are used for quicker games or for teaching.
There should be nine marked points spread out evenly on the board (4rd, 10th, and 16th lines). They are called ""star points"" and serve as reference points or markers for handicap games.;
, This amount is for a 19x19 game. The number correlates to the amount of intersections on the board. If you are playing on a smaller board, use fewer stones.


Black plays with 181 stones and white with 180. This is because black makes the first move.
Keep the stones next to the board, in bowls.

Use this log to write out every idea you have about your game as you begin designing it. This will help you quickly separate good ideas from weak ideas. There are two basic approaches to starting your design: Themes and Mechanics. These two concepts are the foundation of all board games.








Themes are the “feel” of the game, and can also be referred to as the “genre”. Games like Sorry! have a simple theme of beating your opponent around the board, while complex wargames have the theme of large conflicts and player strategy.
Mechanics are the fundamental ways the players interact with the game. In Monopoly, the mechanics are centered around dice-rolling, buying and selling property, and making money. In Axis & Allies, the mechanics deal mainly in moving pieces across a large, interconnected board, while using dice to resolve conflicts between players.
There is no right or wrong way to start designing your game. Some people come up with a mechanic, and then create a theme around it, while others come up with a great theme and then tailor the mechanics to match that theme.;
, Knowing the age range of your tentative players would allow you to design the game as simple or as detailed as you wish it to be and would allow you to create age-appropriate rules. For instance, if you are designing the game for young children, you would want to create something that is simple, easy-to-understand, fun, and would promote camaraderie and learning among the children at the same time. For adults, you could create something that is more competitive and exciting.








, Once you have the basic ideas behind your game written down, set yourself some design goals that will help shape your game. Ask yourself what kind of experience you want your players to have, and what you want your game to accomplish. Consider some of the following when coming up with your goals:









Decide how many player the game will support. Think about if the game would be fun with two players, or if it needs three or more.
Think about how long you want your average game to take. Take into account the first game that players will play, and the learning time associated with it.
Ask yourself how complex you want the game to be. Some people enjoy games that are incredibly complex, with thick manuals full of rules, while others enjoy quicker games with just a few basic rules.
Consider how much of your game will based on luck and how much will be based on skill.

, The end of the board game is one of the most crucial aspects, because the players need a goal to use as an incentive to win. Consider the different ways that the player could win, and keep these in mind as you work on the game.








, These will undoubtedly change during the course of your game being developed, but a basic set of rules will allow you to quickly begin testing and experimenting. Keep in mind your win conditions, and make sure that the mechanics are clear.








, Before you begin work on the actual game, create a rough test game so that you can play around with the mechanics. It doesn’t have to be pretty; you just need to be able to see if the basics work as they should.









Cut out markers and pieces from cardstock or index cards.
Use coins or poker chips as counters.

, This will allow you to determine whether you need to include more or less details in your final design. Depending on the theme and mechanics of your game, your board may or may not include the following elements:









A path. Make sure to add start and finishing places and to set out a clear direction for the character(s) to travel along. Decide whether or not to split or loop the path to add variation or extend the game time.
A playing field. This is the opposite of the path. Games that have a playing field do not have set paths, but instead have areas that the players can interact with depending on the mechanics of the game. Risk is one such game that uses a playing field as opposed to a path.
Positions on which to land. These can be designated by shapes (squares, circles, triangles) or drawn objects/locations (stepping stones, islands, clouds). Make sure that some positions redirect players, instruct them to pick up cards, or cause them to gain/lose items. When designing positions that redirect players to other locations, be careful not to create any domino effects (e.g. Go Back Two Spaces position that sends takes a player to a Move Ahead Five Spaces position).
Playing cards. A randomly shuffled assortment of cards adds variation to an unchanging game pathway by affecting the players in unexpected ways. A card often tells a quick story about an event that befalls a player and then changes his or her score / position / accumulated goods accordingly. Having different types of cards (ex. cards that change a player’s location, cards that change a player’s stats, cards that players can collect throughout the game to represent achievements, and/or cards that command players to do things in real life like dance, sing, do a cartwheel, draw the person to their left, etc.) will greatly increase the number of ways in which a game can unfold.

, Once you have all of the basic pieces assembled for your rough draft, you can start testing the game to see how it plays. Before taking it to anyone else, play it yourself by playing as each possible player. It can be difficult to strategize against yourself, but you can get through a large number of games this way and collect valuable testing information.









Always write down what works and what doesn’t and make changes as you see fit to the board and the other components.
Try to break your game while testing it against yourself. See if it’s possible for players to always win if they do something specific, or if the rules can be broken at all.

, Once you’ve played your game solo enough that most of the kinks seem smoothed out, it’s time to take it for its first real test. Gather some friends or family and explain to them that you’d like to test the game you are working on. Let them know that it is a work in progress, and that you appreciate any and all feedback.









Take extensive notes while the game is being played. Note anytime someone doesn’t seem to be having fun, or any time that the rules get confusing. Pay attention to how the games end. If one player is consistently far ahead of the other players, look at how that happened. Board games are more exciting when multiple players are in close competition.
Try to not get defensive when you start receiving criticism on your game. Criticism is essential to making sure that the game is as fun as possible for the greatest amount of people, so be polite and write everything down.
If possible, try to watch a group of people play without you being involved. This will help you see how a group that is entirely unfamiliar with the game approaches the rules.

, Try to get as many different players to try your game as possible. Everyone plays games a little differently, and testing a lot can help to make sure that your game is fun for as many people as possible. The more people you get to test your game, the more opportunities you’ll have to find flaws or weak points and fix them.








, As your finish each play test, make any changes or adjustments to your board, rules, and components that you think will help playability. 







, Once your testing process is complete and you are happy with how it plays, you can get started on creating the final version of the game. Make a list of all the parts that your finished game will require.









Board games are traditionally mounted on chipboard or binder board. These provide a durable backing for your game and give it a professional feel.
You can use an old game board as the base if you’d rather not purchase anything.
Get cardstock to use as the canvas for the board.
Cut playing cards out of cardstock, or purchase a pack of blank cards from a hobby shop.
Punch circles out of cardstock to use as tokens and counters.

, Your game board is the centerpiece of your board game, so feel free to get creative with the design. Make sure that the path or playing field is clearly marked and that any instructions on the board are easy to read.









There is no limit to the things that you can use to decorate your board -- use ready-made printouts, patterned paper, paint, markers -- anything that will allow you to jazz up your board.
Make your board design as vibrant as possible, so as to capture and maintain the interest of your players.

, You can draw the images on paper, then tape or glue them to a thick material such as cardstock. If you are making a game for family or friends, you can even use players’ photos. If you want to spend a little money, you can take your designs to a professional printer and have them printed on thick, high-quality stock.









To make the pieces stand, cut out a strip of cardboard that you can fold into a 3D triangle (similar to picture frame stands), then stick to the back of the piece for support.
Another way to make game pieces that stand is to glue craft foam to the bottom of the folded piece of paper.

, If your game involves the use of a dice or spinner, you can just use the ones from your existing games, or create your own from cardboard and markers. To do this, you need a pin, a circle piece of cardboard, a cardboard arrow, and a marker. Stick the pin through the arrow and piece of cardboard and then draw on the results.








, If you really want to make your game stand out, you can look into getting 3D pieces printed. You will need to submit a 3D model to a company that specializes in this, but the result will be custom game pieces that look like they came from a store-bought game.

Type in the name of your card and the words you will use.,
Decide whether or not you want a free space.,
Determine the size of your card.,
Print your bingo cards.",How to Make Bingo Cards1," Some of the most well known sites for generating bingo cards are OSRIC, Print-Bingo, and Bingobaker. Feel free to use whichever site suits your needs best. Some sites require you to register to use their tools and others charge a membership fee. However, there are numerous sites that will allow you to use their bingo card generator for free and without entering any personal information., There are specific generators which specialize in picture bingo cards, while others will only accept words which can be typed in from your keyboard., The first box which will appear on the generator will be something like ""Card Title."" Click on the text box and type in the name of your bingo card. This could be something like ""Adam's Bingo Card"" or ""Volunteer Fire Department Bingo Tournament.""After you type in the name, you will find a box entitled something like ""Word List."" Click on the box and type in your list of words/numbers/symbols. Each of the words/numbers/symbols should be separated by a comma. The bingo card generator will then randomly assort these items into separate boxes.
For example: ""bat,bird,turtle,deer,hippo,dog,cat,bear,lion,.....etc."" You can also do the same with numbers (3,5,17,24,56,78,....etc.) and/or symbols ($,&,*,%,@,....etc.).
If you wish you can also create combinations of words, numbers and symbols. For example: ""bat,turtle,67,%,&,76,48,#,hippo,tiger,....etc.""

, On many bingo cards there is traditionally a ""free space,"" one where the person playing gets to place a chip down before the game begins. The bingo card generator will first ask you whether or not you want a free space on your bingo card. Click on either ""Yes"" or ""No.""The generator will then ask you to fill in the text of the free space. This could be something simple such as ""Free Space"" or something more complicated. You can choose from any number of letters, symbols, and/or numbers found on your keyboard.
You will then have to decide where you want the free space to be located. There are generally two options, either ""Center"" or ""Random."" Most of the time free spaces are placed in the center of a bingo card.

, Bingo cards are traditionally 5 X 5 blocks. However, you can increase/decrease these numbers based on the amount of words you have, the type of bingo game you play, etc. You can even make bingo cards with elongated rectangles rather than the normal squares if you decide to do so.The generator will ask you to write in the number of squares you want your bingo card to have lengthwise. Click on the box and insert a number.
The generator will ask you to write in the number of squares you want your bingo card to have height-wise. Click on the box and insert a number.
Multiply these numbers together. You should have the same amount of words (assuming you don't have a free space) as the product of these numbers multiplied together. If you don't, you will have to either adjust the number of squares on your bingo card, or add/subtract words from your list.

, The generator will first ask you to write the number of cards you wish to print. Simply click on the box and insert a number. Then click on ""Generate Bingo Cards."" The generator will link with your printer. When your computer pulls up your print box, make sure to change the position of your sheets to ""Landscape Style.""Since bingo cards get pretty beat up over the course of numerous games, it is best to print the cards out on card stock rather than traditional printer paper.
You should also consider getting your cards laminated. Companies like FedEx and UPS offer pay-for laminating services. You may also have a local laminator near you.

Place all tiles face down in the middle of the table.,
Give each player 7 tiles for their personal pile.,
Flip over the tiles and start making words in a crossword-style pattern one player at a time.,
When a player has no tiles left in their personal pile, give them 7 more tiles.,
Continue forming the crossword until all the tiles are gone.",How to Play Bananagrams2," There will be 144 lettered tiles to turn over. If you'd like to play a quicker game, take out a few of the tiles to shorten it up. But don't take out certain letters! You'll need a good combination to make the best words., Put the rest to the side (still faced down). If you are only playing with 2-3 people, feel free to increase the personal pile to 9. Each personal pile should be directly in front of the player to which they belong.

Some people get very picky about their letters, even if they're faced down. Let each player choose their tiles if need be.

, If each player would like to hide their tiles, they can, but it's unnecessary. This is more about working together and getting all the tiles used than anything.

If you'd like, each player can help the other out, too. Player A could say, ""Hey, Juan! That ""S"" of yours could go on the end of ""BANANA."" If you add that, then I can add, ""SUPERB."" This will make the game go much more quickly. However, if you want to have each man on his own, that's fun (and competitive) too.

, If they can't go, they must skip a turn until they can. This encourages each player to tack on a letter or two to other already-formed words, making for a more exciting board.

To keep track of how often a player runs out, consider having them take fewer or more tiles each time. The second time they draw, they could take 8, the third time, 9. This way better, faster players are given a larger load to bare, helping out those who are just getting the hang of it.

, If you'd like, you can make it more competitive by keeping track of who had the longest words, who got rid of their tiles the fastest, or who helped out the board the most. Where do your strengths lie? How about your friends'? And remember -- have fun!"

Alternate moves.,
Acquire territory.,
Employ capturing.,
Finish the game when all territory is claimed.,
Know your terms.",How to Play Go2," Traditionally, black starts first.


Stones can also be placed on the edge, where there is a T-intersection.
Once a stone is placed, it cannot be moved (unless captured and removed).

, This can be done in one of two ways:


Territory is empty intersections that are bordered or surrounded by stones of the same color. Each empty intersection that is completely surrounded is worth one point, or moku. The bigger the territory you surround, the more points you gain.

Corners can be used as a border as well.


You will lose a point if you place a stone inside your own territory.

, Connect your stones together to capture your opponent's pieces.


Stones of the same color on immediately adjacent points are said to be connected, or joined. The connection can be horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal--the connection is along the lines.
Fill all the adjacent points around your players pieces to capture them. Once captured, remove them from the board and keep them in a separate pile.
No empty spaces can be within the border.

, Both players pass and the game is over. Count up how many points (or intersections) each color guards.


Place all captured stones in the opposing players territory. Thus, their score is reduced due to lost intersections.

Therefore, a captured stone is worth two points. One point negated from your opponent's score and one point for the new empty space surrounded upon removal.


Capturing is what makes this game a battle of wits. While gaining territory is the main goal, one must think defensively at all times.

, As this is an ancient Chinese game adopted by the Japanese, there are many words to know.


Liberty - an adjacent intersection
Atari - a state in which a piece can be captured in the next move

For example, ""Your white stone over there is in Atari! Haha!""


Eye - a single empty space inside a group

Suicide - placing a stone where it can be captured
KO - a situation in which a stone about to make a capture can be immediately recaptured, which would repeat the situation endlessly. Capturing cannot immediately take place after a KO.

, In a handicap game, the stronger player takes white, and black places 2-9 handicap stones on the star points before white answers.


For an even game, the colors are determined randomly. Since black has an advantage by playing first, white is compensated by taking komi, an amount of additional points added to white's score at the end of the game.
The amount of komi varies, but most tournaments use values between 5 and 8 points. Sometimes a fractional value like 6.5 is used to avoid ties.

, This should be done by the player with black stones. It traditionally goes in the upper right hand quadrant.


This initial move stakes out which side each player lays claim to.
Handicap stones are considered the first move in a handicap game.

, Remember, the pieces are placed on the intersections of the grid, not the empty spaces on the board.


Either player may pass if they see no benefit to making a move. Passing signals a desire to end the game and count the score.

If both players pass, the game is over.



, There are generally two options: claiming the most territory or invading your opponent's territory by capturing their pieces (turning them into ""prisoners"").


If a player places a stone that removes the last liberty from a connected group of the opponent's stones, then that group is dead and is removed from the board (captured).
The exception to the above rule is that you cannot capture a single stone that just captured one of your stones without playing elsewhere first. This is called the KO rule (""KO"" means ""eternity"" in Japanese); it is needed to prevent games from never ending.

, Black and white must both decide there is no advantage to laying another stone.


The player who has captured the most stones and territory wins. Captured pieces should be placed on the board in the opponent's territory, decreasing their score.

, You can use either area counting or territory counting. The two methods agree provided both players have made the same number of non-passing moves.


For area counting, each color scores a point for each living stone of that color and each empty intersection within their territory. White then adds their komi.
For territory counting, each color fills in their opponent's territory with any prisoners of that color captured earlier in the game. Their score is then only the empty intersections in their territory. White then adds their komi.

Choose a computer software program.,
Create a new blank document.,
Adjust your table.,
Enter the desired information into the squares.,
Print the card.,
Change the order of the terms.,
Print a new card after each change.",How to Make Bingo Cards2," You will need to choose a program which allows you to create ""Tables"" and enter desired information. Some common computer programs which serve this function great are Microsoft Word (and its derivatives), Print Shop, and Google Docs. The first two are traditionally found on PC computers. If you have a Mac, you should look into getting Google Docs or other online word processing programs., There should be a button that says ""Create,"" ""New Document,"" or some variation of those two. If it does not, go to ""File."" Some variation of those terms should be listed there. You will then add a table to this new blank word document. First click ""Insert,"" and then ""Table"" from the drop-down menu. A blank standard table should appear on your word document., Depending on how large/small you want your bingo card to be will determine how you shift the table. After the standard table appears on your blank document, a dialog-box should appear on your screen. Enter in the number of columns you want heightwise, and the number of rows lengthwise. You can then click and drag the sides of the table card to give you more space to write in words., Click on one square at a time. Write in one term in each square. Terms may be words, letters, symbols and/or clipart. You may also wish to include a ""Free Space"" on the card. You can place it anywhere (traditionally placed in the middle) and title it whatever you like., Click on ""File"" then ""Print"" from the drop-down menu. Change the setting of your printer to ""Landscape Style."" The bingo card should be printed on heavy card stock rather than plain printer paper. Make sure this bingo card is only printed once, as you will change the words around in later steps., Go back to the original table and change around the terms. Click and highlight a term. Click either ""Cut"" or ""Copy."" Transfer the term to another box. Use your already printed card to make sure the term does not appear in the same box., Continue changing the order and printing until you have enough cards for each of the players. You may wish to print a few extra cards just in case you lose a card, or you have more players than expected. Look into getting the cards laminated as well at companies such as FedEx, UPS, or your local printing shop. This will increase the durability of your cards."

Draw a large square.,
Divide the large square.,
Fill in your squares.,
Repeat the previous steps.",How to Make Bingo Cards3," Do so on a piece of card stock paper. Use a ruler to help guide your lines. It is best to know ahead of time the number of columns/rows you will be using so that dividing them up later doesn't become to hard. For example, it is best to draw a top line of 10 inches if you wish to have 5 columns. That way you can easily divide them into columns (each column is 2 inches wide). If the top line were 9 inches, and you wish to have 5 columns, the math becomes much more difficult.In traditional bingo games, the top line and bottom line are the same length. However, this is only if you plan to have a traditionally square bingo card.

, On both the top and bottom lines, make a small pencil mark where each column line will be. Connect the corresponding top and bottom marks with a straight pencil mark (use a ruler as a straight edge). On the left and right lines, make a small pencil mark where every row will be. Connect the corresponding left and right marks together using a pencil mark (use a ruler as a straight edge)., You can put a term in each square such as ""dog,"" ""moose,"" etc. You can also put in numbers such as 56, 76, 87, etc. If you wish, you can also put in pictures of terms.Example: If you are making a bingo card for your Spanish classroom, you can put in Spanish words on the bingo card. Then call out English words, and the students will have to match the English word to the correct Spanish word on the bingo card.
Feel free to decorate the card as well. Give the bingo cards a title. Draw designs surrounding the actual square itself. Be as creative as you want.

, Do so until you have enough bingo cards for the entire group of players. On each bingo card the words should be placed in different positions so that no two players have the same cards. If you are only using the square on each piece of card stock, you can cut the square out with a pair of scissors. If you have a design surrounding the bingo square on the rest of the card stock, do not cut out square."

Act Normal.,
Take notes.,
Be prepared to investigate at night.,
Expect the unexpected.,
Do not get caught.,
Lie.,
Have a base.,
Only confront your suspect, when you have PROOF they are the culprit.","How to Be a Detective, Without Being Detected"," If your main suspect is your parent, then be sure to do what you normally do. Let's say after dinner, you always watch TV in the living area. Well, don't be afraid to do that! You shouldn't hide out in your room.;
, A good detective always has notes! Take notes about the person's behavior, and see if there are any changes. If someone catches you taking them, just tell them that you're just randomly writing, or doing homework or extra credit.

, Is there a certain place this person keeps things? Like an office, or study, or even their room? About an hour before your bedtime (if you have one) get supplies and things ready. Make a map of your house, and add any escape routes, or hiding spots. You might also need a flashlight, if you're ready to do some investigating. If the person does have an office or study, you might want to take your notebook, to write down things. You do NOT want to take any of their personal belongings, they might notice that something is gone, and they will get suspicious. Make sure to wear whatever you would wear when you go to sleep. Stay in your room until everyone is asleep, and do not turn on the flashlight near anyone's bedroom. If they have an office or study, just begin to look for any clues to your mystery. Don't be loud, and don't take long. If you have to investigate someone's room, this is a bad idea, especially if someone is asleep in it. If they are a very heavy sleeper, then you might be safe. If they are a heavy sleeper, go quick. You do not want to get caught in their room, if they wake up.

, Never doubt your suspects. The person you think is innocent, could be behind the whole thing.

, Obviously, if you get caught, the jig is up. You could face consequences, wherever you were investigating. In school, perhaps detentions, or suspension, or just a stern talk with your mother. At home, you might get grounded.

, Yes, if you want to be a successful detective without being caught, you have to lie. If you're caught sneaking around at night, don't spill the truth and beg for forgiveness. Simply tell whoever it is, any of the following: I needed water, I had a bad dream (if you are in their room, tell them you had a bad dream and that you were going to tell them, or if it's a sibling, say you just wanted to check if you were still there because it felt so real.) Or, I couldn't sleep.

, Yes, no matter how corny that sounds, you have to have a place where you can keep everything. A place where nobody will figure out. Your room is the best place, however, your suspects could simply walk in, take a look at your notes, and bust you. Find a place where nobody would really look.

, Accusing someone of a crime no matter how big or small without proof, is wrong. If you only have a page of notes about the mystery and this suspect, that is totally not enough. Again, you could face consequences depending on where you are. If you're accusing someone of something big, like a crime, you could get into serious trouble.

Have an objective.,
Figure out how to get it.,
Get to know them.,
Watch them.,
Daydream a lot!",How to Be a Detective Without Looking Obvious," Learn what you want and what you're after. Whatever it is make sure you know what you're going for!;
, Most of the time you will be spying on a person. If this person is in your school, memorize what classes you have with them. Find out where they normally sit for lunch and either sit with them or somewhere near them. Find out what routes they take when they go to class to class. If they are not in your school but are in your neighborhood or a club. Find out their routines and try to stay on top of it. (do not stalk them that is just creepy.)

, If it is a person you are after, get to be their friend. If you hate each others guts, then get to know people who know them. Don't just automatically try to be their best friend, just slowly get to know them and ask a lot of questions.(but don't overdo it!)

, Whenever you can, just watch them, see what they do! Don't stare at them, look at them for a few seconds, then turn away for a few more seconds, then look back. Never let them catch you watching you! Learn how to watch people from the corner of your eye. If they sit underneath a clock, then stare at the clock a lot, (wink wink).

, This may sound super freaky and really dumb, but it works! When you daydream, the problem-solving side of your brain turns on. If you daydream a lot, your job as a detective will be a ton easier! Daydreaming is also were you can think over and analyze all you of the clues you have seen. This may not sound like the daydreaming you're used to, but it does the same thing and is very helpful!

Get a set of cards.,
Figure out how to win.,
Think about how players interact.,
Design the rules.,
Keep all players in the game.,
Write a rule-book.,
Have fun!",How to Make Your Own Card Game1," You can start out with a standard deck of 52 cards or you can use something more experimental, like a tarot card set. You can even design your own cards.


When creating your own cards, you can purchase a sturdy, firm paper and draw your own designs. Alternatively, look online for free design software.;
, The most important thing any game requires is a clear objective, like winning a certain number of hands, collecting all the chips, matching pairs, or getting cards with a certain numerical value in your hand. If you are creating your own card deck, you can even make each card representative of characters, who fight by rolling the dice.


One of the important things to ask when picking a goal is how hard is to achieve. If the game is not particularly engaging, people probably won’t want a single hand to last several hours., In most cases, the real fun in a game is how it encourages you to interact with other people. Generally, card games are meant to be competitive, but sometimes players can cooperate. Some games, like rook, require teams, so that you are both cooperating with someone and competing against another team. Consider the social dynamics that the card game creates or the social skills that it requires. For example, in poker, betting requires that you be able to read other people’s emotions and disguise your own. In rook, you need to be able to communicate with your partner using non-verbal cues. Can you design a game that forces you to interact with the other players in interesting ways?
To make things interesting in a competitive game, ask yourself if there is any way you can directly impact your competitors. It can be fun to ruin your opponent’s hand and it can also keep things competitive when one person is falling behind.
There are also some games, particularly Solitaire that you can play by yourself. To make this sort of game interesting, it is imperative that you design a system of rules that makes it difficult for you to obtain your end.

, This can be one of the most difficult parts of designing a game. The rules should be make it difficult to obtain the winning conditions that you designed earlier. You want a system of rules that makes the game challenging, without being overly complicated.


This is the point at which you really need to ask yourself what you want the challenge to be. Should players be trying to memorize cards that have already been played? Should they be trying to figure out the probability of a particular card coming up? Maybe the game will test reflexes by rewarding the player who can slap a pair quickest when one comes up.A good place to start out is with the rules of games you like. Try to mix and modify rules from other games to make them new and interesting.
Although usually you want the rules to be relatively easy to understand, sometimes getting a full understanding of a complex set of rules can also be engaging. If mastering a complex set of rules is the challenge of the game, consider starting with a basic design that is easy to understand, but then adding special situations and maneuvers where those with a full understanding of the rules have an advantage.

, Your game won’t be very engaging if, after a person takes the lead, they are destined to win. You need to design the game so that a player who is down and out can get back in the game.Maybe after a certain point a player can have the option of trading his worst card with the other player. Alternatively, a lot of good games become progressively harder as you approach the end. For example, in the first round you might only be required to get a pair, but in the final round you might need to get three of a kind and a pair. This allows players who are behind time to catch up.
One good method is to have the player who is ahead dispose of all of his cards during the course of the game. If he needs to finish the game with only one card in his hand, it’ll be harder for him to match his card with the other card he needs.

, It can be easy to forget the rules of a complex game, especially when you’re still working them out. Write them down to make sure that you have a record of what you have come up with.

, Playing isn’t just about having a good time, it’s also part of the creative process. The more you play the more you’ll be able to understand what works and what doesn’t. From there you can make the game better over time, or you can bring what you’ve learned to making your next game.

A game show is a form of a reality show that has a standard format with rules.,
Get a set.,
Have a writer for your show.,
Have camera(s) if you're going to be filming your show.",How to Design a Game Show1," There is a competition between either two or more individuals or between teams. As a game show creator, you must fully understand and outline your game from start to finish. You must plan every detail and establish your blueprint. The best source is a book called The Reality of Reality TV by Dr. Melissa Caudle. In this book, Chapter 6 goes to great lengths on formatting a show and how to design the developmental arcs.;
, You need a place to film your show. If you're performing it live, you could use anywhere like your backyard, your garage door, in your house or anywhere.

, If the show is mostly scripted, have someone write a script, and have a writer to make questions, puzzles, or whatever you'll be using to base your show off of.

, if you're not doing it live, you can use a video editing software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie to make titles and switch camera angles.

Experiment with a lot of games.,
Try strategy games.,

Think about common variations on games.",How to Make Your Own Card Game2," A good place to start when designing a game is with understanding what has worked before. Play a lot of a varieties of games to see how they work and what makes the interesting. Find which ones you like and figure out what it is that you enjoy about them.


Try different categories of games to determine what your options are.
Remember, card games don't necessarily just need to be about cards. You can throw in dice and a board as well.

, Good examples of strategy games include ""Risk"" and ""Settlers of Catan.""Strategy games are meant to test intelligence. They often last for an hour or more and involve slowly accumulating an advantage over your opponent by making astute choices.


While strategy games are typically about gathering strength over time, to make things interesting you should have a method of winning that is quick and unpredictable. So, for example, in chess you can gain a huge strategic advantage over your opponent by taking their pieces. However, one wrong move can always put you in checkmate, so it is possible for a player to come from behind to win.

, In many betting games, like blackjack and poker, you have very little control over whether you win or lose. The point is to calculate how high your probability of winning is and bet according. Sometimes you can scare your opponent into giving up their hand by betting more than they are willing to pay, effectively allowing you to win on the basis of your interactions with the other player, rather than your actual hand.

, Fishing games, like dominoes or casino, give each player a set of cards that they need to lay down. Sometimes there is a deck that is pulled from randomly to create uncertainly. The objective is usually to find a card that matches one that has already been laid down and thereby either allowing you to get rid of or add to the cards in your hand., Often, small changes in rule systems can alter a game significantly. Many games are based on such small variations from other games. Common ways to change games include making certain cards wild, taking some cards out of the deck, and adding or subtracting cards from your hand.

"
Experiment with your game.,
Use design software.,
Find a publisher.",How to Make Your Own Card Game3," Even professional game makers usually start off with a dud. Before you seriously consider publishing a game, play it a lot. Ask other people what they think its strengths and weaknesses are. You might be biased toward believing that it is better than it is.When experimenting make sure that there aren’t any situations where the rules are unclear or simply don’t work. Be sure that games don’t go on for an agonizingly long time or that they don’t stop being competitive before the game is over.
When new people play the game, see if they can understand the rules. If it takes more than one game to understand how things work, the rules might be too complicated., If you want to mass produce your cards, a simple drawing won’t be sufficient, though it might be a good place to start. There are free software programs online that you can use to create jpeg image files that can be sent to publishers for easy and affordable production., There are now websites like www.gamecrafter.com that will produce card sets made from jpeg images that you send them. The process is affordable, approximately $7-$25 for a single card set. It can even cost less if you order in large quantities.Alternatively, look online for a list of board game conventions. Here you can meet some major publishers who might be interested in picking up your game. However, you will need to approach them with a very professional looking game in hand and a good pitch about what makes your game special."

Choose the major themes from the chapters that your upcoming exam will cover, for example.


If this is a recreational game, you can either decide on the categories as a group, or the host alone can choose them.
Whoever is playing the host of this round will be completing the rest of these steps.;
, Write one category on each index card and pin those 6 index cards at the top of a sturdy piece of poster board. Line them up in a single row. Make sure to write legibly (or type and print out the text, if you prefer).


You can also use a marker board if you don’t have poster board on hand.Write the 6 categories at the top of the marker board and draw lines between them to separate the columns.

, The point values range from $100 to $500 in each category, so you will have one card for each of these values – $100, $200, $300, $400 and $500.


Be sure to write legibly, or you could type and print it out if you want it to look extra nice.

, The $100 question should be the easiest one. For instance, if your first category is “Code Names” you could write something like, “James Bonds’ Agent number.” As the host, you’ll need to create a list with all of the answers on a separate sheet of paper. In this case the answer would be, “What is 007?”


Remember, in Jeopardy contestants are given the answer (the clue) and their response should be in question form.
Only the host should work on the answer key.

, Make sure to pin the card so that the $100 side is facing out. Before you pin the card up, you may want to write $100 on the board first, then pin the card over that.


When the host pulls the card from the board to read the clue, the spot will be empty but the point value will stay on the board.
Once you get pretty far along in the game, this will help to give the board a little structure.

, You will follow the same process as before. Remember, the higher the point value, the harder the question should be, so increase the difficulty for this next clue/answer.Pin the $200 card directly beneath the $100 card in Category 1.
The cards will go in ascending order, starting with $100 at the top of the column, and ending with $500 at the bottom.
Make sure to pin the card so that the $200 side is facing out. This will be the practice for all of the clue/answer cards.

, Then follow the same procedure for the rest of the game board until all of the categories have completed index cards pinned up. At this point, the game is ready to play.

Obtain the consent of the person you intend to tie up.,
At no time should the hogtied person be left alone unsupervised.,
Tie the person's hands behind their back.,
Optionally tie the person's elbows together gently.,
Have the person lie down flat on the ground.,
Tie the person's feet together at the ankles.,
On a barefooted person it can also be monitored way more reliably that the blood circulation or nerve pathways will not be cut off by the rope.,
Optionally, tie their legs together, just under the knee.,
Use another rope to tie the bare ankles to the wrists behind the back.",How to Hogtie Someone," Tying someone up without their consent is illegal. It's important to understand that being hogtied can be quite uncomfortable for long periods of time.;
, A rule of thumb is to not leave someone tied up in this position for more than an hour. The bigger or heavier a person is, the shorter he or she will stand a hogtie. Accordingly a rather lightweight person, such as a woman of slender build, can endure a hogtie for quite many hours, some have reported having stayed hogtied over night without any problems. However fatal incidents of full-bodied males are known from police custody. So: keep it safe & sane


Periodically check to make sure the person is breathing easily and comfortable, especially if gags or other bondage implements are being used simultaneously. Under no circumstances is a person to be left unattended, if gags should be used. Again: be safe, first and foremost!

, Gently bring the person's hands behind their back with the palms facing each other, wrists crossed or palms facing outward. Take the rope and wrap it several times firmly around the persons wrists. Tighten the rope by cinching it firmly between the arms.








, Tie right above the elbows pushing them as close together as possible, but tight enough where they won't slip out of place. The degree to which you tie the arms together is up to you, and you can just tie the wrists if you want.


At this point, some people also like to secure the person's hands to their waist, though it's not necessary for a basic hogtie. If you want to, this can be done by wrapping rope around the person's waist/stomach like a belt, and pushing the arms down, so they're unable to shift them up or down, then securing the ropes together with an overhand knot.

, Make them comfortable and ensure that they can breathe easily while lying flat on their stomach in the prone position. Again, check periodically to make the person being tied is comfortable.

, Use the same basic approach you used on the hands and arms, bringing the ankles together, passing rope between the ankles and wrapping each individually, then wrapping them together snugly with the rope.









For best performance, make sure the person is not wearing any footwear but remains in bare feet. Taking away the shoes (and socks if any), it will give you further advantage since the ropes will be placed on the bare skin instead of clothing so they won't slip off. It is easier to tie up a barefoot person in general. In case the captive is struggling, you will run lesser risk of getting bruised by a shod kick. (You can also bring a struggling captive quickly under control by simply grasping some of their toes. Chances are, the person will let you finish to tie them up rather compliantly.)

,


For this purpose it is recommended to check the tactile sense of the toes and soles at regular intervals during a hogtie, which obviously cannot be performed if the person is wearing shoes or even socks.

, Use the same technique as the wrists and ankles, making sure its tight enough that the rope doesn't fall down. This stops their legs from struggling forwards and backwards as well as left and right.

, To finish off the hogtie, first pass a rope through the ankle ropes and the wrist ropes, pulling them together and bringing the ankles up by bending the person's knees. The ideal angle is found, when you stand right in front of the hogtied person and the undersides of their feet are looking right at you if the ankles are relaxed.

Add games of your own invention or alter the games you find above or ones you see at the carnivals.
,Play with family and friends.",How to Build Your Own Carnival Games," If you are going to make one game or a bunch of games, this list will show you how to make all games listed in the introduction.
, Most carnivals have a giant wheel with numbers. People tend to place a quarter on a number and spin a wheel, if the wheel lands on their number, they get all the quarters placed on the numbers. To make money on this game, ask for people to pay $1 and give them a quarter to place on a number. Start by taking a piece of paper and divide it up with the amount of numbers on the wheel, Keep it simple! Just use the wheel from the game of life or make a flat wheel and spin a pencil in the middle., Take a bulletin board and tack balloons onto it. Use darts or sharp pencils to throw at the balloons. Make a line on the ground of where people have to stand to throw the darts., Simply buy rubber ducks from the dollar store and, with a Sharpie, mark numbers on the bottom, 1 for a small prize, 2 for a medium and 3 for a large. Only make a couple medium and one large. Grab a large bowl or container and fill it with one inch of water. Too much water will allow the ducks sink!, Place three paper cups on top of each other like a pyramid. Use a water gun or a Nerf gun to shoot the cups down in one shot.

, At most carnivals, promoters use oval hoops to make it more difficult to get the ball through the hoop. You don't need to do this. Just use a regular net and make the rule, the shot has to go in and be shot underhand!

, You can spend $800 on a real one or be ""creative."" Use a target and a chair, have a person hit the target and their reward is to pour a bucket of water on the person in the chair!,,"
"
Buy the ball of twine before you start to make the bag so that you can be sure of the size.
,



 

Knot the 17 strands of raffia.,Place the raffia strands close together (about half an inch apart).,
Begin with the inner of the two strands closest to you.,
Continue this across the stick until another row is knotted and until twelve rows have been made.,Knot the first two loose strands at the top together, then the two pairs following, and so on until the bottom is reached.,Join the two sides at the bottom by placing them with the meshes and knots evenly together and knotting two strands together each time in a last row of knotting.,Place the twine into the bag and draw the bottom up tightly, with a needle full of raffia.,
Cut the ends of raffia to an even length to make a satisfactory finish.",How to Make a Knotted Bag for Twine,", Hold the stick (or pencil) at right angles with the body, the end resting on a chair or table. Double a strand of raffia and tie it around the stick, as shown in this illustration. Make sure that the knot is drawn up quite close.,, Knot this about a quarter of an inch from the first row of knots, with the strand nearest it in the pair, making an even mesh., When twelve rows are completed, slip the work off and finish.,,,, Or, if you are feeling ambitious, create a tassel to end the twine bag:






Wind a strand of raffia over a card, about 2 1⁄4 inches (5.7 cm) wide, five or six times, then slip it off and bind it around several times near the top with the end of the strand. Sew it fast with a tapestry needle; this forms a little tassel.

Decide what you want to accomplish with your game.,
Have a well-defined goal.,
Make the player’s actions and outcomes consistent with the context of the game.,
Craft easily-understood rules that make the game challenging.,
Provide game balance.,
Offer the right level of difficulty.,
Provide players with a sense of control.,
Give feedback and rewards.,
Provide a “hook” to get people interested in the game.,
Determine whether you want to produce a casual game or a commercial game.,
Produce a prototype.,
Playtest.,
Incorporate feedback as necessary to revise your game.",How to Make a Game," Games are supposed to be entertaining, but most successful and enduring games have a concept or purpose to them beyond simple entertainment. Many games teach and develop physical or mental skills.


Strategy games such as chess, checkers, and mancala can be used to teach critical thinking skills, and in the case of mancala, counting skills as well.
The board game RoboRally, where players play robots navigating their way through moving mazes, teaches logical thinking and programming skills through how players play their movement cards.The card/miniatures game Wings of War teaches similar skills, using cards to represent aerial maneuvers for two players to enact a dogfight.The mobile game Tiny Wings is designed so that players’ bird avatars drift in the air until players touch the screen, at which time the birds plummet.With practice, players learn to control the descent of their birds to build speed, momentum, and score, while developing their timing and motor skills.;
, A game’s goal, object, or way to win should be something that can be easily explained to the players or to anyone else. It should also be precise enough that players can readily recognize when they have won the game.


The goal should also be satisfying to the players. Goals such as eliminating a squad of attackers in a video game, being the first to reach a target score in a board or card game, or ending up with the most money on a television game show can all be satisfying.
Having a well-defined way to win doesn’t preclude allowing other ways to win. While the primary way to win the game Unspeakable Words is to be the first player to reach 100 or more points, it is also possible to win by being the only player to still have at least one sanity token in his or her possession., What the player can do within the game should flow logically from the game’s concept and setting.


In the board game Monopoly, a real-estate trading game, players can buy and sell properties, collect rent, and improve those properties by erecting houses and hotels that increase the amount of rent they can collect. Players also pay income and luxury taxes, and depending on the Chance or Community Chest card drawn, may get tax refunds, stock dividends, or reimbursements for sponsoring the opera; or may pay doctors fees or property upkeep.
In the video game Halo, where the goal is to repel invading aliens of the Covenant from human colony worlds, players combat aliens with a variety of guns and explosives. Weapons act in a realistic manner, as do the players’ avatars, their allies, and their enemies.
Consistency of action also extends to providing clues to the player that something is about to happen so the player can prepare to take an appropriate action. In a video game, this can take the form of a thunder rumble sound effect and depicting hair standing on end to show that a storm is coming. In a card game, this can take the form of showing the icons for the cards the player needs to have to win on the card that states the condition for victory.

, Rules should not stand in the way of players’ overall enjoyment of the game, but they should restrict what the player can and can’t do to force the player to adopt creative approaches to deal with immediate problems and long-term strategies to reach their ultimate goal of victory.


The word game Taboo requires players to give clues to their teammates about a person, place, or thing within a certain time limit. The restrictions are that they cannot use any of the words or phrases listed on the card as forbidden, usually the most obvious words or phrases to describe that subject, or any gestures.This forces players to think of alternative ways to describe that subject.
The card game Fluxx has the deceptively simple goal of being the player holding or showing the cards that meet the goal in play. The complication is that the goal in play can be changed at any time by playing a card, as can the number of cards that can be drawn, played, kept in hand, or kept in front of the players.This forces players to familiarize themselves with the cards in the game, a strategy which is offset by the various themed versions of the game with cards that may or may not be found in the basic Fluxx game.
The television game show “Wheel of Fortune” is essentially a variation of the game Hangman. Its primary complication is that players are permitted to only guess consonants to earn money and must pay money to guess vowels., Providing game balance means that when a game can be won in more than one way, no one way is the “right” way to win. Players should be able, and in some cases required, to make thoughtful decisions about which path to victory they will pursue and be prepared to face the consequences of making a poor decision.


In the board game Game of Life, players can choose various paths at various times in the game. While some paths may be shorter and simpler, longer tracks may offer greater risks and potential rewards. Each player has to decide which path is right for him or her in order to finish the game with the most money.The video game Resident Evil 5’s Mercenaries mode offers players two ways to kill as many zombies as possible in a set amount of time: shooting at range or close combat.Shooting at range is safer, but uses ammunition. Zombies are deadlier when fought in close combat, but each zombie killed in close combat extends the length of the combat, allowing the player to kill more zombies and score more points.
Another form of game balance is allowing each player in a cooperative game an equal opportunity to contribute. Most role-playing games are set up so that each race or character type is better at some things and worse at others, such as a super-strong giant who can throw more devastating punches but is much easier to hit due to its size or a nimble ninja that can be taken out with a single successful blow, but can dodge most attacks.
Still another form of game balance is to provide a way for players to catch up when they are behind. The television game show ‘’Jeopardy!’’ offer several catch-up features: its Double Jeopardy! round, where questions are worth twice as much as in the Jeopardy! round; its Daily Doubles, where players can risk any or all of their score on the question; and Final Jeopardy!, where a player who is behind can still win with a skillful wager.

, The ideal game is one that the players can learn the gist of quickly but be offered a continuing challenge to master completely. No one game can be ideal to all players, because players have differing abilities, according to their ages and interests, but some games can and do provide means to recognize these differences.


Some games market separate versions to different age or experience levels. Monopoly Junior is a simplified version of the Monopoly board game that replaces city lots with amusement park rides, houses and hotels with ticket booths, and Jail with Rest Rooms, but the overall goal is the same as in the adult version.In contrast, Winning Moves offered an expanded version of the game, Monopoly: The Mega Edition that added extra spaces, skyscraper tokens, train depots, and a speed die to enhance play.Some games offer alternate versions with additional challenges. The card game Fluxx has various thematic versions, such as EcoFluxx with its Composting card,or Martian Fluxx with its cards that can negate Creepers or an Ungoal card that can make the game end with no winner.Some games offer expansion sets geared to player’s ability levels or interests. Trivial Pursuit released expansion card “editions” for movie buffs (Silver Screen Edition), music fans (RPM Edition), sports nuts (All-Star Sports Edition), and youth (Young Players’ Edition).The card game Munchkin offers expansion sets that feature new challenges to players already familiar with the original game, as well as blender decks that take advantage of the possibilities raised when two version decks, such as Super Munchkin and Star Munchkin, are combined.A number of video games offer extra levels of play that are “locked” until the player accomplishes a particular objective or acquires a particular object, after which the new level is available for the player to enjoy and be challenged by. In getting to that level, the speed of play may gradually increase as the player becomes more proficient at the game to increase the challenge.
Even if the level of play is designed for one particular audience, you can incorporate in-jokes and references to catch the interest of players outside that audience, such as Munchkin’s artifact cards “The Boots of Butt-Kicking” or the “Staff of Napalm.”These kinds of games are sometimes called “dual-premise” games., Games may have rules where some things happen automatically, such as the can-jump, must-jump rule in checkers, or perform tedious tasks, such as teleporting in video games. Along with the automatic portion of the game, there should be opportunities to make decisions that make them feel part of the game.


In Trivial Pursuit, the distance players can move is determined by the roll of a die. However, player can choose from 2 or more directions in which to move based on their areas of knowledge and how many wedges they still need to earn before claiming victory.
While some role-playing games have players roll dice to determine their characters’ attributes, many others allow players to choose their abilities according to a set limit of character points to spend, further modified by the preference of the game master running the campaign. This system requires more time for players to create characters, but offers greater flexibility in the types of characters available.

, Players should receive some indication of how well they’re doing at the game while they’re playing it. This can be done in several ways.


Awarding and keeping scores is the most common form of providing feedback. Scores can be represented with points, tokens, or currency, which can be added to reward the player or subtracted from or left untouched when the player is unsuccessful. Some games keep several scores, such as Unspeakable Words’ awarding points for making words and using Cthulhu pawn tokens to track sanity,or Monopoly’s use of cash, deed cards, and house and hotel tokens.
Video games make use of slider bars to track players’ progress in the game or the health or energy level of their avatars. Progress bars slide to the right to show how close a player is coming to reach an objective, while health/energy bars slide to the left to show how much stamina or energy a player’s avatar or vehicle has so the player can gauge when to recharge.
Video games also make use of other visual and auditory cues, such as an enemy grunting, grimacing or spurting blood when wounded, or, in the case of Tetris, how high the stack of assembled shapes has become. Board and card games are more limited in the cues they can use for feedback, but it is still possible, as in the board game Boomtown, where a player who acquires three or more mines in the same color group earns a token that designates him or her as “mayor” of the community associated with that color, as well as a victory point at the end of the game if the player maintains that status.

, The “hook” is the element that gets people to play the game, and if you’re selling it, to buy it. The hook can be in one or more of several forms, including these:


A theme. The game Unspeakable Words is themed around the fictional universe created by horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. Its letter cards bear pictures of the Elder Gods of the Cthulhu mythos, and the letters score according to how many angles they contain, referring to these creatures’ many-angled appearance.A rule or game mechanic. The card game The Great Dalmuti, requires players to play the same number of cards of a rank lower than those previously played when it is their turn. However, the deck contains progressively fewer lower-numbered cards than higher-numbered cards. This, along with other rules, favors the player who wins the game to win subsequent games, making it a challenge for the other players to overcome the odds and become the new Great Dalmuti.
A media tie-in. A number of games have been produced related to science fiction franchises such as “Star Trek” and “Star Wars,” as well as for other popular characters on radio, movies, television, and in comic books. “Batman: Arkham Asylum” is Rocksteady Studio’s 2009 video game in which the player takes on the role of Batman trying to escape from Gotham City’s insane asylum to stop the Joker from blowing up the city. The media tie-in extends to having the voice actors from “Batman: The Animated Series” reprise their roles in the game, and to their dialog being written by one of the show’s writers., “Casual game” in this sense means a game you intend to play with family and friends or in a classroom, while a “commercial game” is one you intend to sell.


You can produce a casual board game using cardstock, although you may want to laminate the board if you plan to play the game a lot. You can produce the artwork for the game yourself, by hand or with a computer graphics program, or you can get assistance from a friend, family member, or student.
For a commercial board game, you will need professional artwork, either rendered on a computer or converted to a computer format. You can either work directly with companies that manufacture game boards, tokens, and other game pieces, or you can engage a manufacturers’ liaison to work with individual manufacturers on your behalf. A liaison may cost more upfront, but may prove more cost-effective if problems arise during development. You can produce a casual card game using cardstock or index cards, and, again, you may want to laminate the cards if they will be used frequently. You can do your own artwork or get assistance from a friend, family member, or student.
For a commercial card game, you will again need professional artwork, and the cards will either have to be made from playing cardstock or postcard stock.To produce a computer game, you will need to have some level of computer skill. If you want to produce a module for an existing personal computer game, you can use a software development kit such as the Source SDK, Unreal Development Kit, or Skyrim Creation Kit, depending on which engine the game uses.However, if you want more control than the development kit provides, you will have to learn C++, UScript, or another programming language to write the code to give you that control. You will also need a copy of the game you want to make a module for.
To make a game for the social network Facebook, you will need a Facebook account and an editor program such as Construct 2.You may also need to know a programming language such as HTML.
You can render the backgrounds and three-dimensional images for your computer games with a program such as Google Sketchup, which has an interface similar to that of the level-editing software found in development kits.

, You need to have an actual version of the game ready for people to play, along with a clearly written version of the rules to refer to.


Even if you plan to produce your board or card game commercially, you can still make its prototype out of the same cardboard or cardstock you would use for the casual version.

, Playtesting allows you to see if the game works as you intended it to and solicit the opinions of the people playing it as to how it can be made better.


Computer game software development kits usually include a test mode where you can test the game module itself to be sure it doesn’t crash or act differently than you intended. You’ll want to debug any errors before inviting others to playtest.
Family and friends are a good first source of playtesters, if they are interested in the game. Be aware that their opinions may be influenced by their relationship with you more than how well they like the game itself.
Local game and comic book shops may host gaming groups, some of whom may be interested in playtesting your game. Some cities also have board game cafes and night spots dedicated to gaming enthusiasts.
Many science fiction conventions feature a game track, and there are also conventions devoted primarily to games. The largest of these are Origins in Columbus, Ohioand GenCon in Indianapolis, Indiana,although you may be able to find a smaller game convention nearer you. (A list of game conventions is available at http://www.upcomingcons.com/gaming-conventions.)

, You may need several rounds of design, playtest, and revision before your game is the way it should be."

Choose the colors for your braid.,
Tie strands together at the end.,
Secure the end of your material to something.,
Arrange your colors for a 4-strand braid pattern.,
Arrange your colors for an 8-strand braid pattern.",How to Make a 4 or 8 Part Round Braid1," Decide on the colors that will appear in your round braid. Select just one or two, or up to as many as four or eight different colors, depending on which type of braid you do.


For a 4-strand round braid, one or two colors are typically used in different configurations, but you can use up to four different colors for each strand if you wish.
For an 8-strand braid, typically one or two colors are used to create patterns, but you can use as many as eight different colors for each strand.;
, Tie the pieces of material you will use for your braid together at one end. Use a simple overhand knot (tying all four pieces around themselves) to secure them together.









You can fold over one longer piece of your material to create two strands, in which case you will tie together the loop ends of the folded pieces. Remember that this will create two strands of the same color when you plan out what colors you will use.
Don’t worry about how neat or perfect this knot is, as you will likely redo it or use a fastening instead to complete your final braided item.

, Fasten the knotted end of your strands to an object that will keep them firmly in place while you are pulling and tightening the strands to create the braid. Tape the end to a work surface, loop it over a hook, pin it to your pant leg, or whatever method works for you.








If you prefer to work on a flat surface to help keep your strands in order, opt for taping the end down to a table or other horizontal surface that your material can lay flat on.
If you prefer to keep tension on the strands and hold onto and manipulate them with your fingers the whole time, opt for suspending the end from a hook or an angled surface that you can pull the strands out from.

, Decide on how you’d like your colors to appear once they are braided, and arrange the strands accordingly. Two colors on a 4-strand round braid can create a spiral or diamond shapes, depending on what order the colored strands are in when you begin.


Begin with two strands of the same color in the middle, and the outside two strands in a different color, for a pattern that will look like a spiral. In other words, you can hold one strand of each color in each hand if you are holding onto the strands to braid.
Begin with two strands of one color on the left and two strands of another color on the right for a pattern that will look like diamond shapes or a square with four colored sides. In other words, hold one color in one hand and one color in the other if you’re holding onto the strands the whole time to braid., Decide on how you want your colors to look once included in an 8-strand braid. Arrange the strands according to whether you’d like a large chevron, small chevron, or stripe pattern for your completed braid.


For a two-color wide chevron pattern that appears on two sides of the braid, place two strands of each color on the left (or in your left hand) and two strands of each color on the right (or in your right hand). Four strands of the same color should all be next to each other in the middle.
For a two-color narrow chevron pattern that appears on all four sides of the braid, arrange the strands alternately with a strand of the first color, then a strand of the second color, then a strand of the first color, and so on.
For two-colored stripes down the braid, place all four strands of one color on the left (or in your left hand) and all four strands of the other color on the right (or in your right hand)."

Start with the rope of your choice.,
Bind the three ends together.,
Pass the outside strands across the central one.,
Repeat the outside to in pattern.,
Tie off the rope.",How to Braid Rope1," A three-strand braid is a very common way to braid, perhaps most associated with a classic schoolgirl hair braid. You can use this technique to make a strong braided rope. Braided ropes are appropriate for use in high-friction situations.You can use more or less any type of rope material for this method, including synthetic rope, natural rope and plastic cords. It just has to be flexible enough that you can work with it. If the ends of your strands are frayed, fuse them before you begin.


With a synthetic rope you can fuse the end by holding it over a candle so that it melts a little and fuses together.You can tie twine (dental floss works well) around the end portion of the strand to bind it together. This practice is known as “whipping.”You can also use tape to secure the ends of the strands, and prevent fraying.;
, Use a knot or some tape to securely bind the ends of your three strands. Electrical tape and gaffer tape are good choices, depending on how thick the strands you are using are. Once you have bound the strands together at the left-hand side, stretch out the rest of the rope towards the right-hand end.


The three strands should be lying next to each other and not overlapping to get your starting position.You may find it helpful to label the three strands A, B, and C.
You could also color-code the strands, or use different colors if you want to make a pattern.

, Start by crossing strand A over the central strand B. The order of strands will now be B, A, C. Next cross the other outside strand across the newly central strand, C over A. Now the order will be B, C, A. This is one basic repetition of the braiding pattern for a three-strand braid., Continue repeating this pattern of crossing one outside strand over the central strand, and then crossing the other outside strand over the new central strand.


In this example you would now cross B over C, so that B is the central strand.
Then you would cross A over B so that A is the central strand.
You can continue this pattern until you reach the end of the length of rope., Once you have reached the end of the rope, you can secure the braid by binding the strands together. You can do this by taping the ends together with electrical tape or gaffer, or by tying a strong knot at the end.

"

Tie off your rope at one end.,
Form a loop.,
Cinch your first loop tight.,
Anchor the free end of your line.,
Pass the free end of your rope through the remaining loop.,
Finish the knot with two half-inch locks.",How to Tie a Trucker's Hitch1," You'll want your rope secured at one end to something sturdy, like a cleat in the bed of your truck, a well anchored post, and so on. You'll be using the free end of your rope to create your trucker's hitch, which is based on the slip knot.;
, Create a loop in the line of your rope and hold that loop where the rope crosses itself. You can do this easily by pinching the crossed segment together with your forefinger and thumb. This motion of taking your line around itself to create a loop is called a crossing turn. Then, with your free hand, feed some rope from after the crossing turn through the loop.


You can create a trucker's hitch better suited for extreme loads by creating several crossing in your first loop, instead of only one. This can be done easily by twirling your loop several times.You should only pull enough line through your first loop to create a second loop that emerges from your first. This will only require a few inches of line.

, You can do this by tugging on the side of the second loop feeding toward your anchor and the line that is feeding into your first loop. This should cinch your line and first loop around the second loop so that you no longer need to hold it together with your fingers.


At this point, you should only have a single loop in your line. This loop should stick out of the now cinched tight first loop. This is the slip knot portion of your trucker's hitch., You can do this by passing the tail end of your line around a sturdy object, like a cleat, peg, or secure post. Make sure that whatever you use as your anchor point is strong enough to secure what you are holding with your line.


Pull the line firmly to tighten the knot and make the string between your first and second anchors taut. Too much slack in your line could cause your load to slip or shift., Feed the tail end through the loop until there is no longer any slack in the free end of your line. This will also serve to tighten and strengthen your trucker's hitch knot., These locks are sometimes called hitches. Take your free end around both post-knot strands of your line. Since you have run your line around/through an anchor point and returned it back to the knot to finish the tying, your post-knot rope will have two strands. After taking your free end around both strands...


Keep the free end loose so a loop is formed when you bring it around the post-knot strands. Pull your free end through the loop and pull it tight, then slide this to the base of your main knot. This is your first lock. Then...
Perform the same maneuver after the point you have tied the first lock. This time, when you pull the tail end through the loop, pull it through so the free end protrudes from beneath the two locks.
Pull the knot tight. This kind of knot will be suitable for light to moderate tension in your line. Enjoy using your trucker's hitch!"

Move the rightmost strand underneath the two middle strands.,
Wrap that strand over and between the two middle strands.,
Bring the leftmost strand under the two middle strands.,
Bring that strand over and between the two middle strands.,
Repeat these steps down the length of your material.",How to Make a 4 or 8 Part Round Braid2," Lay out your strands or hold them in your hands so they are separate from each other. Use the strand on the far right and pass it under the two strands in the middle.








If it helps you, you can think about labelling the strands from left to right as A, B, C, and D when you begin. Bring the D strand underneath C and B so that the order is now A, D, B, C.Either place your strands carefully on a flat surface or hold them tightly in your hand, as they must remain in order throughout the braiding.

, Take the rightmost strand that you just moved under the two middle strands. Wrap it over one of those middle strands so that it falls in between the two of them.









If you’re using letters to label your strands, you would be taking the D strand and placing it over B so that it is in between B and C. The order from left to right would then be A, B, D, C.
Tighten the strands up toward your end knot so that the braid stays even. Make sure the strands stay spread out in the same way as when you began, even though some will have changed positions.

, Take the strand that’s on the far left and bring it underneath your current two middle strands. This mirrors the same first step you took with the strand on the right.








Your lettered strands were A, B, D, C from left to right after tightening the first side. You will now take the A strand and bring it underneath B and D. Thus the new order will be B, D, A, C.
Remember to keep all strands carefully in place while you braid, whether laying them out neatly on a table or holding them firmly in your hands.

, Hold the far left strand that you just brought under the two middle strands. Wrap it back over so it falls in the between those two strands.









If following letters from the previous step that ended in the order B, D, A, C: Bring A over D so that it rests in between B and D. The new order from left to right will then be B, A, D, C.
Tighten the strands up toward your end knot to keep the braid looking even. Now you have completed this sequence on both the right and left side. Keep the strands separated in the same way as you begun, even though they are now in a different order.

, Continue moving the rightmost strand under the middle two strands and over to rest in between them, then do the same to the leftmost strand. Repeat these motions over and over until you reach your desired length or the end of your material.









If you forget what side you left off on at any point, you can tell which strand to start with because either the rightmost or leftmost strand will appear slightly higher up where it comes out of your braid. This is the strand to move next.Pause occasionally if you are using very long pieces of material for your braid to untangle them at the ends. Ensure that you don’t lose the order of your strands by holding them down with your hand or another heavy flat object while you gently untangle the ends.

Repeat these steps for the rest of your material.",How to Make a 4 or 8 Part Round Braid3," Lay out and separate each of your strands flat on the table, with four of them to the right, four to the left, and a space in between them in the middle. You can also hold four strands in each hand if you choose to use that method for braiding.


Make sure you pay attention to where colors are placed if you’re going for a certain pattern.
As you start making your braid, you should return to this placement of four strands to the left and four to the right to ensure that the strands stay neat and in order.

, Take the strand that’s on the far right of all eight of your strands. Bring it under the three other strands that you have extending to the right, as well as under two of the strands extending to the left.









If you’d like to use letters to help keep track of the strands, you can label them A, B, C, D . E, F, G, H, with the ""."" indicating the space you should leave between the two groups of strands. Take the H strand and bring it underneath G, F, E, D, and C so that it rests in between B and C. The new order would be A, B, H, C . D, E, F, G.
Keep the strands arranged so that some extend out to the right and some extend out to the left. Once you move the rightmost strand in this step, there will temporarily be five strands on the left and only three on the right.

, Take the strand you just moved underneath five other strands and bring it back over the last two. This will place the strand back over with the group of strands on the right, but in a new position toward the middle.









With lettering, take the H strand from its position between B and C at the end of the previous step. Wrap it over C and D to rest next to E on the right side. The new configuration would be: A, B, C, D . H, E, F, G.
Tighten the strands by pulling up toward the end knot. It’s essential that you keep four strands on the right and four on the left, even though you’ve changed the positions of the strands slightly.

, Pick up the strand on the far left of all your strands and bring it under the three others on the left, as well as two of the strands on the right. This repeats the same thing you did with the rightmost strand, this time on the left side.









With lettered strands after the previous steps, the order was A, B, C, D . H, E, F, G. Now, take the A strand and bring it under B, C, D, H, and E so that it rests between E and F.
Just like on the first side, this will temporarily make it so that there are now five strands on one side (the right this time) and only three strands on the other (the left this time).

, Take the strand you just moved from the left and under five other strands. Wrap it back over the last two strands so that it resumes its place with the other three strands on the left, but now in a new position toward the middle.









With lettering, you’ll move the A strand that you placed between E and F previously. Take it over E and H so that it rests on the other side next to D. The order then becomes B, C, D, A . H, E, F, G.
Tighten the strands up toward the end knot and you have now completed the same thing on both sides. Keep four strands on the right and left like you do to begin, even though they are now in a different order.

, Continue moving the rightmost strand under the next five strands and back over the last two, then do the same to the leftmost strand. Repeat these motions over and over until you reach your desired length or the end of your material.









If at any point you forget what side you left off on, the strand to start with is the rightmost or leftmost strand that appears slightly higher up where it comes out of your braid.Pause to untangle your strands if you are using long pieces of material. Keep the order of your strands by holding them down with your hand or another heavy flat object while you gently untangle the ends.

Start with flexible cord.,
Join the ends together.,
Cross the middle strands together.,
Cross one end over the middle.,
Weave the remaining end in.,
Repeat this pattern down the length of the rope.,
Join at the other end.",How to Braid Rope2," This technique requires four pieces of cord with good flexibility, since you will be braiding together multiple strands, so you need to ensure whatever type of rope material you use is flexible enough for you to work with. It will be hard to get a tight braid with something that is too stiff.


A four-strand braid is a good choice for a high-friction use, such as in winches and pulleys.Ensure that each strand is fused at the end, either by melting the end of a synthetic rope, or by tying or taping a natural rope.The extra strand over a three-strand brand should make the rope thicker and stronger.

, For this braiding technique, you will need to knot or fuse together four strands of rope. There are a few different ways to do this, but the easiest is to simply tie a knot joining four pieces of rope together at one end. You could also secure them with some electrical tape or gaffer tape.You can work with four separate pieces of rope, or you could bend two pieces of rope in half and treat the two ends of one piece as two strands, thereby giving you a total of four strands.
You can also use eight strands of rope as long as you work in bunches of two, essentially treating two strands as one.
For the sake of this tutorial, the four strands will be labelled as A, B, C, and D. Strands B and C are the centre two strands.

, Cross strand C over strand B. Wrap C around B so that it first crosses over B before eventually winding underneath it and back to its original position in the cluster.


When you are finished with this step, the ends of all four strands should still be in the same order they were in at the start.
The order should be A, B, C, D., Bring strand A over strand B. Do not cross A over C. At the end of this step, the order of the strand ends should be B, A, C, D., Pass strand D underneath strand C. Bring it up from the other side of C and pass it over Strand A. Do not cross D with B.


At the end of this step, the order of the strand ends should be B, D, A, C.
You have completed one braiding block at the conclusion of this step., Follow the same pattern used to complete the first braiding block down the length of the rope until you make the braid as long as you need it to be or until you are nearly out of rope.At the start of each round, re-label the strands as A, B, C, D according to the order they are now in.
Wrap C around B.
Bring A over B.
Cross D under C and over A.

, Once the braid is complete, you need to join the four strands at the finishing end of the rope. You can fuse them together or create a knot to hold them in place."
"
Start with a flexible single cord.,
Make a loop with the rope.,
Pass one free end through the loop.,
Twist the loop.,
Pass the end through the newly created hole.,
Repeat down the length of the rope.,
Tighten the braid.",How to Braid Rope3," A single braided rope offers the strength of braided rope, but is more lightweight as it involves only one strand. A synthetic or natural rope could work, but it has to have a high level of flexibility so that you can work with it. A stiffer cord will not really work with this method. It can be any length depending on what you want to use it for.


Single-braided ropes are often used for rigging and pulling and climbing.Do not use a rope you have made yourself for climbing unless you have had it checked out by an expert who can vouch for its suitability and safety.

, If you are doing a single rope braid, you will be braiding a section of the rope. When you know how long you want the braided section to be, make a loop in the rope that is about that size.


You can do this just by sliding the two ends of the rope towards the centre.
For this example, have the right side of the rope above the left side., Once you have your loop, bring the end of the rope from the right-hand end up and through the left-hand side of the loop in an over and under movement. Your main loop should now have a smaller loop on the left-hand side and the right-hand end of the rope should be below the loop., Bend the top of the loop down so that it crosses over the bottom end of the original loop. Make this crossover near the first braid of your rope and not toward the open end of the loop. This will create the beginnings of a braid-like pattern and create the hole that you will then pass the right-hand end of the rope through.


As you cross the rope over itself, the original top portion of the loop should cross back over the original bottom portion of the loop, just a short distance away from the new intersection you created.
As a result, a new, smaller loop or hole should form just past the original link of your braid., Insert the right-hand end of the rope through the hole you just created in the previous step. This action forms another link in the braid.


The right-hand end of the rope will go through the hole by going over the bottom portion of the loop and under the top portion of the loop.
The right-hand end should now be angled upward, above the rest of the rope., You will need to continue making new, small loops from the larger loop by twisting the rope, and then weaving the right-hand end of the rope through the holes that are created. The braid is complete once you no longer have enough of the large loop to work with and use for the creation of new sub-loops.

, When you twisted the loop for the last time, thread the right-hand end of the rope through the final small loop. Carefully pull on both ends of the rope to tighten the braid."
"
Start with a flexible single cord.,
Make a loop.,
Push the long side through the loop.,
Turn the u-shaped part into a new loop.,
Create another loop.,
Repeat through the length of the rope.,
Pass the end through the final loop.",How to Braid Rope4," To make a Monkey Braid (or Chain Sinnet) you only need a single strand. Monkey braids can add bulk, or shorten a rope. They are often used as a way to store rope without it getting tangled up.You can use synthetic or natural rope, but ensure that the material is flexible so that you can work with it. Plastic cords tend to be quite stiff, which can prevent you from getting a tight single-strand braid.


You can use a Monkey Braid to make a nice looking chain, which returns to a straight rope when pulled.
You often see these braids on dress uniforms.

, For this technique you need to start by making a loop in the rope by pushing the right-hand end of the rope towards the left-hand until a loop pops up. The point where this loop starts will be where the braid starts so ensure that the loops start near to the left-hand end of the rope., Once you have a loop you need to take the rope from the long end (the right-hand side) and push it through the loop. You are pushing the part of the rope that is closest to the loop on the right-hand side. Only use a small section of the rope.You should be pulling a small U-shaped portion of rope through your initial loop to create a second loop.
Pull it down, through the loop and out, tugging it toward the working side of the rope to tighten it slightly.
Note that it is easier to tighten each loop as you work when using this braiding method. Trying to tighten the loops once you finish the entire braid can cause the braid to be loose and uneven overall.

, Once you have pulled the u-shaped part of rope through the loop pull it to the right hand side so that is in line with the braid and the loop that you just pulled it through., Pinch another section of rope from the working end (the right-hand side), again making sure that it is directly next to the loop you just created. Push it under, through, and out of the loop on the end of the braid, tugging gently to secure it., The rest of the braid is completed simply by making new loops from the working side of the rope and pulling those loops the larger loops. Pinch another section of rope from the working end. Push this section under and through the previous loop made in the rope.


Repeat this as necessary down the length of the rope., When you have enough braids in the rope, create one special final loop to pass the finishing end through. To create a locking loop at the end pass the working end (right-hand end) of the rope over the top side of the last loop and through it.Pull snug on both loose ends of the rope to tighten the braid securely.

Do this twice, and be sure to leave yourself extra line in each turn so both form loops large enough for your rope to pass through., Take a few inches of your rope from the line after the crossing turns and pull it through both loops. Leave enough line after the second of your two crossing turns so that when you tighten your line there are loops both above and below the turns., Just as you'd do with a normal trucker's hitch, you'll want to take your line around an anchor point and bring it back to the free end oriented part of your knot. Pass your line through the loop there and pull tight.This modified trucker's hitch is good for light to moderate tension, but it is susceptible to failure under extreme duress. You might want to choose a different knot for especially heavy loads., Just as you would do for a normal trucker's hitch, you can create simple locks (also called hitches) in the line at the free end oriented part of your knot. Simply take your free end around the double strands of your line at the base of the knot and...


Leave enough slack in your line to form a loop. Take your free end through the loop and pull it tight, sliding the lock to meet the base of your knot.

Watch out for the tail ends of the knot when using the zeppelin knot.",How to Tie a Zeppelin Knot," The tails of each rope should be facing one another. The two ropes should form roughly a straight line, with a small break in between the line.


If you're working outside, you may not be able to find a flat surface. Simply look for the flattest bit of ground you can find.
Check your rope for any knots or tangles. These should be undone before beginning your zeppelin knot.;
, As you loop, place the tail of the left rope over the rest of the rope, forming a q-like shape. It's very important the tail end goes over, and not under, the rest of the rope.








It may be difficult to maneuver tougher kinds of rope. You may have to use both hands, using one hand to keep the excess rope down as you form your loop.
If necessary, ask a friend to hold the rope in place as you loop.

, You're doing essentially the opposite with the right rope, forming a mirror image of the left rope. When you finish with your loop, pass the tail end of the right rope under the remaining rope.








Your loops must be the opposite of one another. One rope should have the tail passing over the remaining rope, while the other rope should have the tail passing under.
A zeppelin rope will not tie correctly if the two loops are not mirror images of each other.

, It's very important that you place the left loop on top of the right loop and not the other way around. The loop with the tail end passing over the remaining rope should always be on top. In other words, the loop with the tail end on top of the excess rope goes on top of the loop with the tail end on the bottom of the remaining rope.








It may be necessary to have a friend hold the ropes in place as you continue with your knot.
Check several times that the correct rope is on top. A zeppelin knot will not tie correctly if the left rope is not on top, and this could be dangerous if you're using it to secure heavy loads.

, Remember, the left loop is the rope on top of the stacked loops. Pass the tail end of the left loop under the circle formed by the two ropes. Do not pass the tail end of the left rope over the circle.








You always want the tail end passing over the rope to pass under the two stacked circles.
You may have to have someone hold the stacked ropes in place as you complete this process.

, Once again, you'll be mirroring the left rope with the right rope. Take the tail end of the right loop and pass it through the circle. This time, pass the tail over the two stacked loops rather than under. If you pass both tails under the loops, the zeppelin knot will not work correctly.








If necessary, have a friend hold the stacked ropes in place again.

, The process of finishing up your knot is simple. Pull on the longer ends (i.e., not the tail ends) of the two ropes. Pulling on the tail ends will undo your progress.








Keep pulling until the knot is tight and secure. This may take a few seconds.
The knot should be a small bundle of intersecting loops, with the two tail ends sticking out to the left and the right.

, One of the advantages of the zeppelin knot is that, while it's secure, it's very easy to untie. Tugging on the two loops at the center of the knot should undo your knot. It should come undone with a light amount of pulling.If you're using the loop to secure a heavy load, the load must be safely on a solid surface before undoing the knot.

, If you're using the zeppelin knot, test it out first to assure it's tied correctly. Pull on both ends of the knot, not the tail ends, with considerable pressure. The knot should not come undone. When done correctly, the zeppelin knot is very secure, but it's very easy to make a minor mistake. If you, for example, place the wrong loop on top, or pass one tail over instead of under, you'll end up with a final product that looks similar to a zeppelin knot but lacks the stability.If your knot is not secure, redo the process and go slower this time. You may have accidentally made a minor mistake along the way.
Never use a zeppelin knot that seems loose to secure a heavy load.

, The zeppelin knot can be used in a variety of situations. You can use it to secure heavy loads by tying together cables. You can also use it to secure slippery, synthetic rope together, as this rope may be resistant to other types of knots., If you're using pointy or harsh rope, be careful. The tail ends of the knot will stick out to either side.


Avoid contact with the tail ends if you're using harsh rope, as they could poke or scratch your skin.
You may want to handle a zeppelin knot with gloves.

Take two ropes and lay the right-hand rope over the other.,
Wrap the right-hand rope under the left-hand rope.,
Bring the right-hand rope back over the left-hand rope.,
Bring the original right-hand rope over the other rope.,
Pull the original right-hand rope under the other rope.,
Pull on both ends firmly to tighten.,
Check your square/reef knot.,
Undo the knot by pulling the loops outward.",How to Tie a Square Knot1,"









To make this knot, you need two strings, ropes, etc. Alternatively, you can use the opposite ends of a single rope.
In our example, we'll lay the right-hand rope (the orange one in the graphic above) over the left-hand rope (the yellow one). However, if you lay the left-hand rope over the right-hand rope instead, you can still get a square knot if you reverse all of the following directions.;
,









The end of the right-hand rope should now be pointing out to the left (and vice versa.)
Note that the first two steps for making a square knot are the same as you'd use for tying your shoes.

,









This is, again, identical to how you would begin tying a pair of shoes.
At this point, you should have what is known as a half knot.If you were to repeat the steps above again, you'd get a standard overhand knot.

,









Notice that the rope going over the top is still the orange rope in the graphic above. The end of this rope will be on the left at the start of this step, but it's still the rope that was originally on the right, so it's the rope you'll lay over the top here.

,









This is virtually the same as in Step 2, just going in the opposite direction since the original right-hand rope is now coming from the left.

,









Try to pull all four ""slack"" lengths of rope with equal force. If you don't, the knot may not hold its shape and may even come apart as you tighten it.

,









From the front, your square knot should look like the one in the graphic above. You can also find good reference images at AnimatedKnots.com and other knot sites.If you have tightened the rope correctly, you should see that it forms a neat, even knot from two loops with one loop wrapping around the base of the other.

,









Untying the square knot is simple — just grab the round part of each loop in your hands and pull in opposite directions. The knot should come apart easily.

Make an S-shape.,
Form loops.,
Pull the bights through the loops.,
Tighten the knot.",How to Tie a Sheepshank2," Twist a flat piece of rope by bringing one end up and the other down. The rope forms two curves called bights between the flat middle section and the upper and lower ends that point in opposite directions.The middle part is the section that has no tension. If your rope is damaged, keep the damaged part in the middle.

, Take one end of the rope. Twist it backwards and over itself to form a loop. Repeat with the opposite end. The rope will still resemble an S except the ends are coiled.







, Pick up the curved part of the S, the bight. Hold the nearest loop still with your other hand and move the bight under and through it. Repeat with the other end. You’ll have rope crossing at both ends, leaving the loops sticking out like handles.








, Grasp one of the loops in each hand. Pull them in opposite directions away from your body until the loop is as tight as desired.

Double up the left-hand rope to make a loop.,
Put the end of the right-hand rope through the loop.,
Bring the right-hand rope under the bottom of the loop.,
Bring the right-hand rope over the two ropes at the base of the loop.,
Bring the right-hand rope under the top of the loop and pull it through.,
Pull all four ends tight with even tension.",How to Tie a Square Knot2,"









Start with one rope in each hand (as you would in the method above) and fold the left-hand rope on top of itself to make a good-sized loop.
This method will make a knot that's identical to the one in the method above.
As above, you can make a loop with the right-hand rope and reverse the directions to get the same knot.

,









For the next several steps, you may want to curl your left index finger around the base of the loop to keep it together for convenience's sake.

,









Thread the right-hand rope through the loop. Pull it down and through — it should pass under the bottom half of the left-hand loop.

,









Next, pull the right-hand rope (the one that's threaded through the loop) and bring it up over the two ropes that come together at the base of the loop. If you're holding the loop in your left hand as directed, these should be at the left side of the loop.
When you're done, the right-hand rope should be above the loop.

,









Finally, take the end of the right-hand rope (which is now to the left of the loop) and put it under the top part of the loop. This mirrors the motion you made earlier on the bottom half of the loop.
At this point, the right-hand rope should be back ""inside"" the loop. Pull it through to complete the knot.

,









Congratulations! Your knot should be exactly the same as the one you made in the method above.

Add extra half knots for added support.,
Add an extra coil in the first half knot to make a surgeon's knot.,
Try using loops (rather than individual ropes) for the entire knot.",How to Tie a Square Knot3,"









To make your square knot a little stronger, skip the ""pull tight"" step in either of the methods above above and instead repeat the over-and-under half knot pattern to create an additional half knot on top of the square knot. You can ""stack"" as many of these half knots as you'd like to give your knot additional strength.
Note that even ""stacking"" square knots in this way won't make your knot safe for critical usage. Don't use square knots (even stacked ones) for securing heavy loads or dangerous objects — they can (and do) fail.Instead, use a more secure knot like a Carrick bend or a Double Fisherman's knot.,









Another way to make your ordinary square knot a little stronger is to make what's called a surgeon's knot. To do this, after you wrap your right-hand rope over and under the left hand rope the first time, wrap it over and under again to create a second coil.
After this, repeat the rest of the steps exactly as you normally would. You don't have to add an extra coil when you make the second half knot.

,









If you have long lengths of rope to use up (like, for instance, if your shoe laces are too long), you may want to try making a square knot with loops of rope (also called ""bights"") rather than single lengths of rope.
To tie this variation, simply start with one loop in each hand and treat each as you would treat individual ropes in the standard square knot instructions. In other words, the right-hand loop becomes the right-hand rope and the left-hand loop becomes the left-hand rope and the instructions are followed identically.

Pull the tagline through the loop you’ve created.,
Pull the tagline through the smaller loop.,
Start to tighten the loop you made.,
Create another small loop.,
Pull end 1 through the smaller loop from behind.,
Tighten the final loop.",How to Tie a Fisherman's Knot," This is the end of your line and the part that will be doing the knot tying. Designate the end of your rope before you start.;
, This is the rest of your line that would run up toward a reel if you were fishing, or a cinch if you were rock climbing. Basically it is all the middle section of your rope.

, The turn is when the end of the rope – the tag end – passes completely around the standing line. Some call this a wrap. , The end in your left hand is end 2, and the end in your right hand is end 1. End 1 will be doing the knot tying, so recognize this as the tag line. Make sure you give yourself plenty of slack. It’s helpful to have a lot of string or rope to work with as you learn.

, You want to cross them so that end 2 lies over end 1. The end of the tagline (end 2) will be behind the loop you have created and pointing downwards. You can leave a short tail or a long tail depending on how much rope you have. To start, make sure that you have at least six inches of rope to do the tying. This means that you should have six inches of rope above where you crossed it.

, You've crossed your two lines, so one line should be dangling over the other. Take the dangling piece and start to wrap it around the other piece. As you do this, the part of rope that you originally crossed will form start to form a loop. So instead of wrapping that dangling piece (end 2) around end 1, pull end 2 through the loop and up to the left. This will create a smaller loop on top of the larger loop underneath. Keep the loops loose so you’re able to get the line through the hole.

, Using your right hand pull end 2 through the smaller loop. You should enter the smaller loop from the back and pull up to the front.

, You can tighten the loop by pulling the tagline with your right hand and end 1 with your left hand. End 1 will be next to the bigger loop at this point. This will create a knot on top of your larger loop. End 1 should be able to slide back and forth enabling you to adjust the loop the appropriate size. If you have ever tied a tie before, it’s a similar concept to the tightening of a tie.

, To continue tightening your knot pull end 1 through the large loop from behind. Imagine a tie that has already been tied. If you were following instructions to make a tighter fisherman's knot you would take the bottom of the tie and stick it in through the top of the knot that is holding your tie in place. Once you've done this pull the line upwards once again. This will proceed to make another create a small loop on top of the larger loop you just pulled your rope through..

, Make sure you pull it through the loop from behind. Pull the loop to tighten it using your left hand.

, Just like you tightened the first knot, tighten this knot by pulling the larger loop from either side. If you plan to undo your work and try again then you probably shouldn’t pull too hard or it will be hard to untie the knot.

Gather a standing line and a loop.,
Shape the loop into a thin oval.,
Place the loop underneath the standing line.,
Fold the long end on top of the standing line.,
Loop the long end beneath the standing line inside of the loop’s short end.,
Repeat two more times, coiling inwardly each time.,
Loop the long end over the standing line then under the shorter end.,
Pull on the long end to tighten the knot.",How to Tie a Prusik Knot," The standing line needs to be about twice diameter of the loop. For example, if your loop is 6mm (about a quarter of an inch) thick, the standing line should be at least 12mm (about half an inch) thick. The standing line will support the knot and the loop will form the knot around the standing line. You can buy a standing line and a Prusik loop at a local sporting goods store or on Amazon.You can also form your own loop with a cord that is about 5ft (about 1.5m) long and 5-6mm (or .2in) thick. To join the ends, tie a double fisherman’s knot.The standing line can be a simple climbing rope. Climbing ropes come in all different lengths, depending on what you will use it for. If you wish to cover significant distance, get one that is at least 100ft (about 30m) long. For shorter distances, a 25ft (about 7.5m) rope would work well.;
, You will want to elongate the loop as opposed to keeping it rounded. This will help you to distinguish between the long and short side of it., It should be off center and perpendicular to the standing line. Lay the loop flat underneath the standing line and let the standing line rest on top of it. If your loop has a knotted end, make this the long end and the other end will be the short end. By placing it off center, you will be able to see which side you are looping more easily. The long end will be looped and the short end will stay in place, so it is important to distinguish between the two., At this point, you can slightly widen your oval so that there is sufficient space for the loops to move inwardly. Simply fold the long end over the standing line. The fold should be very close to the standing line, wrapping above it. Let the loop rest on top of the standing line. Make sure to keep the short end in place., Take the long end and place it inside of the short end of the loop. Pull the long end underneath the standing line over to the opposite side. This is the first coil of your knot. The coil should have formed inwardly towards the center, as this knot is made from the outside in. Keep the short end in place. It will never move; only the long end will wrap., Continue to wrap the long end of the loop inwardly around the standing line at least three times in total. Each time, you will wrap the long end of the loop over the standing line, then through the small end of the loop on the inside of your previous coil, then underneath the standing line over to the other side. Your wrap will get narrower each time, so make sure to start with enough space for at least three inward coils. The windings will never overlap but will coil inwardly instead.A three-wrap Prusik is standard, but a Prusik can be formed with only two wraps or up to five. If there is not a large difference between the diameter of the loop and the standing line, you will need to wrap the loop more times, up to five. But if there is a good difference in diameter between the two, the standing line being at least twice as thick, a three-wrap Prusik will suffice., This will finish your knot. Do not go all the way around the standing line. Simply fold the long end on top of the standing line and place it underneath the small end of the loop., Once the long end of the loop is tucked under the shorter end, simply pull on the long end and the knot is complete. It will hold in place and will slide with ease up and down the standing line when there isn’t pressure applied, but will grip tightly to the standing line when pulled."

Create the patterns for the base and sides of the pyramid using construction paper.,
Cut the patterns for the base and sides, including the flaps.,
Paint the exposed sides of the pyramid with a sandy color.,
Glue the pyramid together.,
Finished.








",How to Build a Model Pyramid1," It's easiest to make an equilateral pyramid, meaning the sides of the structure are all the same size.









Fabricate the base. Pyramids have 4 sides, so you will need a square base. Pick a size, say 6 inches (15.2 cm) by 6 inches (15.2 cm). Measure the dimensions with a ruler and draw an outline for the base on your construction paper.
Measure an additional 1/2 inch out from all sides of the base and draw the outlines. These extensions on each side of the base will provide flaps that you will use to secure the base of the pyramid to its sides. Fold the flaps so they extend upward from the base.
Measure and cut the 4 triangular sides of the paper pyramid. Make the base and sides of each triangle the same width as the base of the structure. In this model, they should be 6 inches. Also measure and draw in flaps on the right side of each triangle, just as you did for each side of the base.;
, Use a straight edge to make a precise fold along each flap.








, While the paint is still wet, cut horizontal and vertical lines at regular intervals with the edge of a piece of paper. This will give the effect of individual stones in your pyramid project.








,









Apply glue to the outside edge of one of the flaps on the base and press a triangle onto it. Repeat with the other 3 sides.
Dab glue on one of the triangle flaps and join it to the section to the right. Gently force the 2 sections inward so their apexes meet. Continue with the next connection, again making sure the tops of the triangles form the summit of the pyramid. When connecting the third and fourth sides of the structure, put glue on both of the remaining flaps. Join the 2 sections on the left first and then pinch the last junction together.
Make sure the tips of the 4 triangles meet, forming the pyramid summit. Dab a bit of glue at the top. Then gently place a thin wire ring on the pyramid. It should be narrow enough to rest about three-quarters of the way up the pyramid. This will help hold the tips together while the glue dries.

Select materials that will be strong enough for your needs.,
Cut the angle iron and steel plate in sizes listed above, making sure edges are square and straight.,
Lay the 7""X42"" piece on top of the 14"" piece with the front edges flush, and an equal space on each end.,
Align one of the 14"" angles on each end of the 7"" wide (top) piece of plate so it overhangs the front edge about 1 inch (2.5 cm), and weld them to the 7"" wide plate.,
Lay the 42"" piece of 2"" angle iron on top of the 7"" wide (top) plate, centering it between the two end angles in the center of the sheet with the angle up, and weld it in place, with at least one inch welds on each edge 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.,

Drill 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) holes 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) beyond the front edges of the 7"" plate through the 14""X2"" angles where they overhang the front of the plate just above the bottom flange of the angle iron.,
Weld one of the smooth 1/2 rods into one of the notches you cut into the 2 1/2"" angles, it should extend 3/4"" (or more) beyond the end of the angle.,
Fit the pin (1/2 smooth rod) you just welded onto the angle into the socket you drilled earlier, then line the other notch up with the socket on the opposite end so you can fit the other pin into place, then weld that pin to the angle iron.

,
Notch the steel pipe 5/16"" wide by 2"" deep so it will slide over the top angle to create a handle to operate the braking angle you just installed.,
Turn the brake over (it will be heavy) and place the 1 1/2"" X 48"" angle near the front edge of the 14"" wideX48"" piece of steel plate and weld it the same as the upper stiffener.

,
Mount the brake on saw horse or your workbench with a few inches hanging over to allow the brake and slide a piece of sheet metal between the 7"" and 14"" plate, snug the bolts down to clamp it, and pull the pipe handle towards you to bend the metal.

",How to Build a Small Sheet Metal Brake," 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) steel plate with bracing will enable you to bend 14 gauge galvanized steel sheet metal in lengths up to about 3 feet (0.9 m), which is the size and specification for the project described in this article. Here are some materials used to build this particular brake.


1/4 cold rolled steel plate, one piece 7""X42"", one 14""X48""

1/2""X1 1/2"" smooth steel rods, 2 required;
, Lay the 14"" wide plate on saw horses or a workbench so the remaining pieces can be fitted.

, Clamp these if desire to prevent them from shifting during the next steps.

, These will act as the clamping hinges when the brake is assembled.

, This will stiffen the plate when a piece of metal is clamped in the brake.

, The location of these bolts isn't critical, but it will look better if they are in line with each other and on each end. Install one of your 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) bolts into each hole, bolting the angle to the plate loosely.

, The exact location of these will be determined by the alignment of the brake, as you will find later, but you should be able to center your 1/2 rods in the center of the corner of the angle.

, These are the sockets the hinge pins will fit into.

, Keep it as straight as possible to the corner of the angle iron so it can swivel freely when it is installed.

Color the large ball with blue marker or paint to represent the oceans and green or brown paint to represent the continents. This will give your model character and and make it more realistic. It will also help others to understand what they are looking at when they see your model.

, The smaller of the two balls can be colored grey. You can add black dots and circles to denote the craters that are scattered across the moon’s surface. Some people also choose to color the moon yellow, just make it clear that it is not the sun.


The relative size of the objects should be a reasonable indication that your model contains the moon and not the sun. The sun is much larger than the earth or moon.

, In order to fix your model so that the earth and moon are always in the place you want them to be, you will need to put each ball on a stick. If you’ve used the styrofoam balls, this will be rather easy. Just slide the a metal, plastic, or wooden stick through the center of the ball so that it stands on the stick.


There is no need to push the stick all the way through.

, You can place the balls any distance apart. However, if you want to make the model to scale, you will need to measure the distance more precisely. The objects should be separated by a distance of nine and a half times the earth’s circumference. Measure this distance with a ruler or tape measurer.


For example, if your earth is four inches in diameter, the moon should rest thirty-eight inches from the earth. That is 3 feet and 2 inches.

, Once you have measured the appropriate distance for your objects, it is time to mount them. Use nails, screws, or glue to set the sticks on a board. This will allow you to move the model without it coming apart.

, To do this you will need a flashlight or a lamp. Cast a solar eclipse by shining the light onto the moon ball. This will create a shadow on the Earth ball.Make sure that the lights in the room are turned off so that you can see the shadow.

, To do this you will do the opposite of what you did to cast a solar eclipse. Use the flashlight or lamp to cast a lunar eclipse by shining the light onto the Earth ball. This will create a shadow on the moon ball., The moon orbits the earth on a cycle of approximately 28 days. This generates the tides in the ocean and allows us to see different stages of the moon (half moon, full moon, etc.). The earth holds the moon in its gravitational orbit and prevents it from drifting off into space.

, When your model is not in use, you can hang it from your ceiling. This makes a good decoration and displays your model. To do this, you can tie a string around the middle of your model and hang it, or you can screw or glue a hook to the center of the model for hanging.

",How to Build Model Buildings," Whether it is from your imagination or down the block, you will need to have a strong mental image of what it is you will be creating.;
, Using a ruler, graphing paper, and a pencil, draw what each observable side of the building would look like. If possible, refer to photographs of the original building you are aiming to recreate. Remember to also refer to your other drawings and the grid lines to ensure that the heights and widths of certain architectural features are represented consistently.

,, Using a sharp cutting tool like an X-acto knife, carefully cut the walls of your card stock model out. Remember to separate walls that will be standing apart from one another. You will also want to cut out any windows or openings at this time.

, Lay the walls out over a piece of cardstock so that the bottom corners of each adjoining wall touch. Use this as a guide, trace out your cardstock floor. For this project you will want to expand this line out one or two centimeters and cut it free from the rest of the cardstock. Additionally, you will want to create a few holes near the middle of the floor section that you will be able to get your fingers through for later.

, Using the discarded cardstock from before, glue tabs to the inside of your model building's walls. These will be used shortly to hold the model together. Remember to add a few tabs on each wall section to connect to the floor and the roof

, With the tabs folded inward, use a strong craft glue to hold the walls together. Be mindful that the bottom of both pieces are straight and line up correctly.

, Because many roofs are angled, the actual dimensions of the roof can be skewed when viewed from the side. However with the walls of your model now in place, you do not need to worry about calculating lengths for roof pieces. Lay a folded sheet of graph paper, ideally along one of the gridlines, on top of your model's walls so that it mimics a roof and sketch out the extent you want the gables to extend.

, From the graphing paper, copy the roof plan from your drawing onto cardstock and cut it out. It is generally easier if you do not cut the peak of the roof but fold it, instead.

, Turning the house over, you can easily align the roof and wall sections so that they sit well together. Carefully attach the floor section on once the roof-to-wall tabs have dried.

, Being careful not to cover up the windows or other openings. Pinch the corners together gently so that the clay bonds or holds.

, The clay allows you to recreate any and all distinctive textures on the walls of facade of your model building. Do not cut deeply into the clay and be mindful of the scale of your model. Refer to photos or the drawing you made on the graphing paper originally.

Find your materials.,
Glue down your base layer.,
Continue to the next layer.,
Repeat until you cap the pyramid with a single cube.,
Fill in the pyramid, if you want to.,
Paint the pyramid.,
Place sand around the pyramid.,
Let everything dry.,
Enjoy your pyramid!",How to Build a Model Pyramid2," You'll need sugar cubes (at least 100, more if you want to make it bigger/taller), a flat piece of cardboard (~1'x1', larger if your pyramid will be bigger), rubber cement, and optionally sand and lots of baking soda (and an extra piece of cardboard, any size).








, Glue a base layer of sugar cubes with the rubber cement, such that they form a large square (for example, 6 cubes by 6 cubes).









Start off with a bigger base, if you want to make a bigger pyramid.

, Brush a little rubber cement over the top of the first layer and then form another square of cubes on top. This layer should be one cube smaller than the layer below (for example, 5 cubes by 5 cubes).








, Make sure that it is properly centered each time.








, You can fill out the pyramid to make it look as it would have when it was new, if you want to. Do this by making a relatively dry baking soda paste (mix baking soda and water). Spread the paste onto the pyramid and smooth the four sides using the edge of the extra piece of cardboard.









Mix in the water a very small amount at a time until a sand-like mixtures is formed and the baking soda holds its shape when you form it.
The smooth, white sides like this is how the pyramids would have originally appeared. While they are just stone blocks now, they used to have a smooth layer of white limestone over the top, so that they would sparkle in the sun!

, If you want to make your pyramid look like it does in real life today, get a can of tan spray paint and spray the pyramid before continuing. Be careful to use only the minimum amount of paint and to do your painting outside, with everything underneath and around it covered in newspaper.








, Next, you will want to cover the cardboard in rubber cement or preferably Elmer's glue and then (while it is still wet) cover the glue in sand or brown sugar.








, Let the sand and glue mixture dry but also allow the baking soda paste to dry, if you wanted to add it. Be careful with the baking soda paste, as it will crumble away easily.








, You can add some toy palm trees or make a Nile River from cut-out construction paper to really make your project shine.

Make a list of these things on a piece of paper or a digital document to help keep these limitations in mind.
Use an online document service, like a cloud based one or Google Docs, so you can check your planning elements easily with a phone or tablet.;
, The theme of your railroad includes its purpose, setting, the type of trains or equipment you want to use, and the service the train will provide (like transporting industrial goods or logs). These aspects will influence your planning and how you actually build your layout.A long coal train, for example, might run through the mountains and carry coal from mines to power companies, steel mills, or residential areas, to provide heat for homes.
Locale should also be taken into consideration. Locale includes things like region (East or West Coast, Mountain, etc.), specific towns, or general areas, like the plains of Kansas.
The era in which your model train exists will also need to be decided. A model planned for the 1920s would use a steam engine. You won't have modern cars either, in this era.
The season you set your model in will change setting drastically. Fall will need to have trees with leaves changing color, winter will need snow, and so on., Grid paper is great for drawing out a to-scale design of your railroad. One of the simplest scales you can use is a 1-inch to 1-foot (2.5-cm to .3-m) ratio, where a 1-inch (2.5-cm) square on your grid paper equals 1 foot (0.30 m) (.3 m) in real life. When planning scale, keep in mind:


The space available for your model.
The amount of money you can invest in your model railroad. Larger models will be more expensive.
The focus of your model. Scenery focused models will be much different from train focused ones.
Your personal limitations. If you don't have good eyes or nimble fingers, smaller models might be unreasonable., Display in railroad modeling refers to how you show off your model. You can arrange ceiling lights to point down on it, direct lighting to it from floor lamps, and so on. Should you be building your model for your own enjoyment, you might not want to devote a lot of time and money to display.


Railroad models built for children and grandchildren might only require a limited display. Adjust your display needs with the purpose of your railroad.
If you intend on adding to your railroad and make it part of a larger design, keep this in mind while planning your display., There are many different styles you might use for your railroad track. Some common track designs include a simple oval, a figure eight pattern, and a barbell shape. You should have an overall idea for the plan of your track before drafting your track plan.When first starting out, you'll likely want to keep your train level to minimize more complicated aspects of planning, like grade (steepness) and clearances., If this is your first time building a model railroad, you may want to use a prototype track plan. These are provided by companies and take a lot of the guesswork out of your track planning. Prototype track plans can also be used as an example from which you make your own design and can be purchased online or at hobby shops.


Use grid paper when drawing up your track plan. Keep your track plan to scale with your real model so you don't have to make adjustments later on.
You may find that some track plans that you thought would work in reality do not. This is not uncommon, but a prototype track plan will help prevent this., The bench is the surface on which your landscape will be made and your track laid. Model benchwork consists for three parts: the supporting structure, a platform or grid, and a sub-roadbed.


Your supporting structure is a sturdy, reinforced frame on which your platform and sub roadbed  sit upon.
The platform forms the base of your model. This sits on the supporting structure or is attached to it, and the subroadbed is laid on top of it.
The subroadbed is the topmost part of your benchwork. This is where your model layout will be built. Use 3 to 4 sheets of extruded foam on top of your platform to make the subroadbed.
Your benchwork could be as simple as a 4x8 piece of plywood or 3x6 ft (.91x1.8 m) door on top of a folding table or old wooden table. Lay your subroadbed on top, and the benchwork will be done., Your backdrop doesn't have to be a work of art. A blue wall in the background can give the impression of a blue sky backdrop. You could also paint a mural or buy/print a pre-made backdrop.


Make sure your backdrop is consistent with your theme choices. Failing to do so can make your model look less realistic.
For a city nighttime scene, you might have a mostly dark backdrop with the silhouettes of skyscrapers on it.
If you're planning on making a model in a mountainous setting, you might have larger peaks drawn on a backdrop of blue sky., This can be done either by drawing out your track plan on your benchwork or by laying loose tracks on it. Once your track is drawn or laid out, sketch out where you'll be placing surface features, like mountains, rivers, roads, buildings, and so on.


Although a sketch on the benchwork of structure placement should be sufficient, making simple cardboard mockups can help prevent planned structures from getting in the way of your track., The terrain is the contoured surface of your model that represents the ground. This is usually made by shaping chicken wire or screen material to fit your vision for shape of the terrain. Cover this with wet plaster cloth, allow it to dry, then paint the exterior.


Plaster cloth can be found at hobby shops and may even be available at hardware stores. If you lack plaster cloth, use paper towels soaked in plaster.
There are many unique ways of creating the terrain of your model. You can cover mounds of wadded up newspaper in plaster cloth, use foam sheeting similarly, and utilize many other techniques., You may have to build up your track a little on curves, as these will be likely places your train can derail. S-curves especially, if you have them, can be tricky. Make sure you have enough clearance in your curves to fit your longest train cars. Cork or foam model train roadbed should be used under tracks and can be bought at hobby or hardware stores.


If you're just starting out modeling, it can be difficult to know if you have enough clearance for long cars. Before installing your track, use your hands to guide your train around curves to see if it fits.
Track installation may vary, but in many cases, you'll need to solder rail joints to connect them. Avoid soldering turnouts, where a train transfers from one line of track to another. These often need to be replaced.
Use a metal file to smooth bumps or ridges on your track that may cause a wheel to jump the tracks or get stuck., Attach feeder wires as indicated by your model set. In most cases, feeder wires will connect to the bottom or outside of your track rails at 3-foot (.91 m) intervals. A beginner set will likely come with a power converter, but more advanced sets may requires you to choose between DC (Direct Current) and DCC (Digital Command Control) power.


Starter model train sets will likely come with a control panel, but DIY models may require you to build one. Search online for tutorials on how to wire one that is simple and organized.

, This includes almost all surface features, like trees, rocks, tunnels bushes, roads, bridges, houses, and so on. Use glue to attach scenery pieces after the terrain is formed. Use paint to represent flat surface features, like rivers and roads.


Keep perspective in mind when making your scenery. For example, large trees should go in the foreground and small ones in the background to create the illusion of distance.

Dioramas are a 3D representation of a scene, like a house. These are great additions and can add a sense of realism to your model.You can buy scenery props at most hobby shops and craft stores. There are also plenty of resources online that illustrate how to make your own.

If you are new to model boat building, you should spend some time finding a model ship kit that interests you. Purchasing a kit is one of the easiest ways for beginners to get into the hobby. Have fun and find a model that you want to build to get started.Your local hobby shops will likely have model boat kits available to buy.
Many on-line hobby shops can send a model boat kit to your home.
There are many different model boat kit styles that you can buy. Many of these will have a differing levels of difficulty and challenge.
If this is your first time building a model boat, try to select a simple model for beginners.
Do some research on the type of boat you are building to help you get an idea of what it will look like when finished.;
, Most model boat kits will require you to purchase some basic tools. These tools will help you to assemble the model and will make sure it goes together correctly. Check the model's tool requirements and purchase any additional tools that may be necessary.You will likely want a wood plane or sandpaper.
Small pliers can help when assembling the model.
You may find a complete ship model tool kit that will provide everything you need to get started.

, Although many model boats will require you to take similar steps when assembling the model, your kit will come with its own specific instructions. Always follow the instructions for your model boat exactly to help ensure your model is built correctly and looks great when finished.


Each model boat will have its own instructions.
Always consult your instruction manual every step.

, Once you have your model boat kit, you'll want to open it up and examine its contents. You should have all the parts and instructions necessary to assemble your boat. However, you'll want to make sure you actually have everything. Laying the pieces out can be a good way to notice if anything is missing or damaged.Make sure all the parts are accounted for.
Make sure none of the parts are damaged.
Find your instructions manual and review it.
You may need additional tools or materials. Check your instructions to see if you need to buy anything else before getting started.

, Once you've confirmed that you have all the materials and tools you will need to construct your boat, you can get started buy building the frame. The frame of the boat will allow you to add planks, forming the actual body of the model boat. Remember to always consult your model's instructions to properly construct your model boat. Review these tips to help give you an understanding of what you can expect when building your model boat's frame:








Slide the bulkhead frames into the keel. The keel will be the long piece of the frame, running the length of the boat. The bulkheads will slide into slots found on the keel. Bulkheads will help shape the planks of your boat when it's time to apply them.
Once you're sure everything fits, you can glue the bulkhead frames into the keel.
Make sure everything is level and flat on the top of the frame. If any bulkheads or areas of the keel are higher than others, use sandpaper to level them off.

, A very important part of assembling your model boat will be to make sure the planks lay evenly over the bulkheads. If the planks aren't able to touch each bulkhead and lay flat, your boat may not be correctly assembled. Use these steps to see how flat the planks will fit across the bulkheads, ensuring that your model boat will be assembled correctly:Place a plank over the bulkheads.
If there is a space where the plank doesn't touch a bulkhead, sand the bulkheads down until the plank rests flatly against each bulkhead.
Take your time and make sure each plank will lay flatly against the bulkheads.
Make sure to test both sides of the bulkheads.
If you sand one area down too much, you can add tiny slivers of wood later on to level off the plank.

, Once you are sure the planks will lay flatly against the bulkheads, you can begin affixing them. Adding planks will create the hull of your model boat. The first plank you place will determine how each other plank is affixed, so take your time and apply it properly, according to your model's instructions.You will likely place the first plank at deck level.
Planks run the length of the boat, from fore to aft.
Each plank will be glued to the bulkheads that it is meant to touch.
Check your model's instructions to learn where you should place your first plank.
Add planks in pairs to ensure they are even and level with one another. Your first planks should mirror images of one another.
Soaking planks in water can help them become more flexible.

, Now that you have your first few planks in place, you can begin adding the remaining planks to build the hull. These planks will need to fit tightly together, filling in any gaps between them. When you are finished, there should be no gaps between any planks, fully encapsulating the bulkheads and creating the hull.








If there are any gaps, you can use wood filler or small pieces of wood to fill them in.
Your model may have you add additional layers of planking. Follow your model's unique instructions when adding planks to ensure the best results.
Additional layers of planking are often decorative.
You may need to taper some planks to close up gaps.

, After you've added all the necessary planks to form the hull, you can begin sanding the hull. Planks may have been slightly uneven in some places, giving your hull a lumpy or rough look. By sanding the hull, you can give your model boat a smooth and streamlined look. Take your time and work carefully to sand away any rough, unleveled, or bumpy areas of the hull.Your model boat's hull should look completely smooth after sanding it.
Each plank will look like it was naturally blended or attached to the next.
No one plank should stick out further than another.

, Now that the the hull has been sanded you can add in the deck. Adding the deck will complete the main body of your model boat. You will likely need to glue the model deck to the top of your bulkheads, keel, and deck level planks. After you've affixed the deck, you can move on to adding details, painting, and finishing your model boat.









Double check your model before adding any finishing touches.
You may need to use wood filler or small pieces of wood to make the deck piece lay level.
Take a moment to sand down any rough areas that you might notice.
Your model will likely have specific instructions for attaching the deck piece. Always check your instructions to make sure your model will be successfully completed.

, Now that you've fully assembled the hull and deck of the boat, you can begin to apply paint, stains, or other sealants. This can help give your model the finished look that the real boat would have. Check your model's instructions for exact details on which kind of finish to apply and how to apply it.Most wooden model boats will require some kind of wood stain and sealant to protect the wood.
Some models can be decoratively painted to look like their real life counter parts.
Matte or stain polyurethane finishes can be a great addition to your model boat.

, Once the majority of your model boat has been painted, you can begin adding details. These small pieces can help add a level of realism to your boat, making the model look and feel completed. Your model kit will likely include all the necessary pieces to add. Follow the instructions in your kit to learn exactly where and how to place the detail pieces to your model. As an example, you may want to add elements like these to give your boat an authentic feel:








Sails.
Masts.
Figurehead.
The boat's wheel.
Rigging.
Cannons.
Quarterdeck.

, Before you complete your model, it's a good idea to give it one final check. Make sure everything is painted to your liking, that you've added all the detail items, and that you are satisfied with the way it looks in general. If there is something missing, feel free to go back and fix whatever it is you've noticed. After you've checked your model boat over, you can proudly display your hard work.


You can buy model boat displays at many hobby stores.
You shouldn't have any leftover parts from your model. If you do, try to figure out where it was supposed to go and add it if possible.
Be careful with your finished model boat as it will be fragile.

Get all your equipment together at the start.,
Start with the four side vertical posts.,
Build the walls.,
Leave a gap for the drawbridge as you build.,
Review your castle so far.,
Paint the castle with a grey paint.,
Paint grass on the plywood base.,
Divide the castle walls with bricks.,
Paint the moat.

,
Design the drawbridge.,
Cut some wool and plait it to make it into a rope.,
Your castle is done!",How to Build a Wooden Norman Castle," For this project, you'll need to prepare the pieces as follows:


Find a big plywood base for your castle. For a sample measurement that fits the suggested measurements in this article, make the base piece about 35-40cm x 35-40cm, depending on how much surround area (moat, grassed area, etc.) you'd like around the castle.
Measure out 4 posts of 1-foot (30cm) each for the side vertical posts. These posts should be sturdy and strong; round dowel is a good choice, or straight and clean tree branches. See the image for the concept.
Measure out 4 more posts of the same length for the horizontal base posts. These pieces should be made from a different wood, the same wood that you'll use for the walls. Pine or similar is ideal.
Measure 12 4-inch (10cm) pieces of a different wood. You may need more pieces than this to complete the walls, so be prepared to cut more if needed.

If you need help cutting the posts to size, get someone experienced with a saw to do this.

;
, Glue the vertical posts in place on the board. To work out where they should be placed, slide in the horizontal base posts and at each end of these, place the vertical posts, one at each corner. Allow to glue firmly in place before proceeding. Then, lay down the horizontal posts between each post and glue firmly in place.

, Glue the 4-inch wood pieces in a piled fashion on top of the base horizontal posts. Do this for each side of the castle. Glue firmly in place.

, Leave a hole on side, of the height and width of your choice, for the entrance to the castle. Shortly you'll add a drawbridge to this, so it helps to use the size of the drawbridge planks to help you to determine the width and height of this gap.

, Once you have piled and glued the castle together, your castle should look like the one shown in this image.

, This can be acrylic paint or poster paint with PVA glue.

, Leave a 3-inch (7.5cm) gap between the castle wall and the grass; this will be for the moat around the castle.

, Use a black marker, black felt-tip pen or black paint and a fine paintbrush to draw lines vertically and horizontally to form bricks.


This step is optional; if you find it too difficult, draw a few indicator bricks on just the edges, to give the overall impression of brickwork.

,, You can use craft sticks, matchsticks, or similar for making a drawbridge from. Use cross sticks to hold it all together and ensure that it fits the width of the gap that you've left.

, You'll need two ropes for each side of the drawbridge. Attach the rope pieces to the bridge first, then to the wood. Use a thumbtack or similar for when you want to keep the drawbridge in the upright position.

, Add some knights, horses, villagers and royalty and it's all good to play with or display.

Obtain sufficient polyurethane foam for your project.,
Draw the basic shape of your pirate ship on a sheet of paper, noting the length, height, and width so you can transfer these dimensions to the foam sheet.,
Mark the shapes of each layer on the foam sheet.,
Cut the top layer, beveling the cut slightly as the next layer should be narrower, since the sides of the ship should taper toward the bottom, becoming narrower near the keel.

,
Cut enough of these layers so that when they are laminated together, they will give you the desired height of the ships hull.,
Remove any material you need to so you have a space for ballast, if desired, by hollowing out the middle layers of foam with a hand saw such as a drywall saw or a narrow trim saw, as shown in the illustration.

,
Check the fit of the layers, then glue them together with a waterproof, latex adhesive sealant, or with a low-temp hot melt glue gun.,
Trim the exterior of the ship with a sander, rasp, or other tool so the joints are flush and clean, and trim enough so the sides of the ship are shaped the way you want them.,
Add blocks of foam at the fore and aft of the ship to create the raised stern and prow common on sailing sips.,
Shape your finished ship's hull by hand sanding the foam so that it is smooth and correctly shaped, taking care to keep the opposite sides as symmetrical as possible.,
Make holes in the sides of the ship to accommodate the cannons.,
Build your cannons out of pieces of wooden dowels the desired diameter, or use short links of brass tubing, as shown in the photos.,
Coat all exposed surfaces of your ship with an adhesive latex caulking or a multipurpose latex primer.,
Spray the entire hull with a good quality enamel spray paint, using the color you choose.,
Build your masts and rigging out of the lightest material you can find.,
Tie the yardarms and rigging to the masts with brown thread to simulate ropes, gluing the knots to keep them secured with a plastic cement or hot melt glue.,
Add whatever details you want to your finished ship, possibly including a crow's nest, a rudder, a skeg to the keel for balance, flags, portholes, and others.

",How to Build a Model Pirate Ship With Polyurethane Foam," You should plan the size of your ship so you can calculate the amount of material you need, for the ship in the illustrations, 2 inch (5.1 cm) thick foam was used, and a piece of scrap 16 inches (40.6 cm) wide and 6 feet (1.8 m) long was used.;
, Add whatever details that need to be sculpted from the foam so they can be cut out, such as the prow, forecastle, main deck and aftercastle, if you want.

, You don't have to be very accurate, since they can be shaped easily later using a sander, Surform plane, rasp, or even a fine-toothed handsaw.

,, You can pin the layers together with long wood screws to mark locations where you want to removed foam so the below decks will be hollow, and to create a space to install ballast which is needed if you plan to float your vessel.

,, Allow the joints to dry out and cure or to cool off so they hold the layers together firmly.

, Rounding and tapering the sides toward the front and rear, and downward toward the keel will give your finished ship a nice shape.

, You can cut these out so that they are hollow, or simple leave them as solid blocks, and you can also cut out individual steps in them with a sharp, thin-bladed knife if you like.

, In each step of cutting and shaping the vessel, remember that balance is essential if you plan to sail the ship on water.

, Holes can be punched into the foam with a piece of tubing by pushing and twisting it into the foam, or you can drill them with a power drill.

, If you use brass tubing, you can heat it and push it into the foam so that they seal themselves, or you can drill holes for individual cannons with a drill.

, This will protect the foam from the solvents contained in subsequent coatings of oil-based spray enamels if you use them, (otherwise, you can simply use a waterproof latex finish coat of your choice).

, Using several light coats will usually give better results than applying a single, heavy coat.

, Thin, dry, bamboo sticks work well, but balsa dowels, or even plastic straws or other materials will work. Add the number of masts you want, making sure they are centered on the ship, and build them as high as you like, keeping in mind they will greatly effect the balance of the vessel.

, Add sails made from light, thin fabric to complete the ship's rigging.

",How to Build a Model," Kits do (infrequently) come from the factory with missing or damaged parts. The time to return it to the store is before you begin assembling it!;
, Using an old toothbrush, some dish detergent and warm water, carefully wash the parts of the model while they are still on the parts trees. Rinse the parts thoroughly and allow to dry completely.

, Use flush cutting sprue nippers, an X-acto knife or a single-edged razor blade. Do not cut too close to the part or you may leave a gouge where you cut it. Use a No. 11 hobby blade to remove the rest of the sprue by shaving across the nub. This is the time to remove any raised bumps caused by the molding process. Use a smooth emery board, 400- grit wet-or-dry abrasive paper or lightly scrape the No. 11 blade at a 90 degree angle across the offending plastic nub until it has been smoothed away.

, They are much easier to handle this way!

, Glue and adhesives do not adhere well to paint, and may cause it to run.

,, Also, too much glue can actually melt parts of plastic and deform your model's surface. It takes trial and error (and practice) to know what the right amount is. If in doubt, err on the side of too little: you can always add more if needed, but too much glue will spoil your model.

, Super glue takes a set almost instantly, whereas other adhesives and bonding agents can take longer. Be prepared to hold the parts for a few moments while the glue sets up, or use rubber bands, spring-type clothes pins, or a hobby vise to clamp your work while the adhesive dries.

, Apply the putty sparingly, smooth it with a moistened finger or tongue depressor (Popsicle stick). Once it has cured, it may be sanded with 400- then 600-grit wet-or-dry paper. Once painted, you won't know it's there.

, If you forget to pick the part up, you will have newsprint on your part and you will then have to sand and paint again.

, Other types of glue will either damage or fog the piece. This type of glue can be used as a filler as well. Simply apply to the gap with and an old paint brush then wipe away the excess with a damp paper towel or a damp cotton swab. This works very well when filling a gap between clear sections and solid color parts.

Display your bridge in a model display.",How to Build a Model Bridge out of Skewers," Follow a common bridge design style, like a beam or truss design—or come up with your own.


A truss bridge uses horizontal and diagonal pieces to create sturdy structures for each side of the bridge. This is the most common and popular style of model bridge to build.
A beam bridge is a simple structure that uses a horizontal beam placed across an empty space, sometimes with supporting “legs” underneath it.You might choose a design based on what you’ll use the bridge for. Does it need to hold weight? Does it need to span a certain length of space in a model display or other project? Note that wooden skewers are better suited to a design with straight lines rather than an arch design.;
, Use a pencil and paper to sketch out the design of your bridge, which will help you determine the scope of the project and how many skewers you will need. Or, design your bridge using a computer programor mobile app.You may also find ready-made designs or templates for a model bridge online or in a simple engineering book.
Use graph paper to assist you in making easy measurements and drawing straight lines. If you don’t have graph paper, use a ruler to help create the lines.
Draw your bridge design to scale (meaning with the same lengths you will use for the actual skewers) so that you can easily lay your skewers across your design to prepare for assembly later. If using digital software, print out your design to do this if possible.
Try drawing or virtually designing your bridge design from a couple different angles to help you visualize each part of it. You can create a side view as well as an end view of the bridge.

, Place your wooden skewers out on top of your sketch to find the lengths you’ll need. Cut any of the skewers down to size using craft shears or a craft knife.


Note that you may have to use several skewers attached together for longer sections, or to add strength to any given piece. Plan to have a large quantity of skewers to be prepared.
If you don’t have access to craft shears or another tool that is sharp and durable enough to safely cut through the wooden skewers, you can use a pair of regular scissors to score a skewer where you want to cut it and then break it by hand along the score.Be careful of the sharp ends of skewers, especially if they fly out when cut. Avert your eyes away from the skewers when cutting, or wear safety goggles.

, Decide if you’d like to use wood glue or string to connect the skewers for your bridge design.


If you use glue, make sure it is wood glue that will dry clear if you don’t want it to show. Apply glue to skewers in small dots to avoid excess glue oozing out when you press skewers together. Try using a q-tip or toothpick to help apply small amounts of glue.If you use string, make sure you have enough to wrap around each joint where skewers connect in your design. Note that you may also want or need wood glue to increase strength or make it easier to hold skewers together before wrapping with string.

, Lay out the skewers for one truss (the support “wall” on either side of the bridge) flat on a table or other sturdy surface. You will need at least two skewers for the top and bottom “cords,” which are the horizontal pieces, and at least four for the diagonal “braces” that connect top and bottom cords.Form triangles with the brace pieces by placing them at alternating angles, with each point connecting to the top or bottom cord. The number and exact positioning you use will depend on your specific design.
For this and other parts of your bridge design, you may want to glue or tie several skewers together for each section to strengthen it. You can hold skewers together with binder clips to strengthen the bind if you are using glue to attach them.Remember that you need to construct two trusses for your bridge. Once you’ve laid out the pieces for the first truss, do the same with another set of skewers for the other side of the bridge.
If you are building a simple beam bridge, you will not need trusses and can skip this step.

, Use glue or string to attach each skewer you’ve laid out for one truss. Apply glue or string at every point where one skewer or bunch of skewers meets another.


Once you are done with all the pieces of one truss, glue or tie the pieces of the second truss. Leave the two trusses laying separate from each other and flat on the table for now.
If you’re using glue, you may want to let it dry overnight or for several hours after application, especially if you plan to have your bridge hold weight.
If you are building a simple beam bridge, you will not need trusses and can skip this step.

, Build the deck where one would walk or drive a vehicle on a full-size bridge. Lay out at least two horizontal pieces as deck beams that will connect the two trusses together at the bottom of either end.


It may help to add several deck beams that connect the two trusses to lend support. You can connect these at the same place where each brace attaches to the bottom cord. For now, simply lay them down between your two assembled trusses to prepare for assembly.Once you have at least two deck beams in place, you can fill in between the beams entirely with skewers to make one even, flat surface. Or, you can later make a more solid deck out of a piece of cardboard, wood, or other flat material if you like.
If you’re using glue to connect pieces of the deck, allow it to dry for several hours or overnight, especially if you plan for the bridge to hold weight.

, Gently tape or temporarily fasten each assembled truss to an object with a flat, vertical side (like boxes or books) to help keep the trusses upright and perpendicular to the table. Then glue or tie your deck skewers to the trusses before removing the boxes or books.For best results, wait till glue fully dries if you’re using it to connect your bridge structures. Then leave the completed structure to dry for several more hours or overnight.
If your bridge design includes top beams, connect them across the two top cords of your trusses once you have connected them to the deck. Your design does not need top beams, but they may help hold the structure together with more stability.

, Try testing the weight that your bridge model will hold, either for fun or a competition. You can either place objects or weights directly on the bridge deck or suspended underneath it with a load bucket.


Make sure the two ends of your bridge are balanced across two stable surfaces to test its ability to hold weight.
If you want to use a load bucket to test weight, try attaching a film canister below your bridge with a piece of string and a paper clip. Then fill the canister with metal washers, coins, or other weights one by one until the bridge can no longer sustain the weight and breaks., Send small battery cars, trains, or other model vehicles across your bridge deck as part of a larger course or just for fun on its own.


You may want to reinforce or make sure your bridge deck has a smooth, complete surface that your vehicle can drive up and over.
Secure the bridge to whatever surface or surfaces you want to have it on so that it stays put for use with your model vehicles.

, Add your bridge to a larger model display or village in any way you wish.


Try painting your bridge to match other pieces of your display or make it more authentic. Use paint with a small paintbrush or spray on spray paint to easily add color to your model.
Display figurines or model vehicles on the deck of your bridge by gluing them in place or simply setting them on the surface. You may want to design your bridge to fit the scale of other model structures or figurines ahead of time if you plan to display it this way.
Add other decorative elements to your bridge if you wish with string, metal ornaments, wood, or other items to make your bridge more realistic, colorful, or fitting with any theme you have for your display.

Choose materials according to what you can find and whether you can work with them easily.;
, The base simply supports the other mechanism parts and provides pivot points for the rotating members. In this cardboard model, a large sheet of cardboard cut from the side of a cereal box will serve as the base.

, The crank needs two pivot points. They may be on a circular cutout as shown here, or they may be on either end of a short rectangular piece. If you'd like a circle, use a compass or trace around a circular object of a suitable size, such as a can or glass. Make a hole in the center of the crank and make another near the edge of the circle. For a linear crank, make holes near each end. Don't put any holes too close to the edge.

There are multiple different sizes of popsicle stick that will be available at your local grocery or craft store. You may want to:


Lay out a yardstick on your work space.
Note the approximate length of your bridge.
Lay your yardstick crosswise to note the width of your bridge.
Estimate the amount of popsicle sticks based on these dimensions, and the size of popsicle stick you decide on using.;
, Your popsicle bridge building supplies can be purchased at a local grocery store, general retailer, or craft store. The kind of popsicle stick you decide on using will depend on the vision you have for your bridge, but be sure you purchase a goodly amount so you don't run out mid-building. Including your sticks, you'll also need:


Popsicle sticks
Hot glue gun (and glue)
Large piece of cardboard or construction paper
Paper (for designing)
Pencil
Scissors or shears (for cutting popsicle sticks)
Yardstick or ruler

, Place a piece of cardboard or construction paper on a table or any other type of smooth, flat, level surface. Make sure that the size of your work space is large enough to accommodate the bridge you will be constructing by measuring out its rough dimensions against the area available on your work space.

, There are several different kinds of bridge you can decide between, including suspension bridges, draw bridges, and truss bridges.Since a truss bridge uses triangles in its frame to support and strengthen its structural integrity, it is ideal for a popsicle stick bridge.


For the purposes of providing a guided example, the following model bridge will be built following the classic Warren truss bridge structure., A blueprint is a drawing that will serve as a plan for your design.Truss bridges can varying degrees of complexity, and you should investigate a few designs on your own before coming up with your design. Generally, a truss bridge has:


Crosswise floor beams and struts.
A deck, that forms the walkway or road of the bridge.
Longways laying stringer beams beneath the deck.
An external frame, composed of squares divided into triangles for better integrity.
Cross bracing forming an X along the top sections of the bridge.
Sway bracing beneath the top crosswise struts., Now that you have a general idea of the structure you're trying to build, as well as the tried and true essential parts of a truss bridge, you're ready to use your imagination. Take some time to sketch out your design. Don't worry too much about being true to life; your blueprint is a plan, not a perfect representation.

, Allow your general blueprint to guide you, but now you have to get down to arranging your popsicle sticks for actual construction. The trusses are the four beams that will run the length of the top and bottom of your bridge. Later, you'll add triangles to these for improved support. To lay out your truss:


Lay out four rows of popsicle sticks with each row being three sticks wide. Each row should be equal in length.
Cut four popsicle sticks in half. Place each of the halved popsicle sticks at both ends of each of the truss beams, in the middle position of the three-wide popsicle sticks.
The component three-wide popsicle sticks of each truss will be glued together to form a truss three sticks thick.

, Take the component popsicle sticks of each of your four rows and, remembering to keep the popsicle sticks even, hot glue your truss beam together. This will create four, three-stick-thick truss beams.


Hot glue dries very quickly! For best results, press and/or clamp your popsicle sticks together as soon as the glue has been applied.
Press the popsicle sticks together and apply firm pressure so your trusses are securely glued.

, If you are using hot glue, this won't take long, but by allowing the glue to fully dry, you can prevent yourself (or others) from knocking loose a popsicle stick from your truss. Other kinds of glue, like wood glue or general purpose glue, should be allowed to rest 10 to 15 minutes.


If, when you touch your glued truss, the bond feels weak, tacky, or loose, allow the glue to dry for another 15 minutes.

, Use your pencil and yardstick or ruler to measure out regular intervals where you will support and connect your trusses with cross bracing popsicle sticks. For the purposes of this model, you will be using two sticks side by side in a W pattern.Another way to think of this: each line of the W pattern that will connect two trusses together represents two popsicle sticks laid side by side.
The more bracing you have, the stronger your bridge will be. However, too many popsicle sticks might make it difficult to see anything move across the deck of your bridge.

, With the W pattern marked out, you should be able to determine how many popsicle sticks you will need. Count out the appropriate number to have at the ready, and:


Position your popsicle sticks along the truss beams before gluing to verify the final structure of the wall truss.
Use hot glue, or another suitable glue, to adhere the popsicle stick cross braces to the truss beams.
Wait sufficient time until the glue you are using sets.

, Set your two trusses flat on your workspace so that each lay parallel. Then, take your popsicle sticks, laying several crosswise between each of your trusses. These will form the deck, or the road, that runs the length of your bridge between the truss walls. Lay out popsicle sticks until your deck stretches the distance of the trusses.


The distance between your crosswise popsicle stick deck will determine the width of your bridge deck.
Be sure that all of your popsicle sticks are even, otherwise the deck leading over your bridge will look irregular.

, Larger sized popsicle provide more stability, but smaller popsicle sticks should work just fine if you don't have any larger ones on hand. Lay your sticks in a staggered formation lengthwise to join your deck into one, continuous piece.


Once your deck supports are in position, use your hot glue gun or some other suitable glue to fasten your supports in place.
If you are using wood glue or general purpose glue, allow some time for the glue to dry before handling the deck.

, Take your yardstick or ruler and measure the length of your deck. You'll need to created union braces for your deck to rest upon. These will also connect the walls of your trusses crosswise together. Take the measure of your deck and the thickness of either truss.

, If you have popsicle sticks of assorted sizes, you may be able to use this, so long as it is as long or longer than the total width of your deck and both trusses. If you are using a yardstick or ruler and your deck/truss measurements, you'll need to:


Multiply the width of your truss measurement by two to account for the width of both trusses and then add the width of the deck.
Cut three or four popsicle sticks to this length.
If your popsicle sticks are too short, make a longer one. Cut two sticks and, with glue, join each by attaching another stick to the bottom for support.

, You should:


Secure the first two deck cradle beams within the cross braces of the trusses at both ends of the bridge.
Use your glue to attach your cradle beams on the truss beam. Hold the glue firmly until it sets and is well bonded to the truss.

, The more braces you add and the more triangles you create with the frame of your bridge, the stronger it will be. Use your glue to add additional deck cradle beams to support the truss walls.

, You may want to leave your deck loose, so that you can show off every aspect of your bridge's construction. However, if you want the deck connected to the cradle beams, simply add glue to the cradle beams and lay your deck into place.


Try to move quickly during this step, especially if using hot glue. It would be unfortunate if the glue dried before you were able to lay the deck into place.

, However, if your popsicle sticks aren't long enough, you may make longer ones. Cut a few and join these into a longer stick using a stick glued to the bottom as support.


Equal distance spacing will give the appearance of the real thing.

In addition to the mold line, there will usually be metal tags known as ""flash"", also from the casting process, which can be found as small bumps or long tags particularly on the extremities of the miniature. If you cut the model from a metal sprue, (a metal frame which metal models can be attached to for easier shipping), then you may also want to locate the areas on the model where you clipped it from. Sprue is created by the molding process, which filled the injection channels into the mold space.;
, For the clippers, wire cutters are not suitable as they will not give you as clean a cut, or as precise, as you will need. Suitable model clippers are available from most hobby or model stores. A range of metal files is also recommended as different parts of the model may benefit from a different shape. Additionally, you may wish to use a magnifying glass to better see the model. A dust mask should also be worn if the area you are working in is windy as the metal dust may get disturbed.

, Be careful not to clip off actual parts of the model. There are usually a few metal tags on every model in addition to the mold line.

, Only do this after all metal tags have been removed, as it makes it easier to handle the model.

, Do not keep the file in one place for too long. Move it along and through the mold line until it has been removed.

, Some parts of the model may be more delicate than others, so take care and adjust the pressure you are placing on the file. Remember, the mold line goes the whole way around the model and links back up to where you started, so the mold line will only be removed when you reach the part of the model where you began the process.

, The miniature or model is now ready for painting or preparing as needed.

Cut a piece of masking tape 3/4"" long and place 1/4"" of it on one end of the card sections and the other part of it on the mandrel.,
Slip the tube off the mandrel for about 2"" and place the bean can over the tube.,

,

With the nail, punch a hole in the center of one of the enchilada cans.






In the other enchilada can, punch a hole in the side of the can 1 inch (2.5 cm) up from the closed end.






Use a medium size Phillips screwdriver 1/4"" to enlarge the holes, so they are 1/4"".







, This requires a mandrel to roll the tube on.


Make the mandrel by taping the two enchilada cans together end to end using the masking tape.

,

Score the fold with your fingernail then fold it the other way and do the same.






Cut along the fold and use one piece of the 8/5"" X 5.5"" as a template to mark a centerline to cut on when you place it on 3 more sheets of 8.5"" X 11"".






After marking, use the scissors to cut the cardstock so you end with 8 pieces 8.5"" X 5.5""







, Use the masking tape to tape the pieces together.

, Yes, tape the cardstock to the mandrel with just this one piece of tape.


Start rolling the tube tightly against the mandrel. If the roll gets crooked, give a little twist against the direction you're rolling to loosen the roll, and straighten the roll and then continue until you get to the end.






Tape the seam using three 1"" strips of masking tape.







, You want a snug fit here. If too tight, pull off the strips of masking tape and cut some cardstock and re-tape then try the fit again.

, Get a small jar with a screw top and pour in about 1/4"" alcohol.


From this bottle, pour some alcohol into the can with the center hole while tilting the can so the alcohol does not run out. You just want to cover the bottom of the can. Hold the can over the jar and rock it back and forth then pour out all the alcohol in to the other enchilada can and when the bottom is covered pour the remaining alcohol into the jar and close the jar. This fueling should be done outside.







, This is more of a demo and requires caution because you're shooting the bean can straight up in the air and when it comes down it will break bones or your head.

Wear a helmet and be sure there are no people around that can get hurt by the flying can. The can will go up about 125 feet (38.1 m).






Put the cans in the tube starting with the center hole can first.






Insert it with the open end first into the tube followed by the side hole can with its open end resting against the center hole can. Both cans should stick out on each side of the tube.






Place the bean can over the open end of the center hole can then set the tube down on a flat surface and use the barbecue lighter to ignite the fuel at the side hole.






The bean can takes all the high pressure when the alcohol explodes and this bean can is and should be mounted in to a rocket body that you can construct similar to the tube you just rolled for the enchilada cans.

First you will need to have a bottle launcher that launches the rocket after a certain amount of pressure build up.,
next glue the zip ties down in a circle on the PVC pipe.

,
Use a PVC pipe just bigger than that of the PVC your using for the launcher and tie a rope on it.

,
Slip the spring under the zip ties and repeat with the PVC pipe that has string attached to it.

,
When you put the bottle on, the head of the zip ties should fit over the head of the bottle so when the PVC pipe comes up from the push of the spring it pushes the zip ties into the pipe holding the bottle until the rope is pulled taking the PVC pipe down letting the rocket come up off of the PVC pipe with the force of the pressure.

",How to Make a Safe Bottle Launcher," You can make a sophisticated launcher from many of the other wikis on bottle rockets. The easiest way is to glue a source of air pressure to the PVC pipe such as a compressor or pump. Slide a two liter bottle over the PVC pipe an apply air pressure. After a certain amount of pressure the rocket will shoot off.;

Cut out a rectangular paper strip.,
Wind the strip tightly around a pencil or dowel.,
Tape the edge of the strip to prevent unwinding.,
Fold the overhanging end into a point or cone.,
Remove the pencil or dowel.

,
Test for air leaks.,
Add tail fins to the open end of the paper rocket.,
Insert a drinking straw into the open end of the rocket.,
Exhale sharply into the straw.",How to Make a Rocket2," The strip should be about three times as long as it is wide: suggested dimensions are 4.5 inches (11.43 cm) by 1.5 inches (3.81 cm)., Wind the strip near the end or point instead of at the center. Part of the strip should hang over the pencil point or dowel end.


Be sure to use a pencil or dowel slightly thicker than a drinking straw, but not much thicker.

, Tape lengthwise along the entire length of the strip.

, Tape up the nose cone so it holds its shape.

,, Blow gently into the open end of the paper rocket. Listen for a rustle of air escaping along the side or nose cone and feel along the side seam and nose for a gentle stream of air. Tape over any leaks and test again until you can no longer detect any leakage.

, Because the paper rocket is narrow, you may want to cut attached pairs of fins that will be easier to tape onto the rocket’s end than three or four separate fins.

, Be sure the straw extends far enough out of the rocket that you can grip it with your fingers.

, Your rocket will fly into the air, propelled by the force of your breath.


Always point the straw and rocket upward, not toward anybody when launching.
Vary how you build the rocket to see how the modifications affect its flight. Also, vary how sharply you exhale into the straw to see how it affects the distance your rocket flies.
A toy similar to the paper rocket consisted of a stick with a plastic cone attached to one end and a plastic parachute attached to the other. The parachute was folded over the stick, which was then inserted into a cardboard blow-tube. When blown into, the plastic cone would catch the air and launch the stick. When it reached maximum height, the stick would fall, deploying the parachute.

"
Decide how long/tall you want to make your rocket.,
Obtain a film canister.,
Assemble the rocket.,
Decide where you want to launch the rocket from.,
Fill the canister 1/3 full of water.,
Break an effervescent tablet in half and drop half the tablet into the water.

,
Cap the canister and turn the rocket upright on the launching pad.

,
Get back to a safe distance.",How to Make a Rocket3," A good length/height is 6 inches (15 cm), but you can make the rocket longer or shorter if you wish.


A good diameter is 1.5 inches (3.75 cm), but the actual diameter will be determined by the diameter of the rocket’s combustion chamber.

, The canister will serve as the combustion chamber for your rocket. You can obtain one from a photography studio that still uses film.


Look for a film canister whose lid has a stopper-like projection that goes inside the mouth of the canister instead of being held in place by a lip on the outside of the canister mouth.
If you can’t find a film canister, you can use an empty prescription medicine bottle with a snap-on lid. If you can’t find a bottle with a snap-on lid, you can whittle a cork stopper that will fit tightly into the bottle mouth.

, The easiest way to make the rocket body is to wrap a strip of paper around the film canister as with the pencil or dowel when making the drinking straw-launched rocket. Because the canister will launch the rocket, you may wish to tape or glue the paper onto the canister before wrapping it around the container.Be sure to have the mouth of the canister or pill bottle pointing out when you attach the rocket frame to it.The mouth will serve as the rocket nozzle.
Instead of folding the end of the rocket body away from the canister into a nose cone, you can make a separate nose cone by cutting a paper circle, cutting from the edge just to the center, and folding the cut circle into a cone. You can affix the cone with either tape or glue.
Add fins. Because this rocket is thicker in diameter than the paper rocket you launch with a drinking straw, you may want to cut individual fins to attach. You may also want to have three fins instead of four.

, An open, outdoor location is recommended, as the rocket can reach a considerable height when launched.

, If your water source isn’t near your launching pad, you may have to carry the rocket upside down or carry the water separately and fill the canister at the launch site.

,,, As it dissolves, the tablet will release carbon dioxide. The pressure will build until it pops the lid off the canister, launching the rocket.


Instead of using water, you can instead fill the canister about half full of vinegar. In place of the effervescent tablet, you can use 1 teaspoon (0.18 ounce or 5 g) of baking soda. Vinegar, an acid (acetic acid), reacts with baking soda, a base, to produce water and carbon dioxide. Vinegar and baking soda are more volatile than water and effervescent tablets, however, so you need to get out of the rocket’s way a lot faster – and using too much of either chemical may rupture the canister."

Cut a small triangle of aluminum foil.,
Take a match from a book of matches.

,
Line the match up against a straight pin.,
Wrap the foil triangle, apex first, around the match head.,
Crease the foil wrapping around the pin head with your thumbnails.,
Slide the pin carefully out from the wrapping.,
Bend a paper clip into a launching pad.,
Place your launching pad at the launch site.,
Place the matchstick rocket in the launching pad, tip up.,
Launch the rocket.",How to Make a Rocket4," The triangle should be an isosceles triangle approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the base and 2 inches (5 cm) from the center of the base to the apex.,, Place the match and pin so that the pinpoint touches the match head no higher than the thickest part of the head.

, Wrap the foil as tightly around the match head as you can without disturbing the pin. When you’re finished, the wrapping should extend about 1/4 inch (6.25 mm) below the match head.

, This will push the wrapping closer to the match head and also better define the channel formed by the pin under the wrapping

, Be careful not to tear the foil when you do this.

,


Bend the outer bend to a 60-degree angle. This will form the base of the launching pad.
Bend the inner bend upward, then around to form an open-ended triangle. This is where you will rest the foil-wrapped match head.

, Again, an open, outdoor location is strongly recommended, as the matchstick rocket can travel a considerable distance. Avoid locations that are exceptionally dry, as the matchstick rocket could start a fire.


Be sure the surrounding area is clear before launching the rocket.

, The rocket should rest at least at a 60-degree angle. If it rests any lower, you may have to bend the paper clip until it does.

, Light a match and put its flame directly under the wrapped match head. When the phosphorus in the wrapped match head ignites, the matchstick rocket should lift off.


Have a pail of water handy to dunk spent matchstick rockets in to ensure they are completely extinguished.
If a matchstick rocket should land on you, stop moving, drop to the ground, and roll until any flames are extinguished.

"
Prepare an empty 2-liter soda bottle to serve as the rocket pressure chamber.Because bottles are used to make this rocket, it is sometimes called a bottle rocket.,
Construct the fins.,
Create the nose cone and payload section.,
Test-balance the assembled rocket.,
Make the launcher/stopper.,
Choose a launch site for your rocket.,
Launch your rocket.",How to Make a Rocket5," It should not be confused with the firecracker known as a bottle rocket, which is so named because it is often shot from inside a bottle. That form of bottle rocket is illegal to launch in many areas; the water rocket is legal in most areas.


Remove the bottle label by cutting where it isn’t glued to the bottle. Be careful not to scrape or poke the bottle surface when doing this, as a scratch or cut will weaken it.
Reinforce the bottle by wrapping it with strapping tape. New bottles can withstand pressures of up to 100 pounds per square inch (689.48 kilopascals), but repeated launching will reduce the amount of pressure the bottle can handle without rupturing.You can wrap several bands of tape around the center of the bottle or wrap the bottle around its center and halfway from there to either end. Each band should go around the bottle twice.
Mark out the places where you want to attach fins to the body with a marking pen. If you plan to have four fins, draw lines 90 degrees apart. If you plan to have three fins, draw lines 120 degrees apart. You may want to wrap a strip of paper around the bottle and make your markings on it first, then transfer the markings to the bottle., Because the plastic rocket body is relatively durable, even though you’ve had to reinforce it, you’ll need fins at least as durable. Stiff cardboard may work for a while, but a better material is plastic of the kind used in pocket folders or three-ring binders.First, you’ll need to design your fins and create a paper template to serve as a cutting guide. However you design your fins, they should be designed so that the actual fin will be folded over (doubled) for extra strength and will reach to at least the point where the bottle narrows.
Cut out the template and use it as a guide to cut into the fin material.
Fold the fins into shape and attach them to the rocket body with strapping tape.
Depending on the design of your launcher, you may not want to have the fins extend below the mouth of the bottle/the rocket nozzle.

, You’ll need a second 2-liter bottle for this.


Cut the bottom out of the bottle.
Place a payload in the upper section of the cut bottle. This can be a piece of modeling clay or a wad of rubber bands. Place the bottom section of the cut bottle inside the upper section, with the bottom toward the mouth of the upper section. Tape it in place, then tape the modified bottle onto the bottom of the bottle serving as the pressure chamber.
Your nose cone can be anything from a 2-liter bottle cap to a length of PVC pipe to a plastic cone. Once you decide on the nose cone and assemble it, it should be permanently attached to the upper section of the cut bottle.

, Balance the rocket on your index finger. It should balance somewhere above the top of the pressure chamber (the bottom of the first bottle). If it doesn’t, take the payload section off and adjust the weight.


After you’ve found the center of mass, weigh the rocket. It should weigh from 7 to 8.5 ounces (200 to 240 g)., There are several devices you can make to launch your water rocket. The simplest is a valve and stopper that fits in the mouth of the pressure chamber bottle.Find a cork that fits snugly in the mouth of the bottle. You may have to shave the edge slightly.
Get a valve system of the kind used in an automobile tire or bicycle inner tube. Measure its diameter.
Drill a hole in the center of the cork with a bit of the same diameter as the valve.
Clean the valve stem and put a piece of tape over its threaded portion and opening.
Thread the valve through the hole in the cork, then seal it in place with a silicone or urethane sealant. Let the sealant dry completely before removing the tape.
Test the valve to make sure air passes freely through it.
Test the stopper by putting a small amount of water in the rocket pressure chamber, then put the stopper in place and stand the rocket upright. If you find any leaks, reseal the valve and test again. Once you have determined there are no leaks, test again to find the pressure at which air forces the stopper out of the bottle.
For instructions to build a more sophisticated launching system, see http://www.sciencetoymaker.org/waterRocket/buildWaterRocketLauncher.htm.

, As with the film canister and matchstick rockets, an open outdoor location is strongly recommended. Because the water rocket is larger than the other rockets, you’ll need a larger open area than when launching either of the other rockets, and it also has to be flatter and more level than for the other rockets.


An elevated surface such as a picnic table is a good idea when small children are present. ,


Fill the pressure chamber 1/3 to 1/2-full of water.(You may want to add some food coloring to the water to produce a more colorful “exhaust” when the rocket launches.) It is also possible to launch the rocket without putting any water into the pressure chamber, although the target pressure may be different than that when the chamber has water in it.
Insert the launcher/stopper into the mouth of the pressure chamber.
Connect the hose of a bicycle pump to the launcher valve.
Stand the rocket upright.
Pump air until you reach the pressure at which the plug should be forced out. There may be a slight delay before the plug is forced out and the rocket launches.

You can find bamboo at specialty art supply shops and online. The bamboo is then cut into thin strips with a knife and used as the frame for the kite.If you cannot find bamboo, you can use thin wooden dowels from your local art supply store. However, the traditional Chinese way of making kites uses bamboo.;
, Chinese kites are usually fashioned from thin silk or thin, long fiber paper. You can find thin silk at your local fabric store and look for thin, long fiber paper at your local craft store. Long fiber paper contains long, natural fibers, such as hemp, and is known for being strong and light.Kites made with thin silk are considered more high quality than kites made with paper.Some kite makers use newspaper or construction paper for their kites. The traditional Chinese kite is usually made of thin silk or high quality paper, but you can use newspaper if you do not have access to silk or specialty paper., To round out your supplies list for the kite, you should ensure you have:8.5 x 11"" (21 x 29.7 cm) plain paper
Masking tape and/or glue
Scissors
Twine
Spool of thread and a needle
Measuring tape
A crepe streamer
Paint and/or markers to decorate the kite

, Chinese kite designs vary from simple fighting kites that are small and quick to the more complex dragon, goldfish, and swallow-shaped kites. You may want to choose a simpler design for your first Chinese kite and then progress to more difficult designs as you become more proficient at shaping.Consider a design in the shape of an animal, like a bird, a butterfly, or a dragonfly. Chinese kites usually use an animal design or representations of animals. No matter what animal you choose, you should go for a shape that is symmetrical, with equal material on either side of the kite.
Another option is to choose a diamond or circle as the shape for your kite. You could then decorate the diamond or circle with animal images.

, Once you have selected a kite design, you should make the body of the kite. The kite can be made out of a sheet of thin, long fiber paper or newspaper.To make the kite, draw or trace an image of the animal you are going to use for the kite. For example, if you are using a butterfly shape, you could trace one butterfly wing on one side of the piece of paper. You could then fold the piece of paper in half and cut out the wings. This will ensure you have a symmetrical kite, with two equal halves. The same process can be applied for a diamond or circle shape as well.

, Once you have completed the kite body, you should cover it with another piece of paper, newspaper, or thin silk so it is durable and strong. If you are using thin silk, you should work carefully and slowly as you do not want to tear the silk.


Place the kite along the fold of the newspaper or the middle of the piece of paper. Trace the kite on the paper and cut it out. Then, attach the cover to the kite with tape, taping along the sides of the kite.

, It is easier to decorate the kite when it is flat and does not yet have a frame. Get creative and use paints, markers, or colored pencils to draw designs on the kite. If you are using an animal shape, like a butterfly or a bird, draw in details found in nature, such as butterfly wing designs or bird feathers. Use bright, vibrant colors so the kite looks pretty when it is flying in the wind.If you are using a diamond or circle shape for the kite body, you can still draw representations of animals on the kite. Cut out images of your favorite animal and paste them on the kite or draw images that are colorful and interesting on the kite.

, According to Chinese tradition, the kite body is usually treated with tung oil or Chinawood oil, which is made from the Euphorbiaceae tree, found throughout central Asia. This will allow the paper to remain stiff but lightweight. If you do not have access to tung oil, you can skip this step., Make a frame with bamboo or wooden dowels to ensure the kite stays airborne once it is in the sky. You will need to cut the bamboo or the dowels so they fit the shape of the kite.Cut the bamboo or the dowel so they are long enough to cross over the center of the kite. One piece will go lengthwise and one piece will go width wise, forming a “T” shape on the kite. If you are using wooden dowels, you should wrap the end of the dowels in masking tape so they do not pierce through the paper and damage your kite.
Lay the dowels or the bamboo so they form a “T” shape. Use twine to secure the two pieces together in the middle of the kite. You can also use glue or masking tape to secure the pieces extra well as you do not want the middle of the dowels to come off the kite.
Secure the bamboo or the dowels to the kite. Use masking tape to secure the bamboo to the kite. Place the tape five inches (12.7 cm) below the edge of the kite on each dowel or piece of bamboo.

, Wrap the twine around the tip of one dowel and then run it around the ends of the other dowel so the twine outlines the shape of the kite. Keep the twine taut as you wrap it around the dowels.Twist the twine around one end of the dowel and knot it around the end of the towel. Then, secure the twine with a piece of tape. Wrap the tape so it is folded securely over the twine.
Finish the frame by folding the edge of the paper over the framing twine. Then, unfold it and spread glue over the edges of the dowels. Press the edges over the string and let them air dry. This will ensure the twine frame stays attached to the kite body.

, The bridle string is the string that you will use to help fly the kite. Usually it is about three times as long as your kite. The bridle string attaches to the kite at both ends of the frame and then the kite line attaches to the bridle. You can use measuring tape to measure the bridle string so it is at least three times as long as your kite.Cut the string once you have measured it and tie one end of the string to the dowel located at the bottom of the kite. Once the string is knotted to the dowel, you can thread it through the paper on the decorated side. This will ensure the decorated image is showing when you fly the kite.
Thread the other end of the string through the paper at the top of the kite. Knot it to the top of the dowel. The bridle string should now be hanging from the front or decorated side of the kite.
Place your finger 17” (43.1 cm) down the length of the string from the top of the kite. This is the tow point or the point where the kite reel will be attached to the string. Make a loop in the string at the 17” point.

, The kite reel is how you will reel out enough string to help the kite fly. You can use a spool of thread or twine as the kite reel for an easy, quick reel. Other options include using a piece of wood or a piece of heavy cardboard.Attach the kite reel to the bridle string by tying the kite reel string to the bridle string. Tie the kite reel string just under the 17” (43.1 cm) knot on the bridle string. Then, slide a wooden dowel through the spool of thread and secure it with tape. This will allow the kite reel to release thread easily when the kite is in the air.

, Finish the kite by adding a tail. The tail can be made of a paper streamer and should be at least one and a half times the length of the spine of the kite. Usually a tail that is longer will ensure the kite flies straight. The tail also provides drag for the kite so it can fly at a higher distance and in a straight line.You can make a tail that is one long string or several strings tied together. Attach the tail to the bottom end of the kite with tape, making sure it is centered on the kite., Kites fly best outside in an open area like a field. Choose a day with winds that are not too light or too strong, usually between 5 to 25 mph (8 to 40 km/h).Never fly the kite near power lines or other tall obstructions as it can get tangled and become damaged

For safety wear, you should wear thick safety gloves and goggles.


Choose glass that will be easy for you to crush – stay away from thick types of glass. It's easiest to make glass powder out of extremely thin types of glass, such as tube lights, light bulbs, and fluorescent lights.;
, Use a bucket or a deep metal or plastic bowl to place your uncrushed glass in. Use a hammer or another heavy, sturdy object to crush the glass with. Use a sifter to separate the shards of glass from the powder.

, Slowly, but firmly, crush the glass with your hammer. Continue crushing the pieces of glass until you've broken it up into powder. Once you've crashed the glass as finely as you possible can, pour it into your sifter to separate the shards of glass from the powder.You'll need eye protection and a face mask so that the glass powder does not enter your nose, mouth, or eyes. You should also were gloves.
Add food coloring to your glass powder to give your string a unique color. This part is optional, but serves a great way to distinguish your kite string from your competitor's.You can also buy powdered glass if you are having problems with crushing your own. Powdered glass can usually be purchased at home supply or craft stores.

, Once you've separated your powdered glass, pour it into a jar that can be tightly sealed. Make sure that you store your jar of powdered glass in a safe place, and keep it away from children.

, You'll need a pot to boil your mixture in, and your main ingredients will be water and flour. Some people add additional jelly-like substances as well, such as aloe vera gel, sticky rice, or sago pudding. This is the glue that will attach the powdered glass to your kite string.


You can use commercial glue if you do not feel comfortable making your own. However, this homemade glue mixture is the traditional method of making manja.

, Take your pot and fill it with 1/2 cup of water. Then add 5–7 tablespoon (73.9–104 ml) flour, and stir until it is completely mixed together. Lastly, add 2-3 table spoons of your sticky substance (rice, sago pudding, or aloe vera gel). Stir the mixture until all ingredients are evenly mixed together.

, It is important that you use a stovetop and not a microwave. Turn the stovetop on medium-high heat, and stir the mixture continuously. Stir the mixture for about 5 minutes, or until bubbles begin to appear. Let the mixture cool completely., There are some threads made especially for kite flying, but if you can't find them, you can always use cotton threads. You should get thicker and sturdier thread to prevent it from breaking while you are kite fighting.


The most popular types of thread used for kite flying are cotton, twisted nylon, and twisted polyester. These threads are very strong and durable, making them the ideal choice for kite flying., Once your glue has cooled off, run your thread through the glue mixture so that it is coated in a thin layer. You can leave the glue mixture in the pot and swirl the string around so that it gets coated in glue., Pour your powdered glass on a flat surface so that you can easily roll your thread in it. Cover the flat surface with newspaper (or something similar) to keep the powdered glass from getting into the surfaces of your home. Roll your thread in the powdered mixture so that it has a complete coat around it. Lie the string flat overnight for it to dry completely. Once it is dry, you can roll it back onto a string spool.Wear gloves so that the powdered glass does not cut your hands., Once you've made your manja, you are ready to fly your kite and cut the threads of other kite fighters!

The vertical spar should be approximately 25 inches (63.5 cm). The two diagonal spars should be approximately 20 inches.

,

Position the center spar on the faintly folded middle line.
Place the first diagonal spar so that it crosses the center spar 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the top. It should extend past the center spar about halfway to the right. The diagonal spar should hang over the left edge about 1 inch (2.54 cm). Do the same for the other diagonal spar but on the other side. The two diagonal spars should meet at the same point in the center.

,, Press firmly with your fingers until the glue dries.,

Punch out two small holes with a toothpick on either side of the center spar one-third of the way down the kite.

, Tie your twine onto the sides of the arched dowel. As soon as the glue on your ribbon dries, you’re kite is ready to fly. Wrap your twine around a toilet paper roll if it makes it easier for you to reel in and out.

Fly your kite.",How to Make a Kite for Kids," It’s helpful to have your materials close by and ready for you to quickly and easily make the frame. You can get these materials at your local craft store.


4 wooden dowels that are 3/16 inch in diameter
Hand saw
Craft knife
String, twine, or fishing line;
, The vertical support of the kite will measure 24 inches. The horizontal support of the kite will measure 20 inches. Make sure to ask an adult for help when cutting the dowels.


Measure the lengths of the dowels.
Mark the dowels with a pencil at the desired length.
Cut the dowels with a hand saw to prevent splintering.

, Use a craft knife to cut small notches into the ends of the dowels. Cut a notch on each end of the dowel perpendicular to the length of the dowel. The notch should go across the dowel, not be in line with it.


Craft knives are very sharp, so make sure to get an adult to help you with cutting or cut the notches for you., Use a ruler and your pen, pencil or marker to make measurements on the two dowels.


On the 24 inch dowel, make a mark 6 inches from one end.
One the 20 inch dowel, make a mark 10 inches from one end.

, Line up the two marks you made on the dowels by placing the shorter dowel on top of the longer dowel perpendicular to it. The two dowels should make a cross.

, Use the string, twine, or fishing line to tie your dowels together where they meet in the center. Tie the string in a knot around the two dowels and then wrap the string around the dowels making an “x” shape as you wrap.


Hold the dowels perpendicular in a cross shape as you wrap the string around them.
Make sure you are wrap the string tightly.
Tie a knot in the string after you have securely fastened the two dowels together.
Do not cut the string off after wrapping the dowels together, you will string the frame together next.

, Bring the string up to top of the dowel cross and wrap it around the notch at the top.


Pull the string around each of the four ends of the kite frame in a clockwise direction.
Wrap the string around each dowel as you go around the frame.
Bring the string back to the center to tie it off around the “x” in the center.The string should be in the shape of a kite.
Pull the string tight as you pull it around the dowels so it is taut.

, You can make the sail of your kite from several different materials. Decide what look you want for your kite. Some materials can be decorated to make your kite unique. You can use any of the following:Heavy duty garbage bag
Lightweight paper
Lightweight fabric
Newspaper
Plastic bag

, You should have all of your tools and materials gathered in one place before you start a project.


Material for the sail
Scissors
Strong tape

, Lay the kite frame down on the sail material, and trace a slightly larger kite shape. The outline of the kite should be 1 to 2 inches bigger than kite frame. Use the scissors to cut out the kite shape on your sail material.

, Fold the edges of the sail over the string on the frame and secure it with strong tape.


Reinforce the top and bottom of your kite. Use tape to reinforce the top and bottom tips of your kite by placing 1 to 2 extra pieces of tape across them.

, Having all of your materials in one place before you begin will save you time as you are finishing up this project.


Pen
String
Ribbon
Tape

, A kite’s brindle is a string that extends the length of the frame and has the flying string attached to it.Use a pen to poke a small hole in the top and bottom tips that you have reinforced with tape.
Cut a 2 foot piece of string
Tie the string in a knot around the top hole. Tie the other end to the bottom hole.

, Hold the kite up by the brindle. Find the point along the brindle where the kite hangs parallel to the ground; this is the spot where you want to attach the flying string. Tie the end of the string in a knot around the brindle. You will hold the rest of the string when you are flying the kite.

, Attach the ribbon by tying it to the hole at the bottom tip, or by taping it to the bottom.


Your tail should be about 6-20 feet long depending on the weight of your kite.
Cut small pieces of ribbon to tie bows around the tail.
Experiment with different lengths of tails for maximum stability.

, Take your kite out on a windy day to watch it fly! Bring tape with you to help fix any damages that might occur while flying or landing.

Use paper to form the body of your kite.,
To cut a diamond shape on the paper, cut the 4 corners off.,
Tie two sticks together.,
Pierce 4 holes in the diamond-shaped paper at each corner.,
Tie a string to the right and left hand sides of the horizontal stick.,
Tie on paper or ribbon to the corners to form the tail.,
Find a breeze or some light wind.,
Fly your kite.",How to Make a Kite1," If you must, tape four pieces of paper together. But you have to tape them together the right way! Tape the two on top together, then tape together the two on bottom. Tape them on each other, making sure they're secure.






;
, Take a look at the design below for a good idea on proportions. The diamond needs to be slightly bottom heavy -- about 3"" from the top is where your two left and right corners should lie.








, To make sure they're in the right spot, line them up with your paper first. Tie as tight as possible! It should be securely knotted and the excess string cut off.









Any string that will keep it in place will do the job. As long as it doesn't come undone and isn't rope (rope is bulky).
Wooden BBQ Skewers work well for sticks. Just don't stab yourself! Ow.


, Thread a string through each hole and around each pipe cleaner or stick. Leave a bit extra on the top to thread a ribbon on, if desired later. Knot the stick in place to the kite itself.








, Then tie the string to the center of that string for your flying line. This string needs to be as long as you need to be for flying!








, You can add small strips of material to the end of the kite for added buoyancy and weighting. It also looks more complete.








, Ask someone to help you hold your kite as you wait for a moderate wind to come. The wind should be blowing toward you, not from behind.


When you sense a breeze coming, start running and throw it up into the air! With luck, it'll stay airborne.

, It's so much more gratifying when you make it all yourself, isn't it? Once you get bored with simple flight, start doing twists, turns, and dives.


And if your kite isn't perfect...you may want to be prepared for repairs and bring tape with you.

Gather your materials.,
Fold your piece of paper in half.,
Make a pencil mark 2.5in (6.35cm) in from the left corner.,
Repeat your measurement.,
Find the top left corner.,
Match the other corner.,
Staple these corners in place.,
Punch a hole where you made the second pencil mark.",How to Make an Easy Kite2," For your kite, you’ll only need a few things. You can choose any color you want, and decorate it however you’d like.


8.5”x11” piece of card stock (Standard paper works too, but card stock is stronger)
Twine
Stapler
Pencil
Ruler
Hole punch

, The shorter sides of your paper should meet (hamburger style). Fold with your decorations on the outside of the paper and turn the paper so that the fold is closest to you.








, Find the edge of your folded paper that’s closest to you. Measure 2.5” in from the left side and mark it with your pencil., From the mark that you just made, measure 2.5” again and mark it with your pencil.

, Fold the top layer of paper to your first pencil mark, but don’t crease it.








, Pick up your paper carefully while holding the first corner in place on your pencil mark. Grab the other side of the paper and fold it down to mirror the first fold. They should line up on the first pencil mark.








, This is going to be what holds your kite in the air. Attach a tail to the other end of your kite if you wish; this will add stability.







, Loop one end of your kite string though the hole and knot it. Your kite is ready to fly! Wrap the string around an empty toilet paper roll to make it easier to reel in and out.

Assemble the stunt kite rods.,
Attach the standoffs to the lower rods.,
Check the symmetry on the kite.,
Select your launch site.,
Connect your lines to the kite bridle.,
Unwind your kite lines.,
Position your kite for launch.,
Launch the kite.,
Steer the kite.",How to Fly a Stunt Kite," Remove the kite from the packaging and find the three rods that come with the kite. There will be two identical shaped rods and one shorter rod.The shorter rod will be stuck horizontally across the kite into the two rod fittings at the top tip of the kite. This short rod is going to keep the kite spread open near the top. Be sure to keep the kite strings (bridle) out of the way.At the base of the kite, insert one of the longer rods through the rubber fitting near the center of the kite.Stick the other end of the rod into the rubber fitting on the corresponding side edge of the kite.
To match the completed side, insert the other long rod into the center rubber fitting. Then stick the corresponding end of the rod into the other rubber fitting on the side of the kite.;
, The standoffs are the stick like items attached to the end edge of the kite. Insert the standoffs into the standoff fittings that are connected on the two lower rods.Adjust the standoff fittings on the spreader rods so they are even with the standoff attachments on the actual kite.

, Your kite should look completely symmetrical on both sides. Look over your kite to make sure the rods and standoffs are secured and evenly spread out on both sides of the kite.Hold up the kite strings to check and see if they are equal in length and balanced as you hold them.If there are any areas of your kite that are lopsided and disproportionate, it will greatly hinder the way your kite flies.

, Fly your kite on a day where there is strong, adequate wind. Select a launch site that is free from any power lines, trees, homes, roadways, and lots of people.You want to fly your kite in a clear, open area where it can’t get stuck and cause damage to surrounding people or property.


A good place to fly a kite is in an open field, or on an open beach.
Never fly a kite during a rain or thunderstorm; these are dangerous and unmanageable kite flying conditions., Unwind a bit of both of your kite lines so the loops can be attached to the knots on the two sides of the kite’s bridle. Be sure to connect your right side line to the right side bridle knot and the left side line to the left side bridle knot.Stick your thumb and pointer finger in the loop of one of your kite lines. Spread your fingers apart so the loop is taut around your fingers. Tilt your thumb and pointer finger downward, so they are on the outside of the loop.Touch your thumb and pointer finger together. The loop should now look like a very loopy and round capital ‘A’. With both fingers touching, slide the line off your pointer finger, so your thumb is now holding both loops.Insert one bridle knot through this loop and tighten the loop by tugging on the end.Do this same procedure with your other kite line and the other bridle knot.

, Keeping your kite on the ground, unwind your left and right kite lines to make sure they are exactly the same length. Your lines should be unwound about 75–100 feet (22.9–30.5 m) from your kite.Stand upwind from the kite and securely grasp onto both of your kite lines.Your lines should be running evenly back toward the kite from your standing position. If your lines come with looped handles, insert your wrists through the looped handles.The shorter your lines are, the less reaction time you have to make necessary adjustments to your kite.The longer your lines are, the more difficult it is to do tricks with your kite; especially for beginner kite flyers.

, Make sure you have a good hold on the kite lines with your arms out in front of your body. Slowly take a step or two backward away from the kite.This will tilt the kite with it’s nose pointing upward, so it is ready to launch into the air when you pull the lines down to your sides., Simultaneously, take a big step back and quickly pull both of your hands down to your sides.This will force air underneath the sail of the kite, launching it into the sky.


Once your kite is launched, you can raise your hands back up and out in front of your body to balance out the kite. Do not make any sudden movements or try to steer the kite to spin., Keep your hands symmetrical to allow the kite to find air balance for the first few minutes. To steer and spin the kite to the right, gently tug on the right string.To steer to the left, gently tug on the left string.


When you finally get the hang of these movements, you can alternatively try giving slack to your left side string to steer the kite to the right, and vice versa.This “push turn” is a little bit more advanced handling than normal “pull turns”.
Your kite will spin in a circle if you hold one of the lines down for too long, That can look cool, but it will also tangle your lines. To fix this, find balance once again, and steer your kite the other way to untwist the lines."

Gather all required materials.,
Begin the construction process.,
Establish the wing dimensions.,
Secure the wings.,
Create the attachment point.,
Attach the string.",How to Make a Fast Kite with One Sheet of Paper1," It is best to place all of the required materials on your desk, table, or wherever you plan to work. Below is what you will need to make and fly your kite:


8.5” x 11” sheet of printing paper or construction paper
Lightweight string
Pencil
Stapler
Ruler
Scissors
Hole punch (optional)
A nice breeze or light wind (6-15 mph);
, Place your paper in front of you in a vertical position with the long sides on the right and left. Fold your paper in half so that the fold (seam) is at the bottom.

, Use your pencil to make a dot at the very bottom of the folded paper, about 2” from the left edge of the fold. While you have your pencil in hand, make another dot at the very bottom of the folded paper, about 2” from the first dot for attaching the string later.


The Bumblebee (Schaeffer) kite, first created by William Schaeffer in 1973, may be the easiest of all kites to create and was designed with a simple fold that sails in gentle winds., Fold the top left end of the paper down until it is touching the first dot. Do not crease this fold. Do the exact same thing on the opposite side so that both sides are identical. Secure the ends of the folded pieces with a staple (the staple should be placed where you made the first dot)., Place tape over the second dot and make sure the piece of tape is long enough to cover both sides. Use your hole punch to make a hole over the dot. This hole is the attachment point for the string.


If you do not have a hole punch, you can carefully use scissors to create the hole.
The purpose of the tape is to reinforce the hole so that it does not tear later.

, Insert your kite string through the hole that you created and tie the string with a gentle, but tightly secured knot. If you are really feeling crafty, you can create a handle for your string with a wide stick or any tube shaped item. A handle makes it easy for you to reel in or extend your kite, and also prevents your kite from flying away.


The string is also called the flying line.

"
"
Get a large plastic bag.,
Work from the bottom seam.,
Draw your keel separately.,
Adhere tape to the outline of the kite except for the length of the 2"" flaps.,
Place your skewers.,
Move onto your keel.,
Go back to your kite.,
Attach your keel.,
Attach a line and a tail.",How to Make a Kite2," A big garbage bag or a garden bag is ideal. A plastic grocery bag won't do your kite any favors and won't be big enough to reap any real high-flying reward. Go for the big guns.


Lay it on a flat surface. You'll need a clean, flat surface to work on to make sure your kite is built as stream-lined as possible.

, You'll be drawing half of your kite, so when you open the bag, it doubles in size. Starting near the top of the bottom seam, draw two sides of a triangle (the third side is the edge). When you have all the dots in place, flip it over and trace on the other side.









The seam should be 11 1/2"" (29 cm) long.
The bottom line should be 10 3/4"" (27 cm) long and should end 1 1/2"" (3.75 cm) higher than where it started.
The top line should connect from the top of the seam to the end of the bottom line. Draw a line -- this will be referred to as the ""fold line."" Then add a 2"" wide (5 cm) flap that begins 2 1/2"" past the starting point of the top line and extends all the way to the bottom. Two of your edges will now be small squares instead of points.

, This is a small triangle that will control the flight of your kite. It should be 5 3/4"" (14.5 cm) tall and 4 1/2"" (11.6 cm) wide. Draw those two lines starting at a common point and connect the two with a third line. Cut it out with scissors.








, Clear as mud? Place tape on the edges of the kite (only 1/2 of it or so, to minimize weight) but not the flaps that start 2 1/2"" from the top and extend to the bottom.








, Long, wooden, BBQ grill skewers should do the job. The straightest one you can find should be placed down the middle. Cut it to length and snip off the pointy end. It should go from the highest point to the bottom.









You'll also need skewers on the edges. Place one on each side on the fold line that stops with the edge of the flap (2 1/2"" from the top). Ideally, these are just as straight as the center skewer.
4 3/4"" (12.2 cm) down from the top of the center skewer, place another skewer perpendicular, forming a cross. Cut it to length, with the ends resting on the skewers on the left and right. This piece is known as the spread and gives your kite structure. Apply glue to both ends where it meets the side skewers.

, Grab some flying line and tape down 2 lengths onto it on both sides (sides mirroring each other). Wrap a bit of tape around the corners to make them strong.









Where the four strings meet, tie a knot. Then, towards the end of the string, tie another knot. Tie the loose ends of the strings at their respective corners into knots, too, flush against the plastic.

, The glue is dry? Great. Fold over those pesky sail tabs over the left and right skewers and adhere with tape. Then fold over the tape you previously applied onto the ends of your skewer cross.








, Poke a hole through the plastic right where the two center skewers intersect. The keel should match the angle the center skewers form; thread the upper keel lines through the hole and secure with a knot.









Do the same for the edge of the keel. Poke another hole for where the keel ends and thread the line through, again securing with a knot. Now that the keel is lined up properly, attach tape to secure it to the plastic.

, You know that extra string you have hanging from your keel, the one with two knots? That's what you'll be attaching your line to -- that's how the keel controls the flight of your kite. Because of this, make sure your keel isn't coming to come off or adjust!









As for a tail, simply slide a length of plastic (or ribbon) between the center skewer and the plastic and loop around. The tail is more for looks than anything. Don't wrap it too tightly and you can always remove it later if you don't like it.

Use a regular sheet of printer paper.,
Fold it in half so the short ends meet up with each other.








,
Measure 2 1/2"" (6.25 cm) from one edge.,
Fold down one edge to your first mark, but don't crease it.,
Punch a hole through your second mark.",How to Make a Kite3," It should be 8 1/2 x 11 inches. Decorate it with pencils or markers.








,, Place a mark for later reference. Then, place a second mark 5"" (12.5 cm) from the edge, also along the bottom of the paper.








, You'll need the curve to maintain flight. Grab the other side of the paper and fold it down as well (still without creasing). Then, staple the edges to the center of the paper.








, This will be used for your flying line. Knot it tightly against the edge of the paper. That's it! Find a light breeze and you're ready for lift off. The video below shows how it's done.

A thin wooden stick or bamboo skewer
Tape
Lightweight string
Lightweight ribbon
Pencil
Scissors
Hole punch (optional)
A nice breeze or light wind (6-15 mph)

, Place your paper in front of you in a horizontal position with the long sides at the top and bottom. Fold your paper in half so that the fold (seam) is on the left side., Use your pencil to make a dot at the very top of the folded paper, about 1.5” to 2” from the fold, depending on your desired wing size. Make another dot at the very bottom of the folded paper, about 1.5” to 2” from the opening. Imagine or draw a line that connects the two dots.


Delta kites were first created in the 1940s by Wilbur Green and were designed with wings that fly well in lighter winds.

, Fold the paper along the line that you just made or imagined. Turn the paper over and fold that side exactly as you did in step 3. Be sure both sides are exactly the same. Use your tape to secure the folded sides along the middle seam. You should already see your kite taking shape.

, Place your thin wooden stick or bamboo skewer horizontally across the widest part of the wings. This section of the kite is also called the sail. Use tape to secure the stick into place. Be sure that your stick is not longer than the width of the kite. If it is, carefully use your scissors to shorten the stick., Draw a dot about a third of the way down the spine of your kite and about half an inch from the edge. Place tape over this dot and make sure the piece of tape is long enough to cover both sides. Use your hole punch to make a hole over the dot. This hole is the attachment point for the string.


The hole will be located at the narrow end of the flap, which is towards the top of the kite.
If you do not have a hole punch, you can carefully use scissors to create the hole.
The purpose of the tape is to reinforce the hole so that it does not tear later.

, Insert your kite string through the hole that you created and tie the string with a gentle, but tightly secured knot. You can create a handle for your string with a wide stick or any tube shaped item. A handle makes it easy for you to reel in or extend your kite, and also prevents your kite from flying away.


The string is also called the flying line.

, Tape lightweight ribbon at the very bottom of your kite on the same side as the stick. Your tail can be as long as you desire. You can start out with a long tail and cut it shorter if your kite is unable to fly.The tail is important because it balances your kite while in flight and prevents it from flipping and nose-diving to the ground.
Some tails are 3 feet or shorter, and some are 15 feet or longer.
The length of the tail will be determined by the weight of the ribbon.

Find open space.,
Launch your kite.,
Guide your kite.",How to Make a Fast Kite with One Sheet of Paper3," Now that you have completed the construction of your kite, it is now time to send it to flight. To start, find a location where there is lots of open space without trees, such as a park, lake, or beach. Although your paper kite may not reach significantly high heights, avoiding any hindrances is still a good practice.

, To launch your kite, begin to walk with the flying line in one hand and the kite in the other hand. Increase your walking pace to allow your kite to fly using simple aerodynamics. When launching your kite, your back should be to the wind and your kite should face you.


Aerodynamics is the movement of a solid object through the air.The right wind direction will keep your kite in flight.

, You can release more string when you feel your kite rising and reel in your kite when it begins to fall.

Decide what type of kite flier you are.,
Pick the number of strings you want: Kites come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.,
Next, choose the kite type: Here is the fun part.,
Finally, buy your kite: Finding a place to buy your kite is usually not an issue.",How to Buy a Kite," Is this your first kite? Have you any sort of experience with kites before? Are you seeking to upgrade an old kite? If you're buying a kite as a present for someone else, keep their abilities in mind. You should also decide how often the kite is going to be used. If a kite flier flies the kite once a month, is it really necessary to buy an expensive kite? Make sure you know how long a kite will hold the fliers attention, as this is a good way to figure out your price range.;
, However, deciding between a two line kite and a one line kite is just as important as deciding between a diamond kite and a dragon kite. Here is an informal list of kite types:



Single-line kites: This is by far the most popular style of kite. These kites have a single string connecting the kite to the winder. Single-line kites are the kites of choice for young fliers, as they are easy to fly and maintain. Older buyers shouldn't dismiss this category. Single line kites can be just as fun as any other variety. Single line kites are the cheapest variety of kites.

Dual-line kites: The jump from one line to two lines is quite a big one. Dual line kites can be steered in air, and are now considered ""stunt kites"". Younger buyers might not appreciate the tangle of strings, but older buyers will enjoy this ""step up"". For a first time stunt kite buyer, dual-line kites are a must.

Quad-line kites: This type of kite is only for buyers who have flown a dual-line kite before. Four lines kites are out of the question for younger buyers: They are expensive, and keeping track of the strings will diminish the fun. However, experienced kite fliers will relish in the added control. This might very well be the kite for you if you can handle the steep learning curve.

, Now you can really customize the kite to your preference. The list of kite types is truly enormous, so you must decide the finer details. However, here is a list of some overall kite types:



Beginner kites: This category includes everything from box kites, to dragon kites. These kites are generally single-line kites that come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. Generally, beginner line kites use single sheets of material, and are fairly simplistic in shape. This group is appropriate for all ages, as there is a plethora of styles to choose from.

Stunt Kites: If you want that extra degree of control, consider getting a stunt kite. Stunt kites always have two lines or more. Stunt kites fly very well, and usually are made with a single layer of material. Keep in mind that first time fliers of stunt kites will crash their kites, so you may want to look into something more durable.

Power-foil kites: Power-foils (or para-foil) are technically stunt kites. However, it's easier to think of them as their own group, due to the uniqueness of their design. Power-foils are made of two layers of material (like a sandwich), and have no hard frame. If you crash a power-foil, the kite will just crumple with minimal damage. This might seem great for a younger child, but buyer beware. These kites exert a huge amount of force on the flier, even possibly lifting them off their feet. Keep this in mind when buying a power-foil.

Line laundry and art kites: If you are a true aficionado, then you might want to look into buying a line laundry or art kite. Line laundry ""kites"" really aren't kites but pieces of material that fly themselves. The usually are attached to some fixture on the ground (like a car, or even another kite), and fly without direct flier control. Generally it's best to have another kite to fly, and keep the line laundry as a pretty distraction. Art kites are basically line laundry that you can control. Art kites come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and like line laundry, are usually quite expensive. For the first time buyer, they really aren't necessary or even practical. However, if you can afford them, they are quite good at grabbing attention.

, There are literally hundreds of stores to buy kites from. If you've found your kite, and figured out your price range, the buy it. It's now time to find a windy day, and let the kite soar up into the sky.

Try a delta or diamond kite.,
Select a box or parafoil kite.,
Choose a single line kite.,
Try a dual line kite.",How to Fly a Kite1," Because they are relatively easy to fly, these two types of kites are great for beginners. They fly well in light to medium winds, about 6 to 15 mph winds., Choose one of these kites if you want something a little more challenging than the delta or diamond kite. They need stronger winds to fly, about 8 to 25 mph winds., Because they are easier to control, single line kites are recommended for beginners. Single line kites are most suitable for light to medium winds. However, if you want to fly your single line kite in stronger winds, then add a tail to it.When choosing a tail for your kite, choose one that is made of lightweight materials.

, Dual line kites, also known as sport or stunt kites, require more experience to fly. You can fly dual line kites in light, moderate, and heavy winds. Additionally, with two lines, the flier has more control over the kite.You can also do maneuvers and tricks, like loops, with dual line kites

"

Fly your kite in 5 to 25 mph winds.,
Choose big, open spaces to fly your kite.,
Avoid flying your kite in rain and lightning.",How to Fly a Kite2," This wind speed works for most kites, although medium speed winds are ideal. It will be difficult to fly a kite in winds that are either slower or faster than this speed. Check the weather app on your phone or computer to see how fast the winds are blowing on a given day.You can also look at the tops of trees, bushes, and the leaves to see how fast the wind is blowing; for example, when the wind is able to move leaves off of the ground, the flying conditions are ideal.

, Parks, the beach, and open fields are great places to fly a kite. Try to avoid flying your kite near power lines, buildings, roads, airports, and trees. Additionally, if you are flying a dual line kite, create distance between yourself and other people in the park, and make sure others know to stand behind you.Remember that the more space you have, the more line you can let out and the higher your kite will fly.

, The electricity in rain clouds is attracted to wet kite lines. To avoid getting shocked, never fly your kite in a rain or thunderstorm."
"
Assemble your kite indoors.,
Face away from the wind.,
Let out some line.,
Use a friend if the wind is light.,
Adjust the bridle.,
Reel in your line.",How to Fly a Kite3," Assemble it per the instructions. Make sure to check the guidelines to determine the ideal wind speed for the kite., Hold up your kite by the bridle. Hold it up until it catches the wind.The bridle is the two or three strings that attach to the kite and the kite line.

, As soon as your kite catches the wind, let go of the bridle and begin to let some line out. The line should not be slack, but taut with a little give. Pull on the line to point the kite up. This will help the kite climb higher into the air., Tell your friend to hold the kite and walk downwind about 50 to 100 feet away from you. Have them hold the kite up in the air in front of them. Once the wind picks up, signal your friend to release the kite. As the kite gains altitude, pull on the line hand over hand until it is stable., If your kite sinks, then this means there is not enough wind. If you can, lower the bridle half of an inch down. If your kite nose dives or spins toward the ground, then the wind is too strong. In this case, move the bridle a half inch higher., Do this slowly to land your kite. As you reel it in, make sure the line is taut with a little give. As you reel in your line, walk toward your kite until it has landed safely on the ground.If your kite starts to spin, then the line is too taut. You will need to give it some slack at the point.

Assemble the kite inside.,
Stand with your back toward the wind.,
Walk backward.,
Pull gently on the lines.,
Land your kite.",How to Fly a Kite4," Assemble it per the instructions. Make sure to attach the flying lines with a slip knot., Place your kite on the ground. The bottom of the kite should be facing up. The bottom of the kite is the side where the kite strings attach to the kite.Alternatively, have a friend hold the kite up in the air for you.

, As you walk backward, slowly let the line out. Make sure the lines are the same length, as well as straight and not twisted or tangled. As you walk backward pull the handles to your sides. This will help the kite catch the wind.If a friend is holding up the kite, have them toss it up in the air once you have walked about 30 to 50 feet backward.

, Do this to elevate the kite higher. The line should be taut with a little give, but not slack. If your kite begins to descend, then reel the line in a little bit and gently pull until it starts going back up., Fly your kite to the side or edge of the wind. At this point, your kite should be at an angle relative to the wind as opposed to perpendicular. Slowly walk toward your kite to bring it safely to the ground.Make sure the line is taut with a little give as you bring the kite to the ground.

Fly your kite.",How to Make a Kite Out of a Plastic Bag," A measuring tool will help you figure out how long your frame pieces need to be compared to what size plastic bag you have. If it's a grocery bag they tend to be around 11x6 inches. That means creating a cross or 't' frame where one stick is 11 inches long and the other is 6 inches.Lay your plastic bag out on a flat surface and cut the sides and handles so it is one sheet of plastic.
Measure out your kite into the plastic by drawing a diamond shape.Do not cut out your kite yet!
The diamond shape can be made by measuring a lowercase 't' or cross on your plastic and using a straight edge to connect all of the points around the cross.
The size is up to your plastic bag and your own preference.;
, Bamboo skewers are the best option for the frame due to their size and weight, but straws or other sticks work as well .


The frame is key in holding the plastic open to keep your kite in the air.
Measure the length and width of your diamond to find out the sizes of the frame pieces you'll need.
To make sure the cross is even: mark the shorter of the two frame pieces at it's center (½ of it's length) and the other, longer frame piece at 1/4th of it's length.Make a cross or 't' with the sticks so that the two marks are on top of each other.
Don't forget to double check that your frame and plastic match up.

, Secure the cross by winding fishing line or string around the joint of the frame and tying it off.Wiggle the frame to test the durability. If it's shaky, or you're not proud of your knot-tying skills, you can use glue at the joint and then wrap and tie string around it after the glue has dried.

, Once you have the diamond shape cut out place the frame over the plastic. Secure the frame to the plastic bag by placing tape lengthwise on the end of each frame edge.Then wrap the tape over onto the plastic to secure it.

, Use a pin to poke two tiny holes through the plastic near the frame joint. It's best to use a needle or something small; a wire twist-tie will work well too. Pull string through one hole and pass it through the other to tie it securely over the joint and make a loop on the frame-side of your kite to have a place to tie the lead string later., Use other plastic bags to cut out long strips of plastic. Tie these together until the tail is around 10x the length of the kite.Tie the tail to the end of the kite frame.


The kite tail is essential for stability in the air and keeps your kite from nose-diving.
Some kites have two tails of the same size which are then tied at their ends to create what looks like one large loop. This can look nice and gives the kite even more stability.
Try out which kite tail you like best.
For additional flare you can tape or tie accordion-folded tissue paper onto the plastic tail.

, Cut off around 50 feet of string and wind it around a 6 inch piece of light wood or sturdy cardboard.This will be your handle.


Lightweight nylon cord works best and is more durable than string or fishing line. A stick from outside or even a popsicle stick will work just as well for your handle.It is really up to you and what you feel comfortable holding.

, Attach the end of the string or cord to the kite's loop. You can do this by making another loop with your string or by tying a secure knot with the string. And your kite is ready to fly!

, It helps to have a friend throw the kite up in the air in addition to having a breeze.


Only let out about 3-4 feet of string until your kite is up in the air.
You may need to run to get the kite going.

Cut two wooden dowels to the desired length.,
Notch the ends of the dowels.,
Form a cross with the dowels.,
Tie the dowels together.,
Wrap string around the bottom of the vertical dowel.,
Wrap the string around the frame through the notches.",How to Make a Diamond Kite1," You can use one piece of dowel and cut it in two, or you can use two separate pieces and cut them each to length. You can use a small hacksaw, or a box cutter will work, as well. Try to get the ends as smooth as possible.Do this outside or over a trashcan to reduce the mess.
This length will be determined by the size of kite you want to make. The dowels can be the same length or one can be shorter. For example, both could be 40 inches, or one could be 32” and the other 24”. It’s up to you the exact shape you want for your kite.;
, Using the saw or knife, cut notches into the ends, in which a piece of kite string will sit. The notches don’t need to be very deep, just enough that the string will fit in. Make sure the notches on each end of each dowel are going the same direction., If you used two lengths, the longer one will be vertical and the shorter one will be horizontal. Place the horizontal dowel ⅓ of the way from the top of the vertical dowel.


Make sure the the vertical dowel’s notches are pointing sideways toward the horizontal dowel, and the horizontal dowel’s notches are pointing vertically toward the vertical dowel.

, You’ll need about 12 inches (30 cm) of kite string. Circle the string around each angle formed by the crossed dowels. As you tie the string, make sure the dowels stay at 90 degree angles.


Knot the string around the cross section multiple times so the dowels are held tight.

, Starting at the bottom of the vertical dowel, wrap the kite string around five or six times. Make sure that when you finish wrapping, the string is near the end of the dowel again.


The purpose of this is to anchor the string to the frame securely before you wrap it around the frame.

, Starting with the bottom where you wrapped the string already, stretch the string from one notch to the next, making sure it stays tight.Finish by hooking the string through the bottom notch and tying it off.
The purpose of wrapping string around the frame is to help it maintain its shape when you fly the kite. It also gives you a guide for cutting the body out.

Cross the rope ends.,
Loop the rope around once more.,
Secure the knot.",How to Tie a Constrictor Knot1," Pull a rope around the back of the object you will be tying a knot around. Pull each end of the rope towards the centre. Cross the right-hand end of the rope over the left-hand end., Hold the end of the rope that is crossed underneath taut. With your other hand, pull the end of the rope that is crossed overhand behind the object. Pull it around to the other side to meet the opposite rope end.Alternate this method by attempting a double constrictor knot: instead of looping the rope around once more at this step, do it twice.

, Pull the overhand side of the rope under the opposite rope end, between the object and the rope. Thread it under the ""X"" formed by the crossed rope in the middle. Pull it though to the other side. Pull both ends to tighten."
"
Trace around the frame on a large sheet of paper.,
Cut out the kite shape.,
Fold the edges of the paper over the string and tape it in place.,
Tie a string around the cross section.",How to Make a Diamond Kite2," Newspaper usually works well for this, if it is big enough. If you can’t find a newspaper large enough, any large craft paper will work. As you draw around the string frame, leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) extra around it.


You don’t need to be too careful about making perfectly straight lines because what you trace will be folded later.

, Set the frame to the side and cut the kite shape out. You can discard the extra paper, as you won’t need it anymore. Be careful to stay right on the line, or even outside it a little bit, so you don’t cut the kite too small.


Once you have finished cutting it out, lay it flat on the table and lay the frame on top of it.

, Make sure the frame is centered on the kite body. Going around the kite one side at a time, fold the paper over the string. Tape the corners first and then put some tape around each folded edge.


For extra support, you can put a few pieces of tape along the dowels to secure them in place.

, Now that the kite is fully constructed, tie a string to it, which you will hold when you fly the kite. You’ll want it to be around 20 yards (18 meters) or so. Make sure it’s long enough that the kite can fly freely.

Make a mark for the top point of the kite.,
Measure a point for the side corners of the kite.,
Measure and mark the bottom point.,
Connect the dots with a marker.,
Cut the shape out.",How to Make a Diamond Kite3," Lay a large trash bag flat on the table. Bags meant for outdoor use are ideal because they are made of thicker material. Use a soft tip marker to make the first mark a few inches below the top, along the left edge of the bag. The edge of the bag will become the center of the kite.


The trash bag you use needs to be at least 40 inches (100 cm) long for this kite.
Depending on the color of the trash bag, make sure the marker you use is visible. For example, with a black trash bag a silver marker would work best.

, Using a yardstick or tape measure, measure 10 inches (25 cm) down the edge of the bag. Then measure 20 inches (50 cm) across, which should be somewhere in the middle of the bag. Make a mark here for the side corners., From the top point, measure 40 inches (100 cm) down on the edge of the bag and make a mark. The three points should now form a triangle on the bag, with the side corner mark being closer to the top mark.


If you only have trash bags that are smaller than the given measurements, just make sure your points are proportional. The mark for the side corner should measure half of the total length, so that when the bag is unfolded the length and width are the same.
For example, the horizontal span could be measured at 10 inches (25 cm) and the length could be 20 inches (50 cm). As long as the proportions match, a smaller kite is fine.

, Using the yardstick or another straight edge as a guide, connect the top point to the side corner point and the side corner point to the bottom point. Your line doesn’t have to be perfectly straight, but as close as possible.

, Use sharp scissors or a box knife and cut as straight as you can along the lines. If you are going to use a box knife, you’ll want to put a large piece of cardboard under the material before you cut it out.


Save the extra material after you cut the kite shape out. This will be used later.
After you cut the kite out, unfold the diamond shape and lay it flat on the table.

Cut wooden dowels or bamboo sticks to 40 inches (100 cm).,
Form a cross with the sticks and tie them at the intersection.,
Attach the frame to the plastic body of the kite.,
Tie a 2 foot long strip of the plastic to the bottom of the kite.,
Attach the remaining kite string to the frame of the kite.",How to Make a Diamond Kite4," The dowels will be used as the frame of the kite. If you can purchase them already cut to size, that’s great, but if not, you’ll need to carefully cut them down.


Use ¼ inch (.6 cm) dowels.
Use either a small hacksaw or a box cutter to trim the dowels to size. Do this either outside or over the trashcan to avoid leaving sawdust all over.
If you made the body of the kite smaller than 40 inches in length, cut the dowels to the length you measured the body at.

, The horizontal stick should be about 10 in (25 cm) from the top of the vertical stick. Using kite string, about 12 in (30 cm) or so, tie it tightly around the intersection of the sticks. Make a few knots so the sticks are tightly secured together.It doesn’t matter too much how you tie the string here, as long as the sticks are secured together. You can also put some tape or glue over the string for added strength.

, Make a small cut on each of the corners of the kite. Fold these flaps over the dowel pieces and tape them securely in place. Duct tape is best, but just make sure the tape holds the frame to the body securely.


Once the corners are attached, you can place 2-4 pieces of tape along each dowel so the kite is secured across the whole body of the kite.

, This is the tail of the kite, which will help stabilize it in the wind. You can also tie shorter strips onto the main tail for extra drag. To add more color, you could use bright strips of cloth instead.

, Poke 4 small holes through the plastic around the center of the crossed dowels, one hole in each angle of the cross. Lead the kite string through all four holes and tie securely to the center cross section.


This is the string which you will hold when you fly the kite, so make sure it is plenty long enough. How high a kite can fly will depend on the wind, but you’ll probably want at least 20 yards (18 meters) of string.

Prepare two lengths of rope by binding or melting them at the ends.,
Lay the rope flat on the ground, and make an overhand loop around 15 inches (38 cm) from the top-end of your rope.,
Pull the standing part through the overhead loop.,
Insert a wooden rung into the new loop formed by the standing part and tighten the rope.,
Repeat the process on the other length of rope.,
Start the next overhand loop anywhere from 9 to 15 inches (23 to 38cm) from the previous wooden rung.,
Secure your ladder at the top.,
Secure your ladder at the bottom.",How to Make a Rope Ladder2," Do this to prevent your newly cut rope from fraying or unraveling.


Binding the ends of a rope is called whipping. Take some twine and run it along the length of the rope until you almost get to the rope’s end. Double back when the length of the twine is equal to around one and a half times the diameter of the rope. The twine should form an upside down “U” shape. Wrap the twine tightly along the “U”, and put the end of the twine through the loop at the top. Now, pull both ends of the twine until the loop is pulled underneath the whipping. Cut the ends of the twine so that they don't stick out and the whipping looks neat. It is best to use natural fibre twine when whipping natural fibre rope as it will be less likely to slip off. If you are using a synthetic rope, wrap the ends with some tape, then melt them over a flame. , To make an overhand loop, take the working end of the rope and place it over the standing part. This loop is the first step of forming the knot which will hold the first wooden rung.


The working end of the rope is the part of the rope which is being actively used to form a knot. The standing part of the rope is the portion of the rope which is not being actively used to form a knot. It is all of the rope in the opposite direction of the working end. , To do this, first put your fingers through the underside of the loop, and grasp the standing part. Now, pull the standing part through the overhead loop. This should form a new loop.

, Move the rung into the desired position, and tighten the rope. The resulting knot should be visible on the top and the bottom of the rung.


The rung will be fairly secure at this point, but tying an overhand knot beneath it will greatly decrease any likelihood of the rung moving down the rope. To tie an overhead knot, make an overhand loop, then pass the working end over, then through the loop. Make sure the overhand knot is directly below the knot supporting the rung.

, Take care to make sure that your rungs are level. Crooked ladder rungs will increase the likelihood of a fall.

, Space your rungs uniformly, and in a manner that will allow you to climb comfortably. Keep adding rungs until your ladder reaches the desired length. , To do this, use either a timber hitch or a rolling hitch knot.


To tie a timber hitch, wrap the working end around the pole or branch you intend to attach your ladder to all the way around once. Cross the working end over the standing part and continue to wrap the working end around the pole at least twice more. Pull the rope taut to tighten it. If you need more grip, wrap the working end around the standing part a few more times. A timber hitch is ideal for attaching a rope ladder because the greater the amount of pulling force exerted on the knot, the tighter it becomes. To tie a rolling hitch, take the working end of the rope and wrap it completely around your stake at least three times. Take the working end and place it over the standing part. Now wrap the rope around the stake on the other side of the standing part a few times. Tuck the working end underneath the bit of rope which crossed over the standing part and pull it tight. A rolling hitch holds up very well against a horizontal pulling force, so it is ideal if you are attaching your ladder to horizontal stakes or poles. As with the timber hitch, if more grip is required, wrap the working end around the pole a few more times. , This is optional, but securing your ladder to the ground will greatly increase its stability and make it easier to climb. If you are going to secure your ladder to the ground, be sure to leave enough rope to do so; 15 inches (38cm) or more should do the trick.
Wrap each leg of your ladder to a stake at a 45-degree angle and secure it with a rolling hitch.

Place the working end of the rope to be crowned in your left hand, unwinding about 4"" (10cm) of it.,
Place your thumb on the front of the rope and your fingers on the rear.,
Arrange the strands so that the two of them come across the top of the rope in a diagonal direction (lower left to upper right).,
With your right hand, take the uppermost of the front strands (which will be strand 1) and bend it over to the right forming a bight.,
With your right hand, take strand 2, the remaining strand of the two that originally came across the ""top"" of the rope, and bend it around the bight in strand 1 that you are holding in your left.,
After making this wrap, place the end of strand 2 between the standing end of the bight in strand 1 and 3.,
Secure the end of strand 2 between the forefinger and thumb of your left hand and the rope.

,
With your right hand, take the end of strand 3 and place it under the bight in strand 1 and over all parts of strand 2.,
Release your grasp on the strand ends.,
Hold the end of the rope with the crown knot in your left hand.,
Select a strand, call it strand 1 (even if it's strand 2, 3 or 1), sticking out from under the crown knot and begin the backsplicing at that point by placing your right thumb partially under it and at the same time upon the strand it is passing over or lying upon.,
With your left forefinger and thumb, grasp the strand immediately below the one your right thumb is holding.,
With your right hand, twist the crown clockwise while twisting the standing end of the rope counterclockwise with your left.,
Keep this strand isolated, and with your right hand, place the end of strand 1 under it and pull it through until it's pulling against the crown itself.

,
Retighten the crown by holding it on your left hand and pulling each crowned strand downward with a clockwise twist.

,
Move to the next strand to be spliced back into the parent rope by twisting the rope around 1/3 turn in either direction until the next strand coming out from under the crown knot is reached.,
As with the first over and under, place your right thumb under strand 2 and upon the strand it's passing over.,
Study the crowning at this point.,
Keep this strand isolated, and with your right hand place the end of strand 2 under it and pull it through until it is pulling against the crown knot.

,
Retighten the crown as before by pulling each crowned strand in a clockwise downward twist.

,
There is only one strand, being strand 3, remaining, and it too must go through the over-and-under process.,
Grasp the knot in your right hand exactly as you did before for the first and second strands.,
Retighten the crowning as before by pulling each strand in a clockwise downward twist.

,
To continue the crowning or backsplicing, repeat the preceding steps for as many rounds of splice as desired.,
Finish the crowning or backsplicing with a final retighten and rolling of the entire crown between the palms of your hands.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Crown Knot," Before you form the knot and begin backsplicing it, the end of each strand should be finished to prevent unraveling during this splicing technique.


With polypropylene, nylon, or dacron ropes, you can heat treat the ends over a flame or some other source of heat hot enough to melt the rope fibres to fuse the ends together.
With cotton, manila or sisal rope, wrap the ends with masking tape.;
, Your thumb and forefinger should be pinching the rope strands and preventing further unraveling.

, The third strand appears to come from behind the front two, in a lower right to upper left direction. This arrangement is important if the crown is to be properly constructed.

, Be certain that the bight goes behind strand 2, the second of the rope strands. Secure the end of strand 1 between the fore and middle fingers of your left hand.

, The wrap must be taken around the working end of the bight.

, Strand 3 is the only strand left untouched at this point.

,, Study this arrangement for a moment and you'll notice that each strand locks and is in turn locked by another.

, Start with any of the three strands and tug on it to begin tightening the crown knot. Don't attempt to pull one strand totally tight before starting to pull on another. Take each up alternately, a little at a time, until the crown is tight.


At this point the crown is complete, and the backsplicing must begin to finish the process of ""crowning"" to prevent unraveling of the rope.

, Select any of the strands sticking out from the crown and grasp it with your right hand. Notice that it passes under a strand of the crown and then lies on or passes over a strand of the end of the rope that is being crowned. Take a look at the whole crown as well as each strand so you are aware that this ""under-over"" arrangement is correct for each strand.

, Grasp the rest of the crown knot with the tips of your fore and middle fingers.

, This is the strand directly below the one that the working part of strand 1 passes over.

, This will open the rope and enable you to isolate the second strand below the point where strand 1 exits from under the crown.

,,, This is strand 2.

, Grip the rest of the crown knot with the tips of your index and middle fingers.

, Keep in mind the over-under principle. The crowned strand you are now working with, which is strand 2, is lying upon the strand it will pass over. You must take the strand of the main rope next in line below this and isolate it between your left thumb and forefinger. This is done by twisting the crown to the right and the standing end of the rope to the left.

,,, As mentioned above, there should be no difficulty in identifying the strand to be passed over, because strand 3 is lying upon it.

, Now, before you begin twisting, identify the strand of the standing end of the rope to pass the crowned strand under. Once again, it's the strand immediately below the strand being passed over. Since this is your last strand, the crowning is getting ""crowded"" and it is easier now to make a mistake. Keep in mind that only one strand is passed over at a time, that only one strand can pass below another, and that only the strands of the standing end itself can be the ones passed over and gone under. With this in mind, grip the standing end of the rope in your left hand, twist the strands open as before, and insert the last crowned stand.

,, There is no need to repeat the process for more than three total rounds or over-under sequences.

, Cut off the ends of the crowned strands around a quarter inch from the last strand they went under. Taper the ends when cutting so that the crown is less rough on your hands. The crown will not unravel and is now a permanent feature of the rope.

Separate your rope into three strands.,
Seal the ends of your strands.,
Tape the ends for easier rope working.,
Apportion the length of and tape off your end strands.,
Determine how big you want the eye of your splice.",How to Splice Rope1," Most ropes are made up of many strands which are usually held together at the ends with a fastener or adhesive, like glue. You may need to cut the ends of your rope free to separate your rope into three strands.


If your rope is made up of more than three strands, try to distribute excess rope evenly among your three strands.
Eye splices are useful for making a stable loop in a line of rope.This can be useful for towing, pulling, hanging, or pulleys.;
, This will prevent your rope from fraying while working on it. Most kinds of synthetic rope can be sealed by singing the ends together with a lighter. Simply hold the flame of the lighter to the very end of each strand for a few seconds until the ends of each strand fuse together.








Always exercise caution when working with fire. If your rope has soaked up a flammable substance, it could catch fire easily.
When dealing with a natural fiber rope, tape may be your best bet for sealing loose ends. However, you should prioritize a smooth, durable tape, like electrical or duct tape. These not only hold up better to wear and tear, but make it easier to splice the rope.
You might also be able to use a rope-safe glue to attach the end strands of a natural fiber rope together to prevent further fraying.

, Fasten electrical or duct tape around the ends of your strands so it encases your rope the entire way around. Not only with this strengthen it, this will make your rope more rigid, which will make it easier to pass through loops and gaps.







, Your strands are going to feed together with the main part of your rope to create an unbroken line. You'll need each strand to be long enough to tuck around the width of the rope at least five times. At the base of this length, where the strands feed into the main rope and are yet unraveled, use a piece of tape to encase the rope and prevent more from unraveling.


If your strands aren't long enough, you may not have enough line to tuck each strand the five times necessary to tie this knot best., Bring the fasted part of your separated end strand back to the main body of the rope where you want your splice tied. The loop formed by your rope and the fastened base of the 3-strand end will establish the size of your loop.








Keep in mind the purpose for which you intend to use the rope. A big eye may work well for some jobs, but may not be ideal for your purposes.

Find an object to use as an anchor.,
Begin tying your larkshead knot.,
Pull the length of the cords through the loop.,
Pull gently to snug the knot down.",How to Macrame1," This will most commonly be a ring or horizontal bar. Though macramé is designed to stay on its anchor permanently, it’s a good idea to practice with a pencil.









You could avoid an anchor entirely and tape your cord to a flat surface -- just make sure the tape keeps your cord anchored and parallel to your surface.
If you're making a necklace or bracelet, use a connector or charm as your anchor! If it can be threaded through, it'll work!;
, Place a loop of cord over your anchor and bend it over. This is a standard way to start any macramé project.









If you walk into any craft supply store, there will be a section dedicated to macramé cords. These are great materials, but the art of macramé lies in the knotting. You can use rope if you please.

, The reverse larkshead knot is simply pulled from the other side.








, That's the larkshead knot! That's the basic start of any project, with a few variations that are also standard:









Most projects use at least four cords. If this is the case, use either two larkshead knots next to each other or a larkshead knot inside another larkshead knot.

For two larkshead knots next to each other, the color pattern will be, for example, red-red-blue-blue. The center red-blue cords will be your anchor cords; red will be what you're working with on the left and blue will be what you're working with on the right. Therefore, with this method, the colors are different.
For the larkshead knot that inside the larger larkshead knot, the color pattern will be red-blue-blue-red. The blue cords will be your anchor cords; reds will be what you're working with on all knots. Therefore, with this method, the colors are the same.

"
Use a mnemonic to remember how to tie the knot.,
Hold one end of the rope in your left hand.,
Draw the end of the string in your right hand (the rabbit) through the loop made by your left hand (the hole.),
Bring the ‘rabbit’ end around (behind) the string.,
Take the top loose string in your left hand.",How to Tie a Bowline Knot1," Think of the loop as a ""rabbit's hole"" and the string end coming off the loop as a ""tree"". Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the ""rabbit"". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole.


Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme:
""Lay the bight to make a hole
Then under the back and around the pole
Over the top and through the eye
Clinch it tight and let it lie"";
, This will be your ‘standing end’ or the end that does not move (consider this end the ‘hole’ and the ‘tree’.) Hold the other end in your right hand (this is the free end--the end of the rope that will be used to form the knot, or the ‘rabbit.’)Make a small loop with the end of the string in your left hand. This loop is the ‘hole’ the rabbit comes out of.


These instructions assume you start with an ""underhand"" loop, so that the free end of the string is under the intersection formed by the loop., The end should be coming towards you as it goes through the loop. Think of this as the rabbit coming out of its hole.

, This string is the part pointing upwards from the loop (the ‘tree’.) Pull the ‘rabbit’ back through the loop and down into the ‘hole’. This time the end is going away from you.

, Hold the other end in your right hand and pull the ends in opposite directions to tighten the knot.

"
Loosen the base of your loop and feed in your first strand.,
Tuck your second end strand around the near strand.,
Tuck your last end strand around the far strand.,
Draw the end strands tight using both hands.,
Continue the weave of your splice.,
Weave until your splice has five tucks.",How to Splice Rope2," The strands at the base of your loop will still likely be woven tightly together. You can loosen these by twisting the rope until strands separate or by using a tool, like a small screwdriver or fid, to break them apart. Then:









Divide the now loosened strands at the base of your rope into three strands. If you are using a three strand rope, you won't have to do anything, but you may have to gather excess strands together into three for 4+ strand ropes.
Separate your three loosened strands at the base of your loop into near (closest to you), middle (in between the two other strands), and far (the farthest strand from you) strands.
Feed any one of your end strands above the near and far strands but below the middle strand at the base of your loop. This will pass your end strand through the loosened strands of the main body of the rope.

, Your next end strand will pass under the near strand at the base of your loop and up through the space between the near and mid strands. After that, pull the end strand through so it emerges through and out of the space between the near and middle strand.







, Your end strand should first pass over your loop. Then tuck it under the far strand so it passes between the middle and far strands. Pull the end strand through the gap between middle and far strands.







, You should pull your end strands through the loosened strands at the base of your loop. Do this until the taped off rope at the bottom of your end strands meets the loosened strands at the base of your loop.









You'll want both your end strands and the loosened strands at the base of your loop to be firm and tight at this point in your splice.

, You'll need to loosen the weave of the main body of your rope to do so. At the next twisting of strands after the base of your loop, use your fingers or a tool, like a screwdriver or fid, to break them apart. Then, you'll need to:









Separate your newly loosened strands into near, middle, and far strands, much like you did before at the base of your loop.
Take the end strand that fed under your original far strand and bring it over your new far strand and under your new middle and near strands.
Take the end strand that fed under your original near strand and bring it under your new near strand and over the middle and far strands.
Take the remaining end strand and bring it under and through your new middle strand., In rope tying, a tuck refers to a rope or strand passing around another rope or strand. Due to the slipperiness of modern synthetic rope materials, using less than five tucks in your weave can cause your splice to slip.








Your weaving will follow the pattern described, with each end strand tucking around and through the near, middle, and far strands of the rope after loosening.

"
"
Ready your rope.,
Seal your separated end strands.,
Tape below your sealed ends.,
Apportion the length of and secure the end strands.,
Hold the center strand to the main rope below your end strand fastener.,
Pass your end strand through the middle loop.,
Thread your remaining end strand through the second loop.,
Draw the strings together to tighten the crown knot.",How to Splice Rope3," You'll need your rope divided into three strands to tie this splice. Your rope may have adhesive or a fastener on the ends to prevent it from fraying. You may need to cut these ends free with a knife or scissors to divide your rope into three strands.


If your rope is made of many strands, you should try to collect these into three even groups of strands to use in your splicing.
A back end splice is especially useful for preventing a rope that has become unraveled from fraying. This splice will securely keep the rope together.
You can use this same splice to fasten two different ropes together, too. Simply use the end of a separate rope instead of using one end of the same rope, which is the example provided here., You can do this easily with many kinds of synthetic rope by passing the flame of your lighter over the loose ends until they fuse together. This will help prevent fray in the rope while you're tying your splice.








You should use caution when applying fire or heat to your rope. If your rope has absorbed a flammable substance, it could start a fire.

, You should use a durable tape, like electric tape or duct tape, when doing this. Your tape will give rigidity to the rope, making it easier for you to guide it through holes and gaps while splicing.








Unraveling your rope can also hurt the stability of its weave. By taping the ends, you'll also provide greater stability to your splice.

, First measure out enough length in your end strands to tuck around the body of your rope at least four times. Then fasten the base of this length with durable tape, like electrical tape or duct tape, to prevent the body of the rope from unraveling.The tape at the base of your end strands should encircle the rope completely to create a sleeve or collar that prevents your rope from unraveling more than you want.

, The end strand should form a loop as it curls back to the main rope. This is the beginning of a crown knot, which will form the base for your end splice.







, If you're holding your loop in front of you, you should have two strands free. Take the rightmost strand and pass it through the loop, keeping all strands loose.








Your second strand should not be pulled completely through the loop. Enough line should remain so that a loop is formed by your second strand as well as your first.

, Take your final strand and pass it over your first loop and through your second loop. The current shape of your end strands should roughly resemble an airplane propeller.







, Pull the strands with steady pressure until the knot is firm. With coarse ropes, you may need to use your fingers to encourage the rope into place. It can sometimes help to pinch the bottom of the crown knot and pull it tightly.








At this point, if you were to look straight down on the knot, you should see all three end strands equally.

Bend the right-hand cord over the left-hand cord.,
Feed the left-hand cord up, over, and through the loop formed by the right-hand cord.,
Snug the knot.,
Bend the left-hand cord over the right-hand cord.,
Feed the right-hand cord up, over, and through the loop formed by the left-hand cord.,
Snug the knot again.








,
Repeat until the pattern is the desired length.",How to Macrame2," You could start with the left, too -- as long as you alternate sides, your result will be a square knot. This is the basic knot that is present in most macramé projects. If you want to macramé, this is the first knot you should learn!








, Basically, you're tying your shoes. It's the same, simple, overhand knot.








, Be sure to pull evenly on both cords to keep the knot centered. If you stopped here, you would have a half knot. Repeating this over and over gets you a spiral weave.








, That is, if you started with the right. Your pattern should be right, left, right, left, right and so on and so forth.








, Yet again, a simple overhand knot -- just started from the other side (to form the ""square"" shape).








,, A row of knots is called a ""sennit."" How long do you want your sennit(s) to be?









A variation of the square knot is the switch knot. This takes four cords. Start with your outside cords and do a standard square knot. Then, take your anchor cords and make a square knot around your previous outside cords. Leave a little space between each knot to clearly see the interesting criss-cross pattern.
The more cords you use, the more interesting it gets. The alternating square knot forms a fascinating, interwoven-ring shape with 8 cords. You knot your standard cords, then you take the right of one pair and the left of another and knot those. Then you knot the standard cords, and go back to the other pair. Then you knot the standard cords....

"
"
Loop cord 2 over cord one.,
Loop the holding cord over cord 2.,
Repeat until desired length.",How to Macrame3," For this knot, you only need two cords. Cord 1 (on the right) will be referred to as the ""holding cord."" Cord 2 should be looped in a counter-clockwise fashion.









Bring it over the holding cord, then looped under it, then over itself. That's your first tie.

, For this, you'll be moving in a clockwise direction. Loop it over, under, and then over again, with the end of the cord pointing to the left.








, Now, that's the basic of the alternating half-hitch. It may seem ridiculously simple, but knowing it can lead to a number of more intense knotting.









With three and four cords, this pattern gets much more interesting. When you have three, simply loop the left and right cords in an alternative pattern around the anchor cord. With four cords, take the leftmost and rightmost cords and wrap them around their anchoring partner, alternating wrapping them around both anchoring cords. One hitch will be around one cord, the second around two -- alternating sides, of course.

"
"
Make a loop with your leftmost cord.,
Take the right cord and lay it across the loop.,
Bring cord 2 around the top of the looped cord.,
Tighten.",How to Macrame4," Don't loop it with another cord, just a loop unto itself. The lower end of the cord should be under the upper end, not over. The loop should be on the right-hand side.








, Then, take the end and put it under the lower part of the looped cord.








, Don't bring it around the loop, just over the top of the (un looped section of the) cord. Then, bring it under the top of the loop, over itself (what you did in step 2) and under the bottom of the loop.









You should see a wonky figure 8 forming -- like two Olympic rings gone bad.

, Make sure both sides are even! Gorgeous. To make it even more noticeable, do it with four cords. Just do a two-for-one, keeping the cords together. Repeat as desired.








"
"
Form a clasp.,
Add some embellishments.,
Make a sliding clasp.",How to Macrame5," If you're making a necklace or bracelet, you're gonna need to have some sort of staying-put device. The simplest way is to make a button clasp. There are two things you need to consider: the beginning and the end.









For the beginning, don't start your knots flush up against the larkshead knot. Leave a space to slide your button/bead/clasp through.
For the end, simply add an object through all of your cords, tie in a knot, and secure with a dab of glue. Cut off the remaining excess and slide it through the space you left at the top!

, While macramé is beautiful on its own, if you're making jewelry, you may want a few more ways to jazz it up. Beads do just that!









With a square knot, all you need is four cords to add on your bead(s). Slide your bead onto the two center, anchor cords and do a square knot around it. Easy as pie.
Use a bead as your anchor. Then, start knotting in two different directions. With your two sets of string, knot as much length as you need and tie them together when you're finished!

, Making a bracelet that you can take on and off easily seems like a task for the bracelet pros, but it's easy! Just take your length of knotted cord and overlap it into a circle. Take an extra length of cord (about 4"" or 10 cm) and start square-knotting over both ends.









After about half an inch of square knots, thread the ends through the backside of the closure. This is easiest done with a small knitting needle. That's it! The length of square knots keeps your ends together and it slides up and down the cords. Huzzah.

Run your rope around the thing you wish to tie your knot around.,
Form a loop with the running end.,
Pull the tip of the running end so that it goes around the standing end.,
Pull the tip of the running end up through the loop you made previously.,
Pull the tip back through the hole.,
Pull on the standing end to secure the knot.,
Once the knot is flush against the pole, pulling on the standing end will make the knot tighter.

",How to Tie a Bowline Knot2," In particular, if you are in a boat and would like to secure your boat to a pole or piling, this is the way to do it. It also work for securing a rope to a pole on any occasion (it could even work for hanging up a hammock.), The running end is the end of the rope that is not connected to your boat, horse, etc. It is the end you will use to form the knot. Make a large, loose loop with the running end so that the tip of the rope hangs over the standing end (the part of the rope that your knot gets tied around.

, It should go over the standing end and then back up from under the standing end.

, The tip should then continue up through the hole and around itself (around the straight part of the rope that leads to the loop you formed.)

, The tip should go down into the loop after you have sent it up and over itself. Pull the tip through so that it pokes out of the hole for a couple of inches.

, Pulling on the standing end will slide the knot up to the pole.

Undo a bowline knot.,
Locate the spot where the ""running"" end loops around the “standing” part.,
Push the loop up the standing part with your thumbs.,
Pull the knot apart once the knot has loosened.",How to Tie a Bowline Knot3," No matter how tight the knot has been pulled, one needs only to ""break its back:""

, The running end is the end with which you tie the knot (the ‘rabbit.) The standing end is the ‘tree’ around which the ‘rabbit’ runs. This spot where the ‘rabbit’ loops around the ‘tree’ forms the shape of a cross., You should push the loop away from the knot so that the back of the knot 'breaks'. This will release tension on the loop securing the running end and allow the knot to be untied.

, It may help to push the two sides of the knot together so that there is absolutely no tension on the rope while you pull the knot apart.

Finished.








",How to Make a Fairy House," Fairy houses can be short and fat, taller and skinny, simple and cottage-y, ornate and castle-y, rounded and soft, angular and dramatic, and so on. decide which style you like before you start planning your design.






;
, Think about where windows, doors, pathways, and chimneys might go. Remember, it needs to be physically possible for you to construct the fairy house, so don’t get carried away!








, You can use a milk carton, a birdhouse, cardboard, wood, or twigs to make the house structure. You can even transform a dollhouse into a fairy house. Remember that you will be decorating it at the end; even if you don’t like the way the structure of the house looks, you can cover this up later on.








, Find leaves, mosses, branches, pebbles, acorns, dried grasses, and other natural items to decorate the house. If you plan to glue the house together, make sure the materials are dry; glue won’t stick to anything wet.








, If you want to keep your fairy house indoors, it might be nice to make a base to set the house on. Take an old piece of cardboard or scrap wood and decorate it to look like an outdoor setting. Add moss to look like grass, twigs to look like miniature trees, and pebbles to look like boulders. You might even want to build the fairy house in a container garden.








, Glue cardboard, wood, and other materials together using a hot glue gun or perhaps wood glue. It may be too costly or time-consuming to make your whole house out of clay, but oven-bake clay is great for turrets or windows and comes in many useful colors. You can add towers by using paper towel tubes, toothpaste boxes, or whatever else you can think of. Ex:









Stack twigs like Lincoln logs. Lay two twigs down parallel to each other, then lay two different twigs on top of the first two so that they cross them. (They should look like a square with overlapping corners.) Keep stacking them this way until the walls are as high as you want them to be and then add a roof.













If building an outdoor house, make the walls and roof of the fairy house and then cover the whole thing with dirt or mud to make a rounded hobbit-house. Press flat stones into the sides to create walls and add moss to the top to make a thatched roof. Leave a hole where you want the door to be and add a hollow stick, reed, or piece of bamboos to make a chimney. Press a few pebbles into the dirt leading up to the doorway to make a path of stepping-stones.














, Cover the floors with sands, leaves, or moss to create soft padding. Make a hammock from the fronds of a fern or a piece of stocking and add scraps of fabric for curtains. Turn an upside-down teacup or saucer into a table and use acorn caps as bowls. You can even add “wallpaper” made of dried leaves, leathers, or hand-made paper. If you want to add furniture, you can either use doll furniture or make your own:









To make a table, for example, gather some dry twigs, both skinny and thick, from your backyard. Cut four pieces and glue them together to form a rectangular frame that’s the size you want the tabletop to be. When this has dried, lay twigs across the top and glue them to the frame. When the top has dried, cut four pieces to the same length and glue them underneath to form the table legs.













Clay furniture is much easier to make but does not look as rustic. There are no real directions: just carefully mold some air-dry or oven-bake clay into furniture.
For more ideas, see How to Make Your Own Dollhouse Furniture.

, Once you have made your structure, you can decorate it with doors, vines, etc. Rustic and natural features will seem more realistic. Birch tree bark has a beautiful look and you can use both sides. Don't forget to include landscaping!

Loosen the weave of your rope.,
Feed an end strand through your loosened rope.,
Add your next end strand to the weave.,
Weave in your final end strand.,
Continue weaving the entire length of your end strands.,
Tighten the splice and enjoy your improved rope.",How to Splice Rope4," Lay your rope and crown knot on your table and, using your fingers or a tool, like a screwdriver or fid, loosen the weave of your rope below the end strand fastener. You'll need your end strands to pass through the main body of your rope to complete your splice.After you loosen the strands, divide them into one near (closest to you), one middle (in between the other two strands), and one far (farthest from you) strand. This will make weaving your splice easier.

, Take any one of your end strands and pass it above the near and far freshly loosened strands, but below the middle one. After that, pull the end strand through the loosened strands until no slack remains.







, Your next end strand will tuck under the near strand and come through the opening between the near and middle strands. Then pull the end strand so no slack remains.







, Your final end strand will pass under and around the far strand to come through the gap between the far and middle strands. After this, you can pull the strand until there is no remaining slack, much as you did the first three strands., Loosen the next twisting in your rope. Take the end strand you threaded around the far strand and pass it under the far and middle strands, but over the near strand. The strand that went around the middle strand should pass under the far strand. The strand that went under the near strand will pass under the near strand, but over the middle and far strands.








All end strands should be pulled firmly after passing through the loosened strands until no slack remains.
Depending on the length of your end strands, you may have to continue this pattern for several twists in the rope until the full length of your end strands is spliced.

, Pull on the ends of your rope firmly until the knot is solid. You can further tighten your spliced rope by rolling it in your hands. You should feel the rope tighten as you do so. Your spliced rope is now ready to use.

",How to Make a Miniature Foamcore Building," Use the measuring tape to measure out the correct size and use a flat edge to draw the outline using a pencil. You can also print off a pattern or draw another pattern on a piece of paper, then trace it onto the foamcore.


If you'd like, you can create ragged edges as though the part of the ""building"" were destroyed or crumbling.;
, Use your craft knife and cut along the lines. If you've created other pieces with sections that will represent other walls, you have a choice. Either cut them down the lines, but not all the way through, and bend them that way (filling in the gap with another material later), or cut through it and attach it using glue later.

,, Glue the sticks to outsides of the doors and windows. This creates the frame for each.

, If you'd like to give it a more ruined look peel off a section of the outer layer of paper before applying the spackle. Using a pencil or other pointed end draw in bricks.

, Either way, using the pencil, draw the pattern that you want the floor to be in, and cut it out. If you decide on popsicle sticks, you'll want to glue some ""cross beams"" onto one side. This will best allow them to stick together.

Determine the final size.,
Gather your materials.",How to Build a TARDIS Replica1," This will make a big difference in your construction, materials, and of course, cost. Also consider that a full-sized replica will be incredibly heavy, so you'll want to build it in place.


For this article, the measurement used is referred to simply as ""units"" rather than inches or meters. For example, instead of 1 inch or 1 cm, the article uses the abbreviation 1u.
This will be the basis for all the relative dimensions you will need to calculate the final sizes. If your TARDIS is to be 4 cm square, then everything is multiplied by 4. For example, say that the vertical posts on each corner are 2u high by .1u square. Multiply everything by 4, and the final dimensions will be 8cm x .4cm x .4cm.;
, Refer to the Things You'll Need List below, and have all the pieces cut to size and ready build before you start.


For the balance of this article, it is assumed that you're building a scale replica. If you wish to build the full-sized version, be sure to build securely, using screws and braces as necessary.

With the landscape in its near-final shape, and with the step-forms in place, add the color and texture needed to bring the scene to life.,

Insert the bridge in two sections.,

,

After many, many hours of dedicated and tedious work, here is the result.",How to Build the New River Bridge in a Bottle," What kind of scene or object would be interesting to put into a bottle? What subject will be able to hold your interest over the many hours needed to complete the project? Perhaps a simple scene would be good to start with. People have been putting creations into bottles for centuries, and a browsing around the internet might yield some inspiration.
, Consider the size of the object or the design of your scene. Would a long skinny bottle be best, laid on its side? Would a short fat bottle be best, used upright? Many people use clear liquor bottles, but you may want something more elegant. Often the best bottles are clear, cork-type (without threads), free of distortions, scratches, and other damage, and have a neck opening that allows you sufficient access. Another consideration is the length of the neck – a short neck allows much better access to all parts of the bottle, including the difficult-to-access ‘shoulders’ of the bottle, just inside the neck opening.

Cleaning bottles yourself can be a waste of time]]Empty bottles are everywhere, but finding the right one may take some persistence. Antique shops are a good source of older, elegant cork-type bottles.






You might find the right bottle, but be disappointed if old age has left it clouded, scratched, or otherwise compromised. Not to worry – there are professional bottle cleaning services that can tumble the bottle on a machine and polish it to like-new condition, all for just a few bucks. Or you can try cleaning the bottle yourself, but some mineral deposits can be nearly impossible to get out.

, The tools needed will depend on what you’re creating, but generally you'll need long, slender pieces of wire or wood, which can be bent or shaped to suit the task at hand. One tool that will prove very useful if you're getting serious about your project is something called an ear polypus, which is like a long skinny pliers. This photo shows a simple tool made from coat hanger wire., The scenery base in this bottle was created using a two-part epoxy clay called Epoxy Sculpt. Using gloves, mix the clay until it is a uniform color, and roll it into little logs. The clay will stick to the end of a tool, and can be lowered through the bottle’s mouth., Try to avoid touching the inside of the bottle with the clay in places where you won’t be putting the landscape, since it will leave smudges which you’ll have to go back and wipe out, which is very time consuming. In fact, keeping the inside of the bottle clean is one of the most time-consuming and tedious parts of this process. Prevention is the best remedy, but you'll ultimately spend plenty of time with your swab tool doing damage control.

To make a swab tool, take a small rectangle of paper towel and tape it around the end of a piece of clothes-hanger wire. Moisten it with a solvent like epoxy Safety Solvent (to remove clay smudges) or window cleaner. You will use and discard many swabs in keeping your bottle project clean.

, This tool was made from ¼” (6mm) steel gas line tubing. It may take a while for you to learn how to shape and flatten the clay logs so that they contact the glass evenly with few trapped air bubbles., The working time for Apoxie is about three hours, so you may need to mix new batches as you go. If you're leaving the project for long enough that the Apoxie will dry, try to think of how to best shape the edges of the Apoxie you’ve already placed so that joining fresh Apoxie later on won't create crevasses or air pockets that will be visible outside the bottle., Based on the size of the bottle, it was decided that the 3030-foot-long bridge would be built to a scale of 1:6060, yielding a model 6 inches (15.2 cm) long., Scale-dimension styrene is available from a few companies in the US, or you can cut your own strips from styrene sheets using a razor blade and ruler. For the arch, styrene strips can be bent around the diameter of a stack of CDs glued together, and held in place with pins while glued.

Bents (the vertical support pieces) for the bridge can be made from strips of copper mesh, cut in strips to form the x-bracing, and sandwiched by styrene strips.






The height of the bents should be checked with the arch to ensure a flat surface for the deck.







,,

These became part of a structural frame that was inserted in pieces into the bottle and reformed to hold the exact negative space that the bridge would occupy.







, The two connector pieces can be removed., Trees can be made from bits of Woodland Scenics ground foam, and inserted individually. Use a wire tool to apply small dabs of white glue inside the bottle, then wipe off the end of the tool and lightly lick it; your saliva will be sticky enough to pick up a tiny tree tuft, but less sticky than the glue spot, so applying the tree is relatively easy.

Exfoliating this bottle took about one hour per square inch of forest, with the most time consuming parts being the distant hills, where smaller tree tufts were used to give the illusion of distance.






The furthest background mountains can be painted with acrylic paints, using an improvised brush. Cut a very small commercial brush short, and insert a brass wire in a hole in its stub, which can then be inserted in a hole drilled in the end of a kebab skewer. This allows the brush to be bent to reach different areas inside the bottle. You may want to experiment with the length of the wire section to suit your needs.






The river gloss was created with Woodland Scenics ‘Realistic Water’ product. Drops were transported into the bottle on the end of a wire and spread to fill the river bed. The railroad tracks are flattened shelves of Apoxie painted gray, with parallel black threads glued with white glue.







, In order to position and glue them accurately within the bottle, a hinged wooden platform can be created from popsicle sticks.

The tallest four bents attached to the road deck were too tall to go through the opening of the bottle, but were attached to the deck with a flexible white glue called Crafter’s Pick Ultimate, which gave the bents the flexibility to bend without breaking as they were inserted. The arch and its bents was slim enough to squeeze through the neck without needing any hinges.






Because the landscape blocked most of the light and view when inverted, it was very difficult to see the uniting of the two bridge sections. A wiser builder might have chosen a bottle with a greater diameter and fewer distortions.






After enough staring into the bottle, you can start to feel a little distorted yourself.






Here the bridge has been joined and placed.







,, Although you may not wish to build something this intricate on your first try, a simple rural landscape scene, perhaps with a few buildings, is well within the reach of any crafter with the patience to try."

Compare the sizes for common model-building scales to find one that will fit the dimensions for the space you have. Look for modeling scales on hobbyist and model railroad enthusiast websites.The most common scales for model airplane hobbyists are 1/48 (1¾” or 31.8 mm) and 1/72 (1” or 25mm).;
, Study books that show plans and photos of airports around the world. Visit other models at airports and transportation museums. Check out Knuffington Airport, which is a model based on Hamburg Airport. Some of its features include 15,000 figurines, 500 cars, 50 trains, 300 buildings and 40 planes.Look at layouts for airports in the UK through NATS (http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/public/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=6&Itemid=13.html) and in the US through Federal Aviation Administration (https://www.faa.gov/airports/runway_safety/diagrams/).

, Plan where things like an air traffic control tower, terminal buildings, planes, shuttle buses, and people will go. Include parking lots, aprons, taxiways, and runways. Consider including an airplane fueling facility and hangars for airplane service, maintenance, and storage., Choose cardboard, wood, or plastic for the base of your model. Cut it to size according to your scale and the design you’ve sketched for the airport. Make sure you have room for all of the structures, runways, parking, walkways, and taxiways.

, Use a ruler to make sure you can fit everything on the base according to your scale. Eliminate structures, runways, or other items if you don’t have enough space on the base you’ve chosen. Alternatively, cut a larger base to accommodate everything that you’ve planned to build.

After you’ve sketched your design on the base, place it on a table so you can start adding your structures.

, Use modeling kits in the scale you’ve chosen for your airport. You can also build these from scratch using stiff cardboard or balsa wood. Make at least one terminal and one hangar if you are creating a model from scratch. If you’re basing your model on a real-world airport, aim to make the same number of buildings that can be found at that airport.


Build simple, large gray buildings with double doors large enough to accommodate an airplane for your hangars.
Terminals can be simple, long structures with jetways on the side of the terminal facing the runways. Make two levels on the side facing the parking lot, with multiple doors for passengers.
Parking garages can match real-world parking garages with multiple levels of parking lots stacked in a building.
Position the terminals on your base according to where you have them in your design.

, The aprons should be long rectangles adjacent to the jetway side of the terminal buildings. Make them wide enough to accommodate the planes you plan to park at the terminals. Paint at least one apron for each terminal. Use black or dark gray paint for the aprons. You can also cut out rectangles from poster board and glue these down to use as the aprons.Aprons are the same as ramps.

, Make the taxiways look like wide roads leading from the apron to the runway. Use black paint for the basic taxiways. Add a solid yellow centerline. Paint on yellow arrows or chevrons that point to the runways.

Create one taxiway for each apron.

, Design the runway to look like a wide road with a solid white line down the middle. Runways lead from the taxiways to the point where the plane lands or departs. Mark the landing areas with eight white bars. Add white chevrons to indicate the direction of the runways. Planes take off near the chevrons.Make at least one runway if you’re designing your own airport. If you’re basing your model on a real-world airport, make the same number of runways found at that airport.
Number the runways using the block, geometric font used for runway designators. You can see examples of this font at https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/part3-standards-325-325-160.htm.

, Get some model airplane kits in the scale you chose for your model airport. Assemble the airplanes. Smooth them with sandpaper if needed. Next, paint them to match the types of airlines you’ve chosen for your airport. Add decals for authenticity. Put the airplanes on the aprons, taxiways, and runways., Buy some ground foam at a hobby store. Paint the foam green and let it dry. Spread some white glue on your base where you want the grass. Crumble up some ground foam and spread the crumbles over the glue.Put down the foam first, then spray it lightly with some white glue if you don’t want to crumble the foam.
If you will crumble the foam, also paint the board under the grassy sections green before adding the foam to make the grass more vibrant.

, Get some lichen from real trees or buy it at a hobby store. Glue some clumps of lichen around the grassy areas as bushes. Break some toothpicks in half to use as bases for bushes. Slide some lichen onto the toothpicks and glue the bottom of the toothpick to your base.Cover the tops of small twigs covered in lichen and glue the twigs to the base for trees., Decide the types of signs you’d like to have. Cut out small pieces of white paper in the shape of the signs you want. Color in the paper with markers, colored pencils, or paint. Use a permanent marker to write the text of the signs. Glue the paper to toothpicks and glue the bottom of the toothpicks to the base where you want the signs.

Make stop signs, parking signs, and signs indicating the location of aprons and jetways on the runways.
Add names or other designators to your buildings. Write them freehand or use a stencil with paint or permanent marker.

, Buy figurines from craft stores, model stores, or stores that sell miniatures. Try to get them in the scale you chose for your airport. Look for figurines dressed as pilots and flight attendants, people in coveralls for working on the aprons and around the hangars. Don’t forget families and other figurines to be the passengers and public. Glue the figurines around the airport in appropriate places.

Find miniature cars, tankers, fire engines, shuttle buses, and other vehicles that belong at the airport. Get these in your scale and place them around the airport.

Unroll a sheet of MonoKote on a clean work surface, and lay the model part on top of it.,

,
Finish the edge by carefully folding the top edge under to the bottom side and using the heating iron to seal it in place.",How to Apply MonoKote," Carefully outline the part with a fine tip marker, and cut out the section allowing an extra 2 inches (5 cm) in width and 4 inches (10 cm) in length.;
,, Allow a minimum overlap of 1 inch (25 mm) all around except the wing tip which needs a minimum of 3 inches (75 mm).

,,


Continue working around the edges, left to right, top to bottom, right to left and bottom to top.
While sealing the edges, keep the MonoKote pulled taut so that when you finish tacking down the edges, the covering is smooth and wrinkle free.






If you see wrinkles developing, stop and carefully peel up the edges, using the ironing tool to loosen the adhesive if necessary, and pull tightly while smoothing the MonoKote, until the wrinkles are eliminated.






Once the edges are covered, go back to the top and run the iron over the entire surface, working from the top down. Alternately, you can do this part with a hot air gun to avoid scratching the new finish. Either way, avoid overheating and loosening the edges or you will create wrinkles.







,,, Or you could cut thin pieces of MonoKote or use their special trim to wrap around the edges.

Retrieve the smoldering rocket with gloves.",How to Make a Match Rocket," A match rocket is simple to make: all you need is a few match heads, plus a piece of foil to wrap around them. You'll end up with a tiny rocket that shoots out smoke and hot air when lit, pushing itself up and away. To get started, cut out a foil square about 5 x 7 inches (13 x 18 cm) works well.There are two types of foil: normal and heavy-duty. Heavy duty foil makes a better seal, but it will weigh down your rocket if you use too much.;
, Lay the skewer down along the long side of the foil. Roll the skewer along the foil to wrap a foil tube around it. Try to keep the foil tight against the skewer, and as even as you can. Pull out the skewer, leaving a hollow foil tube behind.


You can buy wooden skewers at most grocery stores. If you don't have one, wrap a smaller piece of foil around a matchstick instead.

, Snip off the match heads with a pair of scissors. You only need one match head for each rocket.Do this over a cloth or cloth-lined container so the match heads don't bounce away.
Paper matches are a good option since they weigh less, but any type of match should work.

, Use the skewer to push a single match head into the foil tube. Stop once it's about ½ to 1 inch (1.25–2.5 cm) from the end.If one end of the tube is more uneven or ragged than the other, put the match head near this end.
You can put more match heads into the rocket if you want, as long as you leave that space in the end. Because the match heads won't all ignite at the same time, this doesn't increase the rocket power as much as you'd think.

, Crimp the end next to the match head closed with a pair of pliers. Repeat this from several angles, until the tube is as tightly closed as possible. If there are any holes in this end, smoke will escape and the rocket will not fly nearly as far.For extra insurance, fold this end over itself, as though it were a tube of toothpaste. Fold a tiny piece of foil and wrap it around this to stop it unrolling.

, Push the paper clip into the end of the tube that still has a hole. Wrap the foil around this object, narrowing the tube.A narrower opening means more pressure, which will shoot the rocket farther. You can leave the paper clip in there for now.


Use a metal paper clip, not one with a plastic coating.
A standard sized paper clip should be fine. If you used a large number of match heads, you might need an over-sized clip to support the rocket.

, Fins add more than just style; their shape helps keep the rocket pointed in the direction of movement.This is the most aerodynamic position, reducing the slowing effect of the air. If you decide to make fins, here's an easy way to do it:Cut a small square of heavy tape with an anti-stick backing. Aluminum foil tape works best.
Fold it along the diagonal, then turn it over and crease the same fold the other way. Unfold and repeat along the second diagonal.
Fold it along both folds and cut off the central corner. You should now have a square with a hole in it.
Remove the anti-stick backing. Push the tape into an X shape and slide it onto the hollow end of the rocket. It should now have four fins.

, A stable, relatively heavy stand that won't move much on launch will get you the farthest distance. Here's one easy way to make one if you don't need your matchbox anymore:Empty your matchbox and fill one half with pebbles or other dense objects.
Punch a hole in the lid of the matchbox, near one end
Stick the paper clip currently in the rocket into this hole. Slide the lid until you get the desired launch angle.
If the paper clip falls over, tape it onto the matchbox base or weight it down.

, If the foil is wrapped too tightly around the paper clip, the rocket might cling and fail to launch. Rotate the rocket and wiggle it slightly until you're satisfied it's slightly loose.


If this is very tight, the rocket could explode.

, The smoking rocket tip will be hot enough to leave scorch marks on carpet and furniture. Find a concrete surface outdoors with at least 40 feet (12m) of space.


Keep the rocket pointed away from people, animals, or another person's property.

, Stand to the side of the rocket and hold a torch or lighter to the tip of the rocket, where the match head is. Soon, smoke will shoot out the end with the paper clip, and the rocket will fly forward. Have fun!









The rocket usually flies at least 20 ft (6m) if it is pointed at a 45º angle. It can occasionally fly up to 40 ft (12m).
On a windy day, point the rocket in the direction the wind is blowing. Screen the flame from wind while lighting.

, The rocket tip will keep smoldering for some time, and could cause a fire if it lands in brush. Always pick it up after launch, but wear gloves. It will be hot enough to burn skin.

Test for the correct dihedral.",How to Get the Best from Your Model Plane," This is primarily to make mechanical adjustments, re-centring the output arms and optimising the torque ratings. When connected to a control surface, a servo generally translates its rotary action into the linear movement of a control linkage.

Consider a servo arm that's set square across the servo. Given that the movement of the arm is equal in both directions, the linear distance the linkage moves will also be the same. Now if you add some trim in flight, therefore moving the servo position from central to offset, there will be unequal linear movement to the linkage and hence the control surface (Fig. 1).



 


This 'differential' throw is sometimes very useful on an aileron, and you might choose to purposefully offset your servo arms in order to get it, but it's much less desirable on, say, a rudder. True, you can mix it out using the Adjustable Travel Volumes (ATVs) on your transmitter, but the rate at which the control surface reaches a given point will then be different for both sides of the deflection, and the control surface response will feel different in the air. It might take a few flights to get the linkage lengths correct or the servo arms to a good position but stick at it, as getting the basic steps right is very important to the rest of the set-up process.;
, Servo torque is usually rated in 'kilograms per centimetre' (kg/cm), e.g. a 3kg/cm rated servo will provide 3kg of force to the control surface from a point 1 centimeter (0.4 in) out along the servo arm. Attach your pushrod at 2 centimeter (0.8 in) from the centre of the hub and the servo can only apply 1.5kg of torque. Put an overly long, 3D-type arm on your servo at 4 centimeter (1.6 in) from the hub and you'll only get 0.75kg of torque - not much for driving a massive control surface (Fig. 2).





, Servo selection can be a key factor when building a model. For the purposes of this article, you already have the right servos for the job, so let's set about optimising their torque.

If you found the elevator to be a little twitchy for your liking during flight you probably either rated it down or reduced the throw using ATV. In order to maximise the torque available to deflect the control surface, the correct course of post-flight action would be to move the position of the mechanical linkage: either inwards on the servo or, if this isn't possible, outwards at the control surface horn. You would, of course, then have to reprogram your transmitter to increase the rate or ATV (maybe to their maximum levels if the linkages don't bind up) in order to facilitate the same deflection at the control surface for 'best torque' from the servo.
Another thing to assess in this area is control centering and the 'feel' of the model. For example, does the elevator always come back to neutral after a 180º turn or reversal? Do the ailerons 'hunt' a little after a rolling sequence? If you're unsure then fly the model again, getting your mate to make notes if you think it will help. Poor centring of a control surface is due to problems either with the mechanics (binding servos, stiff linkages, etc.) or the electronics (bad servo resolution or 'dead band' in the radio system). Whatever the problems are, don't continue the set-up until they've been corrected.

, Selection of the correct propeller will fundamentally affect your model's performance. Many pilots want some level of 3D or 'Fun Fly' performance from their models, coupled with good air brakes and fast acceleration, which generally demands a prop of large diameter but shallow pitch. However, if you're after high top-end speed then you need a smaller diameter prop that's relatively high in pitch (for example, one British speed record-holding model used a carbon 8 x 10"" prop turning at 20,000+rpm to achieve its 234mph).

Spend some time deliberating over the way in which your model performed on the initial flights, and if it suits you, then great! Don't overlook the ever-present noise issues, though. On most conventional models the main noise producer is actually the propeller, so if you fly from a noise-sensitive site you'll need to drop the tip speed somewhat. It's important to settle on the prop early, as any changes here will affect the thrust line steps that we'll look at later. When you're happy with your prop choice, make sure it's well balanced and stick with it. Buy spares of the same make and size. Before we start with the trimming proper, bear in mind that trimming is a bit like squeezing a balloon. Change a bit here and something somewhere else will be affected!

, Most kit instructions give a good indication as to where the balance point should be, but this position isn't sacred; it only represents the point where the prototype handled in the way the designer thought it should.

Testing the C of G is fairly simple, its effectiveness being demonstrated best on models with fully symmetrical wing sections set at low incidence angles. With the model at height, observe a flight path where you're viewing from the side and flying into wind. Slow the engine to idle (or motor off if you're flying electric) and push the model into a vertical dive. Release the elevator stick and observe the descent of the model. If it begins to pull out of the dive as if up elevator was applied then this indicates a forward C of G. Conversely, a tuck-under as if down elevator was applied indicates a rearward C of G. Many F3A aerobatic pilots set the C of G slightly rearwards to help the model fly 'hands off' down line. 3D models also usually exploit a very rearward C of G, and it's not unusual to have to apply slight up elevator on these to hold the dive straight (Fig. 3).






When applying this test to a glider, observe the model in a long, steep descent of 45 - 60º rather than a vertical dive. A good proving test for a glider is to fly inverted. Hands-off inverted is often desirable for a racing set-up and is often referred to as a 'pitch neutral' CG position. Some pilots prefer to prove the CG position in a vertical climb rather than a dive, observing if the model falls backwards or tucks under as it begins to slow. Keep in mind that the motor's running flat out here, and any thrust line inaccuracies will create a similar effect. We'll come to those later. In the meantime let's look at the other balance issue.

, This is an aspect of trimming that's often overlooked. Old school modellers sometimes added weight to the wingtips after a session of hanging the model from strings attached to the roof., At a reasonable throttle setting pull tight consecutive inside loops without using any other control except elevator, and leave the throttle alone. Watch carefully to see whether the model begins to track off to one side. It will track towards the heavier wing. Note the direction carefully, then bring the model around the circuit to the same position, throttle setting and heading as before. This time roll inverted and push down elevator to fly tight, consecutive outside loops. Again note the direction of any drift. If the model has a heavy side it will now track in the opposite direction to before. A drift in the same direction indicates a warped wing rather than a heavy one (Fig. 4).






Obviously the lateral balance of models with side-mounted engines is going to be off from the start, so you might expect this side to be heavy. Lateral balance can be corrected by adding small weights to the lighter wing, as near the tip as possible, until the model tracks straight both upright and inverted. On moulded glider wings the weight can be added to the outboard aileron servo bay or under a gap seal near the tip. If you're unlucky enough to have a warped wing and decide to stick with it, you might consider lessening the effect by adding a trim tab on the underside made from trailing edge stock, or experimenting with the mixing on your Tx. Mind you, this is really a compromise and you'll probably never get it perfect.

, It's quite common these days (especially on high-end ARFs) to find the front bulkhead factory-fixed with an offset for motor side-thrust and down-thrust. Whilst these might seem like they're set with intent, any variations in motor or prop size relegates them to the position of 'best starting point'.

The spiraling slipstream from a propeller hits the model's fin at an angle, and the yaw force this generates depends on the motor RPM and forward speed of the aircraft. To a small extent this effect can be mixed out with rudder trim but this will constantly vary as the RPM of the motor changes.

, This is perhaps the easier of the two to determine, but be aware that anomalies with lateral balance and any fin or rudder misalignment can create similar effects. Fly the model at full throttle, straight and level into the wind and then pull vertical at the end of the circuit, as if for a stall turn. It's important to establish the up line quickly without the use of rudder. Be wary of pulling too sharply as any lateral balance inaccuracies will drop the heavy wing and throw the model off the vertical. The model should hold steady for a short while before yawing off to one side. If it yaws to the right, decrease the right thrust; if it yaws to the left, increase the left thrust. Try to have the model hold a vertical up line for at least four seconds before a slight yaw to the left begins (Fig. 5). It may take you a few flights to get this and the lateral balance nearer the mark, but patience will pay dividends so keep at it.





, Again, fly the model at full throttle, straight and level into the wind. Abruptly cut the throttle to idle and watch the flight path. If it climbs, the motor is pulling the nose down when under power and you'll need to reduce down-thrust. The correct thrust line should see the model continuing straight and level before slowly starting to sink as the speed drops. A more abrupt dive is a result of too little down-thrust and you should alter the motor angle accordingly. (Fig. 6). High lift wings (as used on electric-powered gliders) result in a motor installation that has large amounts of down-thrust, whilst side-thrust may not be such an issue. Models with the motor mounted on a pod above the fuselage will need large amounts of up-thrust to work effectively.





, Note also that most F3A aerobatic engine mounts are now fully adjustable with side- and down-thrust trimming in mind., This is the last area where big gains can be made towards perfecting a model's performance. It's really aimed at obtaining purity of yaw axis and rudder control, i.e. when applying rudder the yaw is optimised and any associated pitching or rolling is minimal. Whilst this really only applies to aerobatic models, an insight into what's going on can help us understand some aspects of model behaviour. In order to obtain pure rudder input a low-wing model will generally need dihedral (wingtips elevated above the root), a high-wing model will need a hedral (wingtips below the root) and a mid-wing model might need none at all. Let's look at this in practice:

An F3A pattern ship is designed to track straight, roll pure, and knife-edge forever. Its low-wing design incorporates slight dihedral to achieve purity of the rudder control whilst retaining some stability.
A very aerobatic high-wing design such as the Wot 4 usually has a flat wing that's mounted way above the datum line. If rudder is applied in flight then yaw is induced, but there will also be a large pitch downwards and a rolling motion in the direction of the rudder. To eliminate this mechanically the Wot 4 would need an anhedral wing for purity of roll control, but then the model would lose the stability that's made it a classic design.
Scale aerobatic models like the Extra 300 generally have a mid-wing configuration with little or no dihedral, as they're designed with control purity and some level of instability from the off.

, The test for correct dihedral is made with the model in knife-edge flight. With the aeroplane flying at a decent speed, roll to knife-edge and apply top rudder. If you rolled 'left wing low' with right top rudder and the model slowly starts to roll in that direction (i.e. with the rudder input) then the dihedral angle of the wing is too great. Likewise if the model rolls against the rudder then the dihedral angle is insufficient (Fig. 7).






You'll need to try this on both sides to be really sure, and the remedy is to cut the wings in half and re-join! Once upon a time, maybe, but not so these days. Most modern transmitters with freely programmable mixers will have a dedicated knife-edge mix that applies a little aileron as a slave channel to the rudder input. Experimentation with rudder rate switches for straight and level knife-edge at full throw may result in slightly different figures in the mix for both sides. Models like the Wot 4 will need a great deal of aileron compensation for a given rudder input, whereas a low-winged aerobatic might need only 2 - 3% aileron offset in the mix. An additional free mixer will deal with any pitching induced by the rudder.
Most models will pull towards the undercarriage in knife-edge due to the increased drag it produces about the datum, and of course you'll need to set this up for both sides; but the result could easily be effortless knife-edge flight from horizon to horizon with a model that you'd otherwise struggle with.

Before starting, you must decide on the model you wish to build.,
Do research.,
Choose what configuration you want your aircraft to have.,
Decide whether you wish to expound on your model by including it in a diorama or building separate elements to supplement it.,
Choose the order of assembly.",How to Build a Plastic Model Airplane from a Kit1," Among the model airplane categories there includes fighter, transport, military transport, private, ultra-light, airliner, glider, and others. Choosing what type of model you build is usually as easy as picking your favourite, but some models are easier to build than others. For example, combat aircraft are usually more difficult, often requiring complex camouflage patterns and a familiarity with the proper use of an airbrush. The model you end up choosing should be the result of a balance between your interest and your abilities.;
, Building a model is not as easy as opening the instructions and following them step-by-step. The first thing you must do before assembling any parts is read the instructions thoroughly, from the introductions, steps and paint list, all the way to the parts list. Most model airplanes will be packaged with an alternate set of paint schemes and sometimes even parts. Choosing which paint scheme and aircraft variant must be done before any assembly takes place. Background knowledge of the aircraft may help you choose which type you want to build.

, Configuration may include whether the landing gear are up or down, the doors open or closed, the air-brakes or thrust reversers extended or retracted. In the case of combat aircraft, you must also choose whether to include the weapons and drop-tanks. If the kit you are planning to build includes a pilot or passengers, you must choose whether to install them as well. Finally, choose whether you wish to “weather” your aircraft. Weathering may include soot trailing from the engine exhaust, gun ports, engine cowl, etc… consider the type of aircraft you wish to build and base your choices on the situations that aircraft may find itself in. For example, combat aircraft usually appear more weathered than commercial aircraft. Write down all configuration choices you have made so as to keep a picture of the aircraft fresh in your mind, or at least close at hand.

, Some kits come with weapons racks, vehicles for maneuvering the aircraft on the ground, and/or ground personnel. These objects may be useful to set the place of your model, but may also be inappropriate based on your aircraft configuration (for example: an aircraft in flight on a stand will seem out of place next to a toiling maintenance team). If you are ambitious enough, you may choose to build a diorama or separate elements from scratch. Such a diorama should be sketched out to aid in building it, and a clear materials list must be kept in preparation for its assembly.

, While the paper instructions included with the kit will have a beginning and an end, it may not be advisable to follow the order of assembly step by step. The installation of some parts may inhibit the installation of other parts further along, and if you must paint one part but not the part next to it, you may also have some difficulty. Assembling the aircraft in your head before opening your tube of glue is imperative, and must be clearly defined and recorded to make the assembly as fun and as easy as possible.

Ensure all parts are clean.,
Use a small pair of scissors or shears to remove the parts from their respective sprues.,
Before gluing parts together, always ensure that the contact points are clean and that the parts fit well.,
Once two parts are glued together, it may be necessary to clamp them together until the glue sets.",How to Build a Plastic Model Airplane from a Kit2," Dust and oil may inhibit the adhesion of paints and glues, as well as detract from the authenticity and “look” of the model. You can remove dust and oil with warm water and a very small amount of detergent. Bathe the parts, still on their sprues, in a shallow basin for several minutes, agitating them occasionally. After that, rinse them thoroughly before drying them with a clean paper towel. No detergent or water must be allowed on the parts as they are assembled.

, Using a knife to remove parts is difficult, dangerous, and may damage the part. Only when the part is removed may you use a fine knife to remove any flash or excess sprue still attached.

, When applying the plastic cement, only apply to one of the parts. An excessive amount of plastic cement will not only prolong or prevent proper adhesion, but may also melt and deform the parts. Plastic cement must always be used as conservatively as possible. When gluing clear parts, such as windows or canopies, try to avoid plastic cement. This is because plastic cement can “fog” clear plastic even in areas where not directly applied. For clear parts, use white glue.


Gaps between parts may become apparent after assembly. To remove a gap that is too large to overlook, it may become necessary to separate the parts, adjust their fit, and re-adhere. Another option is to fill the gap with modeling putty, or another substance which dries to hardness and can be smoothed and painted over. When applying putty, only the smallest amount is required. An excessive amount will be difficult to remove later and in the case of clear parts, may be impossible to remove without evident damage to the part beneath. Follow the instructions on the packaging and use a plastic tool to apply the putty, so as not to scratch the model.
If an assembled part is not adhering properly in some places, it may not be necessary to separate the parts and re-adhere. Another option is to use a liquid plastic cement to re-adhere the parts. By applying a small amount of liquid glue to the outside of the gap, the glue is drawn into the gap by capillary action. It is important not to apply too much glue, for the reasons above, but also because too much glue may remain outside the gap and dry to hard, malformed bubbles. In general, less than a drop will suffice. When the glue has been applied, hold the parts firmly together until proper adhesion is assured.

, This may be done by holding the two parts firmly together with your hands, but you may also use a variety of tools to do the same job. Elastic bands, clothespins, plastic clamps, tape, and wire are all suitable materials. When applying the clamps, make sure that the pressure exerted on the parts is great enough to keep the parts together, but not nearly enough to deform or break them. Also make sure that whatever clamp you choose to use will not scratch the plastic.

Choose a suitable place to paint.,
Before painting a part, make sure it is clean and dry.,
Ensure that the paint you are about to use is mixed to a thorough consistency.,
It may become necessary to mask adjacent parts from the part you wish to paint, so as not to accidentally get paint on that part.,
When painting with a brush, always ensure that it is of appropriate size and that there are no loose or stray bristles.,
You should always follow the published instructions included with your airbrush, but some key points to especially remember are to keep you airbrush perpendicular and of fixed distance from your work, and to paint in one direction only (unless painting camouflage patterns).,
Dry brushing is a technique which employs only a small amount of paint, usually to achieve the effect of weathering.,
After painting, it may become apparent that some paint needs to be removed, whether it holds dust, has found its way onto an adjacent part, or simply is the wrong colour.",How to Build a Plastic Model Airplane from a Kit3," You should not paint where dust or other airborne particles may adhere to your work. Choose a clean, dry place, between 5 and 30 degrees Celsius to apply and dry paint.

, Painting over particles will not remove or hide them, but trap them in place.

, Start by striking the closed container of paint sharply and repeatedly against the palm of your hand. After about 20 strikes, open the container and mix the paint thoroughly with a stir-stick. A piece of sprue shortened to length makes an excellent and accessible stir-stick.

, Masking can be in the form of masking tape or liquid masker. With masking tape it is necessary to cut the tape to the size of the area you wish to mask. Before applying the tape, it is good practice to remove some of its “stickiness” by applying it to another material and removing it again. This makes the tape easier to remove once painting is complete. When applying masking tape to the part, ensure that no gaps are present along the edges of the tape. The other method of masking, using liquid masker, may be preferred for smaller or awkwardly-shaped parts. To apply a liquid masker simply use an old, clean brush, and wait for it to dry. Once the part is painted it should be allowed to partially but not completely dry before the masker is removed. Completely dry paint runs the risk of “tearing” if the mask is removed, whereas paint that is too thin may flow to the masked part once the mask is removed.

, Brush painting should be reserved for small or isolated parts, or parts which require a certain finish to them. Applying paint with a brush leaves striations in the direction of brush travel, and must not be used for exteriors or large surfaces.

, Airbrushing provides an even coat of paint, and while being better suited for large surfaces, may be used on smaller parts whose surroundings are properly masked.

, To dry brush, take a dry paint brush and apply a small amount of paint to it. Next, brush off any excess paint on a piece of paper until the result is an inconsistent streak of paint which resembles the weathering you are trying to achieve. Paint the weathering onto the model before the paint dries further. It may be necessary to reapply the paint and remove the excess several times before the level of weathering you want is reached.

, To remove paint you may either scrape it off or use a solvent. Scraping is appropriate for small, flat parts and may be performed easily with a small, sharp knife. Solvents can range from specially designed paint removers to brake-fluid, but the method of application usually remains consistent. Using a brush, apply a small amount of solvent to the part you wish to remove paint from. After the designated amount of time, remove it carefully with a clean paper towel. Not only will the solvent come off on the towel, but a portion of the paint will, too. Repeat this process until all the paint has been removed. For large parts it may be practical to submerge the entire part in solvent to effectively remove the paint.

Ensure also that your model is free of contaminants and dust, so nothing may be trapped underneath a decal.

, It is not necessary to cut out the decals perfectly; rather you should leave a few millimeters around each decal to avoid cutting it accidentally.

, The water should be at least lukewarm to remove the decals from the paper they are printed on, but not scalding hot. Never use boiling water to apply decals.

, Make sure you are not gripping a part of the decal itself under the tweezers.

, At this time the decal will lose most of its adhesion to the paper and is ready to be applied to the model.

, The edge of the paper must be lying on the edge of the part, so the decal is transferred immediately from paper to part. Using a clean, wet brush, maneuver the decal onto the part and position it accordingly. Ensure that all air bubbles and creases are removed from the decal by pushing them out with the brush.

, The decal should be left alone for an hour to allow it to dry completely. Until then, it may be accidentally repositioned. To reposition a partially dry decal, simply apply some warm water with the brush and maneuver it back into position.

Make sure the top edge of the paper is even with the rest of the page. Use your copper pipe (or any other thin, round tube) to create the shape of the rocket by rolling the paper around the pipe.Tuck the paper underneath the pipe simultaneously as you roll. This will ensure the body is as snug as possible.
If the tube slides smoothly and freely as you’re rolling, you’re in good shape.;
, Once your paper is tightly wound around the pipe, unroll it so only a third of the page is around the pipe. Hold the paper in place with one hand and using the other hand, grab the glue. Rub a strip of glue the entire length of the page. Roll the paper a little more to cover the newly placed glue spot.


Repeat this action of rolling a little, placing glue, rolling a little and placing glue, until the tube is sealed. Pay special focus to the last edge you glue. Ensure it is extra secure so it doesn’t unravel during flight.
Continue to rub and roll the solid tube for several minutes to make sure everything is holding in place and sticking accordingly. Think of the tube as a rolling pin for dough and simply roll it back and forth.

, Holding the pipe upright with one hand, slide the pipe out the bottom about half an inch. This will leave the same amount of space (half an inch) exposed at the top that is not supported by the tube.

, Using a single finger, bend the unsupported edge at the top of the tube down. This will create a three or four layered end. Press hard against the pipe so it is firm.


Once you’ve smashed the edge, press the crimped end on the table to really smash it in.

, Using scotch tape, grab two, inch and a half pieces or so of tape. Place the tape over the bent end of the cardstock. Make sure the tape is crossed for added security.This will prevent the edge from popping open once shot.

, Using a separate sheet of cardstock, fold the paper in half lengthwise. Holding the opened side of the paper, cut upward diagonally on the opposite corner of the page. When you open the fin, you will have created a large triangle with the bottom measuring about two to two and a half inches wide.

, Align the bottom of the triangle along the base of the rocket (non-taped end). Place a piece of tape over the tip of the triangle so the tip lays flat but the wings are perpendicular to the rocket.


Use only a single piece of tape here so the fins have a little flexibility.

, You can do this with a little play dough. Using a small amount, about the size of a dime, make a ball of dough. Drop into the open end of the rocket. Use your copper pipe to push it to down all the way.

Make sure the people around you know you’re about to fire so you don't hit them.

, If you have one long PVC pipe, it will need to be cut into three 12” long pieces and three 6” long pieces. Cut them using a handsaw or hacksaw.


If purchasing PVC from a hardware store, ask them to cut pieces to the required lengths to save time at home.

, Grab your liter bottle and firmly insert one of the 12” long pieces into the end. Use duct tape or electrical tape to secure the connection around the mouth of the bottle.

, Snap a connector onto the end of the 12” long PVC piece. Add another 12” long piece of pipe to the opposite end of the connector., Connect a PVC tee to the end of the second 12” long PVC pipe. The bottom of the tee should point vertically, as this is where the rocket will shoot from.


Connect the final 12” pipe by placing it into the tee.

, Insert a 6” long pipe into the remaining tee opening. Place another tee on the opposite end of this by pushing the bottom of the tee onto the 6"" long pipe.


You will have two openings pointing in opposite directions.

, Take the two remaining 6” pipes and insert one on either end of the tee. Place ½” end caps on either end so air doesn’t escape when in use.


The final launcher will be a “T” shape with a single vertical rod sticking up front its center.

, Place your paper rocket onto the vertical launch pipe. Stomp on the bottle to shoot the rocket into the air!


You can add blocks underneath the pipes. Doing this will send the rocket soaring across the sky in an arch, rather than straight up into the air.
Play with the design by adding two vertical pipes or more to launch multiple rockets simultaneously.

Make it a contest.",How to Make a Diet Coke and Mentos Rocket," For the purposes of this example, we’re using Diet Coke, but you can actually use any type of diet soda (as long as it contains aspartame).


Warm soda causes better explosions, so avoid using cold/refrigerated soda.For best results, purchase room-temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot (not boiling) water for a few hours before using it.;
, Experiments have shown that while the original Mint Mentos will give you a longer explosion, Mentos Fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion.Other experiments have shown that Mint Mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide’s escape from the bottle, making for a more intense explosion.As the rocket is more of a fast-acting affair, you might want to go for Mint Mentos.
If you have the time and money to do so, why not try one bottle with Mint Mentos and one with Fruit Mentos, and then compare the results?

, You probably have this one lying around your house already, but if you don’t, you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere (hardware stores are a safe bet).

, Wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda-Mentos concoction, but also from any other debris (for example, the lid) that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes.

, Your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy; make sure it has enough room to do that. If you’re in a parking lot, make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50-foot radius, if not more.


If there’s a field or empty lot nearby, go there to make your rocket. You don’t want to risk doing damage to anyone’s car or home, as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair.

, It’s possible you’ll get covered in the sticky Diet Coke-Mentos solution. Wear clothes and shoes that you don’t mind getting wet and sticky — preferably ones that are easy to wash.

, Bring your 2-liter bottle of Diet Coke, your pack of Mentos, your masking tape, and your safety goggles to wherever you’ve decided to build your rocket.

, Place the strips of tape on a flat surface, with their sticky sides facing up. Do not allow them to stick together.

, The more Mentos you use, the better the explosion; however, you don’t want to the Mentos to dip too far into the Diet Coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle.

, They should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging: stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins.

, Be sure to leave the sides of the Mentos exposed.

, You’ll use this piece to attach the Mentos to the bottle cap, so ensure that it’s small enough to fit inside the cap.

, Take the 3-inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you’ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of Mentos. This will create a ”loaded” Mentos cartridge that you can place inside the Diet Coke bottle.

, Put the cap on a flat surface, with its inside facing upwards. Place the Mentos cartridge, sticky-tape side up, into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there.


Be careful not to press too hard, as you don’t want any Mentos falling out of the cartridge!

, This step is optional. If you’re worried about the Mentos prematurely falling into the Diet Coke, you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll, including the cap.

, The cap should be securely on the bottle, but not closed too tightly. If it’s closed too tightly, the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle, and the rocket won't work. As you twist the cap on, you’ll also want to make sure that the Mentos do not touch the Diet Coke yet.

If it seems like the Mentos will touch the Diet Coke, you can either dump a small amount of Diet Coke out before screwing the cap on; redo your Mentos cartridge to contain fewer Mentos; or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible.

, Shake it so that the Mentos fall into the Diet Coke, and then keep shaking. Do this for at least a few seconds.

, There are several different methods for “launching” your rocket:


A popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground (preferably hard ground, like cement). This is the best method if you’re worried about getting hit by the rocket, as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction.
Another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground, the ground knocks off its cap.
Yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90-degree angle, cap-first, on to the ground.

, You can skip this step if your rocket works right away. If the rocket doesn’t go off when you throw it, pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. Just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far, otherwise you’re likely to end up covered in Diet Coke., When the bottle hits the ground, its cap should fly off and the Diet Coke-Mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle’s opening. This should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. Depending on how you throw it, the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds.


Side-angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground.
Vertical launches (in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground) tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward.
If the bottle is still full of Diet Coke and Mentos but it’s stopped moving on the ground, you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it.

, Once you’ve finished your experiment, don’t forget to pick up after yourself. Clean up any bits of tape or Mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. And pick up the rocket! Clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin (or bring it to the bottle depot).

, The more Mentos, the better the explosion. Experiment with putting different amounts of Mentos into the Diet Coke bottle to see what yields the best explosion.

, Studies have shown that Mint and Fruit Mentos yield different explosions. Try mixing them together in one cartridge and adding them to your Diet Coke bottle to see what sort of explosion they cause when they are mixed together.

, Fill an Empty 4-liter milk jug with 4 liters (2 two-liter bottles) of Diet Coke. Leave enough room at the top to add at least an 8-Mento cartridge.


As with the original rocket recipe, stick the Mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug, fasten the lid, shake the container to release the Mentos into the Diet Coke, then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard.

, Get together with your friends and each make your own rocket. Set up a flag or some other way of measuring height, and have a judge watch and name the winner.

Roll a piece of paper into a cone.,
Wrap the nose cone with duct tape.,
Attach the nose cone to the bottom of the bottle.,
Take thin cardboard and cut out 3-4 triangles.,
Add ballast to give the rocket weight.,
Fill up the bottle with water.,
Make a very small hole through a cork.,
Stuff the cork into the bottle opening.,
Place the needle-like valve of a bicycle pump into the opening of the cork.,
Turn the rocket right-side up.,
Launch the bottle rocket.",How to Build a Bottle Rocket1," This will be the nose cone of the rocket. Feel free to use colored or patterned paper to design the rocket., This will have it stronger and more water-resistant.


If you want to add a bit of color to your rocket, you can use colored duct tape to wrap the nose cone.






You can also paint the plastic bottle if you’d like to decorate it further. Feel free to also add a design or logo to the plastic bottle (or body of) the rocket.







, You can glue it or use duct tape.


Try to put it on a straight as you can onto the bottle and make sure it is secure., Since these will be the fins of your rocket, try to cut them at perfect right angles so they can help the rocket stand straight.


Use cardboard, construction paper, or manila folders as material for the fins. Sign boards, such as the ones that say “For Rent” or “For Sale” are also very good fin material.
Place the fins on the lower part of the rocket.
Bend “tabs” into the sides of the fins so that they can attach to the rocket body more easily. Then, tape or glue them on.
If you line up the bottoms of the fins with the bottom of the rocket, it should be able to stand on its own.

, Ballast can be any material that provides weight for the rocket and ensures the rocket can coast once it is launched.


Use Play Doh or clay as ballast as it is soft, malleable, and unlike pebbles or marbles, won’t fall out or scatter when the rocket launches.Mold about half a cup of Play Doh or clay into the ridges on the bottom of the bottle to form a rounded end on the outside of the bottle.
Cover it with duct tape to keep it secure.

, Pour 1 liter of water into the bottle., Make sure the hole is the same size as the valve of your bicycle pump valve.

, You can also wedge it in with pliers for a tighter squeeze.  

, Make sure it fits into the cork tightly.

, Hold it by the neck of the bottle onto the bicycle pump valve, and aim it away from your face.

, Make sure you are in an open, outdoor area. The rocket will shoot up quite fast and high so remove any obstructions and warn anyone around you before you launch it. To launch the rocket:Hold the rocket by the neck of the bottle and pump air into it. The rocket will go off when the cork can no longer withstand the pressure building up in the bottle.Let go of the bottle. The water will shoot out everywhere when the bottle rocket takes off, so be prepared to get a bit wet.
Do not approach the rocket once you start pumping, even if it appears that nothing is happening with the launch, as this can lead to injury."

Cut off the cap end of one of the bottles.,
Keep the other bottle intact.,
Add any decorative paint or designs to the bottles.,
Put ballast into the cut bottle.,
Tape together the two bottles.,
Take thin cardboard and cut out 3-4 triangles.,
Make a very small hole in a cork.,
Stuff the cork into the opening of the intact bottle.,
Place the needle-like valve of a bicycle pump into the opening of the cork.,
Turn the rocket right-side up.,
Launch the bottle rocket.",How to Build a Bottle Rocket2," Use scissors or a box cutter. You want a nice, clean cut so the bottles can be taped together cleanly and straight.Cutting off the cap end of the bottle will make the rocket more aerodynamic and durable. A rounded end is also softer so it will do less damage to any objects if the rocket hits something when it lands.

, It will act as the firing chamber that will hold the water and pressurized air. It will also be attached to the launcher, or other bottle.

, Feel free to personalize the two bottle rocket with any logos or patterns. Be creative!

, You can use Play Doh, similar to the procedure for the one bottle rocket, or kitty litter. Kitty litter is cheap, heavy, and when wet, will stay in place well.To put in the kitty litter, tip the cut bottle and pour in about ½ inch of kitty litter. Then, add enough water to wet the kitty litter completely. Add another ¼ inch of kitty litter and soak it again.
Avoid dumping in too much kitty litter as this can create a dry layer of kitty litter than could get loose and scatter when the rocket is launched. Too much kitty litter, or weight, in the rocket, can also cause the rocket to hit hard when it comes down.
Dry the inside walls of the bottle and use duct tape to help hold the kitty litter in place.

, Line them up so that the cut bottle is on the bottom of the intact bottle. Press the bottles together, so that the edge of bottom, cut bottle goes over the intact bottle and tape them together with duct tape., These will be the fins of your rocket, so try to cut them at perfect right angles. This way, they will hold the two bottle rocket straight and make sure it coasts smoothly.


Place the fins on the lower part of the cut bottle.
Bend “tabs” into the sides of the fins so that they can attach to the rocket body more easily. Then, tape or glue them on.

, Ensure the hole is the same size as the valve of your bicycle pump valve.

, You can also wedge it in with pliers for a tighter fit.

, Make sure it fits into the cork tightly.

, Hold it by the neck of the bottle and place it onto the bicycle pump valve.

, Make sure you are in an open, outdoor area. The rocket will shoot up quite fast and high so remove any obstructions and warn anyone around you before you launch it. To launch the rocket:Pump air into the bottle. The rocket will go off when the cork can no longer withstand the pressure building up in the bottle.This is usually at around 80 psi.Release the bottle. The water will shoot out everywhere when the bottle rocket takes off, so be prepared to get a bit wet.
Be cautious once you start pumping and do not approach the rocket, even if it appears that nothing is happening with the launch, as this can lead to injury."

Collect the materials and building supplies.,
Drill a hole into one of the 1/2"" PVC caps using your 9/16"" drill bit.,
Pull the valve through the drilled hole so it is air-tight.,
Place the top of the empty, capless soda bottle in the top of the 1/2 x 1"" bushing.,
Cut the steel rod into a 10"" piece, then bend your steel rod into a U shape roughly 1/3 inch wide.,
Press the two ends of the rod into the side of the bushing, mark where they touch the meet the bottle cap, then drill two holes to thread the steel rod into the bushing.,
Take the 1/2"" x 1/4"" bushing and carve out the stopper with a sharp knife or a Dremel tool.,
Cut a piece of 1/2"" pipe to 12"" long, then make a mark 2"" from one of the ends.,
Glue the 1/2"" x 1/4"" bushing (the one you carved out) so that it ends right at your 2"" mark.,
Glue and elbow onto the small ""stub"" pointing out from your bushing.,
Glue the big PVC coupling to the other end of the bushing, the one already glued to the PVC rod.,
Glue the bushing with the launch pad holes drilled into the other end of this coupling.",How to Make a Bottle Launcher1," Go to the hardware store and buy the materials you will need, listed below. You will also need a collection of tools, such as a hammer, electric drill, drill bits, a bike pump, and a hacksaw/PVC cutters, but most people will already have the equipment. You should buy:


.453 rim hole tubeless tire valve (auto parts store)
PVC cement
1/8"" steel rod 24"" long
2-liter soda bottle
6' of 1/2"" Schedule 40 PVC pipe (all the following parts are Schedule 40 PVC)
1 1/4"" x 1/2"" Bushing
1 1/4"" Coupling
1 1/4"" x 1"" Bushing
2 1/2"" elbows
4 1/2"" caps
3 1/2"" t's;
, Start with a thin, small pilot hole, then drill the big one. This hole needs to contain your valve, so if you're not using a .453"" tube then you need a drill bit that will fit the valve snugly.








, You want the top of the valve (where you add air) to be sticking out of the top of the PVC cap. The ""seat"" of the valve should fit right in the cap.








, Note the wide plastic lip right where the screw top meets the bottle. You'll be using your steel rod to pin this lip down, keeping the bottle in place as it gains power. You can then pull the steel rod out of the bushing to let the rocket release.









This lip must be at least a 1/4"" below the top of the bushing.

, You want the ends of the steel rod to fit on the side of the bushing, as you will thread them through the bushing. Bend the 10"" piece directly in half -- it should be perfect.








, Use the bottle to make your height lines. Then use a sharpie to draw two horizontal lines on the top of the bushing to guide your drill. Remember -- you need to rod to cover the lip of the bottle and keep it in place. The rod acts a bit like a pull tab, holding the bottle down until you pull it out. The bend of the rod should be out to the side, with the ends inside the bushing.









Start with a 3/32"" bit to start the holes, then a 5/32"" drill bit to cut them to size.
Use your rod to poke through the holes and get out any hanging bits.

, The smaller bushing needs to be thinned out on the inside so that the other bushing can slide right through. To do this, take a sharp knife and carve away the inside of the bushing so the whole thin is the same width.








, This is the final piece of your launch mechanism.








, Using PVC cement, glue the bushing to the 1/2"" pipe, making it so the bottom of the bushing is right at the mark you made. There should be 10"" of pipe remaining. The little stub will point out.









The 1-1/4"" bushing end should point to the larger end of the pipe.

, Make sure you glue a nice, airtight joint everywhere you can.








, Slide the coupling onto the longer end of the PVC rod, then fit it into the back of the bushing. Make sure you glue it on well, so the joint is airtight.








, Make sure that the holes you cut are still visible above the coupling. By now, if you went from one end to the other, you would have:









Elbow joint
Smaller bushing
PVC coupling
Launch pad bushing
1/2 PVC pipe.

Start off by cutting the cork to its preferred length by cutting it in two.,
Drill a hole through the exact centre if the cork, which the same diameter as your valve.,
Slam the valve through the hole with the use of a hammer; use a pair of pliers again to secure the cork.

,Let the valve's inflation side stick out for at least 5mm (or 1/5 inch)

,
Attach fins and a nose cone to the water bottle to increase altitude and stability.,
Launch.,
Push the launch system into the nozzle of the rocket with the valve positioned so that you're able to pump air into the rocket.

,
Position the water rocket with the nozzle faced downward onto a makeshift tripod which will leave the rocket positioned with its nose towards the sky.,
Pressurize the rocket.",How to Launch a Water Rocket," Your piece should be around 2/3 of the length of the threaded part of your valve; which is very often around 1.5 cm (or 5/8 inch).;
, Use a pair of pliers to secure the cork while drilling.

,,, This is optional

, You're ready to launch your rocket! Fill the rocket for about 1/3 to 1/4 with tap water.

,, Make sure this is stable.
], Do this by attaching a bicycle pump or compressor to the valve first and then start pumping. This may take some time (usually between 5 and 40 seconds, this heavily depends on your pump and rocket size).
"
"
Find a large field at least half as long and wide as the expected altitude of the rocket.,
Set up the launch pad in the center of the field.,
Load the model rocket motor.,
Keep in mind that, if you have a parachute or streamer recovery system, you should place three squares of wadding in the rocket tube if using paper wadding (if you bought a kit, this is the wadding that should have came with it).,
Place the igniter in the nozzle of the rocket motor and secure it with the plug provided.

,
Remove the launch rod safety cap.

,
Place the rocket carefully on the launch rod and attach the electrical clips to the ignitor.

,
Stand back as far as the electrical cords allow and keep any spectators behind you.

,
Insert the safety key into the launcher and begin the countdown.,
Remember, if the rocket doesn't launch when you press the button, wait at least 60 seconds before approaching it.",How to Launch a Model Rocket Safely," Make sure there are no power-lines, trees or other obstructions. See the NAR (national association of rocketry) safety code for details.;
, Don't forget to put the safety cap on the launch rod.

, Important: Only use the recommended motors for your rocket. Using the wrong motor could lead to physical injury or damage to your rocket.

, If using cellulose wadding (often called ""dog's barf""), use 3 times the diameter of the rocket.

,,,,, At zero, press the button and watch your rocket escape the surly bonds of earth.

, Make sure the igniter is fully inserted into the motor, check electrical connections for short circuits, and try again. If it still doesn't launch, change the motor.

Select a rocket launch site.,
Choose a central location within the launch site for the launch system.,
Prepare the model rocket launch system.,
Prepare the rocket for launching.,
Do a quick safety check.,
Slide the model rocket onto the launch rod.,
Connect the ignitor on the model rocket to the launch controller on the launch system.,

Deal with any problems.,
Find your rocket.",How to Launch a Model Rocket," Choose a large field free of debris, power lines, trees, or buildings. Make sure there isn't any dry flammable material near the launch site (such as dry leaves, twigs etc.)Football fields, parks, and playgrounds can be good sites for a model rocket launch. Be sure to check park and playground rules to make sure you are permitted to use the area for a rocket launch.
Different sized rockets require different sized launch areas. For example, a rocket with engine size A would require a 100' x 100' launch area. The instructions on your model rocket launch kit should specify what size engine and launch area you need.;
, Make sure all spectators are at a safe distance away from the launch system. It is also a good idea to position several people to act as trackers as rockets can launch very high and fast, making them difficult to track down once they make landing.

, A model rocket launch system consists of two things: a launch pad and a launch controller.Most rocket launch kits will come with a launch pad and launch controller.
Most rocket launch systems require some assembly. You should assemble the rocket launch system before you begin to assemble the model rocket itself.
Most launch pads consist of several parts: a 3-4 leg platform to provide stability on uneven ground, a launch rod to control the angle of the model rocket at launching, and a deflector plate to protect the launch pad from being damaged by the rocket engine when it is ignited. Follow the instructions provided with the kit or launch pad to assemble these properly. There are several types of launch pads, and you should always the appropriate one for your type of model rocket. The instructions for your model rocket or kit will tell you which type is required. The next component of the rocket launch system is the launch controller, a piece of electrical equipment that ignites the rocket igniter attached to the model rocket by supplying appropriate voltage to cause the igniter to burn. Some of these connect to an external battery to provide this voltage. This controller will be connected to the model rocket later via wire and clips. , You will need a rocket body and nose cap, recovery wadding, the recovery system, an igniter, the model rocket engine, and engine mount. First, insert the recovery wadding into the rocket through the nose cone end. Recovery wadding is a type of flame resistant material that will protect the model rocket from flames during the ejection of the model rocket engine. Without the wadding, the parachute or recovery system will melt. Be sure not to pack this material too tight or the recovery system may not eject properly during launch. Second, fold insert the parachute or recovery system into the tube of the model rocket body.
Third, place the nose cone back onto the rocket body.
Fourth, install the igniter into the model rocket engine, as per the instructions in your kit or with the igniter. The model rocket engine is what powers the flight of the rocket.Lastly, insert the model rocket engine into the engine mount, the portion of the model rocket that houses the engine. In many cases, this will be a system of hooks inside the rocket tube or a separate kit for assembly will be included. Be sure to check your instructions with your model rocket kit to see what is required for assembling the engine mount., Make sure all spectators are at a safe distance away from the launch pad and your tracers are in position to find the rocket once it lands. Also, check again for any flammable debris or other obstructions to the rocket's trajectory.

, First, disconnect the safety cap off of the launch rod and slide the rocket on. The rod should go through a cylindrical piece on the side of the rocket called the launch lug.


The rocket should rest on the deflector plate of the launch pad.
Be sure that the hole in your launch lug is clear and slides easily onto the pole on the launch pad.Angle your rocket away from any area you would not want it to land in.

, Connect the clips from the controller to the igniter wires.


Don't let the clips or the wires touch each other. This can cause a failed ignition.

, Place your key in the launch controller. Use a countdown and press the button to launch your rocket at the appropriate time.


A common type of countdown that is used by model rocket enthusiasts is: ""5... 4... 3... 2... 1... LAUNCH!"" When you reach ""LAUNCH"", press the button.

, If your rocket launch fails, check that your connection between the controller and igniter is secure. There are a number of other reasons why an igniter might fail. Here are some common troubleshooting tips:


Inspect the igniter wires where they protrude from the tip of the pyrogen. They shouldn't touch each other. If they are touching or close to touching, you can adjust them.
When placing the igniter into the rocket, turn the rocket upside down so the nozzle is pointing up. Then drop the igniter into the nozzle. Gravity will help the tip of the igniter to touch the propellant, which is necessary for proper ignition.
Each igniter comes with its own plug to hold it into place. Press the ignitor plug down hard into the nozzle on the igniter.
Make sure the igniter clips are clean before you hook them up to the igniter wires. Dirty clips are a common problem and can prevent a good electrical connection from taking place. When you attach the clips, attach them as close to the pyrogen as possible, but make sure they are not touching each other.

, It can be reused if there's no damage. Minor damage can usually be repaired.


It is a good idea to have several people positioned down field to act as chasers or spotters. This can help you find your rocket more easily once it lands.
If your rocket is severely damaged, you may not be able to re-use it.
A really useful thing to have with you is five minute epoxy. This allows for quick and strong repairs if there's any damage.

"
Gather the ingredients and equipment that you will need for the process.,
Create the Dettol solution.,
Choose the models you wish to strip the paint off of.,
Place the models carefully in the Dettol bath.,
Leave the models in the bath for approximately 24-48 hours.,
After 24-48 hours, remove the container cap, put on your gloves and remove a model from the mixture.,
Brush off all the loose paint onto the newspaper with your toothbrush.,
Dunk your brush and any equipment clogged with removed paint (i.e.,
Re-soak the miniature if required.,
Place the cleaned models on the towel or cloth you have placed down.,
Take the models individually and rub them with your hands under a tap of running water.,
Taking another cloth, ""polish"" the models but rubbing the cloth over the model's open areas.,
Flick off any remaining paint in the deep recesses with your second toothbrush and the hard, slim object you have (i.e.,
Rub the models down one last time with your cloth and leave them to dry for about a day.,
Reuse the mixture if you want.",How to Remove Paint from Metal and Plastic Models with Dettol," You will need the following:


An original bottle of Dettol solution, which is a liquid disinfectant available from most supermarkets, pharmacists or general stores. Do not get any variation of the Dettol solution or your results may vary from those intended.
Two old toothbrushes, preferably hard or medium in strength, as soft toothbrushes fail to remove as much paint.
Some sort of fine object, such as toothpick, pin or paper clip. These will come in handy later on in the process.
A large container, about the size of a gherkin jar or larger. Glass or plastic will suffice, but make sure it is one you can do without as it will not be usable after the process.
Several rags or cloths, preferably thin so you can feel models through them. Again, make sure they are old and unwanted.
Two rubber gloves. Dettol, while not dangerous, does dehydrate skin and can cause peeling and discomfort on areas exposed to it for too long. Wearing thin surgeon's gloves, or similar, will help you avoid this problem.
Access to running water, preferably where you are working with the process.
Newspapers or covers for the area you will be working with, as it can get quite messy and the paint that you remove will be hard to get off any surfaces should it fall onto them.
A well ventilated room. The mixture can give off a lot of fumes, which although harmless, can be a bit overwhelming in a confined space. An open door or a few open windows should allow sufficient airflow.;
, You can create as much of the solution as you require, and to varying degrees of concentration too, so there are no hard and fast rules. Generally, a 1:1 ratio of Dettol to cold tap water in the container you have brought will give you the best result in 24 hours. You can make the mixture with more water, for example a 1:2 ratio, but the models will need to rest in the solution for longer. So if you have bought a whole bottle of Dettol, the easiest thing to do is simply pour the bottle in and then mix in an equal amount of water, and add more if you wish. Nothing else needs to be done to the solution.

, This solution works with both plastic and metal, and on both heavily painted and partially painted models. The mixture does loosen joints of ""green stuff"" modeling putty and occasionally super glue, so do not soak any models where you wish to keep the miniature in once piece with these adhesives.

, You can do as many, or as few as you'd like.

, Most models will only need a day's soaking, but with the newer, stronger paints available and better knowledge of undercoating, some models will indeed need much longer before all the paint will come off. Of course, the mixture will not harm detail, so is perfectly safe for this period of time. Remember to screw the cap on of the container and leave it in a safe place.

, The mixture should be almost opaque, maybe milky or brownish, and paint should have formed a loose slime covering on the models and with one of your toothbrushes, will be very easy to flick off onto your newspaper.

, Only use one toothbrush, as the second will be used later in the process. Flick away from you at roughly a 45 degree angle to the model's surface. Keep scrubbing away in all the grooves and areas until the paint is gone. If it won't budge, read further on.

, your gloves if they are getting paint back on your clean model, you model if it still has loose paint etc) back into the Dettol mixture NOT tap water to remove any loose paint from it. This is very important - if you place the mixture with loose paint into water, it will clog up your brush and the model, and anything else it touches and make it near impossible to continue. See the tips and warnings sections for more information.

, Sometimes you will need to remove the majority of loose paint and place the model in the bath for a further 24 hours or so before the most difficult-to-remove paint will budge. Scrub off as much of the loose paint as you can and if it still isn't fully cleaned, place the model back in the mixture. Repeat these steps as many times as needed until you are happy that all the paint is gone.

, By now you should have a nice, bare model. However, there are a few more steps to go - paint can still be lurking in the recesses of the model and can obscure detail or even weaken layers of paint on top of it later in your painting.

, It is safe to take your gloves off now as most of the mixture will be washed away. Rinse the models under the water until you can feel they have lost their ""slimy"" feel on your skin. Place them back on the cloth.

, You will be surprised how much paint is still left on the model. This will also help dry the model fully for the next step.

, paper clip, toothpick etc). There is no need to get this brush into the mixture. Really look to force the toothbrush into the gaps and recesses to make sure there is no paint in them.

, After this time period, the model should hopefully be ready to be painted on and of course, all your paint will have been stripped in a non-lethal, easy way!

, The Dettol mixture can be kept for a long time, but generally, it begins to lose its effect after the second use. It would be advisable to throw the mixture away in a safe environment, clean the container out and then remake a new batch of the solution.

Cut the remaining 1/2"" pipe six identical 6-10"" segments and one smaller 2-4"" inch piece.,
Attach the 2"" piece of PVC and a T-joint to the elbow at the end of the launcher system.,
Glue a piece of PVC into the T-joint, perpendicular to the launcher system for support.,
Extend the frame further away from the launcher with more 2 more PVC pipes, 2 more feet, and two more T-joints.,
Add one more PVC pipe to extend the frame, then glue the final elbow joint at the end, pointing up.,
Glue the valve piece into the elbow joint, pointing up.",How to Make a Bottle Launcher2," These exact specifications are not quite as important as the others, so use what you have left however it fits. The stand is made of one long piece of PVC pip (1/2""), and three smaller legs extending off the sides, flat on the ground, to keep everything standing up.

, You want the actual launcher (the bushing with the holes in it) pointed straight up to the sky. Glue in the small piece to the elbow, then attach a T-joint to that small piece of pipe.








, This is your first support foot. Glue it in, then glue on an air-tight cap over the end to keep pressure up.








, Make sure that this T-joint points the opposite direction as the other one for maximum support. As always, glue everything air-tight and glue on an end cap to prevent air leakage.








, The whole thing makes a small U-shape, with the two feet sticking perpendicular away from the frame.








, You may need one more small piece of PVC to connect the elbow joint to the cap with the valve. Remember -- you can never glue it too air-tight!

Attach a bike pump to the exposed valve.,
Fill the bottle 2/3 of the way with water and slide it onto your exposed PVC pipe.,
Slide the steel wire into the drilled holes into your bushing to hold the bottle down.,
Make sure the bottle points in a safe, open direction, then start pumping to roughly 80psi.,
Release the steel wire to launch the rocket.,
Understand what is going on.",How to Make a Bottle Launcher3," This is how you increase the air pressure in the bottle. Each pump adds air to an already tight, pressurized system. With nowhere to go, this pressure builds up in the bottle and propels it when freed.








, The water will be your ""fuel"" as it comes under pressure.








, Use the U-shaped wire to lock the bottle in place. It will want to move as pressure builds up.








, If you don't have a pressure gauge, just pumping for 15-25 seconds would work out just fine. Make sure that you are in a wide-open area.








, Make sure your head and hands are away from the launcher and bottle -- it will really fly if you're not careful.








, As the air pressurizes the bottle and launcher and is then released it creates an action force blowing the escaping air down. In turn this creates an equal and opposite force for the bottle to go in the other direction, upwards! This is because of Newton's Third Law of Motion. Increasing the pressure inside the bottle increased the thrust (Newton's Second Law of Motion). The water is inside the bottle to add velocity, as the water is heavier than the air so as the air pushes the water out first on launch your bottle will fly further.

Get to know acrylics.,
Get to know enamel paint.,
Get to know watercolours.,
Get to know lacquer paint.",How to Paint Plastic Models1," Acrylic paints are one of the most popular types of modelling paints, and many hobby stores sell these. There are many brands, such as Humbrol, Revell and Tamiya. Acrylic paints are water-based and are therefore not toxic, so are good for young modellers. They also have lower odour, so can be used in less well ventilated areas, and as they are water-based, they can be cleaned and thinned with water. Acrylics also have a fast curing time of around about an hour.


Acrylics also have their disadvantages. Acrylics do not bond well on smooth surfaces, and to combat this, before painting, all the parts should be washed with soapy water, as well as primer being applied before. The short curing time is also a disadvantage, as it can leave brushstroke marks. They are also difficult to blend, and so airbrush effects are hard to achieve, and can only be removed with sandpaper.;
, The second and final major type of paint is enamel paint, and these are oil based, and can be toxic, so should only be used in well-ventilated areas. They have a long curing time of approximately 24 hours. They can only be thinned or cleaned with specialist thinners or white spirit, which can also be toxic.


Enamel paint sticks well to smooth surfaces, and is hard-wearing. The slow drying time allows the paint to be blended and one can achieve an airbrushed effect. The paint can also be stripped off quite easily with white spirit.

, Watercolour paints are used on models for weathering and can be reactivated with water, and watercolour pencils can also be used too. To make watercolour paints permanent, a layer of varnish must be put over the top.

, Lacquered paints are best applied with an airbrush, and although highly toxic, they dry instantly, and have a glossy sheen. They also need a specialist type of primer otherwise the paint would dissolve the plastic.

Spray a layer of protective primer over your car's model.,
Sand the model with a fine grit sandpaper.,
Wash your car.,
Apply your coats of paint.,
Sand and wash your car.",How to Paint a Model Car1," Pull on the middle of a wire coat hanger so that it looks like a diamond. Continue to flatten out both sides so that they run vertically. Once your done doing that, bend the hanger over itself to create a stand that your car model can hang on while you work on it. The hanger should look like the letter C. Attach the end of the hanger to the inside of your model using a strong masking tape.Once you're done taping your model to your stand, test its stability by pressing your fingers on the front and back of the model.
Attaching your model to a hanger will allow you to spray paint the entirety of the car, including the bottom and interior.;
, Purchase a model-specific primer or a general primer to lay an opaque base coat for your model. You can purchase a protective primer at most arts and crafts stores. Apply pressure to the trigger of the primer and try to get an even coat across the surface and interior of the model. Once you're done, remove the tape and spray primer in the areas that were covered up by the tape. Keep your model in a well-aerated area while it dries. If you are using a primer specifically made for model building, you don't need to apply a base primer, though it could add to the overall consistency of your paint job.
Use a gray or off-white primer for your model car.
Primer will also act as an adhesive for other layers of paint.
A layer of primer is necessary if you want to use real automotive paint because it contains solvents that are harmful to the plastic model.
The primer will take anywhere from two to four hours to dry., Take the model off of the stand and use a 1200-1500 sandpaper to smooth out the car's surfaces. When sanding, make sure not to sand off the protective primer that you applied. If you notice that you do, go back to the area and spot paint with your spray can. The goal is to get your model smooth and ready for painting., Wash your car with a damp rag and a drop of mild dish soap. There will probably be primer residue left over from sanding that you should remove. If there is dust on the surface of your car before you paint it, it will be trapped in the paint job. Pat your car dry once you're done.

, Reattach the car to your painting stand and shake your spray paint can. Point the spray paint can on your car and administer pressure to the trigger while slowly sweeping the can horizontally to apply even coats of paint across the surface of your car. Once you're done, allow the paint to dry overnight before applying another coat of paint. Continue to do this until the color reaches the deepness and richness that you desire.Before you paint your model, it's smart to practice using the spray can on a piece of newspaper.
Spray can handles are add-on mechanisms that you can add to any can to make it easier to spray.
Enamel paint dries slowly and hardens to a shiny finish.
Acrylic paint dries quickly and is easier to clean up., Once you've painted your car to the desired hue, you'll most likely want to remove the bumps and imperfections in the dried paint. Sand the surface of your car with a very fine 3600 grit sandpaper. Once the surface of the car looks smooth and even, wash the car with cold water and a drop of mild dish soap."

Allow your model car parts to dry before applying additional coats.",How to Paint a Model Car2," There are paint thinners that have been created specifically for model use. If you are using a specific brand of paint, use the same brand of paint thinner. If you can't find paint thinner or want to create your own, combine 50% distilled water with 50% of isopropyl alcohol and your paint in a 1:1 ratio. Thinning out the paint lightens the consistency and enables you to make more consistent coats., Use a mild dish soap and cold water with a rag to wash off your car. Remove any particles of dust that may have built up on the surface of the car as a result of sanding. Wipe the model dry before moving onto the next step.

, Dip your brush into your paint and fill in the more intricate pieces of your model, like the mirrors first. Make sure not to paint over areas where your model will fit together, or you may have trouble assembling your model correctly.Get a variety of different sized brushes to make painting easier.


You can use either a synthetic or natural-haired brush to paint your car models.

, Continue to paint over larger parts of the car. Do not dab or scrape with the brush unless you are doing specific detailing. Instead, you want to achieve an even coat by making long and even strokes.


Popular paints for model cars include Testors, Model Masters, Humbrol, Tamiya, PollyScale, Floquil, and Vallejo., Allow your model car to dry overnight before going back to apply additional coats to the model. Continue to work at painting your car, applying the paint as evenly across the model as possible.

Allow the paint to dry.",How to Paint a Model Car3," Read the user's manual for the airbrush that you are using. Once you've correctly hooked up your air brush, practice at different pressure levels to get a feeling for how the airbrush works. Use a cheap paint and airbrush on large pieces of butcher paper. Airbrushes typically cost anywhere from $25 to $300 and up.Remember to wear a protective mask and to lay out a tarp on your work area when using an airbrush.

, Use a mild dish detergent and cold water to wash the surface of your car. This should remove molding agents which could react poorly with your paint. Once your car is free of dirt and dust, allow it to air dry before airbrushing it.

, Because an airbrush paints a large area at a time, it's important that you tape off decals or designs that you want to paint in later. Once you've achieved the car has dried, you can remove the painter's tape and fill in finer details with a more precise tool like a brush.

, In order to quickly airbrush your car, it will need to be suspended in the air. Use a bent wire hanger as a base and stand for your model car, attaching the stand to the car from the inside. As an alternative, you can also find a stable and flat pillar to set your car on top of as you paint. Make sure to attach the car to the stand using masking tape.,,, Connect the paint jar color that you want to use to your airbrush. Apply the first base coat with your airbrush by applying pressure to the actuator, or button on the top of the airbrush. Quickly move your hand left to right and apply mist coats at 25-30 PSI. Continue to rotate your model car as you apply more coats of paint. When you are nearing the end, lower the PSI on your airbrush to 18-20 PSI to apply the final one or two coats.Lowering the airbrush PSI will make the paint come out thicker.
Do not let the thick paint run, or it may ruin your model. Be conservative on thick coats of paint.
Remember to airbrush separate parts of your car, such as the hood, as you paint the car's body.

, Dry your car model for 24-48 hours before handling it. Keep the car in a cool area free of sunlight while it dries. Once it's totally dried, examine the car and look for areas that are not painted. Instead of airbrushing over the car again, fix small details with a brush and matching paint.

,, Re-wet the entire area with the fixer. The results are shown in the picture accompanying this step.

, Use the same approach with layering of the pigments and the same colors to make it match. Use the same layering approach on the front and rear of the vehicle as well.


, On top of the front fenders, sprinkle a dry mix of pigments in the same color blend, dip a large brush in pigment fixer, and touch the edge of the fenders, and the capillary effect will do the rest of the job. Make sure you don't touch the pigments with a wet brush. Let the fixer flow freely and allow it to surround the sprinkled on pigments. This is to avoid the flattened look and get some structure in the mud.


The same flicking/sprinkling method is used on the rear of the vehicle.

",How to Customize Your Model With Glow in the Dark Paint," The glow effect is painted to simulate the street affects of the models real life counter parts on the streets that use neon lights to glow the underside of the car. The first way is to mix glow in the dark powder with a clear polyurethane. Glow powders come in 8 different colors and now glow super long. Some glow for over 12 hours. Most modelers use the powders that are white in the daytime and then glow either blue, purple, green aqua or white in the dark. These powders glow with different intensities and longevity. The glow in the dark powders glow times are as follows. Green 12 hours, Aqua 10 hours, Blue 5 hours, Purple 4 hours, and white 2 hours. Mix 1 oz of glow powder to 4 oz of the polyurethane. The simply brush it on. The mixture can also be sprayed on with an airbrush or gravity fed detail gun.;
, You want to mix your powder with a slightly thicker clear medium. We suggest a clear gloss acrylic. Model Master makes a nice 1 oz bottle. Mix in ¼ oz of glow powder and then apply as normal.

, Working with the glow in the dark paints or powders is a little tricky. Almost all model bodies are sprayed to get the best finish. The best affect we have witnessed were accomplished by spraying the entire body of the car with white primer. Then you tape off the areas you wish to paint as normal. You can mix glow powders with Testors Transparent Colors. The glow will be slightly diminished because of the pigment in the paint but not that much. The powders in all these applications need to have light energy to glow. They store this energy and slowly release it over time. You mix the powder with the transparent paint ¼ oz powder to 1 oz of paint. The same as the clear gloss acrylic for pin striping. Then spray as normal. You can not mix two glow powder colors and get a different color. Blue and yellow do not make green. You can create different shades by adding more coats, or using more glow powder. The options are really endless with glow in the dark products. For more information on long glowing products and their application you can visit www.glonation.com. Happy modeling.

Take your tweezers and slowly lift the decal up towards where you want to place it on the model.,
Let the decal set.",How to Apply Transfers to a Model," Leave enough space around it, but not so much that you chop off parts of other transfers. This can be done either with a normal pair of scissors, or, for more accurate cutting, one can use a hobby or craft knife to leave as little excess backing paper as possible.;
, You should see the decal or transfer starting to curl up and separate from it's backing paper. That is when you know you should take the decal out of the water.

,, This will allow the decal to dry off unnecessary water. Leave it for a minute., Then use a paintbrush to slide the decal off it's oil based backing paper and onto the model. Use the paintbrush lightly to position the decal to where you want it, and in the right orientation.

, Although new modelers can leave it at that, modelers looking for a high quality finish will apply some decal solution onto the decal afterwards. The main manufacturers of the decal solution are Humbrol, Revell, Tamiya and Vallejo. The point of a decal softener is to 'melt' the decal and help it conform to the contours of your model to make the decal look like it has been painted on.This can help the decal mould to panel lines or recesses and even the wingtips and nose of aircrafts. Now, you will have a decal that looks supreme on your next model!

",How to Make a Diorama," Dioramas are small scenes created of layers of materials, all depicting a similar theme. Think of the topic or idea you want your diorama to portray - is it a scene from a book? A period in time? An example of an ecosystem or animal/plant group? The options for a diorama are endless.









The theme you choose may vary depending on the ultimate size you want and the amount of supplies you have. A very broad theme may not be able to be accomplished in a small shoebox, while a very specific theme will be difficult to accomplish in a large frame.
Consider the availability of your supplies. If you want to make a diorama with an ocean theme, but have nothing to represent water or fish, it will be difficult to accomplish.;
, Create a list of ideas for possible inclusions for your diorama. How do you want the background to look? Will you use found objects only, or printed pictures as well? Do you need to buy any supplies to create your scene, or can it all be made using things from your home and garden? Brainstorming ideas prior to starting to build up your diorama will help you to have a more finished looking piece.









Try making a rough sketch of what you want your ideal diorama to look like. Think of the composition of the piece, and the layout of all the figures.
Gather as many of the supplies for the project as you are able prior to putting it together. Getting the supplies organized will make the assembly of your diorama much easier than trying to find them as you work.

, Because dioramas have layers of background, they need a box or frame that is several inches deep. For a basic diorama, a shoebox or old shipping box can be turned on its side and used. Larger dioramas can be created out of a large wooden crate or frame attached to a box. Anything that gives the illusion of a small open-faced room can be used as the frame for your diorama.








If you have specific goals in mind for your diorama, you can consider building a box out of wood to fit your desired dimensions.
Get creative with the frame for your diorama. For example, a diorama depicting a family scene or people could be done in a refurbished dollhouse.

, Your diorama should be worked on from the back to the front. As you work, you will add layers of details and images which create depth in your scene. Make the background first against the farthest wall of your box. Consider painting a basic scene or printing an image and gluing it on. You could also create a collage out of magazine cutouts to act as the background for your diorama.









Don’t forget to add a background image to the inside sides as well as the furthest back side.
If you want, you can paint the outside of your box a different color to add a more finished look. This should be done before you begin adding layers and figurines to your diorama.

, A realistic diorama does not fail to acknowledge the creation of the ground. Add details to the ground using paint or modeling clay. Papier mache can be used to create the illusion of real mountains or hills in addition to those painted in the back.








, Add your first layer of details and objects at the back and near the sides of your diorama. At this point, you could add larger detail items such as trees, rocks, or pieces of furniture. Keep to the edges of your project, as you will work inwards and forwards as you go.








, Complete the background for your diorama by adding any additional landscape details you may want. If you are creating a nature scene, add anything to represent trees, grass, flowers, rocks, et cetera. The same should be done for any scene though - add in everything you want for a completed landscape.








, Although you don’t have to, complete your scene with the addition of small figurines or models. Keeping with our nature theme example, you might put small toy animals or bugs throughout the frame. Consider hanging things like birds or tiny airplanes from the top of your frame using fishing line and a bit of hot glue or staples. Simple photos could also be printed of the figures and be cut out and set amongst the landscape. This is the final step in your diorama, so complete the scene as you like!







, Although you may just want a simple, smooth ground in your diorama, you can create a very realistic and textured ground easily. Try gluing sand or gravel along the bottom of the frame to give the look of a rough terrain. Pine needles, small leaves, and grass clippings can be glued down to look like grass or a more natural bottom.









Make boulders and small details out of modeling clay or papier mache and glue them down using hot glue.
You can paint or print photos of details you want to be on the ground if you are short on time.

, To give the appearance of trees in your diorama, gather small twigs and branches from your yard or neighborhood. Twigs without any leaves look like trees barren in the winter, while small branches off of bushes or trees with needles look like full trees. Stick a tiny ball of clay on the bottom of the branch to hold it upright, or glue it to the inside of your box.









If you want a more playful look, consider using tree figurines from a childrens toy set or doll house. These are available separately from the packs in some childrens toy stores, or can be taken from a complete toy set.
Consider cutting out pictures of trees from printed photos or magazine clippings. You can cut a little extra of the paper at the bottom of the tree and then fold it backwards so that the paper tree will stay upright when set away from the sides/back of the box.

, If you are looking to create the look of water in your diorama, consider using glass, cellophane, paint, or nail polish. To give the look of a small pool, use a piece of mirror set on the bottom of your diorama with small pebbles or pieces of grass glued around the edges. You can also pour a pool of blue or green metallic nail polish and allow it to dry in a puddle at the bottom of your frame.









If you are doing an underwater scene, stretch blue cellophane over the entire opening of the frame. This will give everything a blue tint like it is underwater, and will add an extra layer of dimension to the diorama.
Photos of water can be added as the background or glued to the bottom of a diorama for a large covering of water.
Use basic acrylic or tempera paint to add a simple background of water to your scene. Small waves can be painted or drawn in as well. Paint paper with the image of water and stagger it inside the box to add layers of dimension.

, To add detail to the sky, consider putting in things to act as clouds, the sun, the moon, or stars. Cotton balls work well glued to the background and roof as clouds. The Stars can be created out of dots of glitter glue, silver nail polish, or metallic paint. Create a large sun by painting a small styrofoam ball and hanging it with fishing line or hot glue. The sky is the limit in terms of the items you use to represent celestial beings!

Determine the available space and the most common use for the projector.,
Learn about the factors used to categorize and evaluate projectors.,
Decide how much you can spend to buy a projector.,
Determine the number and types of inputs and outputs you will require when you buy a projector.,
Visit a projector dealer or trade show to compare projectors.",How to Buy a Projector," This will help you narrow down the most important attributes to consider when you buy a projector.


For example, weight will be a factor if you will transport the projector frequently. Weight will not be as important if you buy a projector for fixed installation. Portable DLP projectors are lighter than portable LCD projectors.;
,


Resolution is a major factor. Projectors for viewing videos in a large room or auditorium, for example, will require a higher resolution than projectors used for PowerPoint presentations in an office. You need to choose a projector with a high enough resolution for its most frequent use. A resolution of 800 x 600 DPI (dots per square inch) is generally adequate for basic PowerPoint presentations in an office or conference room. 1024 x 768 or higher allows for more detail and 1280 x 1024 for an even higher quality image.
Brightness and contrast are important elements of image quality. Projector brightness is measured in lumens. Lumens range from 500 to 1,000 for small, dark rooms to more than 2,000 lumens for large, brightly lit rooms. Purchase a projector that is rated for the most brightly-lit uses you anticipate. Additionally, the larger your screen size, the more brightness you will need.

, Projectors are available in a wide range of prices. You need to budget and balance cost and performance considerations.


When you purchase a projector, your total purchase may also include a screen and possibly other peripherals, such as a monitor and cabling.

,


If you wish to project to a monitor as well as a screen, so that a speaker can refer to a presentation without turning away from the audience, you will need to choose a projector with a second VGA or video output.
If you plan to project video, determine whether you need to buy a projector with HDMI, composite or component video inputs.

, This will help you evaluate brightness, contrast, noise level during operation and other factors that may be hard to visualize without actually seeing the projector.


Your dealer may also have specific recommendations for your particular situation and needs.

Stick with what fulfills you.,
Ask yourself what kind of person you want to be.,

Be aware of your influences.,
Be patient.",How to Find Your Way," Before you can find your way, you must understand where you are standing. Become conscious of your circumstances, even if you still don't know how to change them. Try to figure out exactly why you feel lost or adrift. Develop the clearest possible picture of your life as it is.


Think about how you spend your time and energy. Look at what you do every day, and try to parse out the things that fulfill you from the things that feel pointless. Think about how you can cut those meaningless activities out of your life.
Try setting these thoughts down on paper. Write about your life, or make a list; draw a chart or map that describes how all of your passions and commitments are connected. You may find that a visual representation helps you understand your situation.;
, It can be difficult to find your way when you are scanning the distant horizon for inspiration. Even if you decide upon a path from where you stand at this moment, you will encounter endless forks and diversions along your way. Indeed, your journey will not become real until you've begun moving in a direction – any direction. Break your inertia, and build momentum. There is a good chance that action will make you feel empowered to change other things., Be bold, and take a chance. This does not necessarily mean that you should commit to something huge. Find a small step that you can take to explore your path. Dip your toes into the water, and see how it feels. If you don't like the way that things are developing, you can always switch your focus elsewhere.


Perhaps you've always dreamed of being a musician, but you have no idea how you'd ever get to that point. Try something simple: take a music lesson, and buy or borrow a cheap instrument. Make a commitment to yourself to try it out for a few weeks.
Maybe you feel stuck, and you want to move to a different city. Do something small that feels like a step in that direction: visit a new city to scope it out, or look for jobs and housing in your spare time. Your vision will only become real if you put it into practice.

, Your way will fall into place as you walk. The individual steps may feel small and insignificant, but they will build into something powerful if you keep at it. This is the very nature of a way: it does not happen all at once – it is happening all the time. Your way is the sum of every single moment in your life, of all the million things that you do and dream, and there is no map that can show you exactly where you will wind up.Getting started along your way can be as basic as deciding to try something out. Intention is a powerful thing.

, It is easy to say that you're going to do something, but it is not always easy to follow through. Take the initiative, and do not wait. The longer you hesitate, the longer it will take to find your way. Be afraid of stagnation, not of obstacles.


Catch yourself each time that you make an excuse. Learn to recognize the signs: perhaps you plan to do great things, but you give in to self-doubt when the moment comes. Embrace your fears; eat your fears; use them as fuel.

, Be aware of how certain activities and situations make you feel. If something excites you, grips you, and engages you to delve deeper – explore it. Open yourself up to the possibility that your way might be right in front you. You won't know until you try. Be bold., Embrace your joys and your ideals, and try to own your circumstances. Don't try to suppress what truly makes you happy. You can certainly work to become the best possible version of yourself, but don't waste energy trying to become someone else. You are a unique and powerful human being, and you have the agency to own your destiny.Remind yourself that you will not find your way if you are riddled with self-doubt. You will need to make a choice, and you will need to step boldly into your future.

, You may come to a point at which your way seems to fork. You want to do this, and you want to do that; perhaps you want to do three things, or four things, or more things! Your way can be a focused and singular path, or it can be a constant exploration of new, exciting endeavors. Ask yourself whether you will be content with choosing, and whether it's worth splitting your energy up into different categories.


If you choose to forego all other opportunities in pursuit of one goal or path: try to stick to your choice, but give yourself the space to open yourself back up. If you are going to commit wholeheartedly to a single job or focus, however, you may need to close some of the other doors.
If you decide to split your time between two passions—say, music and psychotherapy—you may find yourself facing a hard, if meaningful, path. You will need to be especially disciplined if you want to keep on top of both goals.

, If something makes you feel joyful, meaningful, wired, inspired: keep doing it. See where it goes. You still may not have a clear picture of the larger scope of your ""way"" – but you can let this feeling guide you.


Remember: this thing doesn't need to be your only passion, and it doesn't have to be the only place to which you direct your energy! Your way can be a mix of many things., This is your lodestone, so touch it often. Practice being that person, and know that it may not be easy. If you want to be an adventure travel writer, then you have to get up out of bed, exercise, go out and explore – and then come home and write about it. Playing computer games, watching TV, eating snacks, and hanging out at the mall doesn't get you there. It gets you somewhere else.

, It's okay to be critical about the things that you were taught growing up. Many children are socialized to share the views of their parents, their communities, and their societies – and those views may not serve your adult life. Ask yourself whether your assumptions about the world are accurate or useful.


It can be stressful to handle new information that contradicts or disproves what you've been taught. Remember: this doesn't necessarily mean that you must cast away everything you've been taught – merely that it pays to be conscious. Carefully consider each truth, and decide which truths serve your larger purpose.
Be aware that questioning certain beliefs may alienate you from peers and family members. If you've grown up deeply involved in a religious tradition, your family and community may not approve of you refuting that tradition.

, You likely aren't finding your way in complete isolation. Think about who you're spending your time with, and consider how they might be impacting your purpose. If you structure your days around people who are active and inspiring, then you may find it easier to engage and connect with meaningful work. Surround yourself with people who help you grow.Sometimes, you may find that other people are holding too much sway over your choices. Consider whether this plays into why you feel lost.

, Understand that you will not find your way overnight. Reading this article is only one small stepping-stone along a deeply personal journey of self-discovery. Remind yourself that it's okay to wait for the right opportunity to come along. Don't jump at the first half-decent chance that you get – but don't wait too long!


If it isn't perfect, don't be afraid to let it go and wait for something that you really want. For instance: don't marry your first boyfriend if it doesn't feel right. Don't take the first job that someone offers you without looking at the other options.
On the other hand, be wary of chasing perfection. Sometimes, it's best to choose the option that's in front of you. If you wait too long, you might let dozens of great opportunities pass you by!

Seek forgiveness from God.,
Release the offense in your heart and apologize to the person or people that has hurt you.,
Embrace healing through restitution.,
Forgive yourself.,
Remember: forgiveness is a process, it keeps on and on.,
Choose to ask forgiveness and release forgiveness to take hold of your emotional healing.",How to Find Healing in Forgiveness," To admit one's fault and to understand a need God's help and healing, you must have humility. People with too much pride often bypass forgiveness because they must humble themselves to apologize.

Ask God to forgive you. Pray to him like you would talk to a friend --- God is your friend! Be yourself as you pray; God loves everybody and doesn't care how you pray to him. Just be respectful.



 


Proverbs 3:5, ""Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;""
1 John 1:9, ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."";
, If you can, meet the person face-to-face, but if they live too far away, write them a sincere card or call them on the phone. Even if the person who hurts you never apologizes to you, you still should forgive them.


James 5:16, ""Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.""

, Restitution describes the act of restoration, making amends and correcting a wrong act that was done. Restitution clears the conscience by clearing away guilt. This act gives freedom to ones mind and conscience. Restitution is unconditional. It must take place whether the offended party is receptive of any restitution done not. We have to recognize human individuality and uniqueness in responding to situations. Sometimes even the offender refuses to ask forgiveness to us, we should forgive them inside our hearts.


Matthew 5:23-24, “Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.""

, Remember that sinning or messing up is the fact of life. God will forgive us --- and never remember it again. Face your life and keeping on going, despite your stumblings and shortcomings.


Hebrew 10:17, ""Then he adds: 'Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.'""
Jeremiah 31:34, ""No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the LORD,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the LORD. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”

, Finding healing through forgiveness is a process. Memories flash back, pain floods in and sometimes they bring back the same reactions one has had at the moment when the pain was inflicted. It seems forgiveness isn't taking place and we lose faith. Forgiveness takes place when we choose to release forgiveness each time we remember and ask for forgiveness each time the devil berates us with contempt over and over again.

, Life is just great when we see beauty around us. When we get to appreciate the essence of simple things and learn the grandest wisdom in every life's situation.

Decide what philosophy you want to think about, it may be anything from Axiology to Metaphysics; you decide.,
Go even deeper now and select a sub-category; for example if you chose Metaphysics, you'll need to decide whether you want to examine ontology, philosophy of mind or body, or religion.,
Start by making notes on what you think on the subject, even if your views are ill-informed, write them down.,
If you don't have an idea don't worry, start by doing some research into it, look at both sides and form an opinion.,
For those who have an idea, start looking at why you think what you think.,
Once you have done that, do some research, look at both sides, but don't form an opinion, as stated for those without an idea.

,
Now, take everything you have; your opinion, other people's opinions and why you and they think that.,
Start by tearing into the problem, it may be is there a reality?,
Have an argument with yourself, make a statement about the subject, like 'I know there is a reality, because I can sense it'.,
Counter argue, 'but have your senses never deceived you before?'.,
Keep doing this until you get to some truth or certainty and if you can't just say it is impossible to know and ask why is it impossible for me to know?,
Once you have a truth, build it up, allow your thought to expand out like tree roots, starting from one root or truth and growing more roots, i.e.,
Continue arguing these points to ensure these are truths and just keep going.

,
Eventually, you might just have a strong argument for there being a reality, it is a good idea to write these down in a notebook throughout your forming of the philosophy, you can then write these more formally, at a later date.",How to Form a Philosophy (Advanced)," It is best when deciding what branch of philosophy you want to study, by picking one that deals with topics either relevant to your current subjects. By that I mean, if you are a musician or artist it is better to study Aesthetics, as this deals with the value of art and 'does it have any meaning?;
, Like the previous step choose one relevant to you, especially if this is your first attempt at forming a philosophy from scratch. It can be very difficult to get into and concentrate on something unfamiliar or uninteresting, this might put you off philosophy or lower your confidence if you decide to give up on a topic you don't like. So best to start with something you like.

, By writing them down it'll be easier to keep track of what you think, it will also make it easier for you to spot flaws in you thinking and why you think those things, however you must look at these notes as if they are someone else's, to make yourself truly impartial.

, Make sure you do research of both sides as you'll have a biased opinion from the start and as you try to prove one side or the other you won't have the full facts, probably ending up with an ill defended conclusion. People will immediately see the flaws and tear your philosophy apart.

, A mind map will help you. As stated earlier this will help you spot flaws in what you think and how to remedy these flaws to form or attempt to form your flawless philosophy or truth, which is the philosophers end goal.

,, It is best for you to do some research by asking people's opinions as well, for the reason that they are usually biased. You can use their opinions to form part of your philosophy, in the sense that you show how there ideas are wrong and yours are right. This could be done like this: If there are only three possible answers, X is wrong because ..., Y is wrong because ..., Therefore Z is right because ... X says... Y says... they are wrong... However if it is done like this... then Z is right. Roughly like that, hopefully yours will be Z.

, Can we know? Rip it to pieces and ask why? You can't tell what an atom is made of unless you break it apart, you shouldn't stop until you break the philosophy down into it's constituent parts. A's philosophy is X, X is formed from Y+Z, so A's philosophy is Y+Z. However Y is formed from Q+U but Z is a truth or the base, therefore A's philosophy is (Q+U)+Z or X.

, Making assertions like the previous statement will help you build your argument, by proving it or:

, Counter arguing will help breakdown the philosophy or narrow down the possible answers there could be.

, If you find some truth like Z which is an axiom or self evident truth requiring no proof you're actually getting somewhere, but if you've broken down the philosophy of X by A into: (Q+U)+Z or X, Or X to be true all of it's constituent parts need to be true, like a healthy person must be by definition made up of healthy parts or else he would be a lame man. The rest of his body may be healthy, but if his one lung doesn't work he is not a completely healthy person. Therefore if Q,U and Z are right then X is right however if Z and Q are right but U is false then X must be false; following our lame, healthy man allegory.

, finding other truths based on your first truth. If Q,U and Z are right and X is right then you've wasted a lot of time proving something someone else has already proved however if you prove Q and Z but not U, meaning X is untrue, start looking at what could produce a truth using Q and Z but not U, unless you are looking at the opposite of U to find a truth that is.

,, Remember, though, that philosophy is a continual process of old philosophies either dying and been thrown out or rejuvenating and evolving. Greek thoughts about the universe, like Thales belief that the universe was made out of water has been proved wrong by new technology, try to ensure your philosophy can evolve like Socrates or Kant. It is easier to have a more flexible system in ethics and political theory than in epistemology and metaphysics which compete with medicine and psychology which are sciences not arts like philosophy; they instead based mostly on empiricism.

Consider what your own point of views are and what you believe.,
Consider how you got them.,
Examine alternative points of view to your own.,
Go back to your ideas first and compare the two.,
Explore if any theories are bullet proof.,
Explore the current relevancy to points of view.,
Try to apply different ideas to your own, they might seem bizarre and totally foreign, but see if they work and have any value.

,
Consider that views and ideas are just part of the thing we call an identity and culture.,
Examine if there are in the world many people who go through life without seeing beyond their own ideas and if that limits them or harms them and others.,
De-clutter your own mind.,
Consider the relevance of this analogy: A person can know some things as real and true, but if they explore what they don't know and cannot find answers, they should not be ashamed to say they don't know.,
Consider finally that there are not many truths, but one.",How to Explore Theories and Live Beyond Them," Write these down and look at how they influence your way of thinking and acting. These might be theories on anything, such as why we are here, how we are here, what is right and what is wrong and so on.;
, Did you get them from your education, from your relatives, friends or mentors. Did you get them from mainstream society or are they your own theories?

, If you have ever had someone else disagree, or offer an alternative idea to one of your own, examine that one and why you select your own above another persons.


Try to see if the other persons ideas are valid, sometimes one person is right and one is wrong, but sometimes both can have different but valid points of view and sometimes theories are right in some conditions, and wrong in others.

, Try not to have any bias or prejudice to another persons ideas or your own, but just see how ideas give you and another person advantages and disadvantages.

, Many theories or views often are relevant in some cases, but not relevant in others and that an opposite idea might have merit. Look for any points of view that are applicable in every case, how rare are they?


If you can find some, explore why they are 100% consistent and if they have an opposite. If you can find none, Try to find out why that it is by looking a little deeper and asking more questions.

, Ask other people their ideas and examine wisdom and culture generally. Is there some ideas that become redundant in changes of technology?


Some examples of old ideas might be that the world is flat, or that diseases are caused by magic. By sailing around the world it was shown the idea of a flat world was incorrect and today is no longer relevant. In the same way, it wasn't until the microscope was invented to see viruses and bacteria that cause many illnesses that we know that its not spells and curses.

,, As well as how we perceive and remember events and the strength of how we feel and react to events and impulses.


Consider this analogy. A persons mind is like the room we live in, ideas and beliefs are like the wallpaper or paint we put up to personalize our room. Is it possible that with so much wallpaper we have papered or painted over the windows and doorways so we cannot see beyond our own mindset?

, Are you or other people prisoners in a gilded cage of ideas and beliefs?

, If you feel that you are a prisoner, start to let go of some ideas and see if you can live without them. You don't have to abandon them all, although try to see if it is possible to live without them entirely and if that does in fact set you free.


If that gives you benefit or well-being, tear down some of that wallpaper and let the light in.
If that makes you feel nervous, Try to see why. Is there a loyalty to that theory, or something you identify with? Or are you fond of a particular idea above what is really happening?

,


There is a true honesty in admitting you don't know the things you don't rather than making up something in order to be certain. If things change and it is possible for the truth to be known, then a truly honest person would not be ashamed to examine it and accept it.

, That things are true or that they aren't. What is true does not belong to anyone, any society or any idea, but is relevant to everyone, anywhere. Try to find the truth that applies to everyone beyond ideas, theories and cultures and how that can help yourself and other people.

Start at the beginning and look at what knowledge is.,
Consider how much of your knowledge you actually understand on a deep level.,
Explore the relationship with knowledge and the present moment.,
Test what happens when you release the past.,
Consider now the relationship you have with your philosophy or religion.,
Start to explore individual facets of the philosophy.,
Consider the benefits and possibilities of improving your understanding.",How to Explore the Difference Between Knowledge and Understanding," Knowledge, in effect, is the accumulation of facts, myths, trivia and beliefs. Its an all encompassing field of data that we use to live by from methods to complete a task, data to be able to plan as well as the ability to reflect on what was learnt.


Reflect on how you accumulated this great store of data. Data can be accumulated from schools and other people and the mind stores this if it has interest in it, be it trivial interest or functional relevance.;
, By and large, the amount of knowledge we have is far greater than the amount of it we really understand. For example, we may all know that placing a raw egg into boiling water will cook the egg, but we don't necessarily understand the process that affects the proteins in the egg, however a specialist who studies the process will not only learn how, but understand why. In the same way, we may know many pieces of wisdom but much of it we simply store as learnt, but not as understood as we seldom observe it or apply it in a mindful manner.

, Knowledge when closely observed, reveals itself to be entirely linked to the past, but not the present moment. All our knowledge and information has been accumulated over a long period of time, the present moment simply is - there is just awareness and being.


It is important to consider this aspect. There is very little data- knowledge we didn't come across through education, experiences and from personal study, but this retention of data is simply the retention of data that is not obtained ""now"", but was obtained ""then"" and is now stored for our personal use in our minds.

, You may try this as a thought experiment, or during a meditation exercise. If you do let go sufficiently to be fully aware of the present moment, its likely only to be for a few minutes as the process of the mind depends on knowledge so it quickly reverts to the process it is familiar with using.

, How much of it is knowledge learned as opposed to knowledge understood? It is a very surprising point to understand, that many of the methods to live well and be happy have already been discovered by the multitude of philosophers, saints and religious leaders over time. So why is it that we may hear the answer, but it still not make any difference, yet for some it does?

, By contemplating its intention as well as its method of application as well as its alternatives and its non application, you can get a deeper insight. Its still not sufficient at this stage, but this is the foundation to building understanding. The greater deal of understanding happens when the knowledge learned is applied directly in the moment.


The fascinating part of the mind is that it can see the same thing and still learn something new. Just like when you look at a photograph or a painting many times, eventually more and more of it becomes apparent to you. You see more subtle effects of light and shadow, the brush-strokes and paint textures and colours and more subtle parts of the background which can give new meaning and interest. With this in mind, you can explore the philosophy or teaching, or more generally life and the mind itself to be able to comprehend it and find deeper applications and benefits.

, In essence, understanding is a very deep process with great benefits, whereas simple book knowledge, rote learning or mnemonic style information occupies a very shallow level of the mind and so gives minimal benefits. It is only when a person has learned it well enough to apply it in the moment, can understanding then grow from knowledge.
Finish the process by reflecting again on the difference between knowledge and understanding. Knowledge ultimately being the collection of past events and second hand knowledge obtained elsewhere. In the present moment, there is simply understanding and the opening towards serenity and happiness.

Make the distinction between philosophy of religion and theology.,
Prepare yourself personally for studying philosophy of religion.,
Familiarise yourself with the arguments for and against the existence of God.,
Explore the ontological argument more deeply.,
Consider the epistemic questions about faith.,
Consider the divine attributes.,
Think about the role of religious language.,
Think about the problem of evil.,
Engage in dialogue and write.",How to Explore the Philosophy of Religion," Philosophy of religion attempts to investigate the philosophical underpinnings of religion and religious beliefs - about God, for instance. Theology combines some philosophical reflection on these topics with reflection on religious beliefs that take some of the answers for granted that philosophers of religion would want to question.;
, Unlike other branches of philosophy, philosophy of religion questions and seeks reasons for ideas around religion and faith. For many people, their religious faith (or lack of) is a very personal and subjective matter and discussing it frankly and openly in a classroom may be uncomfortable. Decide whether or not you truly want to take part in such discussions and be prepared to change your mind.


One way to dodge the problem of personal involvement is to mentally rethink the arguments without the term 'God'. The term 'God' brings with it a whole set of beliefs and assumptions. When presented with an argument, mentally substitute 'God' for 'X'. Then you can work through the logic of the argument without bringing your personal beliefs about God into the question of whether or not the argument works on a logical level.

, The three main types of arguments are the cosmological or first cause argument, the ontological argument, and the teleological or design argument.


Start with an introductory text: ""The Philosophy of Religion: A Critical Introduction"" by Brian and Beverly Clack is often recommended to undergraduates.
One good way of doing this is to read a book by a theist and by an atheist. For the theistic side, ""The Existence of God"" and ""Is there a God?"" - both by Richard Swinburne - are recommended, and on the atheist side, try either Robin Le Poedevin's ""Arguing for Atheism: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion"" or Michael Martin's ""Atheism: A Philosophical Justification"".

, Many philosophers of religion, both theist and atheist, will agree that the ontological argument is perhaps the most interesting of the philosophical arguments for the existence of God.


It was originally proposed by St. Anselm. You can read his presentation of it in the Proslogion.
Another form of the argument is presented in part V of Descartes' Meditations. This was criticised by Kant in The Critique of Pure Reason.
More recently, contemporary philosophers of religion have revived the argument in a more technical manner. The two philosophers to read on this are Norman Malcolm and Alvin Plantinga.

, Learn about the idea of fidelism, and read up on Pascal's wager. Attempt to answer the question: is it rational to believe in God? Do believers in God have evidence for their beliefs? If they don't have evidence, can it still be rational to believe in God? Is a religious or spiritual experience evidence?

, Many of the sort of questions one may ask in Sunday school are actual problems that philosophers of religion attempt to resolve: questions like ""can God create a rock so big he couldn't lift it?"" (or Homer Simpson's variation on the theme: ""could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot he couldn't eat it?"") are questioning the compatibility of the ""omnimax"" conception of God (omnipotence, omnipresence, omniscience, omnibenevolence - God being all-powerful, everywhere, all-knowing and all-loving), specifically whether God's Omnimax properties ever conflict with one another or with the laws of logic or of nature.


Some good introductions to these questions are Gerard J. Hughes' book ""The Nature of God"", Anthony Kenny's book ""The God of the Philosophers"", T.V. Morris' ""The Concept of God"" and Richard Swinburne's ""The Coherence of Theism"".

, Some philosophers in the logical positivist movement considered religious language to be cognitively meaningless and to lack reference (A. J. Ayer and Rudolf Carnap hold this kind of position). Some other philosophers try to interpret religious language in a naturalistic, reductionist manner, reducing claims about God to being claims about ethics (see R. B. Braithwaite and Kant). Some mystics and religious thinkers deem it impossible to describe God because of his infiniteness, and so prefer to talk about what God is not - this is described as the via negativa. In recent times, many philosophers of religion have interpreted religious language through the lens of Wittgenstein's latter theories.


To learn more about this, look at Dan R. Stiver's book ""The Philosophy of Religious Language: Sign, Symbol and Story""

, How can we say that we live in a universe created and ruled by an omnibenevolent and all-powerful God when he allows so much pain and suffering to occur? This question has been a primary line of argument from atheists and agnostics, and one that religious philosophers find the most difficult to answer. A number of theodicies have been presented that attempt to respond to these criticisms. The main theodicies to consider are the free will argument (including Plantinga's formulation of it) and the soul-making theodicy (as presented by John Hick).

, It is no good just reading the literature: philosophy is not a spectator sport. Attempt to develop the arguments yourself, think them through, write down your thoughts, and discuss them with others. It can be difficult finding people who have also studied the philosophical literature in depth: this may mean finding people on the Internet, attending seminars, conferences and lectures at universities or becoming a student.


One good way to keep up with the literature is to subscribe to a philosophy of religion blog. A number of good blogs exist: Prosblogion and Common Sense Atheism are two that are worth reading. The former is intended more for professional academics in philosophy of religion, while the latter is suited for a wider audience.

Firstly gain a foundation to explore this topic by considering what philosophy & wisdom is for.,
Find and evaluate any existing philosophies you like, as well as those that you don't.,
Consider how we as individuals can compromise the benefit of wisdom when learning or discussing it.,
Evaluate further limitations.,
Consider how wisdom can be appropriately collected and used for our benefit.",How to Explore and Overcome the Limitations of Philosophy," This may sound trivially obvious in itself, but its one of those curious questions that can be very reflective and enlightening yet is seldom ever asked. Generally, when the question is not asked, the mind does not operate on a level where philosophy has a meaning or value. When it takes you some time to find an answer, wisdom is more likely to have greater benefit than those who can make an instant answer as the mind is considering more deeply and thoroughly.


It's a lot like general or second hand knowledge versus experienced knowledge. We may all know basics facts we have learned in school, or information we have picked up from the Internet, TV or from other people, but until we have actually experienced it directly, it does not have the same impact to us. For example, we may learn about the events in another country from the TV or the paper, but when we are there seeing it, it's a very different experience. The knowledge that is directly gained through experiment and direct observation is far more penetrating.;
, Ask yourself how did you gather them and why you hold onto them. Generally, people hold onto philosophies and ideas that are important, either practically or emotionally to us. Likewise the philosophies we don't like are those that contradict existing ideals, or are associated with other things we don't like.


It can take much time to accrue them, but when we experience events and as we develop as people, our philosophies change as we do. We may look at things in one way when we are young, but when older have different priorities. When we are intellectually young or inexperienced, compared to when life has sent many experiences and challenges our way, our choice of philosophy and values change.
The importance of this is that what we may see as wisdom at one stage may seem shallow or not wisdom at all at a later stage in life. A person who lives on flat ground at sea level all their life will logically think a small hill is a great height, yet a person who has seen mountains knows that the hill isn't that big at all. Relativity is a major obstacle to absorbing wisdom.

, Often you see people debating, sending rebuttals each time something was said, but they are treating the conversation like a game of tennis, batting the ball back and forth. In this case, when a person is simply debating and arguing a point from any fixed position, there is no genuine communication or understanding going on. When a person reads words on a page or hears a lecture, it doesn't sink in when the person wasn't sincerely wishing to observe and explore the subject in the first place as their insecurities are preventing them from opening up their mind to deeper insights.


As individuals, we often put up walls in the mind when we are abstracting or measuring against another subject, or protecting personal philosophy and values. When we do that, we have actually stopped listening as we are now engaged with a different mental activity and agenda. This is another major obstacle to philosophy having any positive benefits.

, Wisdom, as such, does not make us invulnerable to change and the challenges of life, yet often people search and study many different philosophies and religions, either looking for assurance or some preventative bullet-proofing of this life or the afterlife in whatever form it is imagined. But what the wisdom on the pages or the message the instructor is giving goes unnoticed when it doesn't give what the person was really looking for.


It's much like a treatment to an illness or injury. Medical professionals may come up with new medicines and surgical techniques but when the patient never uses them, they do nothing on their own. But more crucially, Doctors cannot cure or prevent our ability to become ill, old or injured, they can simply treat the condition that arises, and recommend a healthy lifestyle to make it be as good as conditions allow. Likewise wisdom cannot cure or prevent files problems, but wisdom can provide us with a treatment for our pains, sorrows and frustrations and can likewise recommend a healthy lifestyle as good as the conditions will allow for our well-being. This ultimately is the greatest limitation as wisdom, as they are tools to be used wisely, they are a means to an end, but not the end itself.

, The solution, as often is the case, lies within the problem that philosophy was never going to fix the problem when a person was looking to cure the incurable. Wisdom only takes us so far, then we must continue our lives and apply what we have learned in order to make it as skillful and beneficial as possible. When the philosophy is not wisely handled or gathered in the first place, the best outcome one can hope for is that the penny may drop later in life. Wisdom ultimately has the best effect when the person is perceptive, but also has gained enough insight and experiences of day to day life to understand that wisdom is a wonderful thing when used wisely. Then a person can be willing to investigate not only more seriously, but become more wise, sincere and compassionate.

Start by reflecting on what an abstraction is.,
Consider the relationship we have with our abstractions and ideas.,
Expand this field to take in mental measurement.,
Consider where these skills can create unhappiness.,
Evaluate different aspects of measurement in relationship to memory.,
Consider why we place such great importance on our abstractions.,
Consider how you can act to resolve a problem.",How to Explore Mental Abstractions," Abstracting is the art of being able to shape a thought in our minds and, despite the mental dialogue and mental chatter, to be able to describe, recognise, categorize, perceive and explore it. In any experience, we may perceive a multitude of facets as well as factors such as our internal emotions and ideas, our intentions, our biases and desires as well as our memories.
Externally we are influenced by a wide range of different factors, by our environment, by friends and family, and by enemies and threats. 
Consider a basic scenario that applies to you in your day-to-day life. A very simple example is when we are driving. We have a destination and a purpose for going there; to be able to describe both the journey as well as the purpose, we must abstract it to be able to describe it effectively.
In the same way, abstracting is an important mental tool. We use it to analyse and process experiences and data to be able to act or react as the case may be. When we remember knowledge such as how to drive, how to cook, how to survive in basic terms are all abstractions of knowledge when they remain in our mind as active memory. This covers all functional daily habits and routines as well as skills that we rely on for a living.;
, Without memory and knowledge, including muscle memory, we would essentially be little more than old infants. Apart from basic biological needs, an infant has not yet collected enough information to be able to create an identity, even though the difference between them and their surroundings is an awareness that develops quickly.


Relationships are essentially dependent on our abstraction and memory retentive nature of the mind and body. Without it we would have ability to recognise and measure appropriately, for these skills require that experience.

, Measurement in essence, is largely about distinction and relevance. A basic early distinction is the ""me and you"" separation. Measurement is a critical skill in action, reaction and relationship to something or someone. We may in a mundane example, measure tastes, touch, sounds, ideas and all the sensory data we depend on. It becomes more subtle when we start to rely on this mind process. In a more refined sense, it is a quantitative process - how much should we do, should we do nothing etc. All questions are in effect related to measurement because a person is at point A and intends to get to point B, be it that point A is we are hungry so point B is the resolution of hunger, which means eating. Point A may be the desire to purchase a new thing and point B as the resolution is obtaining it, by earning and saving the funds to achieve that goal.


Remember that these skills exist for a reason, our survival as individual and social human beings depends on being able to interact with everything in life.

, Both processes can directly make us unhappy. When a person treats the abstraction and measurement as if it is the thing itself, then it resolution process is compromised. So when we imagine something, be it a dream or a nightmare and believe it is real, we become dominated by it as if the monsters are real. The dream is the experience and that process is real, but its content is simply an abstraction.


The important aspect where this applies, is when we believe something, then we are in trouble when we treat the concept as the thing itself. In practice, if we believe it may rain today, but it does not, either we will shrug it off, or we feel unhappy because we became expectant or dependent on the idea of rain coming. The amount of emotion we feel is directly proportionate to its relevance to us.

, Memory is an abstraction itself, but it too plays a very important role. A basic example to consider in day to day life, is driving. When a person drives to a destination, all along the way a person is measuring. Measuring the speed, distance between the car in front and behind, measuring time but above all, measuring our own abstractions. When we are stuck behind a slow driver, we become frustrated because we are measuring not only against our arrival time, but also against the times the experience of driving this same stretch of road did not have delays. This is abstraction in process - the recognition of a problem is a mental abstraction, but so to is the comparison of other times driving but also whether we will be late and other problems later on. This creates new feelings - such as unhappy at being frustrated, concern at being late, fear of being told off for being late and so on. When we are aware of these feelings, we start to abstract and measure these too.


The relevance of this is all down to the point that this measuring occurs all the time and it is when we measure in this way and start abstracting, we become frustrated, annoyed, unhappy and all the other undesirable feelings.

, Our abstractions cover our day to day life, but is also central in business, family, spiritual and all other aspects of life. In consequence, they form, supplement and reinforce all our ideas and abilities to act in life. The catch however is that when we take them too seriously and place too much relevance on them, then they fall into the same pattern as before that the more important they are to us, the more protective and insecure we become and more afraid and hurt when something undesirable happens.


The dynamic nature of abstraction and measurement creates a separating effect. When we distinguish ourselves from the experience, we are no longer in the experience itself, as we have these measurements and experiences in between us and the experience. Eventually, we build a wall of ideas and beliefs which can give us a sense of security, but at the same time limit our capacity to act creatively and directly, but when we not only value our ideas but that sense of security it's a double hit as we become more protective of them.

, As these mental processes exist for good reason, the complication arises when we use the tools the wrong way. Just like when using a rolling pin to mow the grass is the wrong tool for the job, measurement and abstractions being our identity, our memories, points of view and values can get in the way of experiencing life fully. 
In essence, a person can only rise above day to day problems when the relevance is no longer there. Generally speaking, people let go of thoughts and feelings all the time. They have an idea to go shopping, to clean the windows, to mow the lawn etc, but when life gets in the way we don't experience any unhappiness when the original plan was not critical to us. The skill lies in being aware not only when you are separating yourself from the experience, but also become aware that its more practical to use the knowledge as knowledge and not knowledge as an abstraction.

Make your point of reference.,
Learn to recognise that particular frame of mind.,
Ask yourself or check often to see if you are currently in that frame of mind.,
Use your point of reference as a foundation, ""safe-house"" or an anchor that you can return to.

,
Learn the other feelings and frames of mind by comparing them to your point of reference.,
Practice returning to your frame of mind as often as possible.,
Explore a chain of events or a different feeling from your point of reference.,
Take it a step at a time.,
When you feel confident in doing this expand it to observe everything from your ""safe-house"".,
After you feel an ability to recognise each different frame of mind you might experience (such as anger, jealousy, generosity, virtue etc) you can select the ones you want to associate with and which ones you don't.,
Use the point of reference with the aim to be able to see everything from a subtle distance.,
Try and use it to improve mental health at the same time.,
After that, try and see what made that frame of mind happen.",How to Explore the Mind Using a Point of Reference," Select a mind frame that feels particularly reliable and bright to the mind. It might be awareness of something, feelings of happiness, equanimity, peaceful silence or a kind and gentle frame of mind such as compassion, kindness, or an appreciative happiness. It is different for each person which particular frame of mind they wish to use.


In practice, it should be one that you don't feel the need to compare to similar feelings, or be attached too. It should be one where you feel safe, restful and/or makes the mind is more cheerful and bright. Try for ones you are familiar with and/or can go to quite quickly.;
, Most important is to learn how this frame of mind occurs and how it goes away. Similarly how to return to it as how it is lost.

, If you are, then that's fine, if you aren't try and find out exactly what made the mind change. Try and check every few minutes if you can.

,, Ask yourself is the different frame of mind restful or stressful?

, By knowing when you are stressed, afraid, angry, depressed or otherwise anxious you can go back to it.


Some methods are a self reminder, a mantra, image or mnemonic that prompts the mind to return to it or whatever works for you. Just practice returning until you feel confident in your ability to do it. Its a skill, but a very useful one to build.

, Try and explore the events forwards and backwards to see a common thread or event that made you leave the point of reference.

, Once you are familiar with both your point of reference, recognising when you have left it, returning to it and recognising a common thread, only then should you try and find out how that common thread or event happens. Not everyone can do it at once.

, Should anything in life be a shock or distressing, you can quickly return to your point of reference and then come to terms with things in your own time.

,


Its actually a lot like being able to deal yourself a winning hand in a card game. You can choose the feelings you want to have anything to do with and dump the ones you don't like last weeks garbage.

, So if its something happens that could cause problems like losing your discretion, or something you could regret like shouting at someone you care about, you can distance yourself from it and say ""no"" and then deal with the problem from a calmer frame of mind. If it was something good that brightens the mind, you can embrace it without being unsure.

, If you normally, or have ever had to experience an unpleasant thought chain again and again, you can return to your frame of reference and put away that thought or feeling and try to build knowledge from your foundation.

, There is a common theme that distorts the mind, you just have to find your particular one, how it happened and how you can return to your ""safe-house"". Give it a try and find out how your mind works and how you can avoid, work with and resolve problems.

"
First, find a place in which you can observe and explore your desires.,
You may practice mindfulness or meditation, or simply put your feet up and relax while watching the mind like an explorer.,
Explore the extent of the desire.,
Explore some of the biological impacts of desire.,
Explore the motivation of each desire.,
Consider the practical reasons for desires.,
Consider how desires can be used for benefit.",How to Explore and Understand Desire," This is important as merely reading about the subject doesn't have as beneficial an effect as watching them as they unfold, and analyzing their effects.;
,


Set yourself clear guidelines for what you will be doing. It's important not to get to involved with the desire or dream. Just watch them remotely, like you would observe a painting in an art gallery. You can admire them and encounter many different things, but you know you are still in the gallery and not within the painting itself.


, Generally, it’s best to explore it in the moment, but also in relation to time. This exploration is a fascinating life-long journey as it will continue to reveal new facets and variations as you go.


The purpose of exploring it is to ultimately gain an understanding of it. Remember that you can let go of the desire- don't let it control you. Desires can be so strong that they can become self-destructive as well as detrimental to others around you. They not only lead, but drive every facet of our life.
The relationship to time is also important as ultimately the desires that control us the most are born of past experiences. If you have a history of stressful experiences, you may want to control your present situation to create a positive outcome or prevent a certain negative outcome.
We often reach out to third parties in order to help us do this, much of our mental wishes to power symbols and third parties exist not out of piety, but out of desire to create change, or prevent loss.

, Generally, desire creates a tension in the brain and the body, which can be mild or intense, in relation to our interaction with the desire. This in a nutshell reflects tension and stress headaches, as well as nausea and the other symptoms we typically experience when we feel stressed, including unhappiness and that common feeling described as ""blocked,"" where it is difficult to focus on other things. Excessive desires overwork the brain(as it keeps on thinking and craving) which leads to mental fatigue


This can cause unhappiness as we have less energy and more stress-related illnesses. Many desires are very subtle and often influenced by feelings of dissatisfaction and insecurity. For example, you might dream of winning the lottery.
In other cases we may desire to control others or situations as a way to prevent personal frustration re-occurring.
Ultimately all our thoughts, fantasies, and mental chatter are generated by our desires. Our emotions are likewise tied to desire; we get angry and frustrated and despair because our desires weren't realized.

, Generally desires arise from positive emotions such as generosity, kindness, intelligence, compassion and so on, or negative emotions such as insecurity or neediness, fear, anger & frustration, envy, ill will, greed, ignorance, etc..


The mind produces desires like the liver produces bile. It is an exercise in futility trying to stop them, simply because that is itself a desire. Often we become afraid of desires, or try to control their expression which only causes more stress to the mind and body. It’s easy to fall into a groove in how we interact with our desires, but this can lead to depression and other problems.

, Without desire, would we see the need to eat, sleep, exercise, be good people, work to pay for our meals, home, and hobbies, or even, on a very subtle level, breathe? Even your ability to watch TV, relax, read, listen to music, sing, etc. is a fruit of desire. Our entire life is basically the expression and reflection of our desires.


Desires can ultimately be divided into long term and short term, so a spur of the moment desire to go buy something while shopping, as well as reactionary desires, are primarily short term, but may also be connected to long term desires. Long term desires are more lifestyle orientated, such as getting a university education.
They can also be categorized into functional or intellectual and beneficial or harmful. Since the mind and body would greatly prefer to relax and do nothing, our biological survival depends on actions. Many of our emotions exist for survival, such as fear existing to make us aware of precipices, wild animals, poisonous things and other dangers. Greed for possessions such as extra clothing and shelter from cold weather or extreme heat are inherently connected to our survival.
This body, in essence, is an investment of much energy and resources, the most efficient piece of software in the hardware of the body, is the concept of I. If we had no concept of self-importance, then we would not be inclined to protect and feed the body that we depend on. Likewise in a society where the idea of ego is muted (this applies both to primitive tribal communities as well as more modern societies), relationships between other people are more important because our survival and well-being is linked to cooperation.
Whenever confronted by a choice, it is desire that resolves it, using knowledge (be it accurate or inaccurate) as a guide. Without a desire to make the choice and deal with it's consequences, it would remain an unresolved conflict. On the other hand, we often try to avoid making a choice as the outcome would conflict with our existing choices and desires.
The body can and often does overrule our mental desires. For example, if we want to party all night, we will feel very tired, and if we don't stop to eat, we will feel increasingly hungry and uncomfortable.
This poses a classic paradox to philosophy and ideologies, as in some cases the individual is praised and philosophies aim on developing the individual to realise their inner goodness and virtue. The alternative view is that the individual is selfish and it is through an enlightened society, or, all beings being equally dependent on each other as a means to change the individual to be a more noble being. Both, in essence are correct and incorrect at the same time, because human beings have both greed and generosity, love and hate, so all humans have both noble and corrupt virtues.

, Ultimately the lesson is always to be smart about your desires. We can desire to be good people and do grand things, but without skills in dealing with our desires we might not attain our goals. The key to building personal happiness is learning to recognize when your desires have gone too far as well as knowing how to let go of them.


Sometimes the old metaphors are the best ones. Ancient philosophy tells us to rise above our troubles like the lotus rises above the mud that it grows in.
To do this a person has to desire to act for their own mental wellbeing, but it can be difficult to prioritize this over other competing desires. It's largely a question of balance. One desire is stronger than the other so our will power is not 100%. Through repeated observation and analysis of our desires and addictions(an extreme effect of desire), we can attain a healthier, more balanced frame of mind.

Consider how you intend to start observing.,
Be sure what you intend to observe.,
Observe the mind carefully.,
Ensure you are sincere.,
Explore the subject, without using any analysis or thought.,
Write down what you observe.,
Continue to explore the intention.,
Apply what you learn in order to let go.",How to Explore and Observe the Mind," There is a wide range of different ways, such as in a standard meditation format, in inquiry or in response to a problem. Nearly all times that success has been made have had several factors in common - it requires space and some time to be able to explore the object, sincerity or integrity and simple intention to stay on the ball.;
, Realistically, the mind is rich in a variety of different aspects. Emotions, thoughts both past, present and future, ideas about projects, memories, prejudice and biases, happiness and sorrow and so on. The complication begins early.
If you approach the mind simply without focus, it would be like looking at a great panorama of hills, trees etc. In one glance you may see a lot, but the actual effect is that you see absolutely none of the finer details, or things in particular such as the bees on the flowers, the grass in the wind and so on. The method must use intention to focus on a particular field of study, like a person has when working on a crossword puzzle or jigsaw. A mere glance will tell us what this is, but it needs a careful and intentional focus to see all the little details. In life, we miss a great deal of what happens simply because we never look closely enough

, The mind is very quick to use thought to analyse, but this is the where the problem arises. Immediately there is a division; there is the subject, there is the thought and then the thinker. Then, to compound the problem, the mind takes up analyzing the thought. The whole goal is to avoid this division simply by knowing when it happens, but also why. It happens because there is not enough intention to stay on topic or in focus, but also because the mind is simply more interested in wandering off or just is not really sincere.
Observation can be boring, challenging and hard work but also often shows us what we don't want. For example, a person may wish to believe there is a monster in the cupboard, but when they open the cupboard to find no monster at all, it upsets the fantasy. Very often the fantasy is both more important to people, while also the original cause of the problem that caused the stress.

, Very often, people observe and explore the mind because they are told it is the way to resolve their problems. They may for example be struggling with anger, depression, sorrow or anxiety. A person may alternatively be following a tradition or culture that requires introspection and so does it out of devotion. Problems arise very early on here as there is no clear reason a person has to look for themselves.
It is similar also in discussions about a subject. If a person listens to the advice, either to be polite, or to be seen to be discussing serious subjects, then they are lacking the sincerity for any change to occur. Likewise a person may have prejudice and use that prejudice to block any advice. Finally, a person may simply have no intention anyway to actually resolve the problem, but simply observe the mind as they had been instructed to do so, or thought it is a good idea to try.
Therefore you must check within yourself if such boundaries, criteria or “firewalls” exist within you to prevent you from getting a resolution, even if you yourself are intent on the subject. Very often, the person may be hearing closely, but hearing and listening are very different things. At the end of a discussion its all down to being sincere and rational about what was discussed. If you simply let the memory or importance of the conversation fade away, then it simply was never important enough. When a person is sincerely asking for advice as opposed to empty, generic or rhetorical questions, there lies a big difference which explains why we may discuss a problem often, but still never get a resolution.

, Every human being uses thought, every human being also has emotions and problems that come from being human. The problem arises when there is something that occurs that you do not like, or do not want. People see fear, sorrow or depression and then wish these emotions did not exist, or they may see greed, hatred or bias and think or feel that these things are bad or that these harmful aspects should not exist. Immediately the problem is reinforced by identifying or analysing it as a problem.
This process has divided the mind in a non-productive way and caused more distress and complications. Analysis, in practice, is an invasive or destructive process. For example if you wish to analyse a flower or an animal in detail, very often the result is you end up killing it, dissecting it and pulling it to pieces to analyse it. However, if you observe it as it is, much can be learnt without needing to pull things to shreds within the mind.

, We may observe a feeling, such as anger, but when we observe it without leaping into analysis we can clearly discern a cause or focus of that anger. The anger is dependent entirely on the object and a desire to do something about it. If we are angry, we direct our anger towards the subject often in order to maintain our anger. All anger therefore has intention involved to occur as well as to stay. This is where the challenge lies. If the person is not careful, they will begin to think about this as well and so will have hit another wall here. But if you didn't judge the anger, you alternatively can lose track by starting judging the intention or the trivia around the emotion.
Intention and anger are simply processes in the mind acting on an impulse object, such as a memory or experience, or an image or symbol. By writing down what you have observed you can move from one step to another until you don't need to write anything down at all.

, Because intention is the key ingredient, when you let go of the intention, the problem resolves itself and the conflict falls apart. When a person has noted that these are all separate but joined processes to make the emotion, then you can then act on them.
Sincerity again is important. Just like when you listen to a person speaking, people very often want to classify a person when it is a subject that they don't really want to act on, or contains a point they do not wish to hear.
For example, when a person discusses a negative aspect of the mind some listeners may conclude that the lecturer is pessimistic, or alternatively optimistic when they discuss only good aspects. When a person is balanced people will find another thing to criticize such as age, qualification or position and titles; or nationality, appearance - such as how they dress and so on.
All these are ways the mind uses to be able to continue as they are and so feel justified or safe to ignore what is being said and so even if a person intends to resolve a problem, their mind is working against them in achieving that goal. They may listen to all of the lesson, but consequently take away none of its content to apply.

, The moment you recognise that the mind is not only a collection of processes, thoughts, feelings, memories and prejudices as well as intentions and perceptions then you can more safely pull apart the puzzle, like a person can untangle a ball of wool.
Without using thought or judgments, you can stay clear of getting involved to your own detriment. This means you can ultimately understand not only how the mind acts and reacts, but what and how you can do something about it to improve your health and well-being.Rising above our problems, like a lotus rises above the water, is the lesson. It is important to be able to let go so you do not drown in our feelings and thoughts and so can stand free, which gives us happiness and well-being.

Legal, such as our relationships with local government and community as well as state, national and international laws and;
Personal & spiritual cohesion. This covers all individual aspects such as our relationship with our physical health and well-being as well as mental or spiritual health.

Legal may include not exceeding the safety speed limit while driving or vandalism up to criminal activity and higher international laws; and personal includes eating healthily and maintaining a healthy home, as well as practicing acts that may be seen as mental or spiritual, such as forgiveness, generosity and practicing things such as meditation, vegetarianism (etc). In essence, virtue in a cultural sense is about social interaction and the harmony of society. Transcendent virtue on the other hand is a more subtle variation which requires a depth of insight to be able to discern between ordinary and true virtue that leads towards personal harmony.;
, In times of war, it is seen as virtuous to defend ones country and fight ones enemies, yet this will in some contexts contradict legal but consistently contradict moral virtue. Meanwhile, to be pacifist in war supports moral or spiritual virtue, yet may contradict legal and will often be portrayed as cowardice or treachery in social virtue. Teetotalism (the abstaining from alcohol) can be socially contradictory and isolating while is neutral or positive in legal contexts and is positive in spiritual and health virtue.


Mundane virtue therefore is not clean cut and what may be virtuous to one may be non-virtuous to another, especially acts of schadenfreude. Some virtues also change in context so there is never a clean cut way to be perfectly virtuous. It is very important to reflect that true virtue is always within the moment and that there is no genuine set standard of degree of virtue except when a person retrospects or abstracts a cultural system. Protecting the environment on one hand is virtuous but when it affects people livelihoods it is socially inappropriate as well as virtuous at the same time.
Psychologically, transcendent virtue is also complex. All humans beings have the ability to love and hate, to be generous and selfish and to to be wise or ignorant. In this itself lies a complex paradox when we are deemed to be naturally good or inherently corrupt. When we assume our inner nature is divine or perfect it can on one hand lead us to aspire to live up to this ideal (which is a good thing), but will also be a consistent problem psychologically whenever our dark side shows itself, which leads to fear, paranoia, depression and other complexities.
For transcendent virtue to be natural, it is to be aware that we have the proportionate capacity for both good and bad outcomes, so while we have the capacity to love all beings infinitely, it exists because infinite hate also exists. It is all down to personal choice and awareness of that choice as well as the event itself. Mundane virtue focuses on personal conditioning, which is the training we have had from our parents, friends and teachers about how to behave.

, This is a vast area of study, but can give very interesting insights. For example some cultures forbid the consumption of pork, yet others do not. It is useful to understand the foundation or cause of the law as that way you can understand that all virtue is built on reason and cause and effect dynamics.


The usefulness of this is that it becomes quite easy to discern between mundane and transcendent virtue. Mundane virtue tends to vary and is subject to social pressures and personal interpretation, where transcendent virtue tends to be universal.

, Some virtues have stayed steady for millenia, yet some are only relatively recent such as international trade laws as well as those dealing with technology. Virtue arguably reflects what is appropriate for the age. The complication with this is ancient laws and means of dealing with crimes - such as those only a few hundred years ago such deportation for those caught stealing food and more ancient ones authorising the use of torture to extract confessions. Some scholars have been known to imply a metaphorical context to ancient laws so that they are more socially acceptable in modern times.


The value of this helps a person to distinguish between mundane virtue - which only helps us so far to develop as human beings, as well as transcendent virtue which is timeless and natural.

, A central factor to the benefits of being virtuous is a degree of trust a person has with themselves, as well as others who are wise or intellectual will trust such a person. Virtue is often the foundation of society not just because of cohesion value, but because it gives a definite quality of life. Wisdom in essence is the product of virtue, as is developing mental health skills such as letting go, thinking creatively and being humane to oneself and others.


Virtue effectively brings a personal freedom that is unexpected from what sounds a very limiting lifestyle. Many communities and religions such as Buddhist monasteries tend to be happy places as there is an appropriate balance with virtue, wisdom, routine and order, as well as mental-health and physical health development (such as contributing and playing an active role) which bring happiness. Societies that tend to favour only certain aspects tend to live less fulfilled lives.

, This in itself it's a mind puzzle, because what is virtuous in one context is not necessarily virtuous in another, so its recommended to consider the implications of a mind that does not have the limitations of such an upbringing. Is there a sense of natural virtue, is the world complete anarchy, or does it no longer matter? Most people will settle on at least one of these outcomes, if not others, so its very useful to explore other possible outcomes.


This can include multiple variables. For a basic example, one may say it is virtuous to act first and apologise after if needed (which is stronger in social virtue than the other two), where another would say be humble and think first, act later (which is stronger in the legal virtue) Both can apply in personal virtue depending on the context. A person who lives in the moment however, arguably does not belong to either schools as wisdom guides their virtue.

, There are really more ways than can be listed where virtue can be put off course. Its generally all about priorities and priorities are always linked to our wants and needs, but virtue is more concerned ultimately with personal negligence. Suicide generally is seen as immoral, yet willingly dying to save another only varies by intention and motivation.
A key area to explore is that politically we are frequently manipulated through applying to one of our concepts of virtue to choose something we may not have chosen had we been more wise to what was going on. This is most frequent in advertising - such as being socially virtuous to buy certain products, or voting on political parties even when candidate or policy is not particularly wise, yet it is by the the use of manipulating virtue and that the voter themselves are perceptible that elections can be won or lost.


Likewise when individuals indulge in our own desires, fears and ignorance which can make us deeply unhappy and insecure with ourselves. We may also manipulate ourselves to believe that we were just, virtuous or right to act as we see fit, where many if not most wars and genocides have been stated by its propagators as virtuous and just actions

, In this context wisdom must reflect on the outcome of the action and the goal is to be wise, virtuous but not negligent. When people as individuals have the ability to move towards skillful or unskillful actions, it is we as individuals who ultimately choose to act, even when it does not seem that way. Was the action praised by the wise and innocent? Did it improve our well-being and mental health or did it lead us to remorse or other misfortunes?


Many philosophers and great thinkers have said that the greatest gift person could have is good, virtuous friends. Those who we can trust, we can share and learn with and to support each other in their life journey. It is always useful to explore virtue to understand how and why it exists, as well as how it can make the world a better place.

Start by examining what you feel is a quality experience in your own life.,
Further explore the varieties of this dissatisfaction.,
Consider times that you have found satisfaction in doing something by yourself.,
Consider the alternative cases where you are prepared to pay whatever the cost is.,
Think about this: Proportionate to the attachment or passion you have with anything is equal to the dangers most people are willing to go to, this is most self-evident in wars.,
Consider experiences you've had where simple or free things seemed to have the most value.,
Beware of the extremes in order to best make changes in your life to give the most benefit.,
Try to find ways to improve the quality of your life and make it fun, without their being a harm factor.",How to Explore & Understand Value or Quality in Life," This will require you to think primarily about times in your life when things seemed to have quality or value and then look rationally at the opposite times when they didn't. Select one of these to test, preferable one that had a lot of value to you, because these are easier to handle without creating unpleasant feelings.
Look carefully at the memory, firstly to see if it is still fresh and accurate and not too dulled over a long time.
Here it is best to compare the two - what underwrites the ones we feel are lacking or not quality moments were the ones where there was an aspect of dissatisfaction present in the moment, or afterwards on evaluation. It is important to explore this dissatisfaction because this is the central aspect of every time we feel unhappy.;
, Consider that there might be the case where the event seemed exciting at first, but over long term handling or experience it seems dull, like a ""commodity"".
For example, you might find at first going out for a meal to be exciting and fun, but if you have to buy your meal everyday, it soon seems ordinary and loses interest. Where a meal cooked by yourself or by someone you care for is a different experience.
Consider how much money was involved in the experience as this can affect the quality or value. There is a case where a person may hold the view have said that if you don't charge for services, no one will appreciate its value.
What really happens however is that the cost paid for it dulls the experience, because the money itself has to be earned so it has its own relative cost to us as individuals. It returns to being a commodity as you are paying for it, therefore you have an expectation of your money (or ultimately, your efforts) getting what they are worth, or a return of investment. Both parts actually make quite special things seem very ordinary and unimportant and the experience of quality and sense of value is lost.
It is important to consider however this exercise really is not about expecting people to do things for nothing, for the flipside is that when you value something, you are often more likely to bid higher for it to attain that goal.
Additionally, many needed services just won't exist without money to cover their costs, so the balance is between money making operations, or exploitative and the differences between them.
Part of the problem and indeed the solution is this same relative cost and return process. When we feel it wasn't worth the cost, or that we paid more than it was worth we are dissatisfied.

, A simple case is working in the home or garden. When you decorate your space yourself, it feels so much more genuine than if you paid someone to do it for you. This is because of your personal involvement and efforts to achieve a goal, goal setting and achievement being a big booster to our personal confidence, management skills and personal satisfaction.
Consider likewise if your selected experience you were unsatisfied with had a mental or emotional ""cost"".
It may have been you were manipulated, pressured, begged or flattered into doing something that if you had a choice you would say no to, or offered a product that while may have been good quality, seems overpriced. Many methods exist in coercing a person to do something they don't want. This has a terrible cost to both sides.
The alternative is when you do something for someone else, or vice versa (without any obligation or expectation, but just out of friendship, kindness or compassion), or share moments with people in a beneficial context it seems so much more precious and these are the memories that people cherish. This is because there is no physical or mental ""cost"" paid, or that the cost had a return of satisfaction.
This is well reflected in people who follow a virtue system, volunteer their time or live a little more frugally within their economic means. The sacrifice of personal time and efforts, or practicing self control against our easier desires gives in effect a return of the investment of effort.
These practitioners typically feel more satisfaction and more frequent satisfaction and so develop a sense of life-quality, but also appreciate things and people wisely and are consequently appreciated and valued by others. This gives satisfaction which increases the sense of value and quality.

, This will help you explore the limitations, or ways to more wisely practice activities that will increase value and not compromise it. When we are driven to extremes about what may seem virtuous or good actions will compromise and happiness. This is because we no longer have any control - our feelings effectively turned rogue and we lose that self direction.
There is a host of areas where this applies, it may be a social or community aspects, religious or spiritual, environmental, economical, identity, political and nationality issues you may be very passionate about. Its all about reflecting that while these may be good things within themselves, is it possible that a person may have such strong desires to get involved even if it goes too far and breaks the law.
There are cases more mundane such as you want to buy a particular type of car, so you over-extend your finances to be able to get it, even when you only use it for something a more economical car would be appropriate.
When it has reached the extremes, primarily self importance has over-ruled which drives people to do these actions, which can be reflected in how easy it is for a person to step back and let go. There are cases where a person just wants to be personally involved for it has become ""personal"", or through peer-pressure is encouraged into doing it.
This also has a terrible cost, because it develops into the feeling that nothing becomes important anymore (in order to achieve that goal). Cases also exist similar to addictions where because of the feeling of power we gain, these cases may constantly seek a way to be involved and express their feelings.
The return of investment can also be corrupted - A person may also go into the habit that they will only do something for someone else, but only if they get something in return. Quality is diminished very easily and its largely when it is tainted by greed or obligation, which reduces the true satisfaction that builds wisdom and happiness.

, Also equal is the amount of pain and despair you may feel if it doesn't go the way you want (such as if you lose what you had that ""investment"" in).

, It might be something like a picnic with family or friends, doing some basic housekeeping for someone you care about, growing a plant or cooking a meal from scratch, or tidying up any clutter you may have at home to give yourself some fresh space. Whatever occurs you from your experiences.
Now imagine that same event, but change it slightly, such as if you were obliged to do those things that you didn't want to, or that you were doing it to get something, or that you were possessed by the urge to ""buy it"" when you really didn't need it. What has changed? Did the feeling stay the same, or did it become slightly tainted and quality or value is lost? This merely is a practical reflection or test you can do to test the above sections for yourself.
The goal now is to learn when you are being manipulated or greedy and so be able make a stand to say ""thanks, but no thanks"".
This isn't easy, but you have to ask yourself if the small unpleasant feeling of saying no, is more or less than the price paid for saying yes.
This is hard because many cases exist where a person is manipulated by their close friends and family, but are afraid they will end up alone as they don't have anyone else. On one hand its certain that this is a low quality life, essentially being used as a doormat, on the other it is not unreasonable for the person to want to tolerate it for the sake of keeping the relationships. This simply is the cost that must be paid for the association as it is.

, As the mind is inclined to extreme sides dancing from one to the other, there is a lot of various ways this may manifest but some common options to consider are:
It is possible a person may suddenly feel horrified at all the misery, misfortunes, manipulation and exploitation in this life and want to get as far away as possible from it, whether they run away from people, or take their own life. As it is a central part of ordinary human interaction, it can't be avoided without becoming an recluse and that can make us cold and lonely when we shun others.
Diving in and sacrificing everything for others may make us vulnerable for the times when things don't go to plan. We can easily be hurt far more by being too generous.
Dedicating your life trying to change people. As it is an effective method (after all, only until a person realizes they are being exploited will they know), so any extreme response leads into horror or misery, so less quality of life - people are resistant to change from outside, few will understand and even those that do are unlikely to implement difficult change. The only way to handle it is make a choice to let go and do what you feel is right.
Taking one or several aspects too seriously or personally. This is what leads us to harm. Things that when wisely considered are rich in value become meaningless or even obstacles to achieve our desires.

, Once you feel comfortable in saying no or yes according to the event, see what you can do to make life more interesting and better quality. This might be to learn something new, change bad habits, do something for yourself or other people without obligation, while keeping a balance so you aren't becoming another doormat. Then you are a free agent, because you have the choice to be.
It is important to accept that life is not easy, nor that it owes us a living. We do not have complete will power to achieve everything, our willpower is naturally limited. By accepting our limitations and accepting that dis-satisfaction is therefore inevitable or unavoidable in life, we no longer will be that effected or hurt when it does happen.
This two way system on letting go of the dissatisfaction, as well as implementing ways to improve what we experience is dependent on understanding how the dis-satisfaction arises in the first place, once that ignorance has been penetrated then it no longer is a demon in the closest or monster under the bed, because it has been understood for what it is.

Gather your supplies.,
Fill the bottle with vinegar.,
Wrap the baking soda.,
Seal the tissue to the bottle cap.,
Close the bottle.,
Shake the bottle.,
Ignite the bottle.",How to Make a Vinegar Bomb1," For this bomb you’ll need vinegar, baking soda, toilet paper, duct tape and a bottle. The best type of bottle is a 50 cl plastic bottle because it won’t require you to use too much vinegar. You should also plan to supervise a young child if they are going to perform this experiment.


The best type of vinegar to use is white distilled vinegar. This is also one of the cheapest vinegars.;
, Open the bottle and make sure you keep the cap. Pour the vinegar into the bottle until you reach the halfway mark of the bottle. If you are using a plastic bottle that is larger than 50 cl, add about a cup of vinegar.


You can use a funnel to safely add vinegar to the bottle without wasting any.

, Take a square of toilet paper or a tissue and put a tablespoon of baking soda onto it. Fold or wrap the baking soda with the paper. You are wrapping the baking soda so that it doesn’t react to the vinegar immediately. The tissue paper acts as a timer for the bomb.

, Do not use too much toilet paper or it will not dissolve into the vinegar. Do not use too much baking soda, or it will not fit onto the cap and won't be able to close. You can either seal the paper with tape or glue depending on your preference. Mount the tissue paper onto the inside of the water bottle's cap.


Once you find a good fit for the tissue wrapped baking soda, glue it to inside of the cap.
Take care and try not to rip the paper and spill the baking soda.

, Carefully attach the cap to the water bottle. You’ll need to watch out for the grip of the cap and bottle. Try not to pierce the tissue paper and release the baking soda. If you are worried about this, you can alternatively tape the cap to the bottle.

, You need make the vinegar come into contact with the baking soda. Shake up the bottle for a few moments, or until you feel the bottle’s pressure increase. You could alternatively turn it upside down so the vinegar comes into contact with the baking soda.


Be close to the area you want to ignite your vinegar bomb. You shouldn’t do this step until you are ready for the bomb to explode., When you think the pressure is large enough, throw it at the ground. You could also set the bottle down and wait for the chemical reaction to blast the cap off the bottle. It might be more fun to throw the bottle against the ground. Take a couple steps back. You should be at least 3-4 feet away from the bomb.


Cement is a better surface than grass for an explosion.
Make sure the area where you throw the bottle is clear of people. You do not want to accidentally harm someone with this experiment.

Locate your target before you ready your grenade.,
Grab your grenade in your throwing hand.,
Pull the pin with your non-throwing hand.,
Throw with an overhand motion.,
Take cover!",How to Throw a Hand Grenade1," Unlike firearms, there's no way to ""point"" a grenade at your enemies so that is selectively deals to damage to them — grenades will indiscriminately hit anything, friend or foe, that's within their blast radius. For this reason, it's extra-important to know where your enemy is before you pull the pin. Don't even grab your grenade until you've identified an enemy position you intend to strike — you do not want to be caught with a live grenade and have nowhere to throw it.Note, however, that, in combat situations, you can expose yourself to enemy fire if you spend too much time peeking out of your cover and trying to locate your enemy. This requires you to delicately balance your need to locate your target with your need to protect yourself. Many sources recommend against spending more than just a second or two looking for your enemy.;
, When you've found a target and you're ready to throw, grab your grenade in the hand you usually use for throwing. Grip the grenade in the palm of your hand with the pull ring pointing up. Use your thumb to put steady pressure on the safety lever — the large, square, metal lever running from the top down the side of the grenade.


Don't let up your pressure on the lever until you're ready to throw. The lever holds a small but very important part of the grenade called the striker in place — if you relax your grip on the lever after you pull the pin (this is called ""milking"" the grenade), it's possible for the striker to rotate and strike the fuse while the grenade is still in your hand. Because this can easily be deadly, it's important to get in the habit of keeping steady pressure on the lever at all times before throwing.

, Grip the ring on the side of the lever mechanism by slipping a finger through it and remove it with a pulling, twisting motion. The safety clip holding the lever in place should fall off of the grenade. Note that, contrary to the portrayal of grenades in movies and on TV, their fuses aren't necessarily lit when you pull the pin. Rather, this happens when you release the lever and the striker is able to ignite the fuse, so keep pressure on the lever until you throw.

, Hand grenades can be thrown naturally — the same way you might throw a baseball.To throw, plant your feet about shoulder-width apart, put a slight bend in your knees, cock your arm back, and hurl the grenade over your head as you take a strong step forward. Your arm should pass next to your ear and you should twist slightly at the hips. Let the grenade roll out of your fingertips as it leaves your hand.


For the greatest distance and accuracy when throwing, follow through with your throwing motion. That is, after the grenade leaves your hand, let your arm continue its natural path downward and continue to twist slightly at the hips.

, Use the time available before the grenade explodes to protect yourself. Crouch, kneel, or lie prone behind any available cover to protect yourself from shrapnel. Keep in mind that in the types of situations in which you're likely to use a hand grenade, you'll probably want to be wary not just of the explosion of the grenade, but also of the possibility of enemy fire, so waste no time at all taking cover.


If no cover is available, flatten yourself against the ground and orient yourself toward the coming explosion. This minimizes your profile, presenting less of your body area to potentially deadly shrapnel.Once the grenade is in the air, it's (literally and figuratively) out of your hands. Without pressure from your hand to hold the safety lever in place, its spring will push it up and away from the grenade, allowing the striker to ignite the fuse. For many grenades, at this point, you'll have about four to five seconds before the grenade detonates. However, this can vary depending on the type of grenade you're using or, rarely, whether your fuse is defective.

Gather a batch of eggs.,
Puncture the egg.,
Drain the egg.,
Wash out the interior.,
Dry the egg shells.",How to Make an Egg Smoke Bomb1," It doesn't matter what type of egg you use. Don't feel inclined to buy expensive, organic eggs, but you could. Jumbo eggs cost a little more, but are easier to work with.


You can even save the egg's insides for cooking if you don't want to be wasteful.;
, Take a push pin or nail and poke it through the bottom of the egg.After creating the initial puncture, widen the hole. Softly scrape the edges of the gap until it's around the size of your thumb's fingernail.








, Hold the egg over the sink as the insides drain out. You can catch the egg white and yolk in a bowl if you don't want to waste any supplies. If the yolk is stuck at the opening, puncture the yolk with a pin or nail. Allow the yolk to completely drain out of the egg's shell.








, Turn on the faucet to a mild stream. If the water is too heavy, the shell might crack or become damaged. Gently wash the leftover insides out of the shell. You don't need to be too thorough, but a basic rinse will do.







, Place the egg shells back into the egg carton. Make sure the hole you created is facing down. This will allow most of the liquid to clear from the shell. By the time you're done preparing the powder, your shells should be ready to go.









It'll take around 15 to 20 minutes.
Place them in a sunny spot of the house for a quicker drying time.

Familiarize yourself with the equipment.,
Learn the language.,
Get the rules down.",How to Play Pool1," There are generally three things you'll be using: a cue stick, table, and pool balls. You can probably guess which is what.


Pick a cue stick appropriate for your size. Most are 58 inches (147 cm) in length, but shorter and longer ones are available. The tip is the most important part of a cue (it's on the narrow end you'll be hitting with). Tips vary from soft to hard, though inexperienced pool players are best served with a medium to medium-soft tip.
There are three standard sizes to a pool table: 7, 8, and 9 feet (2.7 m). The Billiard Congress of America defines a ""regulation"" pool table as any table that is twice as long as it is wide. For example, a 7-foot table is 7 feet (2.1 m) long and 3.5 feet (1.1 m) wide. If you are playing on a smaller table, you may want a shorter cue.
As for the pool balls, there are evens and odds, solids and stripes, and, most importantly, the 8 ball and the cue ball. The cue ball is solid white, a bit heavier, and should be the only ball directly hit during the game.;
, In order to play the game, you have to be able to understand the terminology and rules. Familiarizing yourself with the vocabulary of the game will make it easier and quicker to learn.


The ""break"" happens at the beginning of the game when a player breaks up the fifteen pool balls. It is the first shot. Some players break straight on while others break at an angle.
A scratch occurs when the cue ball jumps off the table or rolls into a pocket. Determine the scratch rules before you start any game.

It is common for the player who did not receive the scratch to be allowed to place the cue ball anywhere in the ""kitchen"" upon their subsequent turn. This is the area between the head rail and the head string; or, more simply put, the area between the edge and the second set of diamonds.



, For now, let's stick to standard 8-ball. Quite clearly, knowing the rules is the only way to win.


Use the triangle to ""rack up"" the 15 pool balls. Different people have different preferences for the set up, but make sure the 8-ball is in the middle.
A player breaks. If he or she makes a ball into a pocket, he or she claims that type (solid or stripes) for the duration of the game and shoots again. The other player receives the variation they did not claim.

If the player makes a ball of each variation, they may choose which one they prefer.


Both players sink all their pool balls into the pockets until just the 8 ball is left. The first player to sink the 8 ball is the winner.

If a player inadvertently sinks a ball of the other player's, it counts to the other player's benefit.
If a player inadvertently sinks the 8 ball before all their other balls are in, they lose.
If a player scratches on the 8 ball, they automatically lose as well.

Gather your materials.,
Cut the top off of an empty soda can.,
Break an egg into the can.,
Add milk and vinegar to the container.,
Make the container air tight and stash it somewhere warm.,
Remove the baggie/lid when you’re ready to use the bomb.",How to Make an Assortment of Stink Bombs1," You will need a container with a lid (or an empty soda can), one egg, one tablespoon of milk, one tablespoon of vinegar, a pair of scissors and a zip-lock baggie.You will only need the zip-lock baggie if you’re using a soda can, since that will act as the can’s airtight “lid.”;
, You need to use a container that you don’t plan to ever use again, so an empty soda can is a quick and easy choice. Carefully cut the top 2 inches of the can off with a sharp pair of scissors.


If you have some sort of plastic container with a tight-fitting lid (that you have no other use for), feel free to improvise and use that instead of a soda can.A glass jar (such as a mason jar) with a lid will also work well., You can crack the egg fully open and drop the contents inside, or you can make a crack in the egg and toss the whole thing in there, shell and all. It’s going to smell awful either way.


You can even drop the whole egg in there without cracking it, but the brewing time for the stink bomb might take a little longer.
Any kind of egg will do – white, brown, free range, etc. Whatever type that’s currently in your refrigerator will be perfect.

, Measure out 1 tablespoon of milk and 1 tablespoon of vinegar and put them both in the container with the egg. Any type of dairy milk will work, but make sure it’s dairy (for instance, almond milk will not work because it’s non-dairy). Use regular white vinegar.If you dropped the whole egg in there and didn’t crack it, you’ll need more vinegar. Pour in enough so that it covers the entire egg.

, If you’re using a soda can, put it in a zip-lock baggie and close it up tight. The baggie should be large enough so that the can fits easily inside and so that you can still set the can upright on a flat surface after you close the baggie. If you are using something else for your container, make sure you put the lid back on tightly.


Once you’ve closed the baggie up, put the can in a warm place where it won’t be disturbed.Let the stink brew up for about a week before using the bomb. The longer you wait, the more intense the stench will be.

, Don’t unleash the stench be removing the baggie (or lid) until you’ve decided where to put the bomb! This type of bomb works best if you hide it somewhere, such as in a sibling’s bedroom or under the kitchen table.


This bomb will have a terrible stench - a combination of rotten eggs and spoiled milk.
Be careful not to get any of the mixture on yourself – it smells awful!

Consider this; a good spiritual practitioner does not worry too much about the aesthetics of his/her house.,
First the Philosophy of Tao.,
Read the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi as these are the two works that make up Philosophical Taoism.,
Research the main concepts of Taoism that apply to both Tao Philosophy and Tao religion.,
When it comes to the religion of Tao you must learn the pantheon of deities that make up Taoism.,
Now once you've done all your research find a quiet spot away from distractions, get a dictionary, a thesaurus, a notepad and a pencil.",How to Describe Taoism," Floor boards, carpeting, marble bench tops, Smeg appliances??? Such things are irrelevant when it comes to ego loss and becoming one with the void. A garden however is something that even the most ascetic of students can not do without. For a pretty flower belongs to no one. It can neither be owned nor possessed yet a well thought out garden can help the mind to settle and focus on the almighty in a way that not even a Ferrari is capable of. #One cannot describe something one doesn't know or you only have vague knowledge about. Therefore begin by discovering more about Taoism, learn both forms of Taoism, the philosophy of Tao and the Religion of Tao. Start point: The Philosophy of Tao came first and is based on Lao-Tzu's teachings in the Tao Te Ching, next came the Religion of Tao which is based on the legend that Lao-Tzu visited a hermit and told him the world was going to end, those who followed Lao-TZu would go on to better lives.;
, Research the main tenets of Taoism, they are like the ten commandments, being a set of moral laws or maxims that say how a man should act. Starting point: The main tenets are do not murder, do not steal, do not lie, do not consume intoxicants or become involved in sexual misconduct. This requires a certain discipline. An example of such dedication is in how a good spiritual practitioner, if stabbed in the thorax, will calmly remove the knife, clean it, and then try to return it to its proper owner.

, Read a verse, write it down and then try to translate it into simpler language without destroying the original meaning. For example


Tao called Tao is not Tao: Tao means Way
Meaning:The true way is humble and subtle so few see it, those who boast they know the way do not know the way. The sage follows a path, he does not call it way, but it is.

, Understand that Taoist concepts are often paradoxes which are almost impossible to understand.


Tao or The way or path
WU-WEI or action without action
TE or Usually translated as integrity and the cultivating of the Tao
PU or the state of free from prejudice, susceptible to change like Tabula Rasa.

, You should also learn how these are worshipped and why. All the deities have different powers, worshipped in different ways.

, Meditate and while meditating think about what Taoism means or means to you, with intense meditation you'll spark of your brain. Write down what you think and you will have unlocked what Taoism, which is supposedly following the natural, means.

Gather the supplies.,
Wrap the baking soda.,
Fill the plastic bag.,
Shake and detonate the “bomb.” Go to the area you want to detonate the bomb.",How to Make a Vinegar Bomb2," For this “bomb,” you’ll need one cup of vinegar, tissue paper, a plastic bag, and one tablespoon of baking soda. The beauty of these experiments is the ease of access to the supplies. You might also want access to a clean sink and protective eyewear.


If you plan to do this project with a younger child, make sure that you supervise them through each portion of the process., Lay out a small strip of tissue paper, about two squares, on a flat surface. Measure out a tablespoon of baking soda and dump it onto the paper. You can then either fold up the tissue paper or roll it up. Do whichever technique you like best. Do not wrap the baking powder too tight, or else you may create a tear in the paper.


If you are rolling the tissue paper, make a simple fold on the tips to ensure baking soda doesn’t fall out.

, Hold the bag upright so it won’t tip over when you add the vinegar. Measure out one cup of vinegar and carefully add it into the bag. Add the tissue wrapped baking soda to the bag. Seal the bag once you add the tissue paper.


If you are supervising a smaller child, hold the bag while they pour.
You might notice the reaction start to take effect based on the bubbles that begin to form.

, The best place to activate the bomb is somewhere outside. You could also use your kitchen sink, but this could also cause a mess. Don’t shake the bag too much, but give it a few shakes (no longer than five seconds). Place the bomb in the spot you picked for it to explode. Take a couple of steps back.


If you feel the bag start to expand as you shake it, set it on the floor immediately! That bag is about to explode."

Face sideways toward your target.,
Drop your non-throwing leg and put your throwing leg behind you.,
Extend your non-throwing hand toward the target.,
Throw with an overhand motion and follow through.",How to Throw a Hand Grenade2," Often, in combat situations, you won't have the luxury of being able to throw grenades from the standing position. For instance, if you're pinned down behind cover by enemy fire, you won't want to expose your upper body by standing up to throw. Luckily, it's also possible to throw grenades from positions that minimize your exposure to the enemy.


To throw a grenade from a kneeling position, start by getting in the proper stance. Bend your knees to lower yourself near to the ground, then turn your body ninety degrees away from the direction you intend to throw so that your throwing shoulder is facing away from your target. It's hard to get the same sort of throwing power in the kneeling position that you'd get while standing, so turning to side is a smart choice because it allows you to throw across your body, maximizing your power.

, Bend your non-throwing leg and press it into the ground in front of you so that your knee is pointing toward your target. At the same time, stretch your throwing leg back behind you so that the side of your boot makes contact with the ground. Keep your throwing leg straight and locked for maximum stability.Keep in mind that the kneeling stance you use to throw grenades is not the same as the typical kneeling stance you may use in ordinary noncombat situations (like when you need to pick something up off the floor). This modified stance gives added stability and support while throwing that you can't get by simply lowering one knee to the floor directly beneath you and bending the other in front of you.

, Arm the grenade against your chest by pulling the pin and holding down the lever. As you cock your throwing arm back, stretch your other arm toward your target with your fingers extended and your thumb against the side of your hand. Keep your non-throwing arm at a slightly raised angle (about 45o). If you're positioning your arm correctly, you should look somewhat like you're flexing like a bodybuilder.


As mentioned above, the kneeling stance doesn't have as much throwing power as the standing stance. Extending your non-throwing arm in this way allows you to gain extra leverage in your follow-through, slightly increasing your throwing force.

, Launch the grenade over your head, bringing your arm past your ear and twisting at the hips as you throw. For added power, push off with your throwing leg, which should still be firmly planted against the ground behind you.


Don't forget to take cover! Get as low as possible behind the sturdiest cover available. As always, if no cover is available, press yourself prone against the ground and face the direction of the blast.

"
"
Lie on your back as you remove the pin.,
Cock your throwing leg back and ready the grenade to throw.,
Throw the grenade across your body with a rolling motion.,
Take cover.",How to Throw a Hand Grenade3," Of all the hand grenade throwing positions, the prone stance typically offers the least power, distance, and accuracy, so, when other throwing stances are possible, they're usually preferable. However, in situations where you're pinned behind very low cover, you may not want to risk exposing yourself to enemy fire by taking the time to rise to a kneeling position when you throw. In these cases, throwing from prone may be the only way to strike the enemy without putting yourself in mortal danger.


To begin, lie on your back behind your cover. You should be lying parallel to the action with your throwing arm positioned away from your target. This allows you easily grip and arm the grenade against your chest and also gives you the best possible view of the conditions around you so that you can react as necessary.

, Bend your throwing leg at a 90o angle, keeping it in contact with your other knee. Brace the side of your boot against the ground. As in the kneeling stance, this will give you added stability and power while throwing.


Simultaneously, arm the grenade by pulling the pin and depressing the lever. Cock your throwing arm next to your ear and get ready to throw.

, To throw the grenade, push off with your throwing foot and roll yourself toward your target as you launch the grenade across your body. Follow through with this motion. If needed, you can even roll all the way over. Keep your head and body low as you throw, however — the primary advantage of the prone stance is that it minimizes your exposure to enemy fire, so stay low to maintain this advantage.


If you can, you may also want to use your non-throwing hand to grab any object in front of you for extra leverage.

, Since you're already lying in the prone position, you won't need to ""get low"" after you release the grenade. You should, however, make sure that you're behind any available cover. As mentioned above, if there's no cover available, you'll want to orient yourself in the direction of the blast to minimize the profile area that you expose to shrapnel.


It bears mentioning that, even with proper form, you'll have a very difficult time getting the same sort of throwing distance from the prone position as you might from the kneeling and (especially) the standing position. Because the grenade is likely to be closer to you when it explodes, it's even more important to protect yourself after throwing.

"
"
Pick the correct grenade for your job.,
Know the lethal range of your grenade.,
Take extreme care when “cooking off” your grenade.,
Avoid throwing grenades up stairs or hills.,
Know the effectiveness of your cover.",How to Throw a Hand Grenade4," Hand grenades come in a huge variety of forms. Some are made for inflicting casualties on the enemy, others for merely stunning or subduing them non-lethally, and still others for inflicting damage on non-human targets. It's extremely important to be aware of the type of grenade you're throwing (and how it's used) before you throw it — if you use the wrong grenade, the results can be disastrous. Below are a few of the most common grenade types:Fragmentation grenades: Produces many small pieces of shrapnel upon detonation. Usually considered lethal to non-armored targets at close ranges with rapidly decreasing effectiveness at longer ranges. Shrapnel can penetrate soft barriers like wood, plaster, and tin, but not usually cinder blocks, sandbags, and armor.
Concussion grenades: Creates an explosion with extreme concussive force. This concussive effect is amplified in enclosed environments, making it useful in urban areas and bunkers, fortified enclosures, and so on. Can also be used for improvised demolition.
Incendiary grenades: Produces extremely high-temperature flames. Can set fire to flammable structures, destroy equipment and weapons, and even penetrate armored vehicles in certain situations.
Smoke grenades: Produces either white or colored smoke. Usually used to conceal infantry or light vehicle movement or to make positions visible to friendly forces.
Stun grenades: Sometimes called ""flashbangs"", these produce a deafening bang and a bright flash, momentarily disorienting targets in the room.
Riot control grenades: Usually loaded with teargas, rubber pellets, or other nonlethal deterrents, these grenades are meant to disperse and subdue crowds without causing mortal injuries.

, Grenades can easily cause friendly fire casualties if they detonate too close to you or friendly forces, so it's extremely important to know what ranges are considered ""safe"" and which are not. Even if you're well outside of your grenade's lethal range, you'll want to take cover before it detonates. Though rare, it's possible for a grenade to send shrapnel, debris, or concussive blasts beyond its designated lethal range, so don't expose yourself to these dangers needlessly.


For fragmentation grenades, ranges within 15-20 meters (50-65 feet) are generally considered to produce casualties. While shrapnel can potentially fly as far as 60 meters (about 200 feet), the speed of the shrapnel decreases rapidly with distance, making casualties at these ranges are rare.Concussion grenades have much smaller ranges on open terrain — usually just a few meters. However, in enclosed areas, their killing power is greatly amplified. In these situations, it's best to entirely remove yourself from the bunker, enclosure, etc. before throwing the grenade in.
Other grenades have much more limited damaging ranges. An incendiary grenade is usually lethal only if you come into contact with its flames, find yourself trapped in a burning building, or suffocate on its smoke in an enclosed area. Smoke grenades can cause burns at extremely close ranges but aren't usually considered lethal. Stun and riot control grenades are explicitly designed to be nonlethal, though rare accidents can result in fatalities., Since grenades have a timed fuse, it's theoretically possible for an enemy target to pick up the grenade and throw it back at you. To avoid this, some soldiers use a technique called ""cooking off"" their grenade — intentionally holding it for a short time before throwing it to shorten or eliminate the amount of time that the enemy has to throw it back. To cook off a grenade, pull the pin, release the lever, count to ""one one thousand"" or ""two one thousand,"" then throw. Most combat grenades have a four or five second fuse, so don't cook off your grenade for more than one or two seconds unless you're positive its fuse is longer.


Note that this technique is also sometimes used to increase a grenade's effectiveness against bunkers or other fortified emplacements — in these cases, having the grenade explode in the air above the target can be preferable to having it explode on the ground.
Note also that many former Soviet Union grenades have a slightly shorter fuse than American grenades — often about three to four seconds.

, When throwing any grenade, lethal or non-lethal, it's important to remember that the grenade can roll. Thus, if it lands on a slope, it may roll away from your target or, worse, roll back toward you. For this reason, it's generally a bad idea to through grenades onto sloped surfaces, especially up inclines that you're at the bottom of.If you absolutely have to throw a grenade uphill, try cooking it off beforehand and giving it a high arc so that it explodes in the air above your target or else has little time to roll back towards you.

, Taking cover before a grenade detonates can literally make the difference between life and death, especially if you're within its lethal range. Putting physical barriers between yourself and the detonating grenade is almost always a good idea (except for smoke grenades, for obvious reasons). However, not all forms of cover are equal when it comes to grenades. For your personal safety, it's important to understand the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" cover before you throw your first grenade.


The shrapnel from fragmentation grenades can penetrate wood, plaster, glass, furniture, and thin layers of metal, especially at short ranges. On the other hand, thicker, heavier materials like sandbags, cinder blocks, stone, and thick metal can usually block shrapnel — the thicker, the better.
Note that the shockwave from a concussion grenade can travel long distances through enclosed spaces (even around corners). Thus, in bunkers, tight corridors, and other enclosed spaces, cover may not offer protection from concussion grenades.
While incendiary grenades have a short effective range, they can burn at temperatures of over 2,200o C (almost 4,000o F).This is hot enough to melt through steel, so distance, not cover, is essential for protecting yourself against these grenades.

Gather the supplies.,
Mix the powders.,
Prepare the mixture.,
Funnel the mixture into the shell.",How to Make an Egg Smoke Bomb2," You'll need baby powder and crushed chalk. The chalk is an optional ingredient that is used to add color to your smoke bomb. Pick out whatever color of chalk you want the smoke to be. Use a variety of colors if you want multiple colors of smoke.

, Crush the chalk pieces if you haven't already done so. Be sure that the chalk is finely ground. You could grind the chalk in a food processor, or by hammering the chalk in a sealed plastic bag. Mix the chalk into the baby powder. Use about a handful of baby powder per tablespoon of chalk powder. Stir your powders until they are evenly mixed together.









Experiment with different proportions of baby powder to chalk.
Create multiple batches of colors. Don't feel limited to use one color for all of your bombs. Store the mixture in a tupperware container., Take a sheet of computer paper and fold it in half hot dog style. Unfold the paper, and place two tablespoons of your mixture onto the paper. The crease you created will help guide the powder into the shell without a mess.







, Flip your shell in the egg container so that the hole is facing you. Carefully shake the powdered mixture into the hole. Work slowly with the powder to avoid a mess. This step above anything else requires patience and a steady hand. Don't feel discouraged if you make a mess.








If it's difficult to fill, increase the size of the hole. Be careful not to create any cracks.
If you find clumps in the powder, smooth them out with a fork or by using a food processor.

The simplest method is to apply a small strip of tape over the opening. You could also seal the hole by using tissue paper and a glue stick.

, Once you've filled the eggs with the powder, cut out small strips of tape. You can use whatever tape you have lying around. Duct tape or electrical tape is preferred. Seal the hole with the strip of tape. If your strip didn't cover the hole's entirety, apply another strip of tape.








, Cut the tissue paper a little larger than the shell's opening. Use standard tissue paper like you'd use to wrap a birthday present. You can use different colors of tissue paper if you want.







, Apply your glue stick to one side of the tissue paper you've cut out. Place the adhesive side of the tissue paper over the egg's hole. Make sure the glue is firmly sealed onto the egg's outer shell.







, You can take this in any direction you want. If you'd like a simpler design, draw something with a marker. You could also paint a fun design using watercolors. Remember you're going to ultimately break this, so don't become too invested in your design. Be careful when decorating; the egg's shell is still very fragile.


This step is optional.

, Once you've finished perfecting your smoke bomb, it's time to destroy it! Throw the bomb on the sidewalk or onto a slab of concrete. If you choose to use colors, this will create a colorful aftermath.

Master the stroke.,
Make the shots.,
Switch it up.,
Focus.",How to Play Pool2," Each person has a different preferred hand position. If you are right-handed, hold the base of the stick with your right hand and rest the narrow end on your left. If you are left-handed, do the opposite.


For a good hand position, try putting your index finger on the top of the stick (curving it) and put your thumb at the bottom of the stick. This is a good, basic way to put your hand in position because you have total control of the stick. Hold it tight as well.

Some will prefer to rest the stick on their index finger while others may rest the cue in between their fingers in a flatter style. Experiment with a few to see what yields the best results.
This hand will never move. Only move your back arm when shooting.


Your feet should be a little wider than shoulder-width apart and at a 45-degree angle.
During your practice strokes, your eyes should switch from the contact point on the cue ball to the point you're aiming for on the object ball.

, Line the pool tip up with the cue ball, aim, and hit away! Sounds easy, huh?


As a beginner, focus on hitting the cue ball straight and with power.
Aim as if you were to directly hit your object ball. See that spot you'd be hitting if you were allowed to? Alright. Now, aim to get the cue ball to that spot on your object ball.
Experiment with slow, easy shots. Sometimes a softer touch helps your ball to ride the edge of the table or stay in a more defensive position.

, Now that you've got 8-ball down, why stop there?


Try ""Cutthroat Pool."" Each player chooses a section of the numbers (if 2 players, 1-7 and 9-15; if 3 players, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15) on the correlating pool balls. The object of the game is to sink your opponent's balls and only have yours left on the table. The last one with a ball (or balls) on the table wins.
Try 9-ball. This one can be a bit about luck, but that can be said about most games. The object of the game is to sink the balls in the pockets in numerical order, from 1-9. Each player takes turns going up to the 9 ball. The one to sink the 9 ball wins.

One player could sink 1-8 and still lose. That's the beauty of it!



, Always focus and keep your eye on the ball. Tune out distractions as best you can.


Don't get too confident or frustrated--the tables can turn in a second. Focus on improving your shot, not winning.
Allow yourself a game to warm up. Once kids stop running around, the TV gets turned off, and your muscles start remembering what you've learned you may see an improvement.

Remove the lid from the container when you’re ready to use the bomb.",How to Make an Assortment of Stink Bombs2," You will need one plastic container, such as a water bottle, with a lid (do not use glass or anything that will break). Additionally you will need ammonia, a pair of scissors and one book of matches.Ammonia is a cleaning solution. Be careful with it.

, Toss the wooden sticks and empty matchbook away – you will only need the match heads. Put the match heads inside your plastic bottle.


The match heads contain the sulfur you need to create this bomb.
You could go out and buy the chemical sulfur in a powdered form, but this is generally hard to find and expensive.
Match heads are much easier to find and safer to use.

, Pour the ammonia over the match heads that you’ve already placed in the container. Fill up the container about halfway and then tightly screw the lid or cap back onto your container.Once you’ve put the lid on your stink bomb, allow it to sit for about 3-4 days. The chemicals inside will react and brew up the stench.

Drano is a cleaning solution, so be careful with it and around it.

, No need to use any kind of measuring spoon, just eyeball it. After the Drano, pour about 1 inch of warm water into the glass jar.


Again, you can just eyeball it – it doesn’t have to be exact.Be sure to recap and put the Drano crystals away safely after you use the product.

, Crack the eggs one at a time and separate the white from the yolk. Put the whites into a bowl or mug and dispose of the yolks and the egg shells. After you’ve got your 6 egg whites separated, dump them into the glass jar with the Drano and warm water and stir the mixture well with a spoon.If you’ve never separated egg whites from the yolks before, you can always ask a parent to show you how (although you might want to tell them it’s for an omelet, not a stink bomb).
Grocery stores sell little cartons of egg whites already separated from the yolks, so you can always buy that and use it, if you want.

, During that week, the substances inside will brew together to make the stink bomb. Make sure you put the jar somewhere safe during this time so that nobody stumbles upon it.


Every couple of days, give the jar a good shake., Keep the lid on until you know exactly where you want to put it! You can hide it somewhere, such as in a sibling’s bedroom, under the bathroom sink or under the kitchen table, when you’re ready to pull your prank.Be careful not to get any of the mixture on yourself – it smells terrible!
Instead of hiding the uncapped jar, you can always dump the contents out wherever you want the bomb to be – but this isn’t really advised, since you might end up being forced by a parent or sibling to clean it yourself.

The basic idea of Snaps is to spell out individual letters of a word using either a statement or a snap of your fingers.,
Choose the name of a person that you want the receiver to guess.,
Decide if you want to give the receiver the exact name or the clue to the name.,
Figure out good consonant statements and a clear clue to the name, if necessary.,
Clue your receiver about the word to be snapped.,
Give the first letter to the receiver.,
Give the second letter.,
Follow the same pattern for the rest of the letters.,
Guess the person’s name or clue.,
Pay attention to the snapper’s first line.,
Listen closely to the first statement or series of snaps.,
Follow this pattern until the snapper finishes the name or the clue.,
Guess the name or the clue to the name.",How to Play Snaps,"
There are at least two players in Snaps. The snapper is the person who chooses a word and then snaps out the answer. The receiver is the person who listens to the snapper and guesses the word.
For consonants, you’ll say a sentence or statement in which the first word starts with the same letter that you are trying to spell out. For example, if you choose “George Washington,” your first letter is a “G.” You’ll clue the receiver into the name by starting with a sentence like “Get ready.” This lets the receiver know that the first name of the person or the clue is “G.”For vowels, you snap your fingers- hence the name of the game. Each vowel corresponds to a specific number of snaps. ""A"" is one snap, ""E"" is two snaps, ""I"" is three snaps, ""O"" is four snaps, and ""U"" is five snaps. Thus, for the second letter of “George Washington,” you would give two clear snaps for an “E.”There is no cue for a space in between words.;
, Since the idea of Snaps is to guess the name of someone, choose one that everyone can easily guess, such as a politician or celebrity.For example, you can use “Hillary Clinton” or “Britney Spears.”
Try to avoid difficult names or names that start with difficult letters. For example, the name Xavier would be difficult to use because of the “x.” There are no words with which you could put together a cue sentence.

, You don’t necessarily have to give your receiver the person’s exact name. To make it a bit more difficult, you can snap your receiver a clue to the person’s name.For example, if you want the receiver to guess “George Washington” you could snap out the clue “first President.” For “Marlon Brando” you could use “the Godfather.”

, Once you know the name that you want to play, figure out how to spell it properly first and then look at the consonants. If you’ve decided to use a clue instead of the direct name, you’ll need to devise a clear clue for the receiver.


For example, for the name “George Washington,” you’ll need to have brief statements to clue your reader into each consonant in the name or in the clue. You could use “Read the newspaper” for “R.” If you decide to use “first President” as your clue, you could use “Party on” as your statement for the letter “P.”

, Before you start spelling out your letter with statements and snaps, clue your receiver about the nature of the word with a simple sentence.If you’re using the direct name of a person, say ""Snaps IS the name of the game."" This lets your receiver know that you’re spelling out the name of a person.If you’re giving the receiver a clue about the person, such as “Rocky” for Sylvester Stallone or “the Godfather” for Marlon Brando, say ""Snaps ISN'T the name of the game."" This clues your receiver that you’re spelling out a clue to the name., After you’ve clued in your receiver that you’re giving her a name or a clue, give her the first letter of the word with either a statement or snaps.


Most names will begin with a consonant, so you will likely begin with a statement. Thus, for “Sylvester Stallone,” you could start with the statement “Super duper” to let your receiver know the first letter is a “s.”

, When the receiver has figured out the first letter, move on to the second letter of your name or clue. Only do this once they’re ready to go and you’ve either figured out a next statement or vowel, depending on the second letter.


Second letters are often vowels, so your next clue will probably be a series of snaps. For “Al Pacino” you will want to snap clearly once to indicate to your receiver that “a” is the next letter.
Remember to snap clearly so that your receiver can hear each individual snap.

, Use the same pattern of snaps and statements until you’ve finished spelling out either the name or the clue.


If there are any parts that the receiver didn’t get, go back and give the statements or snap series again.

, Have your receiver guess the person once you’ve finished spelling out the name or clue. If he doesn’t get it, you can either help him or play another round of snaps to solve the name.


If you decided to use a clue to a person’s name, have your receiver guess the clue first and then the name.

, Make sure to pay close attention to what the snapper says before he begins using snaps or statements. This will help you know if he is using a name or a clue about a name.


If the snapper is using the direct name of a person, he will say ""Snaps IS the name of the game.""If the snapper says ""Snaps ISN'T the name of the game,"" then you know that he is spelling out a clue about a person., The snapper will either give you a clue or snap for the first letter of the name or clue. Make sure to pay close attention to this so you get the game off to a good start.


For example, if the snapper chose “Benjamin Netanyahu” as the name, he would first say a statement like “Be prepared” to let you know that the first letter of the name or clue is “B.”
If he chose the name Iggy Pop, on the other hand, he would first snap three times to let you know that the first letter is “I.”

, Listen to the snapper’s statements and snaps until he says that he is finished so that you can successfully solve the name or clue.


If it makes it easier to remember each letter, write them down on a piece of paper.

, Once the snapper has finished spelling out the name or the clue, guess what it is. If you can’t get it, either ask the snapper to clarify something or play another round of snaps to solve the name.


If the snapper decided to use a clue to a person’s name, guess the clue first and then the name.

Play for fun.","How to Play Rock, Paper, Scissors"," Unless you’re playing for amusement’s sake, some issue will normally be hanging in the balance. Maybe you’re trying to decide who gets the last slice of pizza, or who should be first in line to try out a new waterslide. In most cases, Rock, Paper, Scissors is played as a means to help make a choice or put an end to a disagreement. The idea is that both players have an equal chance of winning, making the game random but fair.Rock, Paper, Scissors can be used to decide anything from what movie you see with your friends to who should inherit a collection of priceless paintings.While patterns do emerge during gameplay, they are neutralized by the unpredictability of the other player’s choice.;
, For the game to play out correctly, there need to be two players. Stand facing one another a few paces apart. Place one hand flat out in front of you, palm up. Your other hand will be used to make the shape of the object you want to play once the game starts.Rock, Paper, Scissors can only be played by two people at a time.

, Agree on a cue that you’ll use to match shapes with your opponent. In the majority of games, the players throw their shape on the count of three (sometimes counted off by reciting each word of the game’s title). You can also count down by saying “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On the word “shoot,” both players reveal the object they chose.Tap your closed playing hand against your palm as you count down. This will help you and your opponent get synchronized.
Be sure that you’re on the same page as far as timing your plays.

, When it comes time to play, you and your opponent will each form one of the three objects—either rock, paper or scissors. You’ll then name a winner based on which object they played. Every game will be different, so stay alert! Both players must throw at the same time. If one player delays, the result isn’t trustworthy, and you should start the game over.
Don’t play the same object every time. Switch it up to fool your opponent.

, After you’ve both played an object, look to see who’s won. Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, rock “crushes” scissors but is “covered” by paper, paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors, and scissors is “crushed” by rock but “cuts” paper. The player who picks the stronger of the two objects is the winner.If both players throw the same object, it’s a tie. In this situation, simply play again until there is a clear winner.
The loser of the game has the right to call for “best two out of three,” meaning that three rounds will be played instead of just one. This gives the losing player a second chance to come out on top.

, To play “rock,” simply ball your hand up into a fist when you and your opponent shoot. Rock beats scissors, but loses to paper.


Most people tend to throw rock more often than the other shapes, especially if they're inexperienced. Remember this when choosing which object to play.
Try to predict your opponent's next move by paying attention to their patterns.

, Throw “paper” by extending your hand palm down with your fingers outstretched. Paper wins against rock, but loses to scissors.


Paper is a good object to throw if you're undecided at the last second because there's usually more of a chance your opponent will play rock than scissors.

, For ""scissors,"" use two fingers to mimic the shape of an open pair of scissors. Scissors has an advantage over paper but can be beat by rock.


If you find yourself losing when you throw rock, switch to scissors. This will help you overcome an opponent who relies on paper.

, Play Rock, Paper, Scissors the next time you need to resolve some disagreement in a flash. For instance, you could compete for the privilege of getting the window seat. And, of course, you can always play a series of games to give each player a fighting chance.Rock, Paper, Scissors is better than other games of chance, like drawing straws or flipping a coin, because there’s an element of control involved.
Both players should be willing to accept whatever the outcome may be.

, Rock, Paper, Scissors can also be handy for establishing what order things come in, like when you’re fighting with your friends over who gets to be in the front of the line. You can even play several games between three or more people to set up a final order in advance. After each player has gone up against everyone else, tally up your total number of wins, using tie-breaker games as needed.


A few rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors can help you set up an order faster than talking it out can.

, Put your Rock, Paper, Scissors skills to the test in an organized competition. There, you’ll go head-to-head with other experienced players, learn to pick up on their tells and try to outwit them with superior tactics. There may even be a little bit of prize money or some other reward for you if you emerge the winner.Take a look at the World Rock Paper Scissors Society website for info on how to sign up for an official tournament, or start one of your own. Since you don’t need any special qualifications to enter, anyone has a fair shot at winning!Though it might sound strange, the simple hand game has gained a lot of popularity as a test of strategy and chance.

, Even if there’s nothing riding on the game, you can still play Rock, Paper, Scissors for your own enjoyment. Keep tally of you and your opponent’s wins and losses, and play until one of you reaches a predetermined number. It’s similar to Tic-Tac-Toe in that you can go through multiple games in a lightning-quick fashion. That spontaneity will help keep you on your toes!


Traditionally, playful punishments were devised for whoever lost a series of games, such as a slap on the wrist."

Create exemptions from the game.",How to Play Punch Buggy," You are looking for a “bug” or Volkswagen Beetle. It can be an old or new version, but it should be a VW Beetle. These are the cars that you need to point out. Make sure that you don’t mistake other cars for a “bug.” A VW Bug is a small car that will typically have rounded features, and the VW logo on the back of the car.Remember, you are looking for a car that resembles a traditional Volkswagen Beetle. This does not include all Volkswagen cars. For example, a Volkswagen Cabriolet would not count.;
, At this point, you’ve seen a “bug” so now you can gently punch the person next to you. You should punch them in the upper arm. As you punch them, make sure to yell “Punch Buggy.” This will confirm that you have actually seen a Beetle. When you hit them, don’t be too aggressive. You cannot punch a person back if they say “Punch Buggy” and punch you first.You can call out the color of the “bug” as well. This is not required. This just helps the other person know what type of car you saw.
If you go by a Volkswagen dealership, you are not allowed to punch anyone., You want to make sure that you know who is winning. The best way to do this is to keep score during the duration of the game. Though there are no official rules for Punch Buggy, you can adopt some general guidelines, like what amount of points wins the game. Each proper identification of a bug gives you one point. However, each time you are mistaken, you lose one point.Designate someone to keep score with a pencil and sheet of paper, or on a notepad on a mobile phone.

, It is best to avoid punching the driver of the car. You should only punch other passengers in the car. If it is only you and the driver in the car, play a contactless game of Punch Buggy, or save the game for a time when there will be more passengers.Don’t hit anyone harder than they should be hit. Hit lighter if the other player asks you to.
Avoid hitting very young players. Tap them lightly, or keep them out of the game.

, You can pause or stop the game if you feel overwhelmed. All you need to do is ask for a time-out. Just say ""time-out!"" The game will not resume until you say “time in.” You cannot say “Time in - Punch Buggy - Time-out.” Saying this within one sentence will result in a deduction of points.The amount of points deducted should be decided at the beginning of the game, or by a parent or driver of the car. The deduction is typically 25 points.

, A car that has been previously called out by another player can’t be called out again. If it is called out, the person that called it the second time should submit to two punches by the player that initially called the “bug.” Another option is to deduct points.If you didn’t hear the initial “Punch Buggy,” you can argue to not have your call held against you. This should be decided by all of the players together.

, If you call out “Punch Buggy,” you should punch another passenger within five seconds. You forfeit your rights to punch after the five seconds is over. This rule applies to all players. The other players have the right to attempt to dodge the punch within the five second span.Since the game has no official rules, you can choose to expand or shorter the amount of time to deliver a punch once “Punch Buggy” is called.
A punch that is dodged results in no points for the player that called the “Punch Buggy.”

, A VW bug that has been seen before can be called again thirty minutes later if the car has been stopped in the intervening time between the first and second call. This is because the car being put in the park position cancels out any cars that have been previously called. The car, however, must come to a full stop, not just a temporary stop at a drive-thru.It can be decided that a car is eligible in less than thirty minutes if everyone agrees on that rule.

, The driver should be exempt from the game, as well as any other passengers that do not want to participate. Decide who is playing before the game starts. Punching a passenger that is not playing can result in a deduction of points, or a returned punch.The punishment for hitting an unwilling person can be decided by the players.

, Punch Buggy can also be played without the punches. The rules are exactly the same as the punching version of the game, but no contact is allowed. The other player can choose to acknowledge the call by saying something like “I see it,” or simply “okay.” Keep track of the points on a notepad.This version of the game is ideal when there are only two people in the car.

, You can choose to include other types of cars in the game if there aren’t enough VW Beetles on the road. You can choose to limit the allowed car types to “Beetle-like” built cars, like the Hebmuller or Karmann Cabriolet. Or, you can limit the car type to small, compact cars., You can create rules to be exempt from punches in the game. For example, for the first sighting, it can be decided that anyone wearing black socks is exempt from a punch. Change the rule as the game progresses for each sighting.Another exemption can be for anyone who is wearing a green shirt.

At the end of each hand, a new President, Vice President, and Asshole are declared.

",How to Play Presidents and Assholes," Ace is the highest card. Jokers can be included as wilds or taken out of the deck.;
, 2s are also considered wild and can be played as any other card.

, A person can also choose to pass their turn. They must also take a drink.

,, That person must take a drink. For example; if player 1 lays down two 6s and then player 2 also lays down 2 6s, player 3 is skipped and must then take a drink. Player 4 must then play a pair higher than 6.

, Every player is ranked in the order that they run out of cards. The first player to run out of cards is declared the President. The next player to run out is the Vice President. The last player to run out is the Asshole. Additional rankings can be created. A common rank for the second lowest ranking player is Beer Bitch. This player must fetch all other players a new drink when they run out.

, The game is played the same as the first hand with a few additional rules. While the Asshole is dealing, he or she can tell any player to drink at any time. However, once the Asshole is finished dealing, any player can tell any other player of a lower rank to drink. So the President can tell anyone to drink and no one can tell the President to drink, but anyone can tell the Asshole to drink.

Slammers are metal discs that are somewhat larger than the pogs themselves. They were typically sold in big bins throughout the 90s, and can still be found in some kids stores, attics, and thrift shops.


The original pogs were the cardboard caps from bottles of POG, a popular juice in Hawaii. The game was played using bottle caps for a long time before it was commercialized for the mainland, where it became very popular in the 1990s.
If you want to make some pogs, trace a circle onto a piece of paper 4 centimeter (1.6 in) in diameter. Tape it onto a slab of cardboard. Cut the circle out and draw a design on the top using with black pen. Color if you want. To make the slammer, simply tape two pieces of cardboard together and flatten it.;
, Pogs is mostly a game of collecting the biggest and coolest collection of discs. A game of pogs requires a big pot of pogs, so it's usually played between a few friends all of whom have a big stack of them. The object of the game is to end up with your buddy's pogs in your stack, to make your collection grow.


Most games start with everyone comparing their favorite pogs in a pile. If you see some that you like, you can offer to trade for them or play for them.

, Once you see some pogs that you like, you can challenge your buddy to a game to keep them, but only if you both agree. If you don't want to play for keeps, make sure you both know it.


Before the game, the players decide whether to play for ""keeps"" or ""no-keeps"". If you play for ""keeps"", a player keeps the pogs that are won, even if they are his opponents.
Back in the 90s, when playing with pogs was really popular, lots of schools outlawed the game. Teachers claimed that playing with pogs was a form of gambling. While its not super-common anymore, it's still good to make sure that it's allowed with your parents or teachers before you play.

, Any hard flat surface will be fine to play pogs. Carpet, counter tops, and concrete are all good places for pogs. Just make sure you don't dent up your mom's table with your slammer.If you play on the concrete, sometimes it's good to put all the pogs on a book, or on a binder to keep your slammer from getting all dinged up.

, Go around the circle, and takes turns putting in the pogs that you're going to play with. Just make a big pile of them facedown. Each player must put in the same number of pogs. It's usually best to play with at least 10-15 pogs total. Make sure the stack is at least that big.


Start by placing all the pogs into a pile, then shuffling them and stacking them face down. This helps to ensure that someone's pogs aren't all at the bottom.
If you're playing for keeps, remember that any pogs you put into the stack might not come back to you when you're done. You have to decide which pogs you're willing to risk to get the ones that you want.

, Once you've shuffled them, arrange the pogs into a big stack. Make sure that all of the pogs are facedown, so you can't see the design side. The way you win the pogs is by flipping them over using your slammer, so it's important to make sure that they start facedown.

, Once you've got your stack built up, start the game by flipping the slammer as you would a coin to see who goes first. The slam should pass in counter-clockwise order around the circle, after you find out who goes first.


The first player typically gets the most pogs out of the slam. It's a lot harder to flip over a very small stack of pogs.

, Depending on who you play with, there may be a rule for how you're supposed to hold the slammer. In American Pog tournaments, it was required that the slammer be held between the index finger and the middle finger, and flicked downward, over the back of the wrist. But there are lots of ways to hold the slammer, so it's fun to experiment and see which is best. Here are some common techniques:


Hold the slammer flat against the inside of your fingers, and keep it in place with your thumb. Slap it down toward the stack.
Curl the slammer into your index finger and hold it with your thumb, like you were going to skip a stone.
Hold the slammer like you would a dart, between your index finger and thumb, sideways. Or turn it so the flat side is between your finger and thumb.

, Take your slammer in whatever grip you've chosen, and forcefully slam it down onto the top of the stack of pogs. Let the slammer go as it makes contact. If you hit it correctly, many of the pogs should flip over onto the other side.


You collect all the pogs that you've flipped over. They now are yours, if you're playing for keeps. If you're not, just keep them in your pile until the game is over.
Restack the rest of the pogs that didn't flip over into a stack again, still facing down. Pass the slammer to the next player.

, The game is over when one player has collected more than half the pogs from the stack. The remainder of the pogs go back to whoever put them in to begin with, and the winner keeps the pogs in his pile.


If you're not playing for keeps, return all the pogs to whoever started out with them in the first place.

, The basic game of pog is pretty simple, but you can play a few little variations and specific rules to have more fun. Make up your own, or try some of these common classics:


Play best of 15. Some players play that the stack must always remain at 15, but it's not important who puts in more. If you really want to get your best friend's favorite pog, putting in 14 to his 1 might be a daring way to try to gamble for it.
Play the pogs where they fall. After the pogs scatter, pick up the ones you flipped, but don't restock them. Instead, play that you have to hit them where they fell. It's a lot harder.
Play long-range pogs. In some games, you're allowed to get right up on top of the stack before you slam them. In other games, you have to stand a few feet away, making it much more difficult to actually hit the stack. It adds a little fun to the game.
Just keep playing. One of the fun parts of the game is losing pogs, then getting them back, then losing them again. It's fun to keep playing for the same pogs over and over again. If you lost one of your favorites, it'll be easy to get it back in the next game.

, The easiest way for players to collect a bigger stack of pogs is to play for them regularly. Challenge your friends to games with their collections and try to win as many games as possible to grow your collection quickly.


The best way to grow a bigger stack? Play with lots of people. If you play in a big group and everyone only puts in a few pogs, you don't stand to lose many, but you can gain a bunch pretty quickly. It's a fun way to play.

, Got a pog you really love? Don't put it into a stack to play for it, if you don't want to lose it. The only sure way to keep the pogs you like is to keep them in your possession.


On the other hand, putting ones you really like into the stack helps to keep the game exciting. If you might lose your favorite, there are big stakes!

, Sometimes, people prefer trading pogs for pogs, instead of playing for them. Collecting them was often a more fun part of the game than actually playing the game. Like baseball cards, Pokemon cards, or other kinds of kids' trading cards, a good trade is half the fun.

, Clear plastic storage containers were common for pogs back in the 90s. These were great for keeping your pogs new and clean looking, instead of all dinged up and dented. While these might be hard to find now, you could use PVC pipe of the appropriate size, a paper towel roll, or even just loose in a pencil case.

, It used to be that you could just find pogs in big bins everywhere for a few cents each. Those were the days. Although pogs used to be widely available at toy stores, they're pretty uncommon nowadays. The best bet is probably Craigslist, or to find some in an older relative's attic if you want to score an old stash.

Play methodically and strategically, staying relaxed under stress.,
Analyze the needs and weaknesses of your opponent.,
Research the top strategies for your game.,
Keep an eye out for patterns.,
Use randomness to your advantage.,
Know the rules inside and out.,
Practice the smaller skills individually to improve at the greater game.,
Communicate effectively and constantly with any teammates.,
Play some mind games.",How to Win at Everything1," Even if the game requires relative quickness, like speed chess or sports, the player that keeps their cool is usually the one that walks away victorious. Make a habit of controlled, regular breathing while you play, taking your time to make the absolute best choice every time you're up. If you're relaxed and calm you'll have a much easier time sorting through the options and choosing the best one., Instead of trying to think, ""what is my opponent thinking?"", break the question down into simpler and more effective questions. First, what does my opponent need to win? And secondly, if I was my opponent, what would I be worried about -- what is my weakness? The answer to these two questions almost always points to a worthwhile strategy:


In a game of tennis, imagine you're playing someone with an amazing serve, but poor net play. They will want to hit it hard, keeping you back on the baseline to avoid the net, but you should flip this on it's head and force them to the front-court with short shots and slices.
In a board, card, or strategy game, ask yourself each turn what your opponent still needs to do to win. How can you prevent them from getting this?

, If you're a chess player, there are hundreds of books detailing moves, how to read opponents, and successful long-term strategies. If you're playing cards, mathematicians and game theorists have broken down the proven ways to win for almost any game created, often detailed for free online. Don't try to learn everything through experience -- read up on the success of past players and use it to your advantage.


More than just giving you strategies, reading up on a game's news and tips helps you recognize your opponent's strategy as they try it, helping you cut it off quickly.
Even athletes should constantly read up on new advancements. Look no further, for example, than US triple jumper Christian Taylor. After reading up on research and science, he broke conventional wisdom by taking shorter, faster jumps instead of long, slow ones. He then won the gold medal at the 2016 Olympics., These can be patterns in the game or your opponent's patterns. People struggle to be random, and will generally repeat the same methods over and over again, especially if they feel like they are working. Keeping your mind sharp on the overall trends and patterns in the game can help you control them to victory.


If an opposing team is having the most success attacking down the left side, don't just keep playing. Find a way to plug the hole on your team's left.
In Rock, Paper, Scissors, most men throw rock first, while most women throw paper. That means you should always start with paper -- you're most likely to win or tie. As you keep playing, look out for similar series of moves from your opponent to read them like book., While you're analyzing your opponent for patterns, you can assume they are doing the same thing. Whenever you can throw a little randomness in the mix, or simply mix up your own patterns, you can catch them off-guard and gain an advantage. Not all games allow randomness, but switching up tactics to confuse your opponent will usually help you get ahead.


In sports, like soccer, for example, take shots from all around the box, not just once you get close to goal. Make them defend both outside the box and inside of it to keep them moving.
Use the natural world to help stay random. For example, imagine you're serving in tennis. Instead of serving the same place, or alternating each time, look at your watch. If the second hand says 0-30, serve to the right. If it says 31-60, serve left

, You can't win if you get tangled up in fouls or broken rules. Whats more, knowing the rules inside and out is the best way to catch others cheating and know exactly what tools and strategies you have at your disposal. Whether you're playing a game or entering a contest, knowing the rules back to front gives you an instant advantage over the competition., Take, for example, the game of poker. While you can practice by simply playing lots of poker, good players know they need to focus on each part of the game to truly succeed. They might study what hands to fold or play one day, when to bluff another, and how to calculate card odds on the fly the next day. By mastering individual skills, you greatly improve your total game.


Many games, like chess, have ""practice problems"" online, which are particular game-like scenarios that you must quickly figure out.
For sports, this is why drills are so essential. Don't just think about repeating the motion over and over again, think about how you'll use this particular skill to succeed in a game.For complex tasks like video games playing against a computer, or even against yourself, is a great way to build skills on your own time.

, The teams that talk the most are the teams that work the most effectively. You should be in constant communication about your opponent's moves, where you are, if you need help or support, or any changes in strategy. Don't ever assume that you're better off on your own, or keeping quiet in hopes of being ""secretive."" The best teams keep in touch.


If you learn or find something useful for your teammates, let them know.
Provide on-the-fly updates as you play -- ""I got this one,"" ""I need some help,"" ""watch your back,"" etc., There is a famous shot from the Tour de France where Lance Armstrong, in the lead after climbing a brutally large mountain, sees a challenger gaining ground on him. Even though he is exhausted, Armstrong quickly changes his face into a happy, relaxed smile and looks back at the opponent, who's face is completely tired. The rider, fearing Lance is not tired at all, is demoralized, and Armstrong easily wins. You can play the same tricks in any game to gain a psychic advantage. Keep cool and collected while your opponents crumble.


No matter what game you're playing, keep your poker face up. The only emotions you show are the ones you want your opponent to see.
If you bluff in a game, for whatever reason, don't tell your opponents even if you pull it off successfully. This is why, unless forced, you never show your hand in a game of cards. They can't figure out when you're bluffing and when you're serious.

Define what it means to win in life.,
Do the preparation work necessary for success.,
Always keep learning, especially in the fields you enjoy.,
Work on your goals every single day instead of in big chunks.,
Stop and analyze your goals, making adjustments as needed, regularly.,
Study the habits of the very best in your field.,
Look at failures as challenges, not roadblocks.,
Prioritize wisely.,
Have a winner's mentality.",How to Win at Everything2," What do you consider a successful life? When you see yourself 3-4 years down the line, what are you doing? If these questions are difficult, ask smaller ones to start: are you living in a city or the country? Do you want to work from home or do you want to help save the world through charity? Maybe you just want the time to pursue your hobbies at leisure. Whatever it is, winners figure out where the finish line is so that they can plan how to get there.


Goals worth having aren't always easy. Don't let the difficulty or length of a task in front of you discourage you from going for it., Winners know that success requires work before the actual event or challenge occurs. ""Prior preparation prevents poor performance,"" so sit down for a few hours and sketch out the following questions, as well as your answers:


""What are the most likely things to go wrong?""
""How can I prevent problems or issues in advance?""
""What tools/materials do I need for success?""
""What steps can I take now to ensure success later?""

, Winners never ""know everything."" It's actually the opposite, as winners recognize that knowledge is power and you can never gain enough. Read a daily journal article in your field, pick up a new skill, and go to talks and lectures that catch your interest. While you should focus on your field, know that inspiration comes from everywhere. An open mind will take you far no matter what you're doing.


Try to be a sponge, absorbing as much information as you can whenever you can.
The more you challenge yourself, the more you'll learn. Taking the difficult or longer route usually pays off in more experience and know-how., This is a lot like the difference between studying a little bit every day and cramming the night before the test. While both may do enough to help you pass, the lessons learned from cramming are quickly forgotten.You gain much more ground if you work on something every single day, building momentum and forging powerful mental pathways that make you more efficient and successful in the future.That said, don't beat yourself up if you miss a day -- it's not the end of the world. The point is regular, scheduled practice to work on your goals. Just get back on the horse the next day.

, Winners don't just pick a course and blindly follow it. They are constantly taking stock of their surroundings, and are willing to pivot if there is a better option or idea around them. While every situation is different, productive analysis is easy-- take 5-10 minutes to step quietly aside, then ask the following questions:


""What is the current problem(s)?""
""How effective was my last solution?""
""What has changed since I last made my plans?""
""What is the best possible outcome that I can strive for at this moment?""

, For example, if you want to rule the world of finance, you should probably pay attention to Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, and other titans in the world of wealth. If you're becoming a musician, learn how your heroes practiced and got better, replicating the parts that sound right to you. Instead of mimicking other winners' live, try to drill down into the practices that make them so successful:


Without a doubt, hours of practice is the common thread between all winners. From the Beatles playing all-night shows in Germany to Bill Gates locked in a room with early computers, the best put in thousands and thousands of hours of work before succeeding.
Good practice is challenging, not easy. Lance Armstrong famously brought his bike to the Alps during wintertime as preparation for climbing the same mountains in the summer's Tour de France.

, Winners don't see failure as the end of the road, they see it as a necessary hurdle to jump over. There has never been a successful person who hasn't had to overcome failure, because the road to greatness always has challenges. By approaching setbacks as tests designed to make your better and stronger once conquered, you'll set yourself on the path to win at everything you do.


Challenges force you to learn and adapt on the fly. Remaining open and flexible will help you handle any difficulty that comes your way.

, Everyone knows the person, for example, that wants to write a great novel but ""can never find the time."" The problem is not that they can't find the time, it is that they aren't making the time for themselves. No one can set your schedule but you, so make a habit of prioritizing the things most important to you so you are 100% sure you'll get them done. If you don't make time for your priorities, no one else will.


Set aside the same time each day to work on your goals and projects. Once you actually carve out a dedicated time to work it becomes much easier to stick to.
Being a winner does require some sacrifice. Setting your priorities so that you work on your passions may mean smaller hobbies get less time and attention., You have to be psychologically and mentally prepared to succeed, so be positive and believe in yourself. If you think that you can be a winner, you will be further than most people ever get. Conversely, if you believe that you will fail or have no chance, you'll lose the motivation needed to actually win at anything.


Remind yourself that you not only are going to win, but you deserve to win. Being hungry and hopeful will provide motivation even if things get rough."

Look at the hints at the top of the screen when the round begins.,
Have a look at what the drawer is drawing.,
Associate colours with words.,
Learn the two worded words.,
Remember words that start or end with uncommon letters.",How to Win Draw My Thing on Mineplex1," Count how many letters are in the word. It sounds silly but it helps a lot. Once you've been playing a while you will begin to remember words used in the game based on their length. For example, if there is a word that has three letters, it is either 'pig', 'fat' or 'boy' because these are (currently) the only three-lettered words in the game. Having an idea of the words that are used in the game is vital to be really good.;
, Go through the words that have the right amount of letters that you know the game uses and if the drawing could possibly be it, try the word. Of course, you could just spam the words with the right amount of letters that you know the game uses but this isn't very efficient. It takes up most of your concentration to do this while you could be making more thought out choices instead and actually guess the word quicker.

, For example, purple is often used for words like 'magic' or 'wizard', and blue is often used for things like 'cold' or 'snowflake'. Make up little rules for yourself. One of mine is that if the word is seven letters long and they start to draw in green, try guessing 'creeper' straight away. Another one is if the word is five letters long and they draw a brown vertical line, try guessing 'torch'.


Try using 'bowl words'. If the drawer draws what looks like a bowl, I instantly think of words like 'bowl', 'soup', 'cereal', 'salad' and even 'spoon'. This all sounds odd but it really works. Try making some up of your own.

, (You know, 'camp fire', 'door knob' etc) There aren't that many, and you can use step one and count how many letters are in each word to eliminate certain ones and make it easier to get. Here's a tip, if the word has three letters in the first word and three letters in the second (like this: --- ---), the answer is always 'top hat'. Remember this and be the first to guess it when it comes up! (This could change if they add more words to the game)

, For example, if the word begins with x, try guessing 'Xbox'. It's the only word in the game that begins with x. Letters like 'J' and 'U' are uncommon in the game (for starting words with, that is) so perhaps try to learn which words in the game start with them.

Choose a competition at which you’ll excel, and make sure it’s far enough in the future that you have plenty of time to train effectively. Do some research into the judges and organizers as well to see what they look for in a winning competitor., Plenty of people get scared off by a competition’s requirements and don’t enter in the first place. Others drop out along the way. Since you’ve done your research, you can be confident in your choice to compete and your potential to win. So, stand strong even when you have your doubts and when others may be dropping out.

, Remember that you’re not competing with everyone in the competition. There may be many applicants and candidates, but there will only be a few contenders and finalists.Focus on understanding and beating them.


Determine who among your competition is strongest. This way, you can have an idea of who might be your most likely competition. First, you’ll need to figure out who is likely to enter your competition. Look at past lists of competitors, and focus on the winners or those who placed in the top 10. You might also talk to fans, coaches, or writers who are knowledgeable about your sport or other competition.
Review competitors’ past performances. If possible, try to watch videos or read articles about your rivals’ previous competitions. Look for strengths and weaknesses. Also observe overall strategy, bearing in mind how your own strategy might match up.

, You can't be in a competition if you don't enter. Apply carefully and review your application to ensure there aren’t any mistakes.


Pay any necessary entry fees. If the competition has an entry fee, pay it early, if possible, but definitely on time. Sometimes, early entry is cheaper or free as well, which is a plus. Also, remember to get a receipt.
Enter early. This is particularly true if the competition involves judges reviewing some work product. In a short-story writing contest, for example, the bulk of entries tend to come toward the end of the submission period.Entering early allows you to have more of the undivided attention of the judges, while entering later might mean your submission is lost in the pile with everyone else’s.

, You don’t want any surprises on competition day. Learning the rules inside and out will help you excel on game day, and it will give you peace of mind and possibly even an edge over less prepared competitors. Understanding the rules will also help reduce the chances that you will be disqualified for breaking them.

, Finding an expert or coach in your area of competition can help aim you toward winning. Look for past competitors, retired players, or reporters or authors who have written on the subject. Having a coach is ideal as well, as he can provide you with not just training tips but motivation and encouragement as well.

, Proper equipment that works for you specifically is crucial, particularly when styles or types of equipment and clothing vary considerably.


Wear appropriate clothing. Your clothes should fit properly and comfortably. They should also conform to the expected weather. For many sports, you’ll want clothing that breathes well so that you don’t overheat. Other types of gear may need to be customized to your sport. Cyclists often wear aerodynamic clothing and helmets, for example.
Use proper gear. Gear that works well for you can make a huge difference in your performance. Goggles that fit your face and don’t allow water to come in, especially after diving into the pool, are crucial for swimmers. Tennis players, as another example, need to consider grip, string tightness and alignment, size, shape, and weight of their racquets.
Make sure all your equipment conforms to the rules. Revisit the rules of the competition. Many competitions specifically set out parameters for what types of equipment are and are not allowed. If you’re unsure of anything, ask.

, Having a specific training schedule will take much of the stress out of training. With the exception of the occasional day off, try to train daily to improve over the course of your preparation time. Training daily will also help keep your competition top-of-mind as you prepare mentally.

, Some competitions, such as boxing, require this time for recovery or making weight. There’s a built-in recovery or training time here, but with other competitions you’ll have to self-monitor to make sure you’re getting early, frequent, and adequate training.


Start training well ahead of the competition—several months ahead, if possible. Use this time to train, practice, and hone your skills. If your competition is coming up soon, be prepared to speed up your training session, and focus more on the fundamentals if you don’t have time to cover everything you’d like. Distance runners should focus on longer runs, for example, even if they'd ideally incorporate strength training and sprints as well.
If possible, train for a set amount of time nearly every day. Just don’t burn out physically or mentally during the training process. Instead, train enough to be as prepared as possible and to be mentally comfortable with your level of preparation going into the competition.

, If you’re on a four-person high school debate team, for example, you might want to practice by doing Lincoln-Douglas (i.e. one-on-one) debating to see what new skills or strategies you pick up from that. If you’re on a certain side of the issue, you might practice debating the other side to understand your opponents’ potential strategies. Varying style in physical training also helps work different muscle groups, which is why a butterfly swimmer might try training in backstroke.

, However you ultimately decide to train, it’s obviously important to stick to your regimen and remain persistent. Maintaining motivating can be challenging, but there are techniques you can use other than sheer will power.


Set small goals within your training. For example, many cyclists who try to set hour records on the track (the distance you can ride in one hour) try training at their goal pace for five minutes at a time. Then, they build to 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and so on.The mini goals help keep you focused, while providing a sense of accomplishment along the way.
Make a checklist. Everyone has different productivity styles. If it helps, consider making a training checklist, which might be particularly important if you don’t have a coach to guide you. A checklist is what weightlifters do, for example, to keep track of the exercises they’ve done, the number of reps, and the weight. With a written checklist, you also have one less thing to think and worry about.
Give yourself encouraging reminders. Leave sticky notes on your mirror or car steering wheel. Write down anything motivational to keep you inspired. It doesn’t have to be specific. It can simply be, “You OWN the track today” or “35.5 IS my time!”
Seek support from family and friends. Tell your close ones about your training, your obstacles, and your goals. They might have insights that can help you keep motivated. They might also serve as a welcome and healthy distraction to get you out of the bubble you’re in while being so focused on training.

, You don’t want to neglect this important part of training. In some ways, it’s the most important part because if you’re not mentally sound, you won’t have the presence of mind to focus on the competition. Among the biggest things you can do is choose to have a positive attitude and remain motivated.


Avoid naysayers and any other discouraging influences.Hopefully, you do this already in other aspects of your life, so why not during your training? Since you’ve already set reasonable goals, you don’t need to worry about naysayers, and there will always be doubters and discouraging people no matter what goal you set. So, tune them out.
Manage your anxiety and emotions during training and during the competition itself.This takes practice. Sometimes you don’t know how you will feel while running your first half-marathon. So, consider running some 5Ks or 10Ks, for example. You don’t necessarily have to race for speed, but to understand how it feels to compete in your sport. This will also mitigate surprises on the day of your own competition in the half-marathon.
Be fearless. Fear saps up your motivation. So, to stay motivated, replace fear with focus: focus on your goals, focus on your training, and focus on the moment. Your goals are what you want and now is all you can control; that’s where you need your focus to be to overcome fear.

, Golfers in particular do this by visualizing each hole and each shot on the course they’re about to play, but this applies to all competitions.Visualization helps you practice seeing the success you’re trying to achieve by envisioning specifics. Effective visualization also improves your focus and concentration overall.

, In the days leading up to your competition, you want to be well rested and eat food that will give you the energy and concentration to perform well. Try to get eight hours of sleep in the days before a competition, and don’t skip breakfast the morning of the big day.


What you eat specifically varies depending on the competition, but you’ll generally want to raise your blood sugar with fruits and focus on carbohydrates to maximize your energy.Avoid overeating, and be sure to go to the bathroom before your competition begins.

, If your competition is outdoors, different weather conditions can definitely affect your strategy. If, for example, you’re a sailor, you’d want to know the weather to know which type of equipment to use, such as a different spinnaker. A wet course might require different shoes for a runner or different tires for a cyclist or off-roader.

, Arriving early offers plenty of benefits, in addition to the obvious one of not missing your competition. An early arrival also allows you to scout out the location of the event, as well as your competitors. You won’t feel rushed or stressed either, as you’ll have plenty of time to prepare, suit up, and check your equipment, if necessary.

, Try not to chit-chat too much immediately before your competition. This can distract you from the competition in a bad way and harm your focus. Other competitors might try to engage you to intentionally try to distract you, which you don’t want either.


Find some space to yourself to clear your mind of everything except the task at hand. For example, you might find a corner to listen to music with your headphones. You might also take some extra time to yourself getting ready in the locker room, backstage, or parking lot, for example.

, Remember the visualizations you did as you prepared? Before the competition, do one last visualization of what you’re about to do. See your competition through from beginning to end, focusing on each part and only each part as it comes. The competition should now your primary focus.

, Now that it’s competition time, you’re ready to perform what you’ve been practicing and execute your visualizations. It’s time to focus entirely on the task at hand.


Don’t linger over mistakes during the competition. If, for example, you don’t get the fastest start off the blocks in a track meet, avoid lingering on that by focusing on the next turn.
Don’t think about the outcome. Just as you’re not dwelling on the past, try not to get distracted by the future either. Staying present is not necessarily easy, but it is important to staying focused on the competition and everything you’ve practiced.If your mind wanders, don’t worry about that either. Refocus and keep going.

, Remember, this is what you’ve been preparing for, and you have a plan. Follow the plan, give 110%, and stay focused. The rest will take care of itself.

Be prepared.,
Start drawing as soon as you can.,
Don't rush too much.,
Make your drawings as simple as you can.,
Use appropriate colours.",How to Win Draw My Thing on Mineplex2," Your turn to draw could be at any point in the game, so be prepared. At the end of each round be ready to draw. It could be you next!

, You have a restricted amount of time so every second counts.

, This could lead to you making mistakes and having to start over. Also, people might not be able to work out what you are drawing if you aren't taking care.

, This can save time as well.

, For example, don't use black to draw milk. It confuses people. If the colour you want isn't available, just draw the outline of the thing in black. (For example if you were drawing a pig, you could just draw the outline of it instead of colouring it in purple)

Lay both Pans flat face-up on the table, with the ball equidistant between the two Pans.

,
Each player grasps their Pan based completely on player preference.

,
An observer yells ""Go"" and the two players both flip their Pans as fast as possible, trying to cover the Ball first.

,
The player who covers the Ball fastest gains possession of the Ball and takes the Ball into his/her Pan.

,
If the Ball is pushed off the table while the players try to cover the Ball, then the face-off is replayed.",How to Play Professional Pan Pong2,",,,,


The only alternative to flipping the pan to cover the ball is a move known as the ""Shovel"". This move is executed by simply pushing your pan into the ball which results in the ball flying into the lap of the other player. By shoveling it fast enough, the move effectively shoots the ball out from underneath the opposing player's pan which is coming down to cover the ball. This move is only effective when the situation appears undesirable, due to the fact that per the rules the face-off must simply be replayed.

"
"
The winner of the face-off then takes a shot with the Ball at the other player.

,
If the Ball hits the opponent, the shooter gains a point.",How to Play Professional Pan Pong3,", If the Ball is blocked by the opposing player no point is awarded.


A hit is defined as any shot causing the ball to come in contact with any part of the defending player (this includes the head and face). However, the one exclusion is all of the forearm beginning at the elbow, all the way to the fingertips. A legal hit also includes a ball that is deflected upwards but on its way down comes in contact with the player's body (head, lap, etc.).
If the Ball misses the opponent, or is blocked by the opponent's Pan and hits the floor; the round is restarted with another face-off.
The first player to 15 points and has at least a 2 point lead is declared the winner.
In the event that the first player to reach 15 points does not have at least a 2 point lead, the winner is determined by the same tie-breaking method in Tennis of ""Deuce"". During this tie-breaker, the same rules of game-play are still in effect. Both players begin at Deuce. If a player scores a point, they move to the status of ""Advantage"". If they score once more they will be declared the winner. However, if the other player scores, both scores return to Deuce. This method is followed until a player is effectively determined as having scored twice on the opponent with no opposing points being scored.

Start small!,
Decide what type of company you wish to run.,
Build your first route.,
Do not begin the route immediately after placing your stations.,
Wait for those routes you set up to collect revenue.,
Expand your transportation empire by opening up more routes.,
Keep in mind that, by this time, competition may or may not begin showing up depending on the scenario being played.,
Understand that, regardless of techniques, eliminating competitors is not a priority.,
Build many trucks to transport (about four), if there is a high amount of cargo (for truck routes).,
Make sure that the vehicles are running efficiently.,
Check the vehicle's reliability.,
See how large the vehicle is when checking for profit.,
Remember that every scenario has its own rules, goals, and provisions.",How to Win a Game of Locomotion," You cannot build a massive transportation company in a few years of playing. You must start with something simple, then use revenue to make it big!
, Do you want to run a cargo company, passenger transit, or both? While you never officially are required to choose a company type, it helps in the future to settle priorities in the company.

Personally, while there is more risk in running a passenger transit it is far more financially successful than cargo companies, and cities cannot ""close"" the way that factories can.

, Remember, you do not have unlimited funds, so keep it small for the time-being. Massive trade routes are more complicated, so they can be built later. Depending on the geography, your patience, and the scenario you are playing choosing what type of transportation mode to start with can be hard, Look at the first four tips to help with that.

, Instead, observe the station and wait for the number of passengers/cargo to increase to it's maximum, once it reaches that maximum it will start decreasing, immediately start the route, if you wait too long it will decrease indefinitely and will cost you profit., Do not feel bad for only having one route; in time, you will have tons. Airplane routes especially have only one, and while it may look small, you will generate a high revenue per flight and once the wait period is over you will have a large amount of cash at your disclosure., Look at tips 5 and 6 for ideas., If you are smart, they will not be a problem. Look at tips 7 and 9 for more information., Make sure you don't spend too much time eliminating competitors as they are not a huge threat to you and these techniques are not foolproof, it depends entirely on the opponent., Try to use one way roads to guide trucks through a ""loop"" This way, when the trucks leave the cargo station they won't block other trucks.

Another suggestion is to build multiple cargo loading stations right next to each other (under one station) and use one-way roads. Have many trucks go to different places. One cargo hub can service 12 trucks if done efficiently.

, Check on the vehicles you currently own and make sure that all of them are earning profit, if any aren't investigate a cause and try to resolve it (i.e. if a route is blocked or a bus,truck, or ship is ""lost"") if a cause is found and cannot be resolved or simply cannot be found then eliminate the route, your funds should be used somewhere profitable., If it is less than 60% (or close to reaching 60%), replace the vehicle either with the same model or (if you can afford it) a nicer newer model. On trains, only replace the engine, not the entire unit., if it is not the largest vehicle (highest capacity) of its type, see if it is carrying full loads. If it is, investigate to see how many passengers are at each station; if the route has a high surplus, purchase the larger vehicle.

This method also works vice versa. If you have a larger vehicle not running full loads, downgrade to a smaller vehicle. These small techniques will help you ""cut the fat"" and save a large amount of money in the long run.

, Adapt your strategy to achieve that goal. For example, if they want 10,000 units of paper delivered, do not build passenger transportation. Instead, focus only on paper."

Before relying on a game theory decision, make a decision based on what information you have such as: the kick returner is at his top form today, or we should do an onside kick because the linemen are in (the hands and speed players are not in).,
Decide to use a game theory approach.,
Abstain from using the formation onside kick and use the surprise (no formation) onside kick to avoid telegraphing.

,
Quantify the directions, in this case ""might"" try an onside kick.,
Use your wristwatch's (or a wall clock) second hand as a randomizing device.

,
Divide the 12 numbers on the watch into two: the first set of numbers is from 1 to 50 seconds and the second set from 51 to 60.,
Assign 60% to your watch, like this: Do an onside kick if, when you suddenly look at your watch the second hand on 1 to 30 seconds (6/10 of the way through the first set).,
The decision making will be instantaneous after looking at your watch just once.,
If you do not understand, go through this second football example.",How to Use a Wristwatch As a Randomizing Device for Game Theory Decisions,";
, Be prepared for doing an onside kick from practices, your kicker has to be skillful, kick deep if the hands special team is in, and be prepared for the consequences if the onside kick fails.

,, Might quantified is a bit subjective, but for this example make it 60%. So, 60% of the time try an onside kick and hope for a turnover. Quantify the directions you follow and some words (also phrases) to quantify are: usually, mostly, always, sometimes, occasionally, rarely, should etc.

,, Since, time is in twelves but percentages is in tens, it would nice to have a watch with just 10 numbers, but this is not so.

, Also do an onside kick if the second hand was in the second set of numbers and on and between 51 seconds and 56 seconds (6/10 of the way between the second set).

, In some game situations, the decisions have to be made quick, and this method has you looking at your watch just once. Not acting predictably, puts uncertainty into the game and spreads the other team, amongst other things. Acting predictably is not good.

, You are basically a short yardage team and the defense is getting tough to beat. Make a plan to make a longer pass 10% of the time. This time when you look at your watch, if the second hand is on 1 to 5 seconds, or on the 51st second, pass longer. Going long 10% of the time will help spread the defense and make the short yardage work better. The decision has to be random and not methodical, for example going long every 10th play would be predictable.

Set up a gaga pit.,
Get a gaga ball.,
Learn the rules.,
Know how losing happens.,
Play until only one person is still in, then you start over, and that person serves.,
Use this strategy when you are a very good player.,
Try to hit the ball right after it bounces twice, and hit it at people.,
Seek to hang in there with this strategy.,
If people allow it, try turtling.,
Don't be where the ball is.,
Improve your reactions and try to practice your technique.,
Expect mixed results.,
Stand in a corner and hope people don't notice you.",How to Use Different Strategies for Playing Gaga Ball," It is hexagonal or octagonal standing 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) high. 1 wall is 2–3.5 feet (0.6–1.1 m) tall so people can get in and out. You can play with any number of people 2 or higher.;
, It shouldn't be especially hard; a volleyball or kickball will work.

, Everyone stands in the pit with at least one hand touching the wall. Anyone can serve it and he or she thrown it into the middle. After it bounces twice,  you can move anywhere in the gaga pit and hit the ball with your hands or any part of your body above your waist.

, There are many different ways to lose. If you get hit with the ball below your waist, you have to get out of the gaga pit or restart the game. Another way to get out is called ""double tap."" If someone hits the ball twice in a row before it bounces off a wall or another person, they are out. Another way to get out is hitting the gaga ball out of the pit. If the ball goes out of the pit, the last person to touch it gets out. The ball is then brought back in and served again. If you use the wall to jump, grabbing it and pulling yourself up, you are out. If you take your hand off the wall before the ball bounces twice, you are out. Lastly, if you pick up the ball, you are out., Now you know the rules to gaga ball.

, If you can hit the ball hard or skillfully, this approach is for you.

, Try to hit hard enough so if it misses, it bounces back to you, and you can try again. Hit the ball every which way and get the biggest threats out quickly. Hit hard, move fast.

, In the defensive strategy, the goal is to last as long as possible and in the final two, take advantage of the other person who probably used the offensive strategy and is worn out., This is hunching over in a corner and putting your hands in front of your legs. It is hard to get someone out who is doing that, except form a side. If the people you are playing with don't want to allow it, hunch and protect your legs. Then, when the other person is about to hit the ball at you, move around so they can't get a good shot. When you reach the final two, use the offensive strategy.

, The point of this is to dodge the ball so that it won't hit you, and you want to stay in as long as possible.

, Jump around a lot and run around the pit, so as to make it hard for the person to aim. Jump around until the last two. If you make it that far, use the offensive strategy or get the last person out.

, This is based entirely on luck and hope.

, Just hope the ball goes past you and doesn't hit you. When there is one person left, and he or she thinks he or she won, reveal yourself and face someone who has been working and is probably tired out when you are completely rested, having done nothing the whole game."

Use natural generation to find a nametag.,
Try fishing.,
Trade with villagers.,
Get an anvil.,
Go into the anvil, put your nametag in the topmost left slot.,
Hold the nametag in your hand then right click the mob you would like to rename.,
Find the Easter eggs.",How to Use a Nametag in the Minecraft PC Version," When your world generates, there will always be chests in dungeons and abandoned mineshafts There is a 54.0% chance of find one in a dungeon chest (pre 1.9, in 1.9+ there is a 29.0% chance of one spawning in a dungeon chest. There is a 42.3% chance of there being a name tag in a chest minecart within a mineshaft;
, Nametags can be caught when fishing as part of the treasure category

, Librarian villagers trade nametags for 20-22 emeralds a piece as part of their tier 6 trade.

, Once you have obtained a nametag you need to get an anvil as well as several experience levels to rename it. If you do not rename the nametag it will be useless until you name it in an anvil.

, Go to the top bar and delete the text saying ""Name Tag"" then write whatever you would like to name the mob. After you have written what name you want go to the topmost right slot and grab the nametag. You can now rename the animal.

, This mob will now have that name whenever you scroll over it. It will never despawn (the only exceptions are, if you rename a silver fish and it goes into a block, when you mine it a unnamed silverfish will come out).

, The developers have added three Easter eggs in. This means that when you name a particular mob a particular name, something cool will happen. These are:


If you name a rabbit ""Toast"", it will cause it to have a memorial skin in tribute of one of the developer's rabbit's Toast.
If you name any mob ""Dinnerbone"" or ""Grumm"", that mob will be rendered upside down.
If you name any sheep ""jeb_"", this will make it randomly change the colour of its wool, giving a rainbow effect. This will not affect the wool dropped on death or when sheared.

Prepare the wrestling position.,
Have the thumbs bow.,
Begin the wrestle.,
Pin down the thumb.",How to Thumb Wrestle," Both players should place their thumbs in mid-air, facing one another. With the right hand fingertips, grab your opponent's right hand fingertips and clasp tight together.;
, Start each game politely, showing respect for your opponent by bowing thumbs to one another. Yes, it's silly but it reflects the amusing nature of this mini-wrestle.


The bows traditionally follow the cadence of the verse ""One, two, three, four / I declare a thumb war!"" and occasionally ""Five, six, seven, eight / Try to keep your thumb straight!""

, Try to catch one another's thumbs. It sounds easier than it is. Once the wriggling and giggling commences, this game is anyone's!


It helps if you lie your thumb down and then go around you opponents thumb when they swoop down to press down
Use your thumb to your advantage

, The only way to win in this game is to pin down the opponent's thumb for a set count. A count of 5, at the same pace as counting seconds, is ideal. Any less is usually too easy. Another option is to follow the cadence of the verse ""One, two, three, four / I win the thumb war!""

Don’t worry too much about the rules.,
Let the kids play with you in whatever way is most appropriate and interesting to them as a way to build focus and attention.,
Appreciate the art, novelty, and fun of the game.,
Try taking turns.,
As you play and enjoy the game pieces, gradually introduce new concepts that will form the basis for the game rules.,
Break down more complicated games into stuff your child recognizes.,
When you think your child is ready and receptive, ask them if they want to learn a new way to play with the game.,
Take out any complicated or confusing rules that you don’t feel your child is ready for.,
Quit while you are still having fun.,
Praise ideas and creativity and problem solving more than luck and winning.",How to Teach Games to Kids," The point is to have fun with your kids. There is honestly lots and lots of time to learn “the right way"" to play the games, but first the kids have to learn to love playing them and get excited to try new games. Play games in front of your kids, and let them sit in your lap, hold your cards, move your pieces, pick a color or roll the dice, even if it’s only for 2 minutes as their marching band parades through the room. Show them that playing games together is a fun and valuable use of time.;
, Start by getting out all the pieces and taking some time to look them over.


The point is to sit with your kids and explore together, so don’t worry about losing pieces...you’ll be right there with them, right? If your kid destroys the pieces or puts things in their mouth, wait a while or invest in some of the high quality wooden games out there that have pieces that are too big to eat and too sturdy to destroy.
As you play, try saying things like “Wow, dice, what should we do with these?” or ask questions like “Which side of the card should we use?” or “How do we get these guys to stand up?” Let the kids be the problem solvers, even if their solutions aren’t what you would normally come up with.
It’s okay if they use dice to build towers or are more interested in the backs of the cards than the front. Just remember, if all you do is get a game box out, look at all the pieces with your kid, and put them back in the box, you haven’t failed! You’ve succeeded at starting them down a path of learning to love games.

, Get excited about the characters and feel free to play with the game like a toy. Watch what your kid likes to do with the pieces and use that insight to find good fits for future games. For example, if you get out Candy Land and your child just wants to match colors, then have fun matching colors with them, and store away that knowledge so that next time you can pull out a matching game like Memory instead.

, Whatever you are doing, try staggering it into ""your turn/my turn"" patterns. Make sure they don't have to wait very long to do something, because that’s not very fun even for patient, grown-up gamers.

, You can roll a die and say “Oh look, I got 4 spots on this die roll, what if I move this guy 4 spaces on this path? One-two-three-four.” Or, “Oh look, I have 4 of these stone cards, and no wheat. Do you want to trade one of your wheat cards for one of my stone cards?” Don’t push your kids to do the same, just model the ideas. Start introducing the actions and parameters that define the game in a fun way.


Try not to put emphasis on “right” and “wrong“ ways to play. It’s pretty natural to get excited when your child starts coming up with their own ways to play that are very similar to the “real rules”, but try not to get disappointed if all they want to do is play their own way.

, Come up with some fun mini-games using the game components that highlight some of the interactions and rules. For example, if your child knows how to play Memory and you want to teach them Settlers of Catan, you can play a memory matching game with the pieces.


Place all of the hex tiles face down in the shape of the island and take turns turning them over. Whenever you get a match, you collect a resource card of that type. You can use the resource cards to build roads, settlements, cities, and development cards (using the costs on the reference card from the game) and have a goal of being the first one to build one of each, or whatever else sounds fun. That way they are learning that the hex tiles correlate to resources, and that you get sets of resources to build stuff in the game. Then when you introduce the game, those basic concepts will form the foundation. You can go as far as you want with this, depending on your child’s age/skill/interest level/etc. Breaking the game down to its core mechanics will help your kids form a library of “game rules” that you can use when you are learning new games, and using those mechanics to help teach other games gives kids a chance to practice something they already know in a new context, while establishing new skills. Win-win!

, You can hype this as much or as little as is appropriate for your child. Some kids can’t wait to learn the “grown-up” rules, while some might not care. Take your time with it, play with lots of different games, and encourage your kids to make up their own rules too. Don’t be surprised if their rules don’t make sense to you, your rules probably don’t make much sense to them either. Try to incorporate as many examples from your “play time” with the game as possible. “Remember when you thought it would be cool to use stone cards to build a castle? Well in this game there are these cool pieces called cities that are kinda like castles, and they cost some stone to make. Pretty cool huh?” or “I really liked that rule you came up with about matching the colors on the cards to the colors on the board. In this game, you kinda do that too! But instead of putting your cards on the board, you move this little candy guy to the next space of that color, see how I’m doing it?” Kids learn and remember things better when they can connect it to prior experiences, and by activating those memories or ideas, you are helping them to build important connections as well as validating their own creativity.

, It’s okay to play games however you want, really. The designers don’t know you or your kids, and if you think it would be more fun some other way, then go ahead! You can always add in the more advanced rules later, or change the way you play altogether. Even if you somehow manage to play almost every game wrong the first few times, misread the rules, miss an important part, or just forget something all together, it would always turn out okay. You can relearn the rules the “right way” when you find out later, and your kids can too.

, You don’t have to play to the end. If your child loses interest, pack it up and be sure to thank them for playing with you. If a tantrum or other behaviors make the game unpleasant, then feel free to stop for that too. You can always take a break and leave it out to come back to when the child has calmed down/taken a nap/had a snack/ran three laps around the yard. Putting away a game with a screaming kid will leave a sour taste on the experience for both of you. Try to have a fun transition planned, and keep the experience positive whenever possible.

, It’s cool and fun when they roll a 6 or draw the card they needed, but it’s way cooler when they figure out how something works, play graciously, or come up with a clever move.

",How to Tickle Someone's Belly," Try your friend, sister, or maybe even your mom. Just make sure the victim is someone who is willing to be tickled.;
, A bed is a good idea, as it often provides a lot of room.

, Preferably, the victim should wear clothes which expose their belly, but you must make sure the victim is comfortable with what they are wearing.

,, Make sure you ask first as some people are sensitive about having their belly exposed.

,,, Move your fingers all over their belly, while lightly stroking intermittently.

, They are guaranteed to laugh because of the tingly sensation.

, If they have an outtie, you can tickle by drawing your nail in circles around it. If they have an innie, you can tickle by inserting your pinky into it and moving it around.

Play with at least two players.,

Continue asking and answering questions.,
Create a dilemma of two similar things.,
Try offering two good options.,
Try offering two bad options.,
Ask a question to the whole group.,
Set a time limit.,
Try the board game version.,
Get ideas for questions online.",How to Play Would You Rather," Choose at least one other player besides yourself to begin the game.


Play with more players for a livelier game, as more players can provide more unique questions and debate each other’s answers.
If you have a very large group of people, you can even play with teams, with all the members of a team having to come to a consensus on their answers.;
, Select the first player, who will choose a question that begins with “Would you rather…?” and provides two scenarios for another player to choose from.


Get creative with how you choose the first player if you want to. You can roll a die, go by the youngest player in the group, draw straws, or any other method.The “Would you rather” question can pair any two funny, serious, wacky, or thought-provoking scenarios together, such as “Would your rather have hands for feet or feet for hands?”
The first player asks his or her “Would you rather” question to another player of their choice, who then must answer the question.

, Pick one of the two scenarios you would “rather” do or have from the question asked by the current player. There are a number of different reasons you might have for answering one way or the other, but the choice is up to you!


Players might choose an answer just because it is the slightly more tolerable option of two undesirable things, like “be hairy all over” or “be completely bald all over.”
Players might also choose something they would genuinely enjoy due to their preferences, or something that strikes a moral or humorous debate with the other players.
No player that is asked a “Would you rather” question can answer “both” or “neither.” You must choose one of the two options given.

, The person that the first player asks a question to becomes the next player, choosing a new person to ask a question to.


Alternately, players may ask each question to the person beside them, or to the whole group. The latter may work best for smaller groups playing this game.
Play continues until players are out of ideas for questions, someone cannot choose an answer to a question, or for however long you like.

, Pose a question that compares two scenarios side-by-side, asking the player to choose one that they would hypothetically rather do.


For example, a question could be “Would you rather meet an alien visitor or travel to outer space?” or “Would you rather live one life that lasts 1,000 years or ten lives that last 100 years?”The goal is to make questions very difficult to answer, either because a player cannot choose between two things they’d like to do, or because both options are bad or uncomfortable and he or she wouldn’t want to do either.

, Use a tactic of asking questions that pair together two different scenarios that are generally desirable to people.


For example, you could ask a question about super powers or special abilities, like, “Would you rather have the ability to fly or to be invisible?” or “Would you rather be able to speak fluently every language in the world or be the best in the world at something of your choosing?”You can also provide a scenario that questions ethics, such as, “Would you rather end hunger or hatred?” or “Would you rather make headlines for saving somebody’s life or winning a Nobel prize?”, Make questions humorously uncomfortable for people by asking questions that pose two different scenarios that are in some way undesirable.


Come up with scenarios that would be physically uncomfortable and absurd, like “Would you rather wear a snow suit in the desert or be naked in Antarctica?” or “Would you rather be without elbows or be without knees?”Try a question that would be embarrassing for the other person, such as “Would you rather get caught singing in the mirror or spying on your crush?” or “Would you rather, on senior prom night, have to take your parent or your 12-year-old sibling?”, As a player asking a question, choose to ask it to the whole group instead of just one person.


You can also choose a different method of taking turns, such as the player always asking a question to the person to their left to continue play in a circular motion instead of picking new players at random.
Ask a question to the whole group if you want to get more opinions, or compare answers amongst everyone. The player asking the question can also answer it themselves!

, Give players a time limit for answering any question to help speed up the game and encourage split-second decisions.


Set a timer or flip a gaming hourglass to keep track of the time. The shorter the time period, the more pressure it places on players to give an answer even when they don’t want to.
Pick a penalty for any player who doesn’t answer in time, if you’d like. He or she can be considered “out” for the rest of the game, or have to answer three more questions in quick succession.

, Use a board game version of this game, which allows players to read pre-written questions off of cards and move through spaces on a playing board.


The goal for a board game would be to reach a finish line with pieces on a game board, or another objective of your choosing.
Whether or not you have the board game, try playing with this rule: have the player that asks a question have to guess what the majority answer of all the other players will be before they answer out loud, or have all players guess what one person will choose., Come up with new questions by consulting any number of websites with “Would you rather” example questions. These are useful if you’re stuck in thinking of your own or want appropriate questions for a certain playing group.


Try checking out a family-friendly list of questions if you’re playing with kids.You might also print out questions for kids for a long car ride or other occasion.Look for questions aimed specifically at adults if you’re playing with a more mature group."

Replace hard balls with softer balls.,
Get mini indoor versions of popular sports.,
Play hopscotch or foursquare.,
Get creative with your furniture.,
Think of indoor games that can be brought inside.",How to Turn Outdoor Games Into Indoor Games1," Harder balls, like baseballs, can be replaced with softer variations to prevent damage to the things inside your house. Consider replacing hard balls with balls that would be safer for indoor play, such as beach balls, balloons, or bean bags.Many toy companies sell softer, lighter variations of outdoor balls marketed towards younger children.
Even a crinkled piece of paper can double as a makeshift basketball.;
, Toy companies like Nerf produce small indoor basketball hoops. These hoops can be attached to a wall or the back of a door. Other indoor sports equipment include small soccer or hockey nets.Look online or go to the store and compare brands.


Most indoor equipment will come with age suggestions on the packaging., Games that require chalk to play, like four square or hopscotch, can be played inside using painter's tape. Instead of drawing the grid on the blacktop with chalk, use painters tape to draw a grid on hardwood or tiled floors. Once the kids are done playing, you can remove the tape, and it will be like it was never there.

, Furniture can represent different things if you use your imagination. For instance, if you're playing soccer inside, you can clear out a room and use two pieces of furniture to represent goal posts. Likewise, two chairs can become the goal posts for a game of nerf football. Think of other things that you can do with the items laying around in your house.


Be very careful when incorporating things into your indoor play. Don't pick anything that can easily get knocked over or shatter.
A trash bin can become a basketball hoop.
Furniture can become cover in a nerf gun fight.

, Other games that are played outdoors can be brought inside with almost no alteration to the game itself. Things like jump rope, hula hooping, obstacle courses, darts, or a paper plane competition can be brought indoors."

They are most vulnerable, after work, church, or walking to their car. Feel free to memorize their schedule to find them at any and all times. Spork them.;
, Fork their lawn, with sporks. Hide near by and drop them an anonymous text about their sporked lawn. When they come outside... a) if they don't have their spork on them, spork them right then. b) When they go to clean up the ""forks"" they will really then be holding 2 sporks. Spork them.

, Go behind your sporkee, and throw a spork in their sweatshirt hood. They will wonder what random object you put in their hood, and when they reach back to get it, they will be holding two sporks. Spork them.

, If it is someone's birthday, or if you are in school and need to bring in food, this is an opportunity. This can work for most foods, but this example is for cake. Cut the pieces out and put them on paper plates with forks like always, only place the fork in the cake so you can't see the top of it. Stick a spork in your victim's cake, and when they reach for their cake, they now have two. Spork them.

, Put the spork in a backpack pocket of your victim, or in their folder. When they accidentally hold it and or reach for it, spork them.

, Get a freshman or younger kid to hold a spork, and go up to your victim saying ""you dropped this."" Their first instinct will be to just grab it, and that's where you will be standing right behind them as they take the second spork. Spork them.

Make enough space in a room for your children to play.,
Remove any dangerous or sharp obstacles that may harm the kids.,
Consider laying down soft mats.,
Set up equipment that they may need.",How to Turn Outdoor Games Into Indoor Games2," Consider the number of kids playing indoors and try to accommodate enough space for them to move around and have fun. Move furniture around and try to find a larger room in your house.


A living room or basement are two ideal locations indoor play.
Electronic equipment should be moved.

, Sharp corners, edges, utensils, or tools should be eliminated from the rooms involving indoor play. Remove objects that can break or shatter from shelves, and be careful to choose a room that doesn't have windows or mirrors that could break.Lit candles or open flames should be put out before the kids start playing.

, If your children are going to be playing on hardwood floors, it may be a good idea to lay down mats in case they fall. You can purchase playmats made specifically for younger children, or purchase wrestling mats online and at larger department stores. Mats can prevent injuries and broken bones if the indoor game gets too physical., Set up any basketball hoops or inflate any balls that the kids need to play. Some equipment may be complicated, and require you to construct it before it's useable. Set the equipment in a clean and safe environment.

Be assertive when explaining the rules.,
Set limits on how physical the games can get.,
Teach the children what they should do in case of an emergency.,
Be present and available for the children's needs.",How to Turn Outdoor Games Into Indoor Games3," Have rules in mind before talking to the children about the indoor play. Set up rules that will ensure their safety and allow them to have fun. It's important that the children stick to the rules. If the children don't want to follow the rules, their safety is at risk and you should tell them that they can't play anymore.Good rules include only using the designated room, sticking to the designating play items, and a restriction on running in the house.
You can say something like ""I set up the basement for playing. Do not go into the side room and follow the rules that we talked about. If you don't want to follow the rules, I won't allow you to play anymore, and I'll take away the basketball hoop.""
Don't make exceptions or bend the rules or else you children will try to push their limits in the future.

, Explain the importance of safety to your children. Even though they are playing, they need to tone down their physicality when inside. Roughhousing could result in breaking something, or worse yet, hurting one of the kids.


You can say something like, ""Okay, this mini football game is touch only! Do NOT push down your brothers or sisters, okay?""

, Create a plan that your children can follow in case they get into an emergency when playing indoors. This could include a cell-phone number that you provide or the protocol on what to do if something, such as someone getting hurt. If you aren't going to be home, make sure to leave them a list of emergency numbers in case something goes wrong.


Communicate with the kids via text if you aren't going to be home. It may be easier to do this unless there is an emergency.
If you aren't going to be home, make sure that there is a neighbor that can help your kids in emergency situations., Being present and attentive is the best way to avoid an accident, and to provide the best indoor play to your children. Listen to what they have to say about how much they enjoy the games, and consider providing alternatives if the kids seem bored or uninterested. While you want the space to be safe, you also want it to be a fun and engaging environment for the kids.

, Try layer-by-layer or block building methods. Keep practicing, and eventually you will be able to solve it in a minute or two. You just have to keep solving and figuring out different ways to solve the cube.

, Speedcubes are cubes, well, designed for speed. They can be turned very fast, the layers can be misaligned and still turned very well. Basically, these cubes will feel heavenly compared to your 4-year-old Rubik's Brand. A good first speedcube is the Moyu Guanlong. It's cheap and still performs very well. Another more pricey but popular choice is the Dayan Zhanchi. Buy speedcubes online.

, At first, it will feel extremely fast, especially if you've been using a Rubik's Brand or another speedcube. Breaking a cube in is basically solving and playing with it until it's reached it's full (or close to full) potential. To break it in, just keep solving it, turning it, etc.

, Any silicone based lube is good, just don't use Vaseline or WD-40 or any other oil based lube, as it will eat away at the plastic and make your cube unusable. You can find a few good lubing tutorials on YouTube.

, At official cubing competitions, the WCA (basically the NBA of cubing) uses those SpeedStacks timers for cubing. If you have one of those, then use it to time your solves. If you don't own one, however, then just use a program on your computer. Some good sites for timers are qqtimer.net, and cstimer.net.

, Keep practicing using your new speedcube, get a feel for it. Get your solves more efficient, try to not pause for long periods of time while solving, and turn faster. That's about all the tips I can give you for this step. Keep practicing, and eventually, you'll be able to solve the cube in under a minute.

, Does improving give you a sense of achievement? Is it a skill that impresses people? Is it relaxing? If you get any positive feelings from cubing, then keep going! If ever since the start, you've been frustrated and bored, then stop. You obviously don't enjoy it, so why should you keep going? Remember that bad times and slow improvement is normal; don't get discouraged from just a few slow times.

, Chances are, you've probably been using a beginner's method. This method isn't very move-efficient or fast, so if you want to keep getting faster, choose a faster method. Four of the most popular methods are called the ""Big Four"". They consist of CFOP, Roux, Petrus, and ZZ. Here is a brief introduction to all 4 methods:


CFOP (or Fridrich) - This is the most popular method, and so far the fastest (but not the most efficient). CFOP is an acronym, standing for Cross, F2L, OLL, and PLL. Basically, you solve a cross on any side of the cube and then place it on the bottom, complete 2 layers at the same time, solve the color of the top face, then solve the rest of the cube. The current World Champion, Feliks Zemdegs, uses this method. Chances are, the method you've been using when you learned how to solve the cube is probably a simplified version of this method. If it is, then this is probably the best choice. It's easy to understand, and a lot of it is algorithm-based, so not THAT much thought is required. 
Roux - Invented by Gilles Roux, it is the second most popular method. This is an example of a block building method, which is more intuitive, meaning it requires more thought and improvisation. Basically, you build 2 blocks on 2 opposite sides of the cube, orient and position 4 of the corners at the top of the cube, then solve the centers and edges. A famous Roux solver is Alexander Lau, who is also extremely fast. Though it may not be as popular as Fridrich/CFOP, it is more efficient move-wise, and definitely has the same potential to be extremely fast. The reason you don't see many records broken with it is because it's not used by many, though that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it. If you don't really like layer by layer methods, try block building methods, and chances are you might like it better. 
Petrus - Another not that common method, though still most efficient and intuitive out of the 4. It was invented by Lars Petrus. Basically, you solve a 2x2x2 block, expand it, orient the 7 remaining edges, solve the first 2 layers, and solve the last layer. This is a very move-efficient method (45-55 moves), very intuitive, so it requires a minimal amount of algorithms. If memorization's really not your thing, give this method a try.
ZZ - Probably the least used method, but can still be very fast (all these methods can get to the same speed). It involves orienting all the edges in one step, solving the first two layers, and then solving the last layer with 1-4 algorithms. Once you get really serious with this method, you can learn up to 493 algorithms for the cube. The reason this method is so good is because you don't have nearly as many algorithms to learn (unless you want to be at a world class speed), it can be very good for one-handed solving (yes, that's a thing). A notable ZZ user is Phil Yu, who is one of the fastest one handed solvers, and uses ZZ. He is the owner of the cubicle.us, one of the most popular cubing stores.

, I'll leave some good tutorials in the sources section. Keep practicing and getting faster. As you get faster, perfect your solutions, make your solves efficient, increase your turns per second, maybe get a faster cube. Try bigger cubes, like the 4x4 or 5x5. Try different puzzles, like the Pyraminx or Megaminx. Just keep practicing 3x3, and all your other events will get faster (eventually you will need to practice them separately and more in depth, though).

, A very significant milestone is trying to get under 20 seconds. At this point, you really need to think about the flaws of your solve. Chances are, you're probably turning very fast, then pausing, then repeat. This is very bad. Try turning slower, track the pieces you're going to solve next.

, Chances are, the speedcube you have now will eventually wear out and you'll need to get a new one (cubes these days can usually last around 7,500-10,000 solves). The following are good second or third speedcubes:


Moyu Aolong V1/V2 - This is a good cube if you are around the 20 second mark or beyond. It is fast, but controllable, and was one of the most popular cubes at a certain point (and still is in some cases). Many records were broken/nearly broken with this cube.
Gans 356 - This cube is about the same speed as an Aolong, and the turning is buttery smooth, with good corner cutting. This cube is extremely good, though it is quite pricey (around 20 dollars). Feliks Zemdegs, the 2013 world champion, currently uses this as his main 3x3 cube.
Dayan Zhanchi - This cube was revolutionary at its time, and it set a new standard for speedcubes. Even though it is a few years old, this cube can be made to work for almost anyone, including beginners to world class speedcubers, just like the Aolong. The former world record single by Mats Valk (5.55 seconds) was set with this cube.

, You're a speedcuber, and usually this means you will try to cube competitively. You don't need to be a sub-9 solver to compete in a competition, you can attend no matter how fast you are. Competitions are a great place to meet people with the same hobby as you, you can make new friends, beat your own personal records, and overall have a good time. Competing is nothing to stress over, it's mainly for fun.

, The governing body of cubing is the World Cube Association. They hold official competitions and record times of every competitor. You can check for competitions in your area by going to the WCA website and searching for competitions in your city/state.

, When registering, you'll need to choose events to compete in. After you choose the events, you'll usually need to pay a registration fee, either online or at the door of the venue for the competition. Here is a list of all WCA events (note that usually not all these events will be held at a single competition):


3x3 speedsolve - Competitors solve a 3x3 cube as quickly as they can.
2x2 speedsolve - Competitors solve a 2x2 cube as quickly as they can.
4x4 speedsolve - Competitors solve a 4x4 cube as quickly as they can.
5x5 speedsolve - Competitors solve a 5x5 cube as quickly as they can. This is the first big cube event.
6x6 speedsolve - Competitors solve a 6x6 cube as quickly as they can. This is a big cube event.
7x7 speedsolve - Competitors solve a 7x7 cube as quickly as they can. This is a big cube event.
3x3 One-Handed (OH) - Competitors solve a 3x3 cube as quickly as they can with only one hand.
3x3 Blindfolded (3BLD) - Competitors memorize a 3x3 cube and solve the cube blindfolded as quickly as they can (memorization time included).
3x3 Fewest Moves - Competitors have 1 hour to come up with a solution to the 3x3 cube in as few moves as possible.
3x3 with Feet - Competitors solve a 3x3 cube with their feet as quickly as they can.
Square-1 - Competitors solve the Square-1 puzzle as quickly as they can.
Pyraminx - Competitors solve the Pyraminx as quickly as they can.
Skewb - Competitors solve the Skewb as quickly as they can.
Megaminx - Competitors solve the Megaminx as quickly as they can.
Rubik's Clock - Competitors solve the Rubik's Clock as quickly as they can.
4x4 Blindfolded (4BLD) - Competitors memorize a 4x4 and solve it blindfolded as quickly as they can.
5x5 Blindfolded (5BLD) - Competitors memorize a 5x5 cube and solve it blindfolded as quickly as they can.
3x3 Multiple Blindfolded - Competitors memorize multiple (their own choice of number of cubes) 3x3 cubes and solve them all at once blindfolded. The goal is to get as many cubes solved in the shortest time possible.

, Before a competition, you'll usually want to practice a bit more than you're used to. For example, if you usually practice 30-45 minutes a day, you'll want to practice for about an hour in the days one week before the competition.

, This is something a lot of new competitors just skip over, though it is very important. Once you go to a competition and you don't know the rules and regulations, there is a higher chance you'll accidentally do something you're not supposed to without knowing it. You don't need to memorize the regulations word for word, you can just skim over it quickly, so you get a basic idea of the rules.

, Usually, at your first competition, you'll be very nervous. When you're up and solving, just forget that you're at the competition, and pretend you're at home, in your room, solving just as you would normally. Meet new people there, race each other, or just have a casual conversation. Cubing competitions are supposed to have a very friendly atmosphere, which is what makes the cubing community so great. The competing part of competitions is mainly just to test your limits and to break your personal records. The bigger part is making friends and socializing with the people who enjoy doing the same thing you do.

, If you want to check your results, it's pretty easy. Once you go to your first competition, the WCA will give you a personal public profile, where all your times and world/national/continental rankings will be posted. To check your profile, just go to the persons search on the WCA website and search up your name.

Make sure you have all of the pieces you need to play Tiddlywinks.,
Understand the game’s object.,
Use the right squidger.,
Choose a partner if you want.,
Start with a squidge-off.,
Time the game.,
Begin play.,
Pot out.,
Be strategic.,
Handle squopped winks right.",How to Play Tiddlywinks," These should be in the game itself upon purchase, and you will need all of them to play it right.Winks are small plastic discs that you try to get into the pot. The squidger is a larger piece of round, thicker plastic that you use to propel smaller discs into the pot. Winks come in yellow, red, green, and blue. There are 6 winks of each color.
The pot is the container that you try to put the winks into. The mat is basically the playing field. It’s usually 6 feet by 3 feet. Place the mat on a flat surface in order to play. The mat has lines etched on both ends. This indicates the field’s boundaries and baselines. The mat is usually made of felt.;
, The goal of Tiddlywinks is to propel as many winks into the pot as you can.


You can either play Tiddlywinks in two-person teams or against another player. It’s also possible to play the game with three people. Only 2 to 4 people can play Tiddlywinks.
The verb “to squidge” means you propel or flick the smaller plastic discs toward (and hopefully into) the pot using the squidger.
The way you squidge a wink is by putting your squidger on a wink. Apply pressure to it, and it should pop the wink forward. It can be difficult to squidge a wink when someone else’s wink is on it. The wink below another wink is said to be “squopped.” You must only touch the top wink in your color sequence. If all the winks are squopped, the game is over.

, Some people sandpaper their squidger down. This will make it so they have less sharp edges.


Some people use different size squidgers for different shots. Squidgers must be round and between 25 mm and 51 mm across and no thicker than 5 mm.
They cannot damage the winks. You may only use one per play. However, you can use different squidgers throughout the course of a game.

, Partners use blue and red winks or they use green and yellow winks. Once you have a partner, you should stand diagonally across from your partner on the mat’s opposite corners. Blue winks are put in the corner diagonally positioned across from red; the same is true of green and yellow.If you’re playing in a team, each player should take one of the two colors of the pairs above. Team play in Tiddlywinks is called “pairs.”
If you just playing against another person, one player will use blue and red winks and the other green and yellow winks. This is called “singles.”It’s possible to play with three people. In that instance, one of the people controls both colors and the other two each control one other color.

, This means that you see whose winks get closest to the pot or into it. If yours makes it into the pot or is closest, you get to start.


Place the pot in the middle of the mat. Place the winks behind the baselines. Each corner of the mat should contain winks of only one color. Arrange the colors clockwise in alphabetical order from the English language (blue first, and then green, etc.) Tiddlywinks turns then move in clockwise rotation after the squidge-off.
Play a wink of each color from behind the baseline in the direction of the pot. You always want to make sure you stay behind the baseline when you play a wink. The wink in or closest to the pot is the winner. Then, put the winks back behind the baseline.

, Generally, games of Tiddlywinks last 20 minutes for single matches and 24 minutes for pairs. Start the clock after the squidge-off.


The game can end before the time runs out, though, if someone squidges all the winks of their color into the pot. Games with three players usually run 22.5 minutes.
You can also choose to play until all winks are potted. There is usually a round limit period after the ending of the time period if all the winks are not potted. That means you continue playing until the turn of the color that won the squidge off. Five further rounds of the color are played, with each ending after the turn of the color that won the squidge-off.

, Start with the color that won the squidge-off. The colors take turns in alphabetical order of the English language. Use the squidger to propel the winks toward the pot when it is your turn.


If you get the wink inside the pot, that is called a potted wink. If the wink stops on all or part of another wink, the top wink is the squopping wink and the lower wink is the squopped wink.
Winks that are not potted or squopped are called free winks. When it is your turn in the clockwise rotation, see how close you can flip one of your color’s Tiddlywinks toward the pot. Be careful. If you send it off the mat, you lose your turn. If you get your color in the pot, you get another shot.
If a person’s shot causes a wink of the same color to go off the mat, the next shot with that color is forfeited.

, Potting out means you empty out the pot to see how many winks are inside of it. You “pot out” if all of your winks are in the pot.


If all six winks of a single color are potted, that color is “potted out.” The person controlling that color then wins the game. If you pot out, you also get an extra point and your opponents score one less point.
If all of the colors are not potted when the time runs out, add up the score for each color. Every potted wink is three points. Every uncovered wink is one point. Squopped and unplayed winks don’t count. So, for example, if blue has 3 potted winks and 2 free, the score is 11. If yellow has 4 winks in a pot and 1 free, the total is 13.
The top scorer gets 4 points, the second scorer gets 2 and the third gets 1 point.

, Tiddlywinks is not just blind luck when it’s played well. Some people will squop another person’s Tiddlywinks in order to stop another person who has potted colors.


For example, if a player has five of his color in the pot but the sixth is squopped, he or she can’t do anything until his or her partner frees it up.
There are many possible game plans, but a standard strategy is to try to build an area of friendly winks close to the pot, and to squop as many enemy winks as possible. Trying to put winks in the pot too early may end in disaster as your remaining playable winks become captured.
Hold the squidger with a firm but relaxed grip. Hold it high up so your fingers don’t get in the way of the flick. Place the edge of the squidger on the middle of the wink, about 45 degrees to it., You cannot play a squopped wink. This means that a wink is covered even a tiny bit by another wink. You can, however, play the top wink of any pile if it is yours and follow through to any wink directly under it.If someone pots out, the time limit no longer matters. The game continues until all winks of a partnership are in the pot. All squops must be squidged. Covering winks are moved to 2mm away from all other winks. Play continues in the regular order. First color to pot out wins.
To play a squopped wink, you first play the upper surface of the unsquopped wink. Winks vertically below the wink you first touch can be hit by the squidger. The shot has to be short and continuous from start to finish. You could play a pile shot in which you send the enemy wink far away. This is called a boondock.

Make sure that you have 2 or 3 players.,
Pick your playing field.,
Unfold the mat and spread it out on the floor.,
Assemble the Twister spinner.,
Dress comfortably.,
Take off your shoes, even if you're outside.,
Limber up.",How to Play Twister1," You will also need one person to serve as the referee, spinning the needle and calling out hand and foot positions.


If you have more than four people at your Twister party, you may need to rotate out players, each round, so that everyone gets a change to twist. Consider setting up ""stations"" with separate games so that the non-players have something to do.;
, Choose a spacious, flat, and well-lit area: a living room floor, a deck, or a patio.


Make sure that you have enough space to accommodate flailing limbs, wacky poses, and falling players.
You can play Twister indoors or outdoors. Take weather conditions into account--a bit of rain can quickly turn the Twister mat into a mini-Slip'N Slide.

, Make sure that the surface is reasonably flat. The face-up side of the mat should be white, covered in red, yellow, blue, and green spots--24 spots in all.









Smooth out the wrinkles. The Twister mat will likely slide around and bunch up over the course of the game--this is normal.
Consider using shoes, books, or other small, dense objects to hold the corners of the mat in place.This is especially important if you are playing outside, where the wind may blow the edges of the mat mid-game. Avoid using objects with sharp edges, like bricks.

, This is a square board with ""left foot"", ""right foot"", ""left hand"", and ""right hand"" in its corners. Press the center of the black spinning needle into the hole in the center of the board.









You should be able to spin the black needle cleanly, without friction, such that it makes several revolutions around the spinner board. The needle should stop, eventually, pointing into one of the (left/right foot/hand) corners.
If this particular Twister set has been used before, the spinner may already be assembled. If it spins, then you're good to go.

, Wear loose, flexible clothing that will allow you to stretch. You don't want to rip your pants in the middle of a party!









Loose shorts, yoga pants, or sweatpants are great. Wear something breathable.
Take off any heavy jackets or stiff layers before you play. Extra layers will constrict your movement, and extended stretching may tear your clothes.
If you have long hair, consider putting your hair up with a hair-tie or a headband before you play. If your hair falls into your eyes while you are bending over, it may impede your playing.

, All players should remove their shoes before stepping onto the Twister mat.









This will keep the mat clean and reduce the risk of stepping on other players' toes.
Socks are fine. Bare feet are fine.

, If you aren't used to contorting your body into unnatural positions, consider stretching before you play Twister. If you loosen up your muscles before you play, you will be able to hold poses longer--and boost your chances of winning!









Bend forward, keeping your legs straight, and reach for your toes. Hold the position for at least ten seconds.
Twist your torso slowly to the right, as far as you can go, then slowly to the left. Hold each pose for at least ten seconds.

The story is like a visual novel/point and click-type game where players will be able to read, watch, and listen to the event as the whole story unfolds.;
, The vast majority of this game is based around talking and making decisions while you are talking. Many of these decisions are very important, and will influence how the game pans out and what happens in the future episodes.

, This can also help you understand the situation if you get stuck.


If you are given the opportunity to make a decision, choices will appear on your screen with a timer bar below.
Make a choice before the time runs out or the story may continue with Lee remaining silent. You may also select the ""..."" option to refuse to say anything. Keep in mind that how the game progresses depends on your choices, so being silent may not always be to your advantage. Silence can come in handy if you're unsure what to say, though it may anger the character you're speaking with.
The answers could be placed in a randomized position on each playthrough. This is not so on the Kindle version.
You will usually get a choice to select a “Good Karma” answer, a “Bad Karma” answer, a neutral answer, and the option to answer with silence (""...""). If you have the HUD turned on, a message will sometimes pop up in the upper left corner of your screen after you make a choice, notifying you that ""(character) will remember that"". Characters may react to you or treat you differently depending on what you say to them, so choose wisely.

, The controls of this game are pretty simple, but also require good timing. Parts of the game where you will need to utilize time include killing walkers (zombies), avoiding attacks, selecting which character to save, and even conversing with your fellow survivors.

, To move the cursor around, you simply use the mouse for the computer user and right control stick for console users. Tap what you want to select on mobile and Kindle versions. Tapping also applies to the various buttons described below.

, To move Lee, use the Left control stick for the console and arrow pad for the computer. On mobile or Kindle versions, drag your finger or stylus along the screen.


A button is the primary interaction button such as opening doors, attacking, picking things up, etc.

, Approach the person, then press the X button; this also allows you to know more about their thoughts.


B button is the secondary interaction button for breaking down doors or windows instead of opening it.
Y button is to examine an object or person, allowing you to hear Lee's opinion on what he sees.

, Start button is to pause the game; use ESC for the computer users. On mobile and Kindle versions, you will see a button in the upper right corner of your screen.

, You can change the control keys in the Option menu. Simply press ESC to see the settings and then assign keys to your preference.

, As mentioned above, there are parts of the game that require you to fight zombies or defend the other survivors. If you fail to fight off the zombie, you will end up with a short game over cutscene and will have to start over from the beginning of the panic event. Lee has a unique death cutscene for each panic event.


The tap button mode is when a button appear on the bottom of the screen and you must tap that button repeatedly as fast as you can. When you've tapped it enough, it will then quickly switch to a different button (e.g., A changed to X), and you should press the button repeatedly until you have escaped the danger. In the mobile and Kindle versions, this mechanic is changed to sliding your finger in the direction that an onscreen arrow indicates.
If you are too slow or press the wrong button, you will fail the panic event and die. You will then have to start over from the beginning of the panic event.

, There are instances that the zombie gets too close and you cannot move. It’s typical of a horror game for a zombie to grab your character's leg for more thrill. In this part, you have to kick it in the face before it gets to you.


Players are required to aim at the zombie or enemy first before you can actually kick them off. On mobile or Kindle versions, a reticle will appear, indicating where to tap. X button is usually used for this mechanic since that triggers the action. Failure to kick in time will result in a game over.

, In the middle of the story, you will be able to acquire items that can be used as a weapon. There are zombies that can be only defeated using certain items, so it's best to explore a certain area before leaving it.


Missing an important item may make prevent progressing to the next part.
To use an item, simply choose the item icon when you point the game cursor at the desired location. You can use items on walkers or other items in the overworld.
In some situations, you may have to crawl or walk away to escape walkers pursuing Lee. To survive this type of panic event, simply outrun or outcrawl the walker until a different action can be taken.
If you're unsure with the decision, or regret a decision after you've made it, you can always reload the game and try again.

, There are parts of the game where you will not be under the immediate threat of zombies. For the duration of these parts, you must do certain things in order to progress, such as exploring every area to uncover bits and pieces of the story.


You can gather information, read notes, gather food, and even find weapons if you explore properly. You are almost always required to collect all items in any given scene to progress. In certain cases, however, discovering everything is optional and not required to progress to the next part of the story.
There are chances to stumble into a small event, such as eavesdropping into someone's conversation, if it pertains to the story.
Do everything you think is possible, such as give the food you find to your allies or sit next to them and talk. Eventually, you will hear more of their side and gain objectives for your next mission.

, Using Lee, you have the option to come off as strongly to one side, strongly to the other, or neutral. This is affected by the choices that you make, in addition to affecting your relationship with Clementine.


Whether or not Clementine is your Lee's first priority is your decision.
Every decision you make may or may not hold consequences, so take care if you don't want somebody to be unhappy with you.
Choose what you believe is right, then move on. This game is tailored to your choices. Though the first season always has the same ending, how you get there is entirely up to you.
There really is no right or wrong choice in this game. The game's setting presents a moral grey area, so be confident in the choices that you make.

Have all the players except one sit in a circle.,
Each player must name some object.

,
When all have been asked, the thinker announces what her thought was and each in turn must prove the resemblance between his answer and the thought.,
Change thinkers.",How to Play What Is My Thought," The player not in the circle is the ""thinker"" and thinks of something. Standing in the middle of the circle, the thinker asks each player in turn: ""What is my thought like?"";
,,


Suppose the thought is a stove, and player 1 says: ""Like the sun."" Player 2, ""Like silver,"" then the second time around player 1 can say: ""A stove is like the sun because they both give heat;"" player 2 can say: ""A stove is like silver because they both shine when well polished, and so on.


, The person who has the best connections between the object and the thought becomes the next thinker, as judged by all the players.

"
"
Choose one person to serve as the referee.,
Step onto the mat.,
Spin the needle.,
Place your right








For example: say you are standing with your right foot on a blue spot and your left foot on a yellow spot, and the referee calls out, ""Right hand, red!"",
Try not to fall.",How to Play Twister2," The referee will spin the spinner, call out the moves, and supervise the game.









Remember to switch off so that everyone gets a chance to play. Some players may prefer to spend more time on the mat, while others may be content to sit back and call the shots.
If you only have two people--not enough for two players and a referee--you can play without a spinner. On each ""spin"", count to three: one player calls out the color and the other player calls out the body part. Alternate who calls what.

, Remember to remove your shoes. The referee should keep off the mat.









For two players: Players should face each other from opposite ends of the mat, near the word ""Twister"". Place one foot on the yellow circle and the other foot on the blue circle closest to your end of the mat. Your opponent does the same on his or her end.
For three players: Two players face each other on opposite ends of the mat, near the word ""Twister"". Each player places one foot on the yellow circle and the other foot on the blue circle closest to his or her end of the mat. The third player faces the center from the red-circle side of the mat, placing one foot on each of the two middle red circles., The referee spins the needle, and then calls out the color and body part on which the needle lands. All players must obey this direction.









For example: ""Right foot, green!"" or ""Left hand, blue!""

, You must bend down to your right, keeping your feet where they are, and touch one of the red circles with your right hand.
Do not move any body part until the spinner says so. You may lift a limb, briefly, to allow another limb to pass by, but you must immediately place it back upon the circle from which it came.If you are already touching a color with the limb that has been called, you must move your limb to another circle of the same color.
No two players can touch the same spot at the same time--so make your moves wisely! If two players do reach for the same circle, the referee must decide who got there first.

, If a player falls, or lets an knee or an elbow touch the mat, he or she is eliminated from the round. The last player standing wins the round.









Players should only ever touch the mat with their hands and feet.
Remember to switch roles each round so that the referee gets a turn on the mat. Consider making a rule: the first person to fall has to be the referee next round!

"
"
Stay balanced.,
Crowd your opponent toward the edge of the mat.,
Let your opponents defeat themselves.",How to Play Twister3," You want to be the last one standing. When you touch a circle, do not over-reach; you never know how long you will have to wait before moving a given body part, so make sure that you are comfortable in your pose.


Keep your legs planted firmly, if possible, and do not spread them too widely.
Stay close to your center of mass. Do not lean too far in any direction; make your movements close to your torso, and assess your balance before you definitively place your hand onto a spot.

, When you place your hand or foot on a color, choose the circle that is closest to your opponent. Over time, this will reduce the number of circles that he can easily reach.









Be careful not to physically push another player off the mat. Use the space that your body takes up to block your opponent's own movements.

, If you can take up a lot of space, retain your balance, and outlast the other players, you may be able to keep the game going until everyone else loses their balance.









Be patient, be a good sport, and have fun. Twister doesn't need to be about winning--it can be a great opportunity to laugh at yourself!

Give the hint.,
Let the child guess the name of the object.,
Advance to using two or more objects.",How to Play the I Spy Game," You need a minimum of two players to play I spy, but otherwise there's no limit on how many people can play a game. Players are old enough to play when they have an understanding of the world around them and can easily name everyday objects.;
, For each round of I spy, there is one person who is the spy. That person selects an object and has to get the other players to guess what the object was based on a clue.There are many ways you can determine who gets to be the first spy. For instance, you can draw cards or straws, ask whose birthday is coming up next, go by whose name is alphabetically first or last, or even have an outside person who isn't playing randomly select the first spy.
In another variation on the game, the spy is instead called the king or queen bee., As the first spy, your job is to pick an object from your immediate surroundings that all the players can see. But once you’ve picked it, don’t say what it is!Instead, think about the object to yourself, and come up with a few features and characteristics that make this object noteworthy.


If you're in a moving vehicle, you will have to work quickly, otherwise the object will have passed before anyone else has a chance to see it.

, In order to get players to guess the object you’ve chosen, you have to provide them with a piece of information about the object. Use those noteworthy features you came up with and think about what you can say that will hint to your fellow players what object you're thinking of. Good adjectives to use can relate to the object’s:


Color
Height
Weight
TextureGeometric featuresFirst letter
Material
A word that it sounds like

, In this game, the spy uses the phrase “I spy with my little eye, something that…” and the then finishes that hint with the descriptor or adjective chosen to describe the object. For instance, if you picked a purple hat that a nearby person was wearing, you could finish with “something that you wear.”


When you say the hint out loud, be sure you aren't looking right at the object!Another variation on the hint phrasing is “I spy something and it’s designed to keep you warm,” for instance.
For the bumblebee game, you can say “Bumble Bee Bumble Bee, I see something you don't see, and the color of it is purple,” for example., Once you’ve provided the hint, give the other players a chance to look around and find the object. Then, go around the group and give each player a chance to guess what object you chose.


I spy is usually played with yes or no answers (players ask if specific objects were the chosen ones and the spy says yes or no), but the spy can also provide additional hints to the players by saying whether the guess was hot or cold.
If a guess was close to or similar to the chosen object, the spy says the guess was warm (close) or hot (very close). If a guess was nowhere near the object, the spy says cold, or cool if the guess was mostly off.

, If none of the players are able to guess the object, repeat the phrase and provide another hint. Choose a different adjective this time, and concentrate on a different feature.


For instance, if your hint before told the players what color the object was, provide a hint about something else, like the object’s material, shape, or texture., Go around in the same order and let each player guess again. When a player does guess correctly, that player becomes the new spy, and the game begins anew.


If nobody is able to guess the object, you can either provide another hint, or the spy role can automatically pass to a new player.
If all the players are young and not able to easily guess, consider having a set order in which everyone gets to be the spy., I spy is a great way for parents and educators to teach younger children about letters and the names of different objects. To start, settle down somewhere that you can place objects in front of the child.


In order for this game to work, the child needs to have already begun learning the names of different objects, because the game is used to reinforce that knowledge.

, Pick a household object, such as a toy, utensil, or stuffed animal whose name the child has learned. Place the object down in front of the child on the mat, floor, or tray.In this version of the game, the object isn't to get the child to guess what object you’ve chosen, but rather to encourage the child to come up with the name of the object you’ve put down.
This game also works for older children who are in the process of learning a new language, and the game can be used as a learning exercise for foreign words.

, Just like if you were playing with older children, say the rhyme to give the hint. For this version of the game, focus on letters, and specifically the first letter of the object. As the child progresses and gets better with names and spelling, you can try going by the last letter of the object too. For instance:


“I spy with my little eye, something that starts with the letter S” for a spoon
“I spy something and it ends with the letter G” for a toy dog

, This game only works with familiar objects because the child already has to have learned what the objects are in order to be able to name them.


If the child needs some more help, begin sounding out the name of the object one letter at a time. For the word “spoon,” for example, sound out just sp first, then ""spoo"", until the child is able to come up with the word., As the child advances, you can progress to placing two or three objects down. Choose one particular object that you want the child to identify and name, and then say the rhyme and give the beginning letter. Make sure all the objects start with a different letter.


Another advanced version is to lay down five or six objects, two or three of which start with the same chosen letter, and have the child identify and name all the objects that start with that letter.
As the child’s perception improves, you can stop placing objects down and start using objects in the immediate environment."

Learn the three basic rules of the Game.,
Give up the idea of winning.,
Learn about the background of Game psychology.,
Consider adding variations to the Game to make it winnable.,
Draw attention to the Game as much as possible.,
Always announce when you lose.,
Remind other players about the Game.,
Post about the Game online.,
Try to think about other things.,
Avoid ""triggers"" as much as possible.,
Never let your guard down.",How to Play The Game (Mind Game)," The Game is both infinitely simple and ridiculously complex. Also, you lost again, if you're still reading. The rules to the Game are as follows:


Everyone in the world is playing the Game, whether they know it or not.
If you think about the Game, you lose the Game. This includes things like desperately trying not to think about the Game, or being tipped off by anyone else talking about losing the Game, or any split-second that the Game randomly pops into your mind. You think about it, you lose.
When you lose, you have to announce that you lost. It can be out loud, on the Internet, in writing, or in any number of other ways. Announcing your losses is the only way that the Game is played.;
, Nobody ever wins the game, you can only avoid losing and attempt to make other people lose by spreading the word about the Game. If you're in the Game to win, you're going to lose. If you're in the Game to lose, congratulations!

, Ironic processing is the psychological phenomenon that describes the inverse relationship between a desire to avoid thoughts and the persistence of those thoughts. In other words, the more you want to stop thinking about the Game, the more your'e thinking about the Game.


This is also sometimes called the ""white bear phenomenon,"" based on a reference in Tolstoy, or the ""pink elephant phenomenon."" The act of deciding to not think about something makes you think about something.Ironic processing was used to humorous effect in the first Ghostbusters movie, in which the Ghostbusters were told that whatever they thought of would come to destroy them. Despite attempts to clear their minds entirely, someone thinks of the Stay-Puff'd marshmallow man, who arrives in monster-form to destroy Manhattan.

, Some people play the Game slightly differently, giving players a grace period after losing before you can lose again, or are not required to announce it for a certain period of time. This time can range from a few seconds to half an hour or so. Others put restrictions on ways that a loss can be announced. If you're playing with some friends, decide on winnable rules, if you want.


Some may say that death can also end the Game, while others say that the Game will end when the British Prime Minister, President of the United States, or the Pope says the Game is lost on national television. Still others believe that the Game can only be won when someone knocks the hat off the Pope.

, Every new person you tell about the Game will automatically lose the Game. Walk around in a t-shirt, or carry a sign that says ""I lost The Game."" Wear it in public as often as possible, explain the Game to people, and force them to discover and simultaneously lose the Game.


While this isn't against the rules (there are only three rules in the Game), keep in mind that some Game forums frown upon this. Because the Game is widespread in certain areas, talking about it at all is seen as being super-annoying by some. Discuss the Game with caution.

, Announcing ""I lost The Game!"" when you think of it will also serve to remind other people about the Game, thus forcing them to lose concurrently, creating an infuriating chain of loss. This will normally happen at random times. You can announce this verbally, or you can be creative about it.

, If you start a Game, keep it going on as long as you want, and keep other people losing by reminding them about it as often as possible. Perpetuate the cycle by trying to remind the other players, informed and uninformed about it whenever you get the chance:


If you're in class, write and pass notes about the Game, announcing that you lost. This will keep you from getting in trouble by shouting it out every 10 seconds. If someone isn't available to inform at the moment you lose, write them a note and give it to them later, or stick it into their locker through the slats. You could even do this to random people.
Write on dry-erase boards and chalkboards, either with teacher permission or inconspicuously when the teacher isn't looking. Try to keep this to a minimum and only do it if you know the teacher won't mind. Anyone who looks in your direction will lose The Game.
Take out an add in the classifieds. While you'll need some kind of approval for this, if you work on a school newspaper or other newsletter, find a way to incorporate a mention of the Game or something that will trigger thoughts of the Game.

, Find message boards, chat rooms, and other online venues to blast off status updates and other messages about the Game. The more people who know about it, the more people lose and know they're losing. Update your Facebook page right now with a simple message: ""I just lost the Game.""


Blast off emails to everyone you know, and title them ""I lost the Game."" Every time you lose the Game, alert everyone on your contact list.

, Within a given amount of time, try to stop thinking about the Game. Depending on who you're playing with, you may have a set amount of time to stop thinking about the Game, or it may go on indefinitely. This can be anywhere from a minute to an hour, but ten minutes usually works the best and is considered the standard in many places. Other places do not follow this rule.


Because not-thinking about something isn't possible to do actively, all you can do is actively make yourself think about other things. Try to recite the lyrics to a long and involved rap song in your mind, or recite a prayer ad infinitum. Try to remember all the lines in Caddyshack and start reciting the movie. Do anything but think about the Game.
Start reading, if you can. Plug up your ears and don't listen to anything anyone else says. Just focus all your energy into doing something else, thinking about something else, and ignoring what's happening around you.

, If you often lose the Game in a certain location, a certain place or activity reminds you of the Game, or you know of certain people that always seem to have lost the Game, try to steer clear. However, be aware that the thought process required to do this is likely to make you lose.

, The knowledge of the Game is available to everyone. If you start sending out emails or text messages announcing your loss of The Game, expect others to do so as well. If something looks suspicious, it might be best not to open it. Of course, if you're suspicious that an email might contain a reference to the Game then you're thinking about the Game, and you lose. Good luck.

Play until someone wins.",How to Play Pick up Sticks," You will need a set of pick up sticks before you can play. Colorful wood and plastic sets are available. Some sets even feature special sticks that can be used to pick up the sticks., Keeping score is optional, but you will need to keep score if you want to make the game last for several rounds of picking up sticks., You will need at least two people to play Pick up Sticks, but you can play with more than two people as well. This game is great for children and adults, so you can play with your parents, siblings, or friends.

, If you are keeping score, then write down all of the players’ names on your sheet of paper. Leave plenty of room below each name to write down each person’s scores., You can play to 200 points, 300 points, 500 points, or more! It is up to you and the other players. The higher the point goal that you set, the longer your game will last., Make sure that all of the sticks are standing up vertically. Hold the bundle of sticks a few inches above a flat surface, like a table or the floor., Let the sticks fall freely. When all of the sticks have come to rest, you will be ready to begin playing!, Let the youngest player go first and then have the player to the left of the youngest player go next. Keep moving clockwise around your group of players until the game ends.

, Try not to touch or move other sticks when you are trying to pick up a stick. If you move a stick while you are trying to pull out another stick, you must let go of the stick and stop your turn., The object of the game is to pick up the most sticks over the course of the game. Every time that you successfully pick up a stick, you may try to pick up another stick. Keep picking up sticks until you move another stick and lose your turn. You can set a limit on the number of sticks that may be picked up per turn. Setting a limit is a good way to make the game last longer and also avoid having someone pick up all of the sticks on their first turn., If you are keeping score, then you will need to add up each person’s points after each turn. Points are assigned based on the color of the sticks. Write down the points that each player earns at the end of his or her turn.Black = 25 points
Red = 10 points
Blue = 5 points
Green = 2 points
Yellow = 1 point

, If you manage to pick up the black stick (also known as the master stick), then you may use that stick to move other sticks away from sticks that you want to pick up. The black stick is the only stick that can be used to move other sticks., Keep playing until someone wins the game. The game will either be over when one of the player reaches the goal score or when all of the sticks have been picked up.If you are playing to a certain score, then add up each player’s points occasionally to see how everyone is doing.
If you are just playing until all of the sticks have been picked up, then stop the game when there are no more sticks to pick up and have the players count the number of sticks they have picked up. The player with the most sticks wins.
To start a new round, gather all of the sticks again and do a new stick drop.

Set up the game board and discs.,
Place the first disc in a spot that outflanks an opponent’s disc.,
Flip the outflanked disc to its opposite side.,
Pass the turn to your opponent.,
Continue taking turns placing discs until a legal move isn’t possible.,
Set a time limit.,
Count the number of discs of each color.,
Try to establish stable disc positions.,
Try to get a disc in the corner of the board.,
Think ahead when placing discs.,
Try to trap your opponent and avoid being trapped.",How to Play Othello," Othello is played on an 8 x 8 non-checkered board with 64 discs which are black on one side and white on the other. One player plays discs black side up and the other plays white side up. Place 4 discs in the center of the board; 2 with the black side up and 2 with the white side up so that the discs with matching colors touch diagonally.


The player with black disks typically goes first; in other versions, the players decide who plays first.
The modern version of Othello requires this setup for every game. In the older game of Reversi, players placed the first 4 discs however they chose.Online versions of Othello are just as popular as the physical version and follow the same rules.;
, To “outflank” a disc means to surround a row of your opponent’s discs with two of your own discs. A “row” consists of one or more discs that form a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally.


For instance, the first player places a black disc in a spot that outflanks a white disc either vertically or horizontally, as it is not possible to outflank the white discs diagonally (assuming black goes first).

, Once a disc is outflanked, it is flipped to the opposite color and becomes the other player’s disc. Following the example in the previous step, the white disc that is outflanked is turned to black and belongs to the black player..

, The opponent now places the second disc in a spot that outflanks at least one of the first player’s discs. Assuming the second player plays the white discs, they would place one of their discs so a row of at least one black disc is framed by two white discs on each side, flipping the outflanked black disks to white. Remember that the row can be horizontal, diagonal or vertical.

, For a move to be legal, a disc must always be placed in a position where it can outflank a row of the opponent’s discs. If this isn't possible, you must forfeit your turn until you can perform a legal move. If neither player can perform a legal move, usually because all spaces are filled, play ends.


Discs may flank the opponent's discs in more than one direction, turning them all over simultaneously.
If a legal move is available, you may not forfeit your turn, even if it would be advantageous to do so., Another way of ending the game is to set a specific time limit for each player's total moves. This means a game could end before players run out of legal moves and can encourage faster play. A player's time runs while he plays his turn and is paused when he passes the turn to his opponent. World championship rules typically give each player 30 minutes, but you can set a time limit as low as 1 minute if you prefer faster games., Once there are no more legal moves, add up all disks of each color. The player with more discs of his color wins the game.

, While it might initially seem like flipping as many discs as possible is the key to victory, this actually makes you more vulnerable. Most positions on the board can be outflanked; the edges of the board and the corners are the most stable positions.

, This will give you a position that can’t be outflanked and is an important advantage as it protects many of your other discs from being outflanked as you reach out from the corners.Getting control of a corner is often enough to turn the tables.


Avoid playing discs in the spaces immediately next to the extreme corners, as this gives your opponent the chance to outflank you and gain the corner position.

, Rather than simply trying to flip the most discs in one move, think about where your opponent might place his disc right after yours. You might be able to flip a large number of discs, but your opponent might play a counter that flips more discs back to their color.

, As your skill improves, you’ll be able to set traps for your opponent, much like in chess. Start thinking about your opponent’s likely plays, then push them towards a move that benefits you. Of course, be careful when playing against skilled opponents, as they may do the same to you!


For example, pay close attention if your opponent’s discs move closer to the corners. They may be trying to goad you into playing close to the corner so they can outflank you and take the corner.

Pay attention to your iron bars and vines.,
As soon as you can, build the smelter and ropeworks.,
Decide on three fighter mice and one healer, and try to obtain the strongest weapons on them first.",How to Play Mouse Town Without Spending Real Life Money," Do you have the game yet, and how far have you played?


If you do not have the game yet, download it for free from the App Store.
If you have the game already but have not progressed far, you may want to delete the app and redownload it. This way, you can have a fresh start.
If you have played quite far into the game already, you may want to continue where you are.;
, Playing without spending real life money depends very much on patience. Over the course of the game, you will be pushed to get things accomplished faster by spending gems, and to acquire more gems by spending real life money. Realistically, a game played without spending money will take at least several months.

, The game will push you to spend your gems on 'rush jobs' or to keep yourself alive during the battle. But if you are patient, you can wait the set amount of time for a building to be completed. And if you are losing a battle, you can always refight it later.

, These include:


You will start the game off with 25 gems.
After completing a level, you will receive 5 gems.
Some quests, if completed, will include a reward of 2 gems.
Every day, you will receive daily rewards. These could include coins, wood, stones, iron bars, vines, a house, or gems. Be sure to log in at least once a day, or else you will miss the rewards of that day, which could be 3-7 gems.
By opening a treasure chest. Some chests will contain gems. You may have to spend gems to open some chests, but you will get at least as many in return.
By fighting battles on the pirate ship for gems. These battles cost 8000-10,000 coins each to fight, and if won, yield 4-5 gems. In order to be able to win these battles without spending gems, you will need heroes with very strong weapons and shield, possibly the strongest available.
By watching an advertisement. At times, the software will allow you to watch a 30-60 second commercial in exchange for receiving one gem. Often, the software will allow you to watch the commercial multiple times, sometimes as many as 50 times in succession. This can be a great way to earn gems.

, These allow you to buy stronger weapons and shields and win tougher battles.


You will find as the game goes on that you will need a lot of these, at times more than you will need gems. Especially vines will come in need and will be harder to obtain.
You can earn iron bars and vines by clearing certain types of debris.
Super knockouts can earn you iron bars and vines. To achieve a super knockout, press the icon of a specific hero as it is about to kill an enemy. This can only be done once before the hero recharges.
Some daily rewards will be iron bars or vines. Be sure to claim your daily rewards every day by logging in, otherwise you could miss one of these.
The smelter can produce up to 50 iron bars every 12 hours by converting 10x as many stones, and Ropeworks can produce up to 50 vines every 12 hours by converting 10x as many pieces of wood.

, These enable you to make more iron bars and vines.

, Use these heroes to fight all the battles early on.


After building up maximum weaponry and shields in these heroes, you can work on building up other heroes.
Do not worry about buying the top weapons/shields if they can only be bought with gems unless it is a quest. Many of these require up to 66 gems. Instead, focus on those that require just iron bars or vines (sometimes they require one gem).

Learn the objective.,
Set up the deck.,
Set the teams.,
Learn about the trumps.",How to Play Kop1," The objective of Kop is to have a majority of the points (53 or more).
, Only 16 cards are ever used in this game: the aces, queens, jacks and 10s., Usually, in a game of Kop, there are 4 players. The teams are the players who hold the both the black queens (the stare) (Queen of spades and Queen of clubs) versus the players who don't., All queens and jacks are trumps (trumfy). The highest trumps are the Ace and 10 of hearts, and the Ace and 10 of Diamonds. There are 12 trumps in all, leaving only 4 that aren't (obce).

The trumps include all hearts and diamonds, and the Jack and Queen of Spades and Clubs. The two lowest trumps, the Ace and 10 of Diamonds, are called ryzyka.

Make a circle on the ground.,
Set up your marbles.,
Have the first player ""knuckle down."",
If the player successfully knocked out another marble (while keeping their shooter in), have them go again.,
Shoot from behind the line if a player knocks out your shooter.,
Finish the game when all the marbles are gone.",How to Play Marbles1," You can draw a line with marker or chalk or make a ring out of string or ribbon. The circle can be as big as you'd like -- generally speaking, 3 - 10 feet (1 - 3.3 m) across. Note: The bigger the circle, the harder it is to win!









Use a flat surface. If it isn't flat, your marbles are going to be rolling wherever they please.
With masking tape (or chalk if outside), put two straight lines on either side of the circle. These will be the lines the players must sit behind when throwing outside of the circle. No cheating!

Have each player throw their marble to the opposite line. Whoever's marble winds up closest to the line goes first when playing the game.

;
, You can do this however you like. A plus sign is fairly standard, but you can also make a circle or just scatter them randomly. Use at least 13 marbles (an odd number to determine the winner).








, They should sit outside of the circle on the first go. With the shooter (the player's special marble) resting in the crook of their index finger, they place their knuckle on the floor (hence the term) and flick the marble out with their thumb.The aim is to hit another marble out of the circle while keeping the shooter in.









The shooter is generally a bit larger than the normal marbles. If you have a favorite shooter, it is known as your ""taw."" Your favorite marble, on the other hand, is known as an ""alley."", And they get to take the marble they knocked out and receive a point. When the go again, they must knuckle down where the shooter landed.









Determine if you literally get to keep the marbles you knock out. If so, this is known as ""keepsies."" Know the term ""playing for keeps?"" There you go!

, If the first player didn't knock out a marble, the second player gets their turn. If they knock out the other player's shooter, they don't get a point or to keep the shooter, but the other player does have to shoot from outside the circle (which is much more difficult) on their next turn. It's sort of like an automatic ""lose your turn"" move.








, Whichever player knocked out the most marbles wins. Ready for another round?









If you find knuckling down to be difficult, you can roll your marble. But practice the knuckling! It's more authentic and keeps the game interesting.

Pick a dealer.,
Make your announcements.,
Wrap up the bidding.",How to Play Kop2," He will shuffle the 16 cards and deal 4 cards to each player. For the next round, the player to the dealer's left will become the new dealer., Before the play, players will start bidding. Go around in a clockwise order, starting with the player to the left of the dealer. If that player has a bid, he says ""May I?"" and makes one of the three announcements shown below. Otherwise, start the play.


Kontra doubles the value of the game. To double the value further, other players may say rej (4x) on subsequent turns, followed by bok (8x) and then słup (16x) During the bidding, the partnerships are usually unknown. Therefore, if two people double consecutively, they can become partners, however, two doubles by the same team will only count as one double. For example, if all four players (re)double, once the players team up, the multiplier is only 4x, and not 16x.

Wesele is announced when a player hold both black queens and is looking for a partner. They will be partnered by whoever hold the highest Jack (excluding themselves). They can also stay silent (cicha) or announce zolo (du) (see below)

Zolo (Du) is announced when someone has both black queens. That player will play against the other three players. If Zolo Du is said, that player must win all four tricks.

, It ends when three players in a row pass (say nothing)."
"
Start the play.,
Try to win tricks.,
Play cards.",How to Play Kop3," Once bidding is over, the player left of the dealer leads to the first trick., Tricks are won by the highest trump in the trick, or the highest card overall., If a non-trump starts the play and the next player has the other non-trump card of that suit (e.g. Player 1 draws 10 of Spades, next player has Ace of Spades, so they must play it), then they must play that card. Otherwise, they must play a trump card and only trump cards higher than the highest trump of the current trick. If they can't, they can play any other trump card. If they have no trump cards, they can play any card."
"
Add up the final scores.,
Find the winner.",How to Play Kop4," There are a total of 104 points in the game. At the end of the play, each team counts the value of each of the cards they have won.

Settling ties. If two teams each have 52 points, whoever announced the last double will lose. If no-one doubled, whoever hold the black queens loses.
Playing solo. If the player playing alone wins, they must pay them 4x the amount for chica, 5x for zolo and 10x for zolo du. If they lose, they must pay the same amount of points to every player.
Doubles. Every double announcement will double the payout of the game (see Bidding)

, When one team has more than 52 points, they win the game!"
"
Draw four circles.,
Draw a shooting line.,
Start playing.,
Add up the points.,
Go for another round.",How to Play Marbles2," Draw each one inside the other to create a target effect. The innermost circle is worth the most points - 100. The next circle going outward is worth 75 points, the next is worth 50 and the outer circle is worth 25 points. The size of the circle should be at least 30 cm (12"") across.









Of course, the values are up to you. If you'd like a teeny tiny circle inside the 100 to be worth a million, go on ahead. Many variations of marbles exists -- yours could be next!

, Draw this about 180cm (6 feet) from the outer edge of the biggest circle. The farther away your line, the more difficult the game will be. Don't let any player cross it!








, Define how many rounds the game will have. Each player in turn stands on the shooting line and shoots three marbles at the target. The target is the bull's eye. Each marble that lands in a circle earns the number of points marked in that circle. Landing outside the circles scores nil.








, Add the points for all three marble shoots to reach the player's score. At the end of the turn, the marbles are picked up to leave the field clear for the next player.









If you do choose to leave the marbles, make it so if they're knocked out, they're not counted. Only marbles that are left at the end of both turns have value. This makes the game more competitive!

, When everyone has had a turn, start the next round, adding on the scores. The winner is the player with the highest total score at the end of the game."

Do missions with your horses.,
Take advantage of the free passes.,
Sell your horses.,
Offer coverings.,
Run an Equestrian Center.,
Sell your items.",How to Play Howrse Without Spending Real Life Money," Missions are a wide variety of tasks for your horse to do to earn money. Horses can start missions at the age of two years and can continue them throughout their lives. Missions typically earn you between 20-60 equus.

Missions not only earn you some extra money but also benefit your horses skill with extra training and special items. Do missions with all your horses two years and older to increase the income of Equus. Missions do drain some of your horse's energy, so care for it after it has done a mission. You can do missions once a day.;
, To find the free passes, simply click passes then click the free tab. Here you will find a meter. Every time this meter reaches 300 points, you can earn a pass. To earn the free pass, you must successfully complete a mini-game. After you have completed the game, you will get a free pass.

You can earn up to 10 points a day, so it will take you an estimated 30 days to get a free pass. Points vary depending on what you did throughout the day. Save your passes to buy the things you want to buy.

, If you bred a few good foals, sell them. To do this, click the green plus sign on the horses' profile page, then click sell. Choose the type of sale and the price. Your horse will stay up for 30 days. If you have a really good foal, you can sell it for a pass or two. The pass costing horses can take longer to sell, as most players don't have a lot of passes. In order to sell as many horses as possible, keep prices reasonable.

Price the horse according to its skills, excellence stars, genetics, and BLUP. Do not overprice your horse, for most players won't buy it. This also helps expand your reputation as a breeder, attracting more buyers. You can sell a horse for up to a million Equus and up to 20 Passes.

, If you have a good stud stallion, offer a covering. To do this, click offering a covering, then click public. Choose a price, then click confirm. This helps expand your reputation as a breeder and also earns you Equus. Do not overprice your horse! Covering a mare can earn you up to 7,500 Equus., Equestrian centers are boarding centers for horses. You do need a certain number of Seniority days, so do the other things in this list until you have enough days. Players can board they""re horses at your center for a fee and a certain amount of days.

Offer a few benefits (such as food and riding gear) to attract players. Do not overprice fees! Try to buy good quality boxes, bedding, and enough meadows for the horses to roam in.

, To do this, go to the store and click sell items. If you have a few unneeded/unwanted items, you can sell them for a few extra Equus."

This game uses the Double 6 set, but without every tile (except for 0-0) in the 0 suit, making a total of 22 tiles.,
Have each player draw a hand of 7 tiles.,
Start bidding.,
Before the first trick, the auction winner decides the trump out of the following:


A number from zero to six: If zero is picked, there will only be one trump (0-0), otherwise there will be six.,
The auction winner leads any tile to the first trick.,
Winning tricks.,
Scoring the game.",How to Play Moon (Domino Game)1," The tiles are divided into 7 suits; 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s. The double is the highest tile in the suit, so for the 2 suit, the order is 2-2, 2-6, 2-5, 2-4, 2-3 and 2-1, highest to lowest.
, The remaining tile is placed face down on the middle of the table., The first bidder is determined and then the bidding will go round in a clockwise direction.

The bids can be ""pass"" (no bid), a number between 4 and 7, or 21. Each number bid must be higher than the last (e.g. Player A bids 4, B bids 5, C bids 6). A bid of 21is known as shooting the moon, which is a bid to take all tricks. The bidding stops instantly at this point, and whoever bid 21 wins the auction.
The winner of the auction (the one with the highest bid) takes the tile from the middle and then discards one tile from his hand face down without showing it.

,

Doubles: The trumps will be (highest to lowest): 6-6, 5-5, 4-4, 3-3, 2-2, 1-1 and 0-0.

No trump: There will be no trump.

,

If the tile played is a trump, the other players must attempt to play trumps as well. If a player doesn't have any trump tiles, they can play any tile.
If it isn't a trump, then the higher number on the domino played is the suit to be followed. Other players must attempt to play tiles with this suit. If a player can't follow the suit, they can play any tile.

, When anyone plays a trump, they highest trump wins the trick. If no trump is played, the highest ranked tile played wins the trick.

The winner of this trick stacks the three tiles of the trick face down in front of them and then leads any tile to the next trick.
The game continues like this until all the cards have been played.

, The game ends when someone reaches 21 points.

If a bid is successful (number of tricks won is more than bid, or if 21, all seven tricks are won), the bidder scores the amount of the bid. If they don't win, they lose that amount of points.
The other two players score one point for each trick won.

Take turns rolling the lawn bowls.Lawn bowls are balls are made of hard plastic and range in size from 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) to 5 inches (12.7 cm) (116 mm to 131 mm).,
Count the shots.A shot is a lawn bowl that was delivered closer to the jack than the opposing team's bowls.,
Reverse the direction.,
Tally up the shots.",How to Play Lawn Bowls2," Teams can consist of individuals, pairs, three players, or four players. Regardless of how many players you have, you need to separate the players into two equal teams. Each team should also have a leader.

, The jack is a small white ball that is rolled to establish the target. A coin is tossed to determine which team's leader will roll the jack. That person must stand on a mat at one end of a rink and roll the jack down the rink. The jack must travel at least 25 yards (23 meters) but should not roll past the boundary pin.

, Move the jack to the center of the rink, keeping it even with the same length it rolled to.

, The weight should not exceed 3.5 lbs (1.59 kg). Each team must alternate. One teammate from the first team should roll his or her ball, then another teammate from the second team should roll his or her ball, and so on. The lawn bowl must be rolled within the rink and players should aim for the target jack.

, For instance, if Team A delivered three bowls far away from the jack and further away from Team B's bowls, but delivered one bowl directly next to the jack, closer than any of Team B's bowls, Team A has one shot and Team B has zero.

, Stand at the opposite end of the rink and repeat the jack delivery, lawn bowl delivery, and counting of shots. This completes an end.

, There are two methods of deciding when a game is complete. In the first, the game ends when one team reaches 21 points. In the second, the game ends after 18 or 21 ends are played, and the victor is whoever had the highest score.

Use a drawing shot.A drawing shot is the most common.,
Try a yard on.,
Attempt a running shot.,
Use a drive.",How to Play Lawn Bowls3," Essentially, you aim to get the lawn bowl near the jack without bumping into anything. Roll the bowl to the right of the jack, allowing the bowl to curve in to the left. This curving is due to the fact that a lawn bowl is not a perfect sphere. Lawn bowls are shaved on one side, causing them to curve as they roll.


You can also have a backhand draw by turning the bowl over and curving it in the opposite direction. Aim to the left of the jack, directing the bowl to curve to the right.

, This is also referred to as an upshot or a ""chap and lie"" shot. In this delivery, you aim and forcefully deliver the bowl so that it disturbs jack. The bowl should knock into the jack and drag it 1 or 2 yards (1 or 2 meters) away from its initial location. This delivery is used to move the jack away from the opponent's bowls and toward your own.

, A running shot is similar to a yard on in that it requires force to change the position of another object. Usually, the goal is to move an opponent's bowl away from the jack. The shot is also used on occasion to push the jack toward the ditch without causing it to tip into it.

, A drive shot requires a roll that has so much speed and force that it hits an opponent's bowl or the jack with full force. As a result, the target is removed from play, meaning that an opponent's bowl is either pushed out of the rink or that a jack is pushed into the ditch. Using it to destroy an opponent's bowl does not destroy the end, but using it to push the jack out of the rink does destroy the end.

Try double jinx.",How to Play Jinx2," You can trick a person into jinx by asking a simple question. For instance, if you say ""What's 2 plus 2?,"" the other person will mostly likely say ""4."" In that case, you can say ""4"" at the same time, then immediately say ""jinx"" to start the game., In some variations, the person doing the jinxing can punch the jinxed person if he or she talks before the game is over., In one variation, when you say the same phrase, you can say ""American jinx, touch wood"" instead of just ""jinx."" You play the game the same way with one exception: the first person to touch a piece of wood gets to punch the other person., If you both say ""jinx"" at the same time, you can say ""double jinx"" to initiate the game. In that case, you need to say the person's full name to end the game.

The person with the highest combined number goes first.

, The first player rolls both dice. The dice determine where you play. The numbers for the white die are along one side of the board while the numbers for the black die are along the other side. Match up the numbers to determine your space., Set your game piece down in the proper spot., If you roll the same place twice, that's called a jinx, and it means you remove all your pieces from the board.

Find a big with area, and something to call ""home"" (a tree, a dustbin, a door to a building) and plenty of hiding places.
,
Have everyone dress in dark non-reflective clothing.,Get a torch (flashlight) that doesn't have a beam that is too wide or too narrow.,Define the boundaries - anyone hiding in forbidden territory immediately becomes ""it"" next round.,Choose a place to be ""home"", and choose someone to be ""it"" in whatever way you deem fairest.,Have the person that is ""it"" count to 100.,Just like hide and seek the idea is to not be found, but also the hiders must get to the ""home"" without being spotted first.,
The rules are as follows:

The seeker can only use the torch (flashlight) when they think they see someone in the dark;
The torch (flashlight) can only be on for 3 seconds at most;
When the seeker spots someone they must run to the ""home"" and shout 'forty-forty' then the person's name and location while shining the torch (flashlight) on them (see below);
When a hider makes it to the ""home"" they must shout 'flashlight' - until they do this they can still be caught;
The first person caught is ""it"" for the next turn;
Hiders are not allowed to trip, catch or hold back the Seeker;
The Seeker must stay outside a two meter exclusion zone around the ""home"" unless they are counting or they spot someone;
If somewhere is out of bounds it cannot be used for hiding in, or traveling through, until the game is over.

, In the main menu, choose New Game to start your adventure.








, As you start a new game, you get to choose the class of your hero. There are currently 6 classes with different skills.








,









Assassin—This character is the 2nd highest DPS (damage per second) class and can use two weapons (dual wield).
Black Knight—The Knight class possesses great defense with decent attack damage. They're able to use skills that can summon swords, which is great in inflicting damage. This class is ideal for new players.
Priest—This is the best healing class with great single-target stun. Priests are able to put groups of enemies to sleep, a good strategy especially when you have a mage in your party.
Ranger—This is a range class with support skills such as healing. This class can also summon a bear, which can be played as the attacker or tank for the party.
Warlock—This class has the highest DPS because of its high speed attack, which sends damage through the roof, great for slowing enemies, making them an easy target for the rest of your party. Moreover, Warlocks can wear Plate Mail, which increases their defense.
Warrior—Warrior is a great tank and damage class with stun skills. A mixture between the Knight and Assassin since this class can duel wield weapons.

, At the start of the game, after choosing the class of your preference, a scene will occur, showing you the story of your character before taking a long journey. In this part of the sequence, the game will teach you how to move and attack. The controls is pretty basic, so it’s easy to learn.









On the lower left of your screen, you will be able to see an arrow pad similar to any handheld console. Sliding your hand over it will make your character to move up, down, left, and right.
On the right side of your screen is where you control the attack. Tapping the pad on that side will make your character to swing their sword or cast magic to the enemy.

, Buy the max amount of 12 slot bags as early as possible. Having enough space in your inventory for items is important in the later part of the game, especially when you need to do heavy mob leveling. Going back to the city just to clear your inventory for more space is dreadful.









There's not much to spending money in the early levels of the game, and the extra space will let you pick up everything and even store enough potions for survival.
This technique works well until level 70.

, Dices are found randomly from battles or treasure boxes. You should roll dices as soon as possible as dices are a great way to raise all your stat points.









When you roll a dice, it will randomly re-adjust your current stats. If you don't like what is rolled, you can choose to keep your current stat set up.

, In Inotia 4, you can hire up to two members to join your party. They will help you in taking care of the monsters and even give support such as healing and buffs.









The best party so far is with a Priest, Ranger, or Warlock. With this kind of setup, monsters die quickly and the chance of survival is high.
Priests can stand as the healer of the group, Warlock will be the damage dealer, and Ranger will be the all-around class.
Rangers have offensive and supportive skills, which is useful whenever the Priest has run out of energy.

, Whenever you level up, you obtain skill points that can be used to level up your skills. By the end of the game, you're able to max out all but 2 or 3 skills.









You can also find or make Supreme Elixirs. These raise your skill points by one.

, Stats in the game can be a little misleading and vary slightly between classes. Remember that STR stat is for melee characters and don’t work for characters who use magic. For terms and definition regarding stats, see below:









DMG—This increases skill-related damage.
M.DMG—This increases magic damage.
CRT%—Chance to land a critical hit.
H.RATE%—Improves chance of hitting the enemy.
C.DMG%—Extra damage done by critical hit.
DEF—Physical defense.
P.RES%—Chance to resist physical damage.
M.RES%—Chance to resist magic damage.
EVD%—Chance to not take damage when being attacked.
W.D.R%—Weapon defense rate.
S.D.R%—Shield defense rate.
HP—This is your character’s hit points. When this reaches zero for all party members, its game over. You have to load your previously saved file to play again.
MP—Magic points.
Durability Enhancement—How many times an item can be upgraded with scrolls.
ATK DMG—Attack damage with normal weapon.

, Get a pint sized clear glass jar with a lid and scoop the ingredients into it.

, Add a small lock of either human hair or animal hair to the mix. The hair should rest on top of the mix and be intact as a bundle; this makes the next step easier. (Optional) For an even nastier stench, add one match head to the bundle of hair.

, Close the lid on the jar and then poke two holes in the lid to allow oxygen to flow into the jar (this will make the bundle of hair burn better inside the jar). Next use a magnifying glass to shine a beam through the jar and onto the bundle of hair until it starts to smoke inside the jar. you want to burn as much hair as possible.If you went with the optional in the last step, shine the beam on the match head.

, Put two pieces of tape over the holes in the lid and let the smoke filled jar sit in direct sunlight and leave it alone;this heats up the ingredients and lets them blend, and permeate everything in the jar. once the smoke inside the jar has settled, take the pieces of tape off the both holes This is to help the ingredients decompose inside the jar.

, after about a week, open the jar and take a whiff to see if its stink has blended enough. Only do this outside, NEVER in your house or anywhere else you don't want to badly stink up. Remember, the longer you leave it, the more wicked it's stench will be. A good indicator that it's ready is being able to detect a whiff from a few feet away after two or three weeks.

, Either open or break the jar in the area you want to stink and watch as people rapidly clear away from the obnoxious, haunting, suffocating stench. An alternative way of doing this is instead of using the whole jar, screen the rancid juice from the putrid mix with an old strainer into a small 2 Oz. pump spray bottle (one of those small clear plastic ones used for travel) and spray where you want to stink, just don't get caught and don't get any of this on you otherwise you will be in for a very smelly time.

Add baking soda.",How to Make a Smoke Grenade," To make your smoke grenade you will need a few basic ingredients first. It’s best to have your ingredients prepared before you begin to make the process easier along the way. Your ingredients are:


Granulated or cane sugar. You can get this at any supermarket, in the baking aisle.
Potassium nitrate (also known as “saltpetre”). You can get this at any home improvement store or big box store (like Home Depot or Walmart). If you’re not sure what to look for, ask an employee for a stump remover product.A soda can.
4 to 5 inches of cotton string, for your fuse.
Scotch tape.
A lighter or match.;
, You will also be using several tools to build your grenade. It’s a good idea to have your tools at the ready for when you need them, to make the process move faster. You will need:


Soap and water to clean your can.
A pair of scissors to cut the can in half.
A 1/4 cup measuring cup to measure out your ingredients.
A pot or frying pan to cook your ingredients in.
A towel or oven mitten to shield your hand from the heat.
A spoon, whisk, stick, or another object to mix ingredients.
A stovetop to heat and cook your ingredients on., Prepping your ingredients will help each step go by more smoothly. Being prepared also avoids unnecessary running around or potential accidents in the kitchen.


Before you start mixing and cooking your ingredients, grab your soda can. Clean it out using soap and water. Then, cut it in half using your scissors.Break up any clumps you see in the potassium nitrate powder. Run it through a sifter if you have to.
Pre-measure out your ingredients. You want to measure about 3 parts potassium nitrate for every 2 parts sugar. That’s ¾ cup of potassium nitrate and ½ cup of sugar total. You can put them in small bowls or containers for now., Grab your pan and place it on a stovetop burner. Turn the stove on and heat the empty pan over low to medium heat. You’ll add ingredients once the pan is heated., Once the pot has heated up, it’s ready for your ingredients. Since you already have your ingredients measured, all you have to do is pour the potassium nitrate and sugar into the pot.


You can mix your ingredients before pouring them in, or pour them in individually from the presorted containers you kept them in. They don’t need to be poured into the pan in any particular order.
Mix the ingredients together as you’re pouring them into the pan, using a spoon, wire whisk, or some other mixing tool.

, Keep mixing until the mixture liquefies, stirring constantly. Make sure you only mix it until it becomes liquefied. If you mix too long the mixture can thicken and catch fire., Cover your hand in a towel or oven mitten to protect it from the heat. Using that same hand, grab the pot and pour the liquefied solution from the pot into the bottom half of your cut can. You can hold the can with your other hand, or leave it on a flat surface while you pour the liquid into it., Cut about 4 to 5 inches of cotton string and insert the string into the middle of the liquid, holding in place. You might have to prop the string up by setting your can next to a wall while it cools off and hardens.

, With the top of the can still off, set the liquid aside so it can harden. This process usually takes about 6 to 8 hours at room temperature. To speed up the process you can put it in the refrigerator for about 4 to 5 hours., Once the liquid has hardened, grab the top of the can from when you cut it off and place it back onto the grenade, securing the two pieces together with scotch tape. Weave the fuse through the top of the soda can through the mouthpiece.

, Safely light the grenade by taking a lighter or match and lighting the end of your fuse. After several seconds (once the fuse has fully disappeared) you should see the smoke begin to release.


Toss, roll, or otherwise remove the grenade from your hand immediately after lighting it to avoid smoke inhalation.

, For colored smoke, just add some powdered (aniline) dye to your mixture. Be sure to use powdered dye, as liquid dye won’t give you vibrancy of color in the smoke. You can get aniline dye at most art or craft stores., When it’s the consistency of cookie dough, spoon it into little balls, wrap the ball in tin foil, and stick a small fuse into the ball.

, Add some baking soda to the mixture immediately after removing it from the stovetop. This will make your grenade burn more evenly and slowly.For this variation, you will want a ratio of 9 parts potassium nitrate for every six parts sugar for every 1-part baking soda (9:6:1).

, There are large piles of ""Gold"", ""Silver"" and ""Copper"" cards. Place all of those piles on the table., Kingdom cards (at least in the base set) are all the cards that you haven't already set up. There are a lot of Kingdom cards in the game, but you only need 10 differently named cards for each game.. You and your opponent can choose which cards to use in any way you like.

The rule-book recommends a particular set of cards to use for a first game; ""Cellar"", ""Village"", ""Workshop"", ""Remodel"", ""Market"", ""Moat"", ""Woodcutter"", ""Militia"", ""Smithy"" and ""Mine"". You may want to use this set if you are playing for the first time.

, You need 10 of each Kingdom card that you chose, except for cards with the ""Victory"" type, of which you need 12 (this is only ""Gardens"" in the first set). Put the cards in 10 piles, each card of the same name in the same pile., Each player's starting deck is made up of 7 ""Copper"" cards from the pile you set up, and 3 ""Estate"" cards from outside the pile you set up., Congratulations! You're finally ready to begin playing the game., The (base) game ends when either the Province pile is empty or three different piles that aren't the Province pile are empty. When that happens, each player counts up the number of Victory points in their deck (the big number in the middle of Victory cards is usually the  amount of points that card grants). Whoever has the most points wins., A turn has three phases. These are the action, buy and discard phases. In your action phase, you may play up to one action(action cards say ""Action"" on the bottom) and put it in your discard pile. In their buy phase, a player may buy up to one card (the method for doing this is explained below). In their discard phase, the player discards their hand and draws 5 cards. If their deck has less than 5 cards in it, you draws you deck, shuffle your discard  pile, makes the discard pile into your deck, than draw cards until you have 5 cards in hand., Play actions in the turn's first phase, the action phase. To play an action, reveal it to all players, perform the effect it says for you to perform, then put it into the discard pile., Buy cards during the buy phase, the second phase of the turn. Buy cards from the center piles you first set up. To buy a card, put a number of treasure (copper is worth 1 treasure, silver worth 2, and gold worth 3) into your discard pile that is greater or equal to the number in that card's bottom right corner. Then, put the card you just bought into your discard pile. You may buy only one card a turn.,

+1 card means draw a card.
+1 (if the 1 has a gold  circle around it) means get one coin, like you would by playing a copper.
+1 buy means that you can buy an additional thing this turn.
+1 action means you can play another action this turn.
Finally, a card with Reaction written in the bottom can be revealed at other times than your turn.

, Currently there are 11 expansions and they all add new cards so you can play dominion longer.

Understand the complex ""rock paper scissors"" game at the heart of most fighters.",How to Play Fighting Games1," The point of a fighting game is simple -- you trade blows and blocks with 1-3 opponents in order to knock them out. While the exact rules vary from game to game, more often than not you play until someone wins 2 out of 3 rounds, ending the match.


If you're learning to play fighting games for the first time, just pick up the one that piqued your interest. Don't worry about finding the perfect introductory game. All fighters have a tutorial section in the main menu that will help you learn the precise rules of your game, but the basics are similar from game to game.;
, The buttons for each fighting game are different, so just spend some time getting used to them for your game. Don't worry about winning at first, simply start a fight (usually ""Fight Now!"" or ""Single-Player"" on the main menu) and experiment with each button. You can also use the ""Practice"" or ""Tutorial"" mode to get used to the buttons without someone attacking you. The buttons you must know in order to get started are:


The different attack buttons (""heavy"" vs. ""quick;"" ""punch"" vs. kick;"" etc.).
Block/Shield
Jump.
Grab/Counter

, Experiment with characters you think looks cool or enjoy playing with, then sit down to really get to know them. Most games have ""Challenge Modes"" within their tutorials that test and teach certain skills, helping you get used to the timing of fighting games. A good fighter is all about timing -- executing perfect blocks right on contact, punching right in the open half-second before you get attacked, and stringing together quick combos. The only way to learn them is to practice, so pick a few characters and dive a little further into the game.


Once you've played through a few characters, pick one and stick with them. You want to learn one character inside and out before trying to master them all., Combos are the bread and butter of fighters. They are specific series of buttons, performed in rapid succession (such as ABBA + Down), that lead to a unique attack. You can find them online or in the tutorials, and will need them in order to beat anyone but the most basic fighter. Some things to note as you start learning combos:


How long does it take you to pull off the move? You need to finish the combo quickly or an opponent is going to take advantage your pause and attack.
Do the combos hit from a distance? Do you need to be right up close?
Is there a combo meter or power bar under your health? In some games you can only use combos when this little bar is filled., Blocking is generally done by pressing a button or tilting your control stick away from your opponent. Blocks usually deflect a large percentage of damage, especially when they are timed perfectly. Fighting games are not all about constant offense, and becoming an effective blocker can help you turn the tide against experienced players and button mashers alike.


In many games it is possible to counter a block with a grab or throw, so don't expect to block the whole time and take no damage.

, Once you are comfortable with a character you can learn their combos inside and out. Combos refer to landing consecutive strikes on an opponent in a way that gives them no chance to strike back or break free. The higher and longer the combo, the more damage you will do.


Combos must be done fluidly and quickly, otherwise the game will just try and act out all of the individual buttons instead of the one combo attack.
With joystick combos, where you need to press down, then over, etc, try and move the stick in one solid, continuous motion for the best results., Fighting games are, to a large degree, complex games of countering and reading your opponent. Every move your opponent has can be countered by one of your own moves. The trick is knowing and anticipating your opponent so that you can get these counters off. The most simple counter is blocking an attack, but you also need to recognize when to use a throw against a block, a counter against a throw, and an attack to cut short an opponent's charging. The only way to learn these moves is to practice, practice, practice.


Try and define a move in terms of what it wins against, what it loses against, and what it draws against. This will help you see the right response for every situation.
Learn to recognize each character's animations. Many attacks have tell-tale signs that they are coming, and learning to react to them in a split-second will separate you from the beginners."

Head to the online modes or join in with a friend to really improve your skills against a living, unpredictable opponent.


Almost all fighters have online modes that match you up against similarly skilled players automatically, so don't let worry about getting pummeled keep you offline., Each character often has similar moves, but their timing, reach, damage, and speed are often wildly different. This means that certain characters have an advantage over others, and you need to play each character a little differently. While a complete list of differences across all games is impossible, in general:


Know if you favor speed or strength. Quick characters need to dart around and pepper lots of attacks at the opponent while stronger characters need to pick the opportune moments to deal major damage.
What is your reach? Does a character have long attacks and lots of projectiles, or do they need to get up close. What about your opponent?
Search online for your game's ""Tier List,"" which is a ranking of how good each character is against each other character as written by professional players., Fighting games are not purely based on your reactions, though they appear that way to outsiders. You need to keep the entire game in your mind as you play. For example, if you have one or two attacks that are connecting early on, you shouldn't expect to rely on them the whole fight. Your opponent will quickly adapt and punish you for a lack of creativity. You might, instead, save these attacks for the opportune moment, making the most of them to catch your opponent off-guard.


Is the game on a timer? If so, the player with the most health when time runs out usually wins. This might lead you to take more or less risks as the clock winds down.
Are there special bars to fill up? Usually blocking fills up your combo or special bar, so starting out reserved and then surprising your opponent with a big attack could be more effective then attack right out of the gate.

, After an attack, how long is it before you can move again? How long does it take to start an attack before it deals damage? In general, the longer these times are, the more damage the attack does but the more vulnerable you are to a counter-attack. You need to know how long it takes to complete a full attack to make the most of your moves, and to know when you can safely move in on your opponents., Conditioning is when you make your opponent expect a certain attack, then switch things up to gain the upper hand. Conditioning is essential for all top-tier players and takes many forms. You can condition using the game by cutting common combos short, you can condition over long matches by sticking to one strategy before brutality changing gears, and you can condition opponents with repeated attacks, changing it up just as they get used to blocking it. The essence of conditioning is playing your opponent, not just reacting to them., Jumping is predictable. Once you're in the air, you can't block or change directions, giving your opponent plenty of time to get ready and counter your attack. While there is time for jumping to surprise, dodge, or initiate a combo, you should save it for sparse, opportune moments., Resist the urge to constantly attack, especially when you have the lead. Make your opponent come to you and dictate the flow of the fight that way, picking them off when they make mistakes and tempting them to take risks to get the fight even. Playing conservatively is all about reading your opponents and breaking them down bit by bit, and though it takes some patience, all the best players do it., A gaming pad with buttons and joystick is essential if you want to seriously play fighting games. They are usually $40-80 and come in a variety of designs. If you have any plans of competing in fighters, you'll need on to stand a chance, as they are more responsive to movement and quick combos than a controller."

Put the cups on top.,
Set up the other end similarly.,

End the game.",How to Play Cups or Fricket," The overall setup will look like the sample in the image.

Stand one pair of poles upright, 15 inches apart. This pair of poles is called a wicket. As a guideline, the disc can be used to measure, allow two inches of space on each side. Drive the two poles into the ground far enough to keep the poles stable, roughly eight or twelve inches.
, Gently place one cup upside down on top of each pole.

, Place the poles so that all four are in the shape of a rectangle roughly 40 feet away., Divide into two teams, often two players each., This can be determined any number of ways, flipping a coin; Rock, Paper, Scissors; etc. The team that goes first begins with both of the flying discs., One team takes one end behind one wicket, the other team takes the opposite end behind the other wicket., The team that has been determined to go first takes the discs and begins to play offense, remaining behind their wicket. The opposing team will play defense, remaining behind their wicket., The offense attempts to hit one or both of the poles of the wicket in an attempt to knock off the cups or pass the disc through the poles themselves. They must not cross in front of their wicket while throwing. Meanwhile, the defense will stand behind their wicket and attempt to catch the cup with one hand if it gets knocked off by the offensive player., The offense scores are as follows:

One point for the offense for each cup that has been knocked off and touches the ground
One point for the offense for each cup that has been knocked off and is not caught one handed by the defense, either using two hands or part of the body to help ""trap"" or wedge the cup.
Two points for the offense for a disc that passes cleanly through the center of the wicket
No points if a any part of the body has crossed in front of their wicket, resulting in a ""fault""

, The defense scores as follows:


One point for each cup is caught one handed
No points if the cup is caught two handed or is trapped against the body

, Replace any cups that may have been knocked off to their original position., The defense gathers the discs and teams switch playing offense and defense., Repeat steps four through seven and continue until one team has reached eleven points., Congratulate each other and shake hands, or play again!"

Tie a knot above the nut, as well.",How to Play Conkers," Essentially, each person has a string with a conker on the end. One person holds one still, dangling in the air, while another swings her conker around to hit it. The goal is to try to break the other person's conker., You don't want to be hit in the face by a conker., Let it hang down under you hand., If you intentionally move the string, the other player gets another turn., The person will swing his or her conker around to hit yours.

, If the conker doesn't break, you get a chance to be the swinger instead., However, instead of letting your string hang down, pull it back, almost like a slingshot., The conker should go around and down, hitting the other person's stationary conker., Conkers can hurt if they hit arms or knuckles.

, Conkers isn't necessarily scored per game. Instead, the conker itself receives a score. That is, if you break a conker that has never been played before, the conker your using becomes a two-er. If you break one that has broken another one once before (you break a two-er), yours becomes a three-er. Essentially, you add up all the previous wins, and add them to the current conker., Horse chestnuts are different from the kind roasted at Christmas.In the United States, these type of chestnuts can be referred to as ""buckeyes,"" but they're not the same as the Ohio buckeye trees.In the United Kingdom, they're called ""conkers."", The chestnuts are encased in pods until they ripen. They split open on their own when they're ripe., You only want the nut to make the conker., Chose ones that are even on both sides and that aren't splitting. You'll only need one per person, but it helps to have extras, as the goal of conkers is to break another person's conker.To help you choose the best one, try floating them in water. If it sinks, it's dense and solid. If it floats, it's damaged, and it will break too easily., You need string to create the game piece. Choose something that is fairly sturdy., Hold the chestnut with pliers to drill it. Go slowly so that you don't crack the nut.


If you're a kid trying to make a hole, ask for your parents' help, so you don't hurt yourself.

, You don't want the nut to slide off the string. The string should be at least a foot and a half long., You can use a needle if you are having trouble pulling the thread through the hole., Leave the string on. The string should be long enough to wrap around your hand and hang down."

Keep calm as you play.",How to Play Cornhole," You'll need two sets of bean bags, with each set having four bags apiece. It's a good idea to choose two colors for your bean bags, one color for each team. This way, you can easily differentiate teams. Additionally, each team must have one goal board per team.Official Cornhole goal boards are 2 by 4 feet (0.61 by 1.22 m), with a hole 6 inches (15.24 cm) wide centered 9 inches (22.9 cm) from the top of the board. Larger or smaller boards might not work as well.
Bean bags larger or smaller than 6 inches by 6 inches (15.24 cm by 15.24 cm) may make the game too difficult or too easy.
You can frequently find and buy pre-made Cornhole games at general retailers, sports stores, and sporting goods stores.;
, Team goals should be set up on level ground opposite from each other. The front of each goal should be 27 feet (8.2 m) apart from the other. The goal hole of each board should be positioned away from the opposing board.


You may want to orient your playing area to face north and south. This way, the sun will have less of a negative impact on play., You can play Cornhole with two or four players. Players should be divided evenly into two teams. Two player teams will have a player at each goal board, and single person teams will always throw from the same board.


The rules of Cornhole are relatively simple. If you're in need of players for your game, even complete beginners can pick it up quickly and enjoy playing., Each goal board begins with four bean bags apiece. The players at each goal board should alternate throwing bean bags at the opposite goal board until all four are thrown on one side. Then the opposite board players should do the same. This is repeated until a team reaches 21 points, total.


All throws should be made from behind the front of the board in an imaginary 3-foot ( .91 m) wide pitcher's box that extends the entire length of both sides of the board.
Bean bags that make it through the hole in the other team's goal board are worth three points. Bags that touch and remain on the board earn a single point. Bags knocked into the hole by another bag are also worth three points., When the competition is heated, players may argue about whether or not something was a foul. Because the Cornhole playing field is relatively large, it can be difficult for opposing teams to clearly distinguish fouls. A judge will help prevent this.


Although a judge is recommended for serious players and tournaments, a judge is not required to play this game.

, Now that you've got your teams assembled and the rules are explained, you're ready to start playing. Flip a coin to determine the team that throws first. After that, players should take their position beside or behind their goal board, alternating throws between teams.If you lack a coin, you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine the starting team instead.

, Following the rules carefully so as not to lose points to foul bags, throw your bags at the other team's goal board. Experiment with different underhand throws to find one that works best for you.


When using tall arc tosses, be sure to account for the wind, as it can have a significant effect on these throws.
Low arc tosses generally have more horizontal speed, resulting in more forward momentum. This can help your bag slide up the goal board into the hole.
Avoid throwing a bag higher than 5 - 10 feet (1.5 - 5.8 m). Tosses outside of this range suffer from decreased accuracy., Committing a foul in Cornhole will result in the foul bag being removed from play for that inning. Fouls occur when you play out of turn, step outside the pitcher's box while throwing, or when your bag touches the ground before coming to a stop on the goal board.


In official games, all players are expected to make each throw in under 20 seconds. Taking longer will also result in a foul.
You must always throw bean bags underhand. Overhand throws and side throws common in Frisbee are considered fouls.
As soon as a foul is committed, the foul bag should be removed from the board if necessary. Return any bags affected by the foul bag to their pre-foul positions., The end score of each inning is determined by cancellation scoring. This where you deduct the score of the lower point team from the point leader of that inning. Don't forget that bags knocked through the hole by another bean bag during play are worth the full three points.For example, if in a single inning Team A scored five points and Team B scored three points, the end score of that inning would be two points in Team A's favor., After you've calculated the points, you'll know which team was the point winner for that inning. This is the team that begins throwing the next round. If neither team scored in the inning, the first toss of the next round goes to the final pitcher of the preceding inning.


Continue playing innings until a team reaches 21 points. When that happens, the game is finished., Even though the three-point hole is toward the back of the board, throwing at the front of the board improves your chances of sliding a bag into the hole or landing one on the board for a single point. When aiming for the back of the board, it's easy to overthrow and get no points at all.


Landing bags on the goal board will create obstacles for your opponent. This can be a useful tactic for blocking points., Hold your bean bag so it is flat in your hand. When you throw, keep your wrist straight and use your fingers to create lateral spin, much like a Frisbee. This will give your bag a better chance of sliding into the hole for three points.As you release the bag, allow your index and middle fingers to stay in contact with the bag slightly longer than the others to help generate spin.You must use an underhanded release in Cornhole. Even though the side throw common with Frisbees feels natural for putting spin on the bag, it is illegal.

, Each individual will be different, but generally, you should hold the bag with four fingers under it and your thumb roughly at its top center. Keep your knees slightly bent, and lean you body a little over your throwing arm so it can swing and throw freely.


For the most consistent throw, try to keep your feet positioned the same every throw. A starting position with both feet close together is strong., Tension or nerves can hurt your performance. Try to enjoy yourself and have a good time. If you notice you start getting worked up over the game, you might want to take a break or recenter yourself with:


Deep breathing exercises. Take a deep, full breath while counting to five, hold it for a five count, then release the breath on a five count.
Muscle relaxation exercises. Tighten and release each muscle or muscle group for six second, starting from the top of your body and working your way down."

Wear gloves when you handle the granules. Ammonium Nitrate is not incredibly toxic if you happen to ingest any, but try not too. If it gets on your skin, wipe it off, and take a shower as soon as you can. Always wash your hands a couple times after you are finished.

,, Stir until the granules have just dissolved. If you add too much water, you will end up with bombs that don't smoke.

, Make sure you use an older one. Brand new newspapers have a waxy film that prevents them from lighting properly.

,, Put each one into the water, and swish them around, submerging each one into the liquid for about 30 seconds.

, Do this gently, as the sheets will tear easily.

, Driveway surfaces are fine to use as a drying space. If you are in a shady windy area, lay the newspaper sheets out and put rocks/weights on the four corners of each sheet to prevent them from flying away. You can tell when they are ready when they and can be lifted off of the pavement easily.

, Secure them with a string in the middle. Do not tie them too tight.


You can cut up the newspaper sheets, rip them in half, or leave them whole before rolling them up. You choose. Experiment with different lengths and widths.

",How to Make a Smoke Bomb from Potassium Nitrate and Sugar," If you don't have any weighing scales, don't worry, the ratio is 3 parts of potassium nitrate to 2 parts sugar, so you can just use a tablespoon or use the small spoons found in baby formula milk (e.g. Cow and Gate, Optamil).;
, Put the heat on as low as it will go. This prevents any unwanted accidents from happening.

, Stir continuously, but not vigorously, to prevent the material from burning. After about 10 minutes, you will notice that the powder starts to flow a bit like water. This happens because the sugar is caramelizing.

, After few minutes, brown lumps will start to appear. After another few minutes, the whole mixture will turn brown and will go all soggy,a bit like peanut butter.

, It is really important that you take it off when it looks like peanut butter, otherwise it will turn chocolaty, and eventually start to burn.


To make a tube for your smoke bomb, just get a toilet paper tube and tape the bottom using electrical tape or duct tape.
Clean your pan. A good thing to do would be to get a lighter and set any remaining bits on fire to make sure that the batch will work.

Unmold the smoke bomb.,
Light the smoke bomb.",How to Make a Smoke Bomb out of Household Materials1," A basic, easy smoke bomb that produces thick grey smoke with a purple flame can be made using just two ingredients: white granulated sugar and potassium nitrate, the ingredient found in cold packs.Mixing these two simply components together creates a slow-burning, long-lasting bomb.


If you don't have granulated sugar, you can use powdered sugar, but the process of building the smoke bomb will be a little different.
If you don't have a cold pack, look for another source of potassium nitrate (also known as saltpeter). It's often sold in the fertilizer section of hardware and garden stores. You can also buy saltpeter online or make it yourself if you're feeling ambitious.
You also need a medium-sized pot, aluminum foil, a smoke bomb mold, and waxed string (optional).;
, You can line any sort of container with the aluminum foil to make it into a smoke bomb. The shape of the smoke bomb will affect the way it burns. If you want, make more than one smoke bomb so you can compare different shapes and see which one burns the best. Here are a few mold ideas:


Cut the top off a paper milk carton and use the bottom half as a mold if you'd like a square smoke bomb. Line it with aluminum foil.
Line a bowl with aluminum foil. Any type of bowl works, whether it's deep or shallow.
Make tiny smoke bombs by lining votive candle holders with aluminum foil.
Make a tube-shaped bomb by lining the inside of a toilet paper roll with aluminum foil, making sure one end is completely covered.
Make a funnel-shaped smoke bomb by lining a funnel with foil.
Find an interestingly-shaped vase to make an artistic-looking smoke bomb.

, When it comes to making a great smoke bomb (one that you can easily light and that will burn for a nice long time), the most important thing to get right is the ratio of your ingredients. You need 3 parts potassium nitrate and 2 parts sugar. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of potassium nitrate and 1 cup sugar for a decent-sized smoke bomb.


Adding too much sugar will create a bomb that is difficult to ignite and burns quite slowly.
Adding too much potassium nitrate will create a bomb that lights quickly and burns up fast.

, You're going to melt the two ingredients together so that the sugar cooks and caramelizes with the potassium nitrate. Cook the ingredients over low heat. It is essential that you melt them slowly for the process to work correctly.


As you cook the ingredients, use a wooden spoon to stir them. You'll start to see the sugar melting a bit. If it starts smoking or smelling funny, reduce the heat immediately.
Continue cooking the mixture until the sugar is completely melted, stirring gently.
Stop stirring when the sugar is melted. Allow it to keep cooking until the sugar caramelizes and turns golden brown. When this happens, remove it from heat.

, Be very careful, since melted sugar is extremely hot. Fill up your mold almost to the top. If you want your bomb to have a wick, let the mixture set for a minute and then place a length of waxed string in the center, so that it stands up straight. Let the smoke bomb harden and completely cool in the mold.

, After a few hours, once the bomb is completely hard, it's time to take it out of the mold. Turn it upside down so that the bomb slips out of the mold in the aluminum foil. Remove the foil to reveal the molded smoke bomb.

, Take it to a place where there's nothing around that can catch on fire. Your backyard or another outside area is much preferable to any indoor space. Set it on the ground and use a match or lighter to light the smoke bomb. If you used a wick, you can light that and watch it burn down. Otherwise, just light the bomb directly. It should start smoking right away!


If your bomb won't light, chances are it's because the ration of potassium nitrate to sugar was a little off. Too much sugar will make it tough to light. Try again with exact measurements.
If your bomb burns away in a flash, it's probably because you had too much potassium nitrate in the mixture. Try again with more sugar.

Gather your materials.,
Decide what container to use for your smoke bomb.,
Grind the potassium nitrate.,
Mix the powders.,
Pour the mixture into your container.,
Light the smoke bomb.",How to Make a Smoke Bomb out of Household Materials2," The same basic components are used to make a dry sugar smoke bomb, but they're processed a bit differently. You will need the following:


Powdered sugar
Potassium nitrate (saltpeter)
A coffee or spice grinder, or mortar and pestle

A container with hold in the top
A piece of waxed string

, Making a smoke bomb using powder requires using a sturdy container that will stand upright. The powder will be poured directly into the container. Here are a few ideas:


Soft drink can
Toilet paper tube (covered on one end)
Chip container tube
Ping pong ballBlown-out egg (this is tricky, but quite impressive)

, In order to make sure your measurements are as exact as possible, it's necessary to grind the potassium nitrate before you mix it with the powdered sugar. In 1/2 cup increments, grind the potassium nitrate in a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder (one that you don't use for coffee anymore). Keep going until you've acquired 1 1/2 cups of powdered saltpeter.

, Mix 1 1/2 cups of powdered saltpeter and 1 cup of sugar. To make sure they are completely mixed, you can put them together in the coffee grinder and grind them together, or place them in a container with a lid and shake until they're completely blended.

, Carefully fill your container with the mixture. The more you use, the longer your smoke bomb will smoke. Stick the fuse in the top of the powder when the container is full.

, Light your fuse and watch it burn down to the powder. The powder will begin to smoke when the flame touches its surface.

Feed the top half of the string through the hole in the top of the egg.

,
Heap 2 tbsp of baking soda on the cling film, then close the egg.

,
Cellotape the closed seam shut.

,
Now you will have a sealed egg with some string sticking out of the top.,
When ready to use, jerk the string 'pin' to break the seal, give the grenade a quick shake and throw.,
Enjoy your grenade!",How to Make a Portable Soda Grenade," Most of the eggs already have a hole.;
, Be careful not to spill any. Cover the open end of the bottom half with cling film, leaving some slack in the centre. Now the vinegar should be sealed.

, When the grenade is complete, pulling the string should break the cling film and allow the soda and vinegar to mix.

,,,, Stick a strip of tape at the base of the string 'pin'. This will stop the gas leaking out of the hole when the soda and vinegar combine.

, If constructed properly, the grenade should not break into shrapnel, but split along the seam and violently spray the inside mixture outwards.

, If you are a budding soldier, carry around at least two grenades with you BB gun when going on patrol or playing.

Poke a small hole on either end of an egg.,
Stick your toothpick or pin deep inside the egg through one of the holes to pierce the yolk.,
Blow into one hole to gently force the liquid out of the egg.,
Rinse out the now empty eggshell and let it sit to air dry.,
Tape one end of the eggshell shut.,
Roll a sheet of paper into a funnel and stick it into the eggshell’s remaining hole.,
Pour the filling into the egg with the funnel and tape the remaining hole shut.,
Throw your egg bomb onto a hard surface!",How to Make a Simple Smoke Bomb1," You can use any small, pointed object, such as a toothpick or a pin. Make the hole wide enough that liquid inside the egg can flow out but not big enough that the egg cracks. Be sure to do this over a bowl or cup to avoid making a mess!;
, Wiggle your toothpick or pin gently from side to side. Make sure your toothpick or pin is long enough that it reaches at least halfway inside the egg. You may need to repeat this step if you have trouble getting all of the egg out of its shell. If you get any of the liquid on your hands, do not touch your clothing or near your mouth. Raw egg can carry bacteria called Salmonella that can make you very sick., It is generally best to blow on the more pointed end of the egg. Try to get as much of the egg’s contents out as you can. Be careful not to let your lips actually touch the shell! Under no circumstances should you attempt to suck the egg out. Remember that raw egg can make you sick!, If you are gentle enough, you can hold the eggshell under a faucet and allow water to flow through the shell. However, an easier alternative is to hold the eggshell in a bowl of warm, soapy water. Be sure to wash your hands and disinfect anything the raw egg may have touched!

, The next step will be easier if you tape the bottom. Any type of tape you happen to have should be fine. Don’t use too much tape or your smoke bomb won’t explode properly!

, You may need to widen the hole for the funnel to fit. If so, use the same tool you used to make the hole to gently chip a little more shell away. Be very careful not to crack the egg!

, You have a few relatively safe choices for your filling. The easiest is plain white flour or talcum (“baby”) powder. You can also make more colorful smoke bombs using dyed flour or crushed sidewalk chalk.If you have trouble with this step, ask someone to hold the egg upright for you while you hold the funnel and pour.

, The harder you throw, the bigger your smoke cloud will be. If you don’t want to use your smoke bomb right away, it can be stored for later use. The carton your eggs came in can be a convenient container!

Throw your napkin bomb onto a hard surface!",How to Make a Simple Smoke Bomb2," Don’t use so much water that the napkin is soggy or falling apart. If you don’t have any napkins, you can use a paper towel instead. Make sure that the paper towel is big enough and all one sheet (no perforations).








, As with the egg method, you can use flour or talcum powder for white smoke. Or you can make colorful smoke by either dyeing the flour or mixing crushed sidewalk chalk into the baby powder.Be aware that these more colorful methods may leave a stain!








, Be very gentle with this step! Make sure there are no tears on the payload end of the bomb. There is no need to let the napkin dry, as a moist napkin is easier to tear through. Just be careful it doesn’t “explode” prematurely!








, Just like the egg bombs, the harder you throw your napkin bomb the bigger your smoke cloud will be. Unlike egg bombs, napkin bombs are meant for immediate use. If you try to store a napkin bomb, the twisted end will most likely come apart and your filling will get everywhere.

Understand the dangers that exist with any type of pyrotechnics.,
Read the labels.,
Check the safety regulations of the location you plan to set off your sparkler bombs.,
Buy a set of sparklers.,
Tape some sparklers using electrical tape.,
Plant the sparklers into the ground pointed away from you.,
Light the wick, and GET BACK.",How to Make a Sparkler Bomb1," Sparkler bombs can be extremely dangerous if taken to extreme lengths. Binding enough sparklers together can result in a blast as strong as dynamite. Sparkler bombs can hurt or severely harm individuals who do not take the proper precautions set by their local authorities., If you are planning to make a Sparkler Bomb in the U.S. and use more than 50 milligrams of flash powder, you are breaking the law under the ATF regulations for consumer fireworks., Many areas prohibit the use of pyrotechnics of any kind. Do not set off your sparkler bomb indoors or any location without proper exits, ventilation, and fire safety equipment., Depending on the time of year, sparklers can be bought in many locations. Sparklers can be found in various sizes with the larger sizes lasting longer and giving off more effect. Sparkler bombs are usually made from the 10 inch sparklers.

Sparklers are wires that are coated in pyrotechnic material and iron fillings. Once lit, they emit a tiny amount of sparks that move down the wire for about 20 seconds., As you increase the number of sparklers you tape together, you will create a greater effect; however, each sparkler you add increases your risk for harm and danger. Do not exceed an amount that you have already seen tested by a professional or tested yourself.

Supervise your children so that they do not exceed a safe limit. 72 sparklers are enough to make a dangerous bomb blast. Read the labels and keep well below 50 milligrams of flash powder, the explosive content in firecrackers that is illegal under the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and explosives.Arrange them so that they are all facing the same way and tape them at the bottom where the is no longer any pyrotechnic material.
Wrap the bundle in tape 2-3 times, leaving an inch or so of the coated end exposed. It should now look like a cone.

, Do not hold the sparklers in your hand while lit. Many people have suffered severe burns and injuries for being too close to the flame. Plant the sparklers in the ground so that you can easily observe from a safe distance.

Make sure there is nothing flammable around the detonation area.
Make sure all pets and toddlers are secure and accounted for because you do not want them suddenly darting onto the scene.

, Using a single sparkler, light the rest of the sparkler bomb. Light the single sparkler, with matches or a lighter, away from the sparkler bomb. You want to be able to move to a safe distance as quickly as possible."

You’ll need a digital scale, KNO3 (potassium nitrate), powdered sugar, gloves, popsicle sticks or other stirring sticks, and a durable beaker.You’ll also need something to mold the liquified powders like a cardboard tube from a roll of paper towels.
KNO3 can be found at larger hardware stores. If you’re having trouble you could also look at hobbyist shops or online.
The best gloves for this type of project would be rubber gloves.
Wear protective eyewear and cover up your skin. These precautions are most important when you heat up the chemicals. Wear thick rubber gloves as well.You’ll also need the following supplies for the casing: paper toy caps, an exacto knife, tape, and black powder. Paper caps are the ammo used for toy cap guns.
Black powder or gunpowder can be found at most sporting stores that sell guns. If you’re having trouble, look online.;
, Use 70 grams (2.5 oz) of KNO3 and 30 grams of sugar. After weighing the powders dump them into the beaker and mix well., Use a hotplate on medium low heat. Wear your gloves and stir frequently to avoid the compound from burning. Continue heating and stirring until the mixture liquefies and turns a tan brown color.


Beware of burning! If you are not careful the mixture could burn and go up in smoke., Transfer the liquefied mixture into the casing of your choice. Use something small so you can use the smoke bombs on the fly.The best type of case is something you can easily remove once the mixture has set, like a quarter of a cardboard toilet roll. You could also use a film cartridge, like the type you send into a photo center.

, Give the mixture a few hours to settle. If you are feeling extra cautious, place the container into the fridge or freezer. This mix should take a little over an hour to cool in your freezer.

, Place a small piece of tape on the edge of the cap and attach it to the top of the KNO3 blob. Then wrap the outside of the hardened mixture with the caps. Seal the caps together with tape once the surface is fully covered. , Cut two strips of tape slightly larger than the KNO3. Lie one strip perpendicularly over the first piece of tape creating a cross. Do this with the adhesive sides facing up. Shake the black powder over the tape cross.


Try to leave the outer edge of the tape clear. , Now that you have prepared the tape cross with black powder, it's time to finish the job. Take the KNO3 coated in toy caps and wrap it in the cross. The cross should fit onto the bomb in an easy fashion. Once you smooth out all the air bubbles, you’re all finished.Throw the smoke bomb outside, using force, onto a hard surface like cement.

, Soak about 3 meters of yarn with the water, potassium nitrate, and sugar mixture. Using a cookie sheet, arrange the yarn so you can dry them out into lines.Do not use acrylic yarn.

, Air dry the yarn by keeping the cookie sheet in a dry area that won’t be disturbed by pets or children.If you do not have time to air dry the yarn, dry the yarn in your oven at 300 °F (150 °C) for about 20 minutes. Remember to watch the yarn. Open the oven and use tongs to shuffle the yarn off the pan after 5-10 minutes to prevent them from sticking.

, Once completely dry, cut the yarn into straight pieces to make sparklers. You can make them as long or as short as you want but don’t make it too short because it can quickly burn your hand., Use a glove to hold these homemade sparklers. You can also use a clip, clothespin, or anything else to keep the sparkler away from your fingers and hand."

Cut the striking strip to match the width of the matchbox.,
Place the strip inside the matchbox.,
Wrap the matchbox with tape.,
Set the matchbox off by hitting it or throwing it against a wall or the floor.",How to Make a Match Box Bomb1," You will need a matchbox full of matches and any tape of your choice. It can be masking, duct, or electrical tape and it should preferably be a new roll of tape as you'll be using quite a bit of it. This particular matchbox bomb explodes and engulfs the entire box and its contents. It also needs more force set off compared to other versions of the matchbox bomb, like the flaming fireball and explosive fireball.


Glue and scissors are optional.;
, For most matchboxes, the striking strip will be another layer of material on top of the box that can be easily ripped off. Be sure to keep the structure of the box intact.









If you decide to cut the strip off or accidentally rip open the box, don't worry. You'll be taping up the box quite excessively later. Ripping the striking strip off is just done out of convenience.

, Measure it against the top of your matchbox, or where the tips of your matchsticks touch.









Alternatively, you can fold the the striking strip to fit.

, The striking side should face or touch the matchstick heads. When friction is applied, such as you throwing the matchbox against a surface, the striking strip will light all the matchsticks at once.









If you're concerned that the strip will not hold its place, you can glue or tape the non-striking side onto the top of the inside of the matchbox.
Make sure your matches are all facing the right way (with the match heads facing the inserted striking strip). Align them by tapping the box on a surface.

, Close the matchbox and tape the box in all directions; horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Tape it until the corners are rounded or when the box feels cushioned.









Tape it tight or almost air-tight. This will ensure the matches stay in place and maximize its combustion effect.
You should hear no rattling once you're done taping.
For a bigger explosion, use duct tape or electrical tape. It's stronger and will help make the box more airtight.
For a more prolonged, flaming effect, masking tape or any paper-based tape will increase the flammability of the bomb.

, You can also set it off by hitting it with a tennis racket or bat. The matchbox will go off after a one second delay.









The match heads will rub against the striking strip and ignite. The gases from the flame will need to escape and since the box is almost airtight, a small scale explosion will follow to allow it to escape.Have a fire extinguisher or any other fire safety measures at ready in case an accident happens.

Grip the disc correctly.,
Get in the proper stance.,
Bring the disc back.,
Move the disc back behind your elbow.,
Keep the disc at a slight downward angle while moving it forward.,
Throw the disc.,
Follow through.,
Throw the high release flick.,
Throw the low release flick.,
Throw the ""pizza flip.""",How to Throw a Frisbee Forehand," To properly grip the disc for the forehand, you'll need to use your thumb, index finger, and middle finger while keeping the other fingers out of the way. These three fingers alone should be enough to hold the weight of the disc and to give you the power and control you need. Here's how to grip the disc:








You'll need to stick your thumb out, thumbs up style, and make a peace sign with your index and middle finger, making sure your palm is facing the sky. These are the three fingers you'll need.
Now, hold the disc with your left (or non-dominant) hand, logo side up, and place it over your ""peace sign"" fingers, while folding your thumb over the top of the disc.
Then, fold your ring and pinkie fingers into your hand as if you were making a loose fist, just touching your palm, to keep them out of the way.
Fold your middle finger toward your palm, pushing it against the inside of the rim. Your index finger should stay straight, pointed toward the center of the Frisbee, supporting some of its weight.
Squeeze the disc, pushing your thumb down and your middle finger tight against the rim.

For a variation, instead of the ""split fingers"" grip, you can move your index and middle fingers together for the power grip, which will give you more power but less control.

;
, Once you've got the grip down, you've got to step out, with your feet slightly more than shoulder width apart, pointing toward the receiver. Your knees should be slightly bent to help you maintain your balance and to gather power.







, Now, bring the disc back with your dominant hand while shifting your weight toward your throwing foot, so that about 80% of your weight is on your throwing foot, while 20% of your weight is on your other foot. Your arm should be close to parallel to the ground.








, Keep bringing it back until your elbow is in front of the disc, pointing toward the receiver. Bend your wrist back as far as you can. When you snap it forward, it will generate the momentum you need to spin the disc.








, The disc should be angled about 10 degrees downward parallel to the ground. Your throwing hand and arm should be parallel to the ground, with your other arm slightly behind you. You should increase the bend in your throwing foot a bit, too.








, Now, flick your wrist as you move your throwing arm from the outside to the inside of your body (the opposite motion of throwing a backhand). The power should come from the shoulder, passing naturally through the elbow and into the wrist, allowing the disc to spin. When you throw the disc, make sure that you rotate your body, using your throwing side first, and then your shoulders. Use your non-throwing hand to balance your body after it rotates, to create balance as you move it out and behind you a bit.









You may be tempted to flip your wrist because of throwing balls or playing other sports. But for throwing a disc, you should keep your palm facing up toward the sky so the disc will come off flat instead of flipping over, which is a common problem many first-time forehand throwers have.If you've ever skipped rocks, you can think of the wrist movement as being similar. In a sense, you are skipping the rocks by throwing a forehand, if this helps.

, After you release the disc, make sure to point after its flight path with your hand, keeping it level, with your palm up. Keep your pinkie and your ring finger slightly bent up and your hand level. Continue to look at the receiver to make sure that your disc is headed on the right path.







, This is the same as a regular forehand, except you throw it above your shoulder, flicking your wrist and raising your arm on release. This is good for getting around other people.








, This is essentially a very low forehand. Lunge to the side you're throwing on, sinking down as low as you can. Release the disc just inches from the ground, trying to get it under a defender's arms. Your elbow should just barely make it past your knee when you throw the disc. This is effective at all ranges, but a little bit tricky to master.








, This is used mostly for faking. Here, you start to do a regular forehand throw, but at the last minute, you rotate the disc counter-clockwise, under your throwing arm, by using just your middle finger to hold the disc. Then, you release the disc toward your dominant side, which will be perpendicular to the standard way you will throw the disc using a forehand.

Decide what kind of rope you want to buy.,
Select the right length.,
Ask for help.,
Buy your rope!",How to Size a Jump Rope1," The type of rope you purchase will depend on your experience/fitness level and how you plan to use your jump rope.


If you are a beginner jumper, then you may want to choose a cloth or beaded jump rope. These types of jump ropes turn more slowly and offer more control than PVC ropes, so they are a good choice for mastering form when you are just starting out. If you are an intermediate/fitness jumper, then you may want to choose a leather or PVC jump rope. These types of jump ropes are lightweight and they can move quickly for speed training. If you are an experienced/speed jumper, then you may want to choose a speed rope. Speed ropes are made of lightweight PVC and some speed ropes have ball bearings attached to the rope ends that help your rope turn even more quickly. ;
, You will need to buy a rope that is about 2-3 feet longer than your height. If you have trouble deciding between two lengths, go for the longer one. You are better off buying a rope that is too long than one that is too short. Remember that you can always reduce the length but you cannot add to it. , If you go to a sporting goods store, you can always ask one of the associates to help you with your purchase. They may even be able to size your jump rope for you in the store.

, Once you have decided on a rope type and size, purchase your jump rope. Depending on the type of rope you have decided to purchase, you may be able to pick one up at a local bargain store or you may have to go to a specialty sporting goods store.

Stand in front of a mirror with your jump rope.,
Step on your jump rope with one foot.,
Check the location of your handles in the mirror.,
Take note of how much length will need to be removed.",How to Size a Jump Rope2," You do not need to be able to see your whole body, just the upper half. Hold both jump rope handles in one hand and use your other hand to unwind your jump rope and straighten it out completely so that it touches the ground.

, Make sure that your foot is on the center of your jump rope. Pull on your rope handles and check the alignment of your handles to see if they are even. If they are not even, lift up your foot slightly and adjust the rope until your handles are even. Hold up both jump rope handles as high as they will go. Both handles should be vertical and the rope should be taut. , Look and see where the tops of your handles align with your body. If the rope is above your shoulder line, then it is too long and you will need to adjust it. For beginners, the tops of your rope handles should be just below your shoulder line but above your armpit. This length is ideal for kids and beginners because it will swing around more slowly than a shorter rope.
For fitness jumpers, the tops of your rope handles should be aligned with your armpit. This length is ideal for fitness jumpers because your rope will move quickly and it will be easier to control than the longer length. This length is also ideal for doing double unders, which is known as one of the most difficult CrossFit moves. Double unders are easier if your rope is well-sized For experienced speed jumpers, the tops of your rope handles should be an inch or two below your armpits.This length is ideal for speed jumpers because your rope will move quickly with less effort and it will be easier to control.

, If you have a ruler handy and you want to be extremely precise, you can measure the distance from the tops of your handles to their ideal placement. Otherwise, you can just eyeball it. "

Adjust the length of your rope.,
Test your rope size.,
Readjust your jump rope as needed.",How to Size a Jump Rope3," If your jump rope is too long, you will need to adjust the length. There are a couple of different ways to adjust the length of your jump rope.


The easiest way to adjust your jump rope’s size is by tying a knot or a couple of knots in the rope. Tie the knot as close to the handle as you can without letting the knot actually touch the handle. If you need more than one knot to adjust the size, tie one knot (or two) on each side of the rope. This method is best for beaded and cloth ropes., Make sure that you have enough space to jump rope and that you can see the topmost part of your jump rope as it swings over your head. If you can jump rope in front of a large mirror, that is ideal. If not, ask a friend to watch you. As you jump rope, notice the distance between the top of your head and the middle of your rope.


For beginner jumpers, this distance should be about 16-30 inches. For fitness jumpers, this distance should be about 6-10 inches. For speed jumpers, this distance should be about 2-6 inches. Speed and control , If your jump rope seems too long or too short, you can always readjust it by adding or taking out one of the knots that you made.

"

Remove handle cap.,
Pull excess rope through handle.,
Cut off excess rope.,
Knot or crimp the end of your rope.,
Test your rope size.,
Readjust your jump rope as needed.",How to Size a Jump Rope4," Not all jump ropes have handle caps, but if your jump rope has a handle cap, you will need to remove it before proceeding. Follow the product instructions for how to remove the handle cap.

, Pull enough rope through the handle to cut rope to the desired length. Measure this length twice before cutting it off.


Leave a few extra inches if you will be knotting the end of the rope after you cut it.
If you will be crimping the end of the rope with a clamp that was included with your jump rope, then you can leave a little less length. But it is a good idea to err on the side of caution and leave yourself a few extra inches just in case.

, Step on the middle of the rope and hold the other end to make the rope slightly taut, then make the cut. Do not stretch the rope beyond it's normal length before you make the cut, just make sure that it is straight when you cut it.

, With the end of your rope still pulled through the jump rope handle, tie a knot in the rope or use the crimp that was included with your jump rope to secure the end of your rope. Follow the product instructions for removing the crimp from the severed rope and replacing it on the resized rope.

, Make sure that you have enough space to jump rope and that you can see the topmost part of your jump rope as it swings over your head. If you can jump rope in front of a large mirror, that is ideal. If not, ask a friend to watch you. As you jump rope, notice the distance between the top of your head and the middle of your rope.


For beginner jumpers, this distance should be about 16-30 inches. For fitness jumpers, this distance should be about 6-10 inches. For speed jumpers, this distance should be about 2-6 inches. Speed and control , If your jump rope still seems too long, readjust it by removing another inch or two off the end and knotting or crimping the end.

Find two suitable sticks for the game play.,Find two large stones or two bricks as well.,
Place the objects in position.,
Divide the players into two equal groups.,
Choose the team to start the game.,
Have the first player from the first team pick up the longer stick (Ălăk).,
Have the first team choose one of its more precise throwers to pick up the shorter stick (Dolăk) and throw it towards the stones.,
Play as many rounds as decided beforehand.",How to Play Alak Dolak (Ălăk Dolăk)," One stick needs to measure approximately 70cm (27 inches) in length, while the other should measure approximately and 30 centimeters (12 inches) in length.

The longer stick is called Ălăk and the shorter one Dolăk.;
,, Put the two stones or bricks at a distance from each other equal to the length of the shorter stick, Dolăk, then balance the shorter stick on top of them. This is the stick that the players will hit., The members of the groups are selected by the “heads”, who are usually the older and more experienced players on the playground., The team is chosen by drawing lots. Once chosen, have this team stand behind the stones. The members of other team, keeping a short distance between each other, stand 20 to 30 meters (65.6 to 98.4 ft) away from the first team., The player must then hit the shorter stick (Dolăk) balanced on the stones or bricks. It needs to be hit hard, in order to cause it to move towards the part of the playground where the other team is standing. If the players of the other team can catch the stick in the air before it hits the ground, they will win the round, which starts off the next round (switching teams). However, if they fail to catch the stick, it will fall somewhere on the ground.

Throw long and hard. The farther the stick falls from the stones, the harder the next move will be for the first team to achieve.

, The aim is to ensure that the Dolăk falls a distance shorter than the length of the Ălăk (70cm/27 inches) from the stones or bricks. This will then start the next round.

The team will also win if the Dolăk passes through (in between) the two stones.

, The team with the most accurate throws will win the whole game."

Buy or make a cornhole set.,
Set the boards between 27 feet (8.2 m) and 45 feet (13.7 m) apart.,
Choose to play singles or doubles.,
Throw the bags at the opposite board, aiming for the hole.,
Score the round.,
End the game when someone ends a round with exactly 21 points.",How to Play Bean Bag Toss1," Many sporting goods stores and big-box stores sell manufactured cornhole sets of varying degrees of quality. Buying a set is the simpler route, but potentially more costly. If you don’t want to buy a set, build a cornhole game yourself and customize it any way you wish.


If you want to throw together a quick game, cut two 2ftx4ft (.6mx1.2m) pieces of cardboard for makeshift boards. Cut a hole near one end of each board that is six inches (15 cm) in diameter. Prop the boards up so the hole end is six or eight inches (20 cm) off of the ground.;
, Choose the distance depending on the skill level and preference of those playing the game. Set the boards in a straight line with each other.Regulation rules state that boards should be 45 feet apart, but casual players may opt for closer to 30 feet (9 m) apart.
For younger players, set the boards 10-15 feet apart.

, Cornhole is played with either two players or four players. For a singles game, players stand at the same board and throw to the opposite board. For a doubles game, one player from each team stands at each board and they throw back and forth.Designate a bean bag color for each team. For singles, each player should have four bags of the same color. For doubles, each team should have four bags of the same color.

, Choose one player to start the first round and alternate so that each player on that side throws one bag at a time. Players must stay behind the the front of the board or the throw does not count. Once all eight bags have been thrown, count up the score for that round.


Bags that hit the ground before they hit the board do not count. If the bag is hanging on the edge of the board and touching the ground, it doesn’t count.
Players aim to get bags in the hole, but they also get points for bags that land on the board.

, For every bag that a player gets on the board, they get one point. For every bag that a player gets in the hole, they get three points. Add up each team’s total and subtract the lower number from the higher number. The player with the higher score gets the points that remain after the lower player’s score is subtracted.For example, one team uses blue bags and one team uses red bags. The blue team gets two bags on the board and two bags in the hole for a total of eight points. The red team gets one on the board and one in the hole for a total of four points. Subtract four (red team) from eight (blue team) and the blue team scores four points that round.

, Continue to add each round’s score to each team or player’s total. The game ends when someone has 21 points at the end of a round. If a round ends and a player or team has over 21 points, they must go back to 11 and the game continues.Players who know their opponent is over 21 often throw their bags away from the board on purpose to make their opponent bust.

Use this for an easy, but sturdy hacky sack.,
Cut an old sock.,
Sew one piece most of the way closed.,
Pour in rice or other material.,
Sew the sock closed.,
Sew the second sock over the first.",How to Make a Hacky Sack1," Anyone can make this hackysack, even if you've never sewed before. The result is pretty sturdy if you use strong thread. One disadvantage is that sand – a great stuffing for beginners or people practicing tricks – will leak out the hole. Most players will still have plenty of fun with rice or lentil stuffing instead.;
, Find a pair of old socks without holes or worn areas. Cut off the tip of each one, about 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm) from the toes., Thread a needle with a long piece of strong thread. Pull it through both sides of the sock, near the hole. Continue sewing by moving the needle back through the sock again in the other direction. Repeat this back-and-forth movement until the sock is sewn mostly shut. Leave a gap for stuffing the sock.


Polyester thread is cheap and strong, making it a good choice for this project.The closer together your thread lines, the less your hacky sack will leak stuffing.

, Stick a funnel in the hole, or a rolled-up paper cone. Fill the sock with stuffing material. Uncooked rice or lentils are cheap and large enough that they won't fall out much. Plastic pellets or steel pellets from a hobby store will give more control, and feel more like commercial hacky sacks.Sand and birdseed tends to leak out of this style hacky sack.

, Finish sewing the hole shut once the sock is filled. Tie the thread into a knot and snip off the excess.

, For extra protection, pull the second piece of sock over the first. Sew it shut just as you did the first one. Align this sock so the two holes are on opposite ends, reducing the chance of material leaking out.

Set up a ladder for a bean bag toss.,
Use bean bags to play tic-tac-toe.,
Play bean bag basketball using a bucket.,
Practice reading with a flashcard bean bag toss game.",How to Play Bean Bag Toss2," Set up a ladder in the backyard and write 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 on sheets of paper. Tape one piece to each step of the ladder. Have kids toss bean bags between the steps of the ladder. Keep track of the points they score as they play.Have bonuses for getting a bean bag to land on one of the steps.
This works great for one kid, who can try to beat their own score each time, or let multiple kids play to see who gets the highest score.
Make more or less point cards depending on how many steps the ladder has.

, Make a tic-tac-toe grid on the ground with chalk, tape, or pieces of rope. With two different colors of bean bags, allow players to toss their bags into spaces on the grid. Each player tries to get three in a row to win the game.Make a line a few feet from the grid that players have to stand behind to add a challenge to the game.

, Get a bucket and set it on the ground. Have the child stand five to ten feet from the bucket and attempt to throw the bean bag into the bucket. Use three or four bean bags to see how many they can make in the bucket. Let multiple children takes turn and see who gets the most bags in the bucket.This game allows for many variations such as using their non-dominant hand, closing one eye, throwing it over their head at the bucket behind them, or simply standing at farther distances.
If you don’t have a bucket, use a box or any other container that some bean bags will fit in.

, Take a set of flashcards with colors, numbers, or other vocabulary words and lay them out on the ground. Have kids throw a bean bag and try to land it on one of the cards. If the bag lands on a card, have them pick it up and read the word on it.This is a fun way to practice reading skills and also get them active.
This game can be modified by changing the cards to fit any type of learning you need. Make flashcards with math problems on them or pictures to work on recognition.

Stick a funnel into the neck of a balloon.,
Fill with sand or other material.,
Cut off the neck.,
Cover with several more balloons.",How to Make a Hacky Sack2," Balloon sacks are super quick and easy to make. They won't last as long as other hacky sacks, but a replacement will only cost you a few minutes and a dip in the change jar.

, Get a round, uninflated balloon. Stretch the opening wide and push in the end of a funnel.


If you don't have a funnel, make one out of paper.

, Sand-filled sacks are easy to ""stall"" on the foot, useful for beginners or people learning tricks.Birdseed, dried beans or lentils, uncooked rice, or small beads are other fine alternatives. Fill the balloon to the neck.

, Remove any dangling rubber, to make the sack spherical.


If using fine sand, you may want to tie a knot instead. This helps stop sand leaking out, but the knot will make the ball bumpy.

, Pull another balloon over the exposed hole and around the whole ball. Cut off the neck. Repeat with at least two more balloons, covering each previous hole.For a stronger sack, use up to ten balloons.


For decoration, you can cut small holes in the balloons so the different color shows through."

, Create a chain of six stitches, not counting the initial slipknot or the loop of yarn still on the hook.


If you don't know how to crochet, review the information here.

, You only need to know this most basic crochet stitch to make a hacky sack. Read the full details here.


In the UK, this is called the double stitch.

, Insert the hook back in the first stitch. Complete a single crochet twice in this stitch. Repeat for each stitch in the row, for 12 total stitches.


If you're having trouble fitting two single crochets in one stitch, loosen your stitches a little.
Don't reverse direction – you want a circle, not a square.

, Start the next row Perform two single crochets inside the next stitch. Perform one single crochet in the next stitch. Alternate this 2sc, sc pattern down the row, for 18 stitches.

, As you do this, you'll see the ball taking shape, becoming wider. Follow these patterns for each row, using two single crochets per stitch where it says ""2c"" and one single crochet where it says ""sc:""


Row 4: 2sc, sc, sc, repeat to make 24 stitches
Row 5: 2sc, sc, sc, sc, repeat to make 30 stitches
Row 6: 2sc, sc, sc, sc, sc, repeat to make 36 stitches

, Just repeat one single crochet per stitch to create the middle of the ball. Do this for seven rows (Rows 7–13). There should be 36 stitches per row.

, You'll need to decrease the number of stitches to close the ball again. To do this, simply grab the next stitch and pulling a single crochet through both stitches at once. In other words:Grab the next stitch and pull a loop through as usual (two loops on the hook).
Grab the next stitch and pull another loop through all of them (three loops on the hook).
Complete the single crochet by grabbing another loop of yarn, and pulling it through all three loops.

, Start narrowing the ball size by decreasing each row. Follow these instructions, decreasing each time it says ""dec:""


Row 14: dec, sc, sc, sc, sc, repeat to make 30 stitches
Row 15: dec, sc, sc, sc, repeat to make 24 stitches

, Pour in plastic pellets, uncooked rice, or dried lentils. If you want to use sand or birdseed, you'll need to sew it into a sock, then drop it into the crocheted hacky sack.


You may need to finish filling the sack as you go. Do this between rows, to avoid losing your place.

, Continue shortening each row until the hacky sack is closed enough to keep the material inside. This should do it:


Row 16: dec, sc, sc, repeat to make 18 stitches
Row 17: dec, sc, repeat to make 12 stitches
Row 18: dec until hole is small enough to close off. (If stitching loosely, you may need to repeat this for another row.)

, Weave the yarn through one of the stitches, pulling it with the hook or a yarn needle. Repeat to weave it through several stitches, then lock it in place by reversing direction and weaving through several more.Snip off the rest of the yarn.

",How to Play Hacky Sack in a Group,";
,, Ganking is when another member is in the process of kicking the hacky-sack and someone steals it from them in mid-kick.

,,, You'll look pretty stupid when the hack is laying 5 inches (12.7 cm) in front of your feet.

, Which is somebody who continues on for a while showing off their moves. Nobody likes a hog.

, When you are new to a circle, get a feel for the mood before you start flapping your mouth.

, If you are, go and get it, regardless of who kicked it last. Note that this procedure varies depending on the dynamic of the group. In some groups, members will say ""not it"", and the last person to say this will be forced to get the hack, regardless of their place in the circle.

, The game will go slowly and be more embarrassing for you if you drop the hack every time it's passed to you.

Find an area near you that minimizes the potential for fire.",How to Make a Match Head Tennis Ball Bomb," Most of the items can be found in just one convenience store. Look to larger convenience stores such as Walmart or Target to find everything you need.


Check hardware or DIY stores such as Home Depot or Lowes for hardware that might not be available at a convenience store, such as box cutters or bulk matches.
Other types of balls are also viable for this explosive, provided they are hollow and support resealing, such as ping pong balls.;
, You want around 1,000 match heads in order to fill up the tennis ball completely. Safety matches will not work unless you also place a striker inside of the tennis ball along with the match heads.


Remove the striker strip from a match box if you are using safety matches. The strip is small and pliable enough to be inserted into the tennis ball.

, Use scissors to snip the match heads off of the body. Don’t worry about being too precise. The bomb will still function if some match heads have a bit of wood left over.


Take care when handling the match heads. If you used strike anywhere matches, friction between the match heads could cause them to prematurely ignite.
Separate the match heads into separate groups. That way, if a set of match heads accidentally ignite, you don't lose all of your work.

, Use a pair of sharp scissors, a knife, or a box cutter to cut into the tennis ball. You only need to create enough room to be able to insert the match heads. A pea-sized opening will suffice.


Make the hole a bit larger if you want to be able to insert several match heads at a time.
A funnel is useful for adding match heads to the tennis ball, provided the funnel's material does not ignite the match heads as they are passing through.

, Take care to not accidentally strike any of the match heads while placing them in the tennis ball. This will ruin the tennis ball and potentially cause injury.


If you are using safety matches, insert the striker that you peeled from the match box only after you've placed all of the match heads into the tennis ball. The match heads will need to rub against this striker in order to ignite., Use between 1 and 3 layers of tape to cover the tennis ball. Increasing the thickness of the ball with tape will increase the power of the explosion thanks to a greater build up of internal pressure. Don't use too many layers, however, as covering the tennis ball with too many layers of tape will prevent the tennis ball from exploding.


Other types of tape, such as scotch or masking tape, do not provide the strength needed to build up enough internal pressure for the tennis ball to explode.
Glue the hole in the tennis ball shut prior to wrapping in order to ensure the match heads are secured tight (optional).

, Give yourself and the explosive plenty of clearance. The tennis ball will detonate shortly after hitting the ground or receiving a solid jolt, so be careful when throwing the tennis ball. Sparks and debris will fly a greater distance depending on the number of matches in the tennis ball and how tightly it was wrapped.


The tennis ball will emit a large crack sound upon exploding, not unlike a firecracker. Though the explosion itself will not be terribly large, expect sparks, match heads, and debris to disperse in a large, variable area, depending on how tightly the tennis ball was wrapped in tape. If done correctly, the explosion will look like a miniature firework display.
If the tennis ball does not detonate shortly after throwing, wait between 15 and 30 seconds before attempting to pick the tennis ball up again. You want to make absolutely sure nothing in the tennis ball has ignited before handling. A delayed explosion is possible if only a few match heads ignite upon impact.
The tennis ball may also be launched using a tennis ball launcher or other mortar devices. Note that harsh movement will ignite the match heads within the ball. Launch a few standard tennis balls first to make sure the mortar works properly.

, Before purchasing any materials, make sure you understand the laws and regulations associated with explosives. These regulations range from the Federal level to more local jurisdictions. Make sure you are not performing something illegal in your area by doing your research.Go to your state police department website to read up on explosives and fireworks laws local to your area.
Some states allow fireworks, but have a set definition on what the term includes. If you aren't using legal fireworks in that state, you are committing a felony.

, It goes without saying that creating a bomb is dangerous. There are a number of precautions that must be taken for safety when handling explosives and explosive materials.


Have an emergency supply of water nearby for putting out any fires.
Wear safety glasses. Explosives (including a match head tennis ball bomb) create sparks and debris that can injure your eyes.
Use explosives outdoors only.
Give yourself, and the explosive, plenty of room to operate.
Do not throw explosives at other people or animals., Fire risk is determined by the surroundings of where you set of the explosive. Strong winds or dry weather also further increase the risk of a spreading fire – explosives should not be detonated during such weather.


Do not set off the explosive near homes, sheds or other structures.
Look for a site that is at least fifteen feet away from shrubs, trees or other flammable plant life.
Detonate the bomb over dirt or gravel if possible. The explosion site should be surrounded by dirt and gravel for 10 feet in all directions.
Once the bomb has exploded, travel to the detonation site to ensure embers are extinguished. Use water if necessary to put out kindling and cover with dirt and gravel to smother the remnants. "

Lavender, peppermint, and lemon are a great combination because they all have odor-eliminating and antimicrobial properties.Another option would be a combination of peppermint, tea tree, orange, and lavender. Make sure that the spray bottle you use has a light mist.

, Go slowly and don't let the mixture fizz. If the mixture fizzes, that means it is too wet, and it won't work properly later on. You want the mixture to be damp enough so that it clumps together when you squeeze it. It's okay if it crumbles a little.If it is still too dry, spray a little water onto it. Plan on using about 1 teaspoon. Again, don't let it fizz., You can use silicone ice cube, cupcake, or bath bomb molds, all of which can be found in your local craft shop. You can also use plastic ice cube trays, soap making molds, or candy molds as well. Some people like to use mini muffin tins trays as well.

,
After becoming proficient in the basic kicks and stalls, join a sack circle or check out the internet to learn more advanced sack moves.








",How to Play Hacky Sack," The ultimate goal for group “sacking it up” is to keep the bag in the air for as long as possible. In a group, if every person kicks the bag at least once then the group has completed a “round” or a ""hack."" When every person kicks the bag at least two times around, they have completed a “double helix” and so on. The objectives are different if you're by yourself. Individual freestyle sack has evolved to a very complex sport with a myriad of kicks and stalls strung together to form tricks.






;
, The larger the beads, the harder it will be to stall the sack. If you have a bag with large beads, consider rolling over it with something very heavy, such as a car, to break them down.








, Skate shoes can be good to learn with; they provide many areas from which you can kick and stall the bag. Beyond the basics, however, tennis shoes are a favorite among even the professionals.








, Pants restrict your movement and provide a surface that increases the likelihood of knocking the sack off its intended path.








,










Inside kick: Gently drop the sack in front of you. Use the inside of the foot, almost directly in the center of your shoe where the arch of your foot is, to kick the bag directly straight up. Angle your ankle so that the inside of the foot is parallel to the ceiling. This will ensure that the bag will go directly up and not off to the side. It helps to bend the other standing leg as well. After one kick, catch the sack in your hand. Repeat dropping, kicking, and catching until you are consistently kicking the bag straight up. Next, try kicking the bag using alternating feet and no hands. See how many you can do in a row!

Outside kick: Gently drop the sack with your arm outstretched to the side, and use the middle of the outside of the foot to kick the bag. This is harder to do, but remember the tips above – angle your ankle to keep the outside of the foot parallel to the ceiling, and bend the standing leg.

Toe kick: Gently drop the sack in front of you, but at a greater distance than the inside kick. Use the toes to kick the bag straight up in the air. This kick is similar to the one commonly used to juggle a soccer ball.

,










Inside stall: Drop the sack in front of you. Using the inside of the foot, in the middle of the shoe, catch the sack with the foot by gently lowering the foot a couple of inches (a few centimeters) in a cradling motion. This will help absorb the impact of the bag on the foot and keep it from bouncing off the side. Imagine catching the bag as you would a raw egg or water balloon.

Outside stall: Drop the bag to the outside and cradle the bag by lowering the foot a couple of inches.

Toe stall: Drop the bag to the front and again, cradle the bag by lowering the foot a couple of inches.

, Try doing patterns, such as outside left, inside left, inside right, outside right, or whatever you want to make up. This will help you learn to control where you want the bag to go.








, Also, this helps with kicking too hard, or having kicks go off in random places; the knee is a pivot, and it will not go perfectly straight up.








, In order to keep a hack going, you may need to stall it on your back, chest, neck, face, knee, or even between your chin and neck. The important thing here is to keep it going.








, This will undoubtedly increase the length of your kicking sessions and cause less strain on your muscles.








, Like most motor skill activities it is better to practice for a few minutes or a half-hour each day than to practice for hours at a time every once in a while.

, You'll probably want to make it big enough for 2-4 people and make some room for extra items.

, You could cover your hideout with things like leaves or twigs to make it seem like other people think that there's nothing there.

, You could bring in things like lawn chairs for people to sit in, a snack drawer, or pillows and a soft blanket for people to lay on.

, You'll need to make a good door to keep people out whenever you leave your hideout. Again, things found in nature work perfect. You could also improvise by getting a wood board and gluing things on it like bark, leaves, or twigs to give it a more of a nature look.

Analyse your closet.,
Look for things you can use to hold your spy files.,
Add comfort items.,
Keep a phone or a walkie talkie in your ""base"".,
Make a disguising system.,
Enjoy your base!,
Put a iPad or iPhone somewhere in your base where anybody who is not in your spy group can't see so it records anyone/anything that comes inside your closet and that way you will be able to find out what they did and what they looked at.

",How to Make a Spy Base in Your Closet," If your closet is very small (example: it only has room to hold your clothes and some shoes, and that's it) this may not be the best idea because you will be very cramped and you want to be comfortable, remember? Walk-ins are perfect for organizations with lots of people.;
, Don't get a box and label it ""Spy Files"" and put it somewhere obvious (this IS a secret, remember?), instead, try to obtain a shoebox that is fairly large (can fit a 8 1/2 by 11"" piece of paper inside without bending it) and put some shoes on top of your files. Or, get a folder and label it ""Math"" or another school subject. And, if you keep a notebook like Harriet from Harriet the Spy, the shoebox trick will work too. See the article Hide Your Diary for more ideas.

, Put a blanket down on the floor, add some pillows in the corners, bring in things like portable DVD players and lamps for light if you don't have one. If you have an electric plug near or in your closet, you can plug in things that aren't battery-operated or chargers. Some things you can put in your spy base are your iPod dock, laptop, DVD player, and iPod.

, This is useful if another member calls you with information, so you don't have to get up out of your spy base to answer a call. Cell phones are easier to use, because if you get a call, no one can pick up the other phone, turn it on, and listen in. It helps to have your own phone in your room.

, You don't want anyone to discover your base, do you? So, create a system to disguise it. There's always the option of taking your base apart entirely, but it would be a pain to put back together after. An example is to roll up the blanket and put it in a corner, stack the pillows up by the blanket, and unplug any electronics and put them in a box marked ""Storage"". That way, if anyone looks in your closet, they will just think you are storing things in there.

, Once you are done, go inside your base and relax!,"

Get some seating.,
Make it look nice.,
Keep a stash of snacks.,
Have some entertainment on hand.,
Store any club supplies in a box.",How to Make a Secret Hideout in Your Closet1," Choose a spot that you can sit in, without things getting in the way. If your closet has some clothes hanging in it, find a spot under the shorter clothes. They will help keep you hidden, and you will still be able to sit. You should be able to sit cross-legged in your hideout. If you can't, move some stuff around. You may have to move boxes and shoes to another part of the closet. If you don't have a closet at all, try one of these places:


A spot under a desk
A corner in a room—even better if it's behind some furniture
A large cupboard or cabinet
A wardrobe;
, Closets can get dusty and dirty. If the floor is made out of wood, use a broom to sweep it. If the floor is made out of carpet, use a vacuum. Pick up any pieces of trash, and put them into the trashcan.

, You can make a sign out of paper or cardboard, and hang it outside your closet. You can also hang some fabric inside the doorway of your closet. A quick and easy way to do this is to take a bed sheet, and tack both top corners to the top of the doorway.

, If your closet has an outlet nearby, you can plug a small lamp into it. You can also use a nightlight instead. If there are not outlets, here are some other options:


A large flashlight
A battery-operated light
A light-up toy
Glow sticks

, Closets are small and cramped, and not very comfortable. You can make it more comfortable by giving yourself some place soft to sit. Try one of these items:


A pillow or cushion
A folded blanket
A folded sweater or sweatshirt
A beanbag chair

, Hang up some pictures of posters inside your hideout. You can use tape, poster putty, or thumb tacks. You can also hang up things like tinsel, flower garlands, or strings of pretty beads.

, First, ask your parents if you can keep some snacks in your hideout. Pick snacks that come in wrappers, and stay away from anything crumbly. Here are some ideas:


Gummy fruit
Nuts
Candy
Small crackers, like goldfish

, Hideouts are no fun if you have nothing to keep you busy! Think of what you like to do for fun, then put some related items into your hideout. Here are some ideas:


If you like to draw, have a pad of paper, pencils, crayons, and markers.
If you like to write, keep a journal and some pens or pencils.
If you like to play games, keep a board game or a deck of cards near by.
If you like to keep entertained, keep a radio, music player, laptop, or tablet in your closet.
If you like to read, pick out some of your favorite books, and keep them inside your closet. You'll need a flashlight too!

, You can use your closet as a base for your club. If you have supplies for your club, like notes and badges, put everything into a box. Keep the box in the corner of your hideout.


Pick a box that blends in, like a shoe box. No one will suspect anything!
You can still have a hideout even if you don't have a club!

"
Have a secret password.,
Hold small club meetings in your hideout.,
Do quiet things you enjoy.,
Take a nap.,
Stay safe.",How to Make a Secret Hideout in Your Closet2," When you are inside your hideout, don't let anyone come in unless they know your password. Tell your password to people you trust, and make them promise not to tell anyone.


You can let people come into your hideout if they ask nicely. You can tell them the password later.

, If your club is small, and has only two or three people, then you can meet in your hideout. Don't hold bigger club meetings in your hideout. There isn't enough space.

, Some things are perfect for small spaces, such as reading, drawing, or writing. If you have a hobby that you enjoy, see if you can do it in your hideout.


Remember to clean up after yourself!
Save noisy hobbies, like singing, for other places. If you make too much noise, people will know where you are!

, If you are tired and your room is too bright or noisy, you can take a nap inside your hideout instead. Take your pillow and blanket, and curl up inside. If you sleep with a teddy bear, bring him or her too!


Remember to leave the closet door open!

, You may have rules for other people, such as ""no coming in,"" but you should follow some important safety rules too! When you are playing inside your hideout, remember these rules:


Do not close your closet door if you are inside. You may run out of air, or you may get stuck.
Do not block your way out. If there is an emergency, you may not be able to get out in time.
Do not leave electronics on if you are not inside. Things like lights and laptops get hot, and they can cause a fire in such a small space.
Do not light candles, even if you are careful. You can get those fake, battery-operated candles, however.

Consider turning your child's closet into a secret hideaway.,
Take everything out of the closet, and clean the inside.,
Pick a theme.,
Paint the walls, if desired.,
Consider adding a carpet/rug.,
Decorate the walls.,
Don't forget the ceiling.,
Add organization.,
Make it comfy and private.",How to Make a Secret Hideout in Your Closet3," This is a great way to encourage your child's imagination and creativity. It will also give your child a small space to do something quiet, such as play, read, or draw. In this section, you'll find lots of ideas on how to transform your child's closet into the ultimate hideout.


You do not have to do everything in this section. Simply choose the ideas that appeal the most to you. Your child will appreciate anything that you do.

, This will help give you a fresh start. If you plan on painting or redoing the inside of the closet, then you will need to take everything out anyways.


If you don't have a closet, consider using a wardrobe or a cabinet instead. As long as your child can sit comfortably inside of it, you have the basis for a hideout!

, This will help you choose what sorts of colors and decorations you should use. Start with something that your child enjoys, such as princesses, superheroes, jungles, or pirates. If your child's interests change often, choose something that matches his or her room, or use your child's favorite colors.

, Stepping into a closet can be like stepping into a different world. You can take this concept further by painting the inside of your child's closet a different color. Here are some more tips and ideas to get you started:


Paint a mural. Give the closet a fresh coat of paint first, then paint some designs or scenes onto it. You can do this freehand, or you can use stencils.
Give the closet an accent wall. Paint the side walls white or off-white, and the back wall your child's favorite color.
Paint the walls a lighter color, and the ceiling a darker color. This will make the closet appear bigger. You can extend the dark color by a few inches to make the closet appear even bigger.Add some white trim if the walls are colored. This is a great way to anchor down your design, and add some variation to the closet.

, This is not necessary, but it can help your child's closet feel like a completely different world. This does not mean that you have to completely rip out the old carpet and install a new one; you can purchase a solid-colored rug, cut it down to the right size, and set it down on the closet floor. Try to match the carpet to the theme. Here are some ideas to get your started:


If you are going with a desert, pirate, or ocean theme, consider putting down a light tan carpet to resemble sand.
If you are going with an enchanted forest theme, consider putting down some green carpet or fake grass.
If you are going with a winter wonderland theme, consider a light blue carpet or a light grey carpet. Avoid white, as this will be difficult to keep clean.

, Colorful walls are a great start to transforming your child's closet into another world, but they can get boring if they are plain. You can make the walls look more interesting by hanging things onto them that match the theme. Here are some ideas to get your started:


For a forest or jungle theme, you could hang floral or ivy garlands along the top of the walls.
For a magical look, consider hanging some Christmas lights along the top of the walls. If the closet does not have an outlet nearby, use battery-operated lights.
Make use of wall decals and wall stickers. These are great if your child's interests change. Once your child gets bored of a certain theme, simply pull the old decals off, and apply new ones.Use paper cutouts for something quick and easy. For example, if your child likes the ocean, you could always cut some fish shapes out of colorful construction paper, and then stitch it onto the walls using tape.
Add some sensory or educational play for a young child. Felt boards with alphabets, numbers, and shapes are a great way to keep your child engaged while teaching him or her new things.

, This is a part of the room that is often over-looked, but it can really take your child's hideout to the next level.Here are some ideas:


Paint the ceiling a dark color, then stick on some glow-in-the-dark stars.
Paint the ceiling light blue, then add fluffy, white clouds.
Paint the ceiling to resemble a forest or jungle canopy, complete with green leaves, branches, and colorful birds. You could even add a fairy or two!
If the closet has a light in it, change the bulb and fixture to something the matches the theme.
Suspend lightweight items from the ceiling using fishing line. Depending on the theme, you can use fake birds or butterflies (from the floral department of an arts and crafts store), model spaceships, fish cutouts, snowflakes, etc.

, Depending on how big your closet is, and what you plan on using it for, there are lots of things that you can do. Plan on storing items that your child will use in his or her hideout. For example, if your child will be using the hideout to play, you will need something to store his or her toys. Here are some ideas for you:


If your child likes to read, turn the closet into a reading nook. Add some shelves to one of the walls.If your child likes to draw, mount some baskets, cubbies, or folders onto the wall. Store your child's sketchbooks and coloring books in these.
If your child likes to play with toys or do arts and crafts, add some baskets to keep the closet clean. You can use loose baskets, or you can use a plastic storage unit with drawers.
Add some hooks. These are great if your child needs to use the closet to store some clothes, such as coats and hoodies. Your child can also use them to hang his or her backpack., A hideout can look magical, but your child may not want to spend a lot of time there if it isn't very comfortable. For something quick and easy, throw some pillows into the corner of the closet.You can also add a folded blanket as well. Here are some more ideas:


Install a bench into the closet, one that goes from wall-to-wall. Add some cushions onto the bench, and baskets for your child's toys or art supplies under it.Take the door out, and install a curtain. This way, you won't have to worry about your child accidentally looking him or herself inside the closet. Slip a curtain panel onto a suspension rod, then stick the rod near the top of the doorway.If you are using the closet to store your child's clothes, hang them towards the top; this way, they will be out of your child's way when he or she sits down.Add some lighting. If the closet doesn't have a light fixture or outlet, get a battery-operated light instead. You can get free-standing desk lamps, and mini lights that you can mount onto walls or shelves.

Find a good place to build your fort, like in your backyard or somewhere in the woods, but make sure it is legal before you build it in the woods.,
You must decide if you are going to build your fort on plains, or just somewhere between trees also try a 3x4 to support the walls and floor.

,
Decide if you want your fort to be secret or a place for everybody.,
Plan what you want your fort's purpose to be, like if you wanted your own crib or a hideout.

,
If your fort is on hill, dig or put your fort on stilts or do the 1/2 and 1/2 thingy.,
Collect all of the wood scraps you can find.,
Test the boards by putting weight on them.,
Start building your fort with nails, wood glue etc.,
Look for two trees about 5 feet (1.5 m) apart.,
Now for the frame you have the two trees, place a long stick through the trees.,
If you are creating a fort on the ground and are not using wood for a floor; a lot of small rocks or gravel will do just fine sometimes; Dirt and pine straw works just as great!,
If your parents don't agree with using their wood or supplies, just find a nice place where you can get some tree branches.",How to Make a Wooden Fort,";
,, If it's a fort for everybody, and everybody can come in, don't leave any tools or valuable stuff inside.

,, Digging is most times used, because building in the heights may be difficult and sometimes even dangerous.

, Any piece will do. Use thick beams to build a strong ground floor, use straight, strong pieces to build pillars and use anything like branch to cover your roof.

, Never just step on it and hope it will hold your weight. Always make sure it's strong enough to support any weight which might be put on it.

, Make sure you work safe, because the last thing you want is a nail in your thumb. Use quality stuff, not the cheap kind. You might also use a saw to cut pieces in the correct length.

, Maybe, you might be lucky with both the trees having a branch that creates a Y. If so you can make this in the woods or any place with long sticks.

, # Now lean the walls on the sticks so that they go straight up.The layers for the walls are 1 sticks 2 pine bows 3 bark. The fort is now complete, and waterproof.

, After all, you don't want to sit on the cold, sharp stones/rocks do you!?

, But ALWAYS ask first. Remember, be safe and enjoy your fort/tree fort!!

Know where to build your fort on a cold day.,
Know where to build your fort on a hot day.,
Use light blankets and bed sheets for the roof.,
Put heavy blankets on top of sturdy forts.,
Use seat cushions for the walls.,
Put soft, squishy pillows inside the fort.,
Have an escape plan.",How to Make a Pillow Fort1," Try to find a cozy spot close to a heater. Don't build your fort too close to a window or entrance, because that is where all the cold air comes from.;
, Try to build your fort near a fan or air conditioning unit. You can build your fort near an open window, but only if the window is shady and there is no sun coming in through it. An open window may bring in a cool, fresh breeze, but it can also let the hot sun in!


If you can build your fort in a basement, then even better! Basements are nice and cold during the summer, and the floor will keep you cool.

, Anything too heavy, such as a comforter or a thick blanket will be too heavy and make your fort fall apart., If the base of your fort is made from chairs, tables, or sofas, then you should be able to drape a heavy blanket or comforter without the fort falling apart. Some seat cushions may be strong enough to hold up a heavy blanket or comforter, but they will need to be leaning against something.

, The cushions that come from the seats of sofas and armchairs make great walls, because they are stiff and shaped like blocks. They can stand up on their own without much help.

, The pillows that you use to sleep on don't make very good walls, but they are great for sitting on! Use them inside your fort to make things more comfy.

, Do not build your fort so that it is blocking a door. If something bad happens, you will be in trouble. Blocking doors may keep someone from coming to help you if something happens. It may also keep you from getting out.

Find a suitable room to structure your fort in.,
Take cushions off the sofa.,
Use the seat cushions to make some walls.,
Drape a blanket over the cushions and sofa.,
Think about expanding your fort.",How to Make a Pillow Fort2," Your parents may not mind if you build a fort in your bedroom, but they may not be happy if you build a fort in their living room. Ask your parents if you can use and move the chairs, blankets, and pillows to build a fort.

, Try to use a room that already has the basics for your fort in it, such as chairs and a sofa. This way, you won't have to move furniture around that much.

, This includes the seat and the back cushions. You may find lots of treasures under these cushions. See if there are any worth saving (such as money and toys) and store them in a box. Discard gross items, such as trash and crumbs. No fort is complete without a treasure box.

, Take a cushion and place it on the seat of the sofa. Lean it against the armrest, so that the side you sit on is touching the armrest. The edge of the cushion should be touching the backrest of the sofa.


If you are using regular pillows instead, put two pillows on each armrest. You want the pillows to reach the top of the sofa, so you may need more pillows. Keep stacking pillows until they are even with the top of the sofa.
If you have extra cushions, you can stand them on the edge of the couch, between the two armrests.

, Make sure that the narrow ends of the blanket are covering the cushions, and the long edge is covering the top of the backrest. Tug on the ends so that the blanket is stretched across the top of your fort.


Something light, such as a bed sheet will work the best, because it will be less likely to make your fort cave in.
Blankets and comforters are thick and will make your fort nice and dark inside because they block out light.They are also heavy, however, and may cause your fort to cave in.

, You can crawl into your fort now, or you can make it even bigger by using more furniture and pillows. Push two chairs in front of the sofa and turn them so that they face each other. Lean more pillows against the legs of the chairs, and drape a bed sheet over the top of the chairs. For more ideas, read the part about building a fort around chairs.

, The more furniture, the better. That way, you will not have to move so much around. Make sure that the room you are in has a few chairs.

, The pillows and chairs will be used to make the base of the fort, and the bed sheet will be used to make the roof.

, The chairs will help hold up the ceiling of your fort, and the wall will be the back of your fort.


You can also use a sofa instead of a wall. You can put the chairs in front of the sofa or behind it.
If you cannot find a sofa and if there is no room against the wall for some chairs, you can use a dresser or even a closet instead. Just make sure that you do not build your fort against the door the room. If something happens, you won't be able to get out, or no one will be able to help you.

, The chairs can be as far or as close to each other as you want. You can have them close enough so that you and a friend can sit between them. You can also have them far enough so that you can lay down between them. The chair seats will make shelves and tables for your fort.

, Make sure that the bed sheet is covering the backrests of the chairs. If the blanket is slipping off, you can tie it to the chairs using a piece of ribbon or string.

, You can use sofa or armchair pillows, or you can use the pillows from your bed. Lean the pillows against the chair legs on the outside of your fort.

If you do not have any more blankets, you can use pillows instead. Take two or three pillows and lay them down next to each other on the floor inside your fort.
If you are using just blankets, you can stick a pillow or two inside the fort so that you will have something soft to sit on.

, It does not need to have the word ""fort"" in it. It can be a castle even! Here are some ideas:


Cassie's Castle
Ice cream Palace
Fort Awesome

, Now that you have come up with a name for your fort, you should let everybody know! Take a sheet of paper or a piece of cardboard and write the name of your fort on it. You can use crayons, markers, colored pencils, or even glue and glitter! Here are some more ideas:


Put stickers on your sign. Try to use stickers that match the name of your fort—so if your fort has the word ""ice cream"" in it, use ice cream-shaped stickers.
Decorate your sign with glitter, sequins, stick-on gems, and rhinestones. This is perfect for a castle!
If you are making a cool fort, use a piece of cardboard, and write the words in a thick red or black marker. You can even add the words ""KEEP OUT"" beneath the name!

, Punch two holes along the top of your sign and put some string through the holes. Tie the string and hang the sign over one of the chairs. You can also tape the sign to the bed sheet if you cannot find any string.


If you made the sign out of cardboard, you can put it on the floor and lean it against one of the chair legs.

, You can bring snacks such as apples, candy, nuts, juice, or popcorn. If it is around lunch time, ask your mom or dad if you can have your lunch inside your fort.


Make sure that your mom and dad are okay with you taking food out of the kitchen and bringing it into your fort.

, Forts are not just for hiding in! Bring something with you, such as a book, a music player, or a game.

, But not too much! Keep your lighting low, such as a couple of glow sticks, or a flashlight. If you are near an outlet, plug in a nightlight.You can even make a cool fairy lantern using a mason jar, glitter and a glow stick.

, If you will be living in your fort a while, so you might as well make a box to store all of your snacks, games, toys, and treasure. Find a shoe box, and cover it with some construction paper. Decorate the box with some rhinestones, glitter, and stickers. Put your stuff inside the box, and hide it in your fort!

, Sitting in a fort can get lonely, and even the most exciting games and books can get boring after a while. Ask your friend, brother, or sister to come and play with you in your fort!

First, get all of your supplies together (see things you need);
,
Next,take out ALL of your stuff from your closet.,

But for a regular closet that is only (about) 8x1, take out everything. Make sure your room is clean while you do this step, or you will get all of your things from your closet mixed up with your garbage.

, If you have things that you want, but not in your closet, consider putting them in a box and making a place for them.As to the things you want to keep in your closet, put them in a pile.Once you have sorted your things, throw away the things you want to; put the things for charity in a plastic trash bag and write charity on it. Ask mom or dad to drive to Goodwill to get rid of it. Then put off the things you want to keep to the side. We don't want to get sidetracked organizing now, do we?

, First dust, vacuum, mop, sweep, and basically clean all of the dirt, dust, and dead bugs out. Make sure if there are any stains on the carpet ; those you clean out with Resolve or some other stain killer. If you have hardwood, put Orange Glo down to protect your wood.

, The more blankets you have, the softer it is. Put down pillows so it is comfortable for you to sit and relax in. Now, you can put the lighting in. If you have string lights, you can hangs those up and turn them on. Otherwise, just put a lamp in there. If you don't have a lamp, then just put a floodlight or flashlight in there, but be careful because of the heat they may produce, you don't want to start a fire..

, You might want to move your blankets and pillows around a bit so you have room for books and things . If you have shelves in your closet, that's great. Store stuff there. The bottom shelf is for things you might immediately want or need for easy accessibility. The second shelf is for books, and so on.

, You might want to hand a poster of your fave band, or put pictures of your friends and you, and other things. You can also put a small mirror in. If your ""bed"" at the top has a shelf over it, put a picture of your fave band so you'll wake up to them.

, Close your closet so you don't have the urge to put stuff in there.

, Personalize your closet however you want, it's your place and YOU earned it!

Now you can plug in your fan and turn it on.,
Crawl inside your fort and bring your stuff in too.",How to Make a Fan Fort," The little kind you put on desks isn't gonna work. Next, you need to find a fitted sheet - the kind with the elastic on it that you have to tuck under the mattress. Finally, you will need a tall, heavy object like a chair or a small table.


If you plan on putting stuff in your fort, you may need a couple of things to use as paperweights to hold down light stuff.





;
, You don't want to get your fort all set up, and then find that you can't plug it in because it's too far away from an outlet!


The fan should be off right now.







, Stretch it out. Take the short end and put it over the fan. Now tuck it under the bottom like you would when making your bed.

, Grab the very end of the other end of the sheet, the one not tucked under a fan, and put your tall, heavy object on it.

, You should be looking at a big bubbly fort.

, Just put paperweights on light stuff so it does not blow away. Enjoy your fort!

Clear out a convenient location.,
Arrange the structure.,
Drape a sheet over the structure.,
Expand the den (optional).,
Create an entrance.,
Fill the inside.",How to Make a Den1," Once the den is built, it might end up as the favorite hangout spot for days or weeks afterward. The kids' bedroom or playroom is an ideal spot, but one corner of a large living room or other spare room could work. Move all valuable and breakable items out of the chosen area, to protect it from the wild den denizens.


Some houses have secret, kid-sized areas underneath the staircase, which are perfect for dens.;
, You can build the den over a bunk bed, a table, the back of a couch, or several chairs. Two or three pieces of heavy furniture are ideal, since you can create space between them.


Lightweight objects like lamps or plastic chairs will just fall over when the blanket is added, so leave those out of it.
To make the structure friendly for adults or tall children, tie a broom to the back of the furniture.
Turn chairs so they face outward, to make the den roomier.

, Move the furniture apart so the sheet is almost taut, and you'll have more room and a more sturdy structure. Some fitted sheets will stay up on their own, but you'll often need to fasten them with clothespins or tape at each corner and halfway along each side.Rough play almost always pulls the sheet down, but dens are so quick and easy to repair that this doesn't matter much.


A stack of heavy books or a few thumbtacks are sometimes necessary, but avoid them if the den is for younger kids. They will get pulled down eventually, and you don't want anyone getting hurt.
For a more permanent den, have a crafty adult mount ceiling hooks and hang the sheet from that.

, If the den feels a little small, add extra chairs and sheets, or set up a tent for an easy extension. Overlapping the sheets can form a more sturdy ceiling, but you may need alligator clips or similar tools to keep it stable.

, Lift the sheet on one side so people can climb in. Drape two small blankets over that entrance instead, so people can push them aside and crawl in.

, Add pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, and toys! To create a real palace, add a chest of games and snacks, a small television, or a miniature fridge. Then climb in and relax for thirty seconds before the first pillow fight starts.

Visit a flat, dry forest or garden.,
Find a knobbly structure.,
Gather materials.,
Create the den structure.,
Finish the den.,
Decorate your den.",How to Make a Den2," If you don't have a garden or forest nearby, ask your parents to take you on a day trip to a national park.If the forest is near a motorway, shoreline, or other potential danger, make sure everyone knows how to stay safe.


If you've had rain or fog, bring along a couple tarpaulins to use as a dry floor and rainproof cover., A living tree with a Y-shaped split near the ground is ideal for building a den, since you can use the Y branch as a ceiling. Boulders and other natural structures can also work, but avoid caves or hollows that look like they may be used by an animal.


Don't use a dead tree, as the branches could break and collapse your den.
Bushes and thick plant growth can be home to ticks, which can cause nasty diseases. Check the local wildlife warnings from the park service to see whether bracken is safe to use in your area.

, Look for fallen, unbroken branches that feel solid, but not heavy enough to cause injury if they drop on someone. If there aren't many of these around, tie smaller branches into bundles, or bring bamboo poles, broom handles, lightweight chairs, or other materials from home.Never break off a living branch. Interact with the forest respectfully, without harming the environment.

, A sturdy tree branch or leaning tree makes a strong frame for your den all by itself, but there are several other techniques you can use:


A sturdy branch can be wedged into a rock pile at a slant, but must be firmly in place before you continue.
Three branches can be wedged against each other to form a triangle, with a little trial-and-error. Add more branches one by one to form a circular den.
If you have rope or strong string, lean branches against each other in a tent shape, lay out a branch across the top, and tie them all together along its length. This may take several people.
If you have a tarpaulin, tie each corner to a tree to make a ceiling. To prevent sagging in the rain, place a small rock in the center of the tarp from underneath, tie it in place, then attach a long rope and hoist the center by tossing the rope over a tall branch., Den-building is a great open-ended activity for kids to explore on their own. Some kids may just want to lean a few sticks on to the frame to hide underneath, while others will interlace branches in new and creative shape. Rope is handy to have around in case a structure needs more support, but with experience the builders can make dens using nothing but the natural materials around them.

, To make a camouflaged or weather-resistant den, cover both surfaces with leaves and twigs. Sweep out the floor of your den to make it more comfortable. You can even make a garden outside the den by ""planting"" pine cones or colorful leaves, and surrounding them with a fence of twigs or stacked rocks.

Select a focal point to design around.,

Add lighting.,
Bring in extra amenities.,
Add more storage.,
Decorate.",How to Make a Den3," If you don't have a spare room, consider rearranging a living room or dining room to divide it into two parts. A tall bookcase or a tall-backed couch can create a section of the room to use as a den.

, Do any repairs, cleaning, or redecorating to the room while it is at its emptiest. Does your room need new flooring or new paint to be attractive and comfortable? Tackle that now.

, Think about what activities you or your family will pursue in the den, so you can make it as comfortable as possible. Here are some activities you might want to design your den around:


Quiet, relaxing activities, such as reading, sewing, or other hobbies.
Group activities, such as playing games or watching movies or sports.
Desk activities, such as using a desktop computer, making art projects, or building things.

, This can be anything from a pool table to a writing desk, depending on the primary purpose of the room. As you arrange the other furniture, keep it oriented toward this focal point. This will make the den feel cozy and aesthetically pleasing.


For smaller dens without space for large furniture items, arrange around a large window, a fireplace, a tapestry, or a painting.

, Easy chairs or sofas are fine, but don't rule out bean bags, floor cushions, hanging sling chairs, or papasan chairs. Make sure there's comfortable seating for people of every height.


If your den is in a basement, shed, or other area with less temperature and humidity control, consider wooden patio furniture instead to minimize mold and other damage.

, You may want comfortable, low light if you want the atmosphere room to seem more like a lounge. On the other hand, if you are reading or doing crafts in the den, you will need appropriate task lighting.

, If you like, add a small fridge, a television or computer, or a foosball table. If you have the space, consider a sound system, exercise equipment, or a dedicated area for playing musical instruments, weaving, or other space-intensive hobbies.

, If your family will be listening to music, watching DVDs, playing games, doing crafts, or reading books, you'll want storage. You can use an existing closet or add storage in the form of bookcases, media racks, cabinets, and so on.

, Now that you've installed all the furniture, decorate the rest of the den however you'd like. Add a throw rug and couch pillows, hang up posters, or place decorative items on shelves.

If you have a way to keep the inside from getting wet, see if you can find a way to get power for lamps, chargers, and maybe even a TV if you have an extra!

",How to Decorate Your Treehouse," Will you paint them or leave them wooden? Wood gives a real natural feel, while paint will make you feel like you are in an actual house. Different kinds of paint have different feels. Black will feel like this is your little dark hut and bright colors will feel like you are in a house full of sunshine.;
, Do you want to leave it wooden, or use carpet? Fluffy or flat? Carpet gives the room a cosy feel and a wooden floor is like a little den. Tiles aren't very popular, though. They would be used for a kitchen or a bathroom.

, Windows can be wide, narrow, tall, or short. They can also be square, heart, circle or star shaped. It's your choice. If you want sunlight to shine into your room and make it warm, you have to have windows. Or, if you like, no windows at all. Add curtains, too.

, If you want a spiritual feel, add an idol or two, like a fairy or animal. It would also be cool to have a wind chime.

, You can use couches, little tables, beanbags, paintings, a computer and a desk, lights, or anything else. You can choose a cosy feel, dark feel, sunny feel, etc. The list goes on.

, This can be a television, Nintendo, radio, or even calculators; anything that you can use to entertain yourself when you are bored. For Nintendo try to use it as a laptop and camera if you have the DSi. You can hook up internet to that, which would allow Youtube in replacement for Radio. Try keeping a bookcase in there to hold everything on.

, Rain will soak through wood and we don't want it to wet your furniture or electronics! Try to cover it with moss, tree bark, waterproof blankets, or anything else to keep it out!

Have fun!",How to Make a Cubbyhouse," You'll want to make sure you have either three or four chairs or a table to create the base of the cubby house. You'll also need some blankets, bed sheets, pillows, and/or bean bags. Pegs or some heavy hangers are also good to have so you can secure your cubby., Anywhere will do, as long as you have enough room to build your cubby. A big, open space, like a living room or basement is a good choice.

, There are a couple of different ways to construct an indoor cubby house.


If using chairs: Put your chairs in a circle with their backs facing inwards. Now drape a couple of bed sheets or blankets over the chairs and secure with pegs or heavy items (like a large book or paperweight) so your cubby doesn’t collapse in the middle.
Alternatively, use a fitted shit and drape the fitted ends over the backs of the chairs. This creates a stable structure that won't collapse. Then, use the remaining sheets to drape over the roof to the ground. Make sure there’s a flap at the front for the entrance.If using a table: Put the table where you want the cubby house to be. Put as many blankets or sheets as you need to cover the whole table so you can't see inside.

, Place some blankets on the floor to make the space nice and warm. Bring in pillows, bean bags and any other items you think will make the cubby cozy and comfortable.You could also bring in a mattress and place that on the ground. However, it is recommended that if you decide to bring in a large piece of furniture into your cubby that you build the cubby AROUND the furniture. If you build the exterior first, there's a good chance that when you are bringing everything inside, the cubby will get knocked down., Supply your cubby house with snacks, games, reading material, and toys. You can also invite some cubby buddies to join you!You can also leave the cubby empty (except for maybe a friend!) and instead use your imagination to play. This is your private area so you can be free and creative.

, Enjoy your cozy fort. After you've had enough fun inside, dismantle the cubby house and put back all materials.

, You will need several boxes, scissors, and masking tape.


Try to find a very large cardboard box, one that is big enough to fit small children or seated adults. The best boxes are those that come with a new dishwasher, fridge, or washing machine. If you aren't in the market for a new appliance, you can try asking at a big-box store if they have any spare large boxes that they're looking to get rid of.If you can't get your hands on one large box, you can create a cardboard space big enough for a cubby house by cutting the ends of several large boxes and connecting them with strong tape.

, If you have one very large box, you don't need to do anything here - your base is already made.


If you have several boxes, break them up until they're flat. If you want a taller cubby house, attach two boxes of the same size. Tape them together along their long sides; in essence, you're taping one long side of a broken-up box onto another.
To make the base of the cubby house, tape the the short ends of the boxes together to create a big square.

, Cut a large slit down one side of the box to make a door, but make sure to not cut down the whole side or else the box will be too flimsy. To make windows, you can cut away the top half of one of sides, or cut out smaller window ""panes"" to create a fancier window.You can also cut a door that you have to step in and out of. This means that you cut out your door (whatever size you like) ABOVE the floor, leaving a foot or two of box between the door and the floor. This is the best way to keep the box sturdy.If you want to get really creative, cut out diamond, star, or heart-shaped windows.It's best to draw windows and doors on your cardboard box with pen or pencil before cutting. That way you know exactly where to cut.When cutting windows and doors, make sure to leave plenty of box still ""in tact"" so the box will still be stable., Using two sides of a box, place the crease where the two sides met - the L-shape - on top of the base structure. You will probably want to slide a small piece of cardboard beneath the point of the roof and the base to hold up the roof.

, This is where you can use anything you have lying around the house: paper, markers, paint, glitter, cut-outs, ribbons, etc.


Use decorative wrapping paper to cover the outside of the house.
You could also paint or use markers to color and beautify the cardboard.
Add other decorative touches, like trimming the windows, adding names or words, etc.

, Fill the cubby house with blankets, sheets, and pillows. Decorate the inside with your own pictures and drawings. Alternatively, feel free just to color on the walls!

, Bring in games, books, snacks, and friends. Enjoy what you've just created!

Make the walls of your fort.,
Give your fort a roof.,
Decorate your fort.",How to Build an Outdoor Fort1," A good fort will be built in a place where it fits perfectly. Look for trees with branches that are low to the ground, bushes that are hollowed out in the middle or that form a ring, or logs that can make the base for your fort . Try not to put your fort in the middle of a field or a grassy area, because this will make it difficult to build and won’t give much cover.


Lean your fort up against a tree, if you can. Forts build in the woods are the easiest to make.
Big rocks can be great places to put a fort, if you can find them.;
, The best outdoor forts are built using things from the outdoors! Spend a bit of time searching your yard or the woods for supplies to use in building your fort. You might use things like:


Old branches
Large sticks
Tree boughs (with leaves)
Dead bushes

, If you can’t find many good fort-building supplies outdoors, you might want to add some things from your house to make it better. Remember to only use things from your house with permission from your parents. Gather up all the supplies you could use to build your fort. These might include:


Blankets
Thick string (for holding up the blankets) and clothespins.
Umbrellas
Cardboard boxes
Chairs, Use some big sticks (or chairs, if you don’t have sticks) and put them in the ground to set up a wall around your fort. You can use 4 sticks for the corners, or you can use lots of sticks put close together to make a wall. If you don’t have many stick, you can put blankets or big leaves between your corners to make your walls.


If you have thick string, you can wrap it between the corners and put blankets or towels over the top to make walls.
Try to make your walls between a few big trees or bushes to make it easier to build.

, You don’t have to, but it may be good to add a roof to your fort. To do this, drape big branches with leaves over the top, and balance them on your walls. You could also throw a big blanket or tarp over the top of your roof. If you have lots, a fun idea is to use many umbrellas as a roof over the top of your fort.


Old dry branches that have fallen off trees that still have leaves are perfect for making a roof.
If you build your fort under a tree with low branches, you might not need to add a roof.

, The next best thing to building your fort is making it feel like your own. Bring in decorations to make the inside feel more comfortable, or add some to the outside. Old logs can act as chairs or tables, and fresh flowers always work well for decoration. Use big leaves as bowls and cups, and look for other parts of nature to add to your fort.


If you want, you can bring things from your house to decorate the inside of your fort. Always be sure to ask permission for this, though.
You might want to make a sign for your fort, with a name."

Build a fort in the woods.",How to Build an Outdoor Fort2," If you want to make a fort that will last a bit longer, you can build one out of wood using basic tools. It may take a bit longer, but you'll end up with a top-quality fort that will last for weeks, months, or maybe even years.

, If you have a small backyard or you don't have many supplies to use for building your fort, you can try building a blanket fort instead. Although most blanket forts are built inside on rainy days, you can build one outside in a grassy area or field.

, If you've got lots of empty boxes in your house, put them to use by building a fort! Although your fort probably won't end up like the one in 'Out of the Box!', you can make it feel like a real house with enough work. Combine several big boxes and cut out holes between them to make 'rooms'. You can even add windows and furniture inside your box fort if you want.

, If you are lucky enough to have a snow day, you can put all the white stuff to use by making a fort with it. Snow forts won't last too long, but they may be the coolest out of all the forts you can build. Pile up the snow, cut out doors and windows, and load it up with snowballs in case of an impending attack.

, This type of fort might be the hardest to make, but it will last a long time, and is really cool when finished. Building an underground fort involves digging a series of 'rooms' in the ground, and possibly even connecting them with tunnels. If you have lots of land and time to work, you should definitely try making an underground fort. But be careful!! Underground forts can collapse, so make sure you have a parent supervisor, and always make sure the soil is stable. Always build at least two exits in case of a collapse. Never build underground forts in sand. (DISCLAIMER: underground forts are crazy dangerous. More than a few people have died trying to make these. There's a lot more to building underground than digging sideways. Do a lot of research, be prepared to drop some cash, and make peace with your maker. You are seriously risking your life by building one of these.)

, Forest forts are lots of fun, because they're easy to camouflage and add lots of decoration to from nature. Head out into the woods with some tools, collect some branches and supplies, and build your fort in the woods!

, Depending on the setting, wear clothing to blend in. Try to avoid any bright colors, or clothing that reflects light.


Forest: Wear greens, browns and greys. Avoid and blacks because this will stand out in the forest.
Neighbourhood: Wear browns and dark greys.
Nighttime: Wear dark greys and blacks.
Fields: Wear sandy colored clothing, greens and browns.

,


Make as little noise as possible. Any noise or movement may catch the hunters attention, making them run into your direction
Try to avoid stepping on branches and dry leaves. This will minimize the amount of noise you make.
Never stay in one spot. Try to move around and away from any hiders.
Be aware of your surroundings. Always check behind you and around you to make sure no hunters are near by.

,


Know the most obvious places the players would hide in. Try to look out for bushes or large trees and rocks.
Keep track of the directions players are running to. This way you can go there later and expect to find people
Sneak up behind them, and surprise them.

, If you are a hard core player, then you can confuse and manipulate the hunters into moving away from you:


Get a group of weak runners with you at the beginning. If you are being chased, you will know that the weaker runners will most likely get caught, allowing you to get away.
Get items like rocks and sticks to throw and make noise. This may send the hunter away from you, allowing you to escape.

,
Wear comfortable, light weight clothing. This will let you run faster and longer.

, Try bringing a water bottle with a poked hole at the top. When the hunter finds you, get your bottle and launch! This give you time to escape! Or use an old glue bottle and fill it up with water for more accuracy, minus the chance of spilling.

, If you bring one of those tiny devices that can help you hear farther, those are perfect because when a hunter comes up, there is your chance to escape from getting tagged!

Gather players.,
Make the slips.,
Draw your slip.,
The Werewolf reveals themselves and counts to twenty.,
Note: An optional slip is the addition of vampire.,
An alternate version is Secret Werewolf, where everyone draws their slip and runs and hides, including the werewolf, who does not reveal their slip or count.",How to Play Werewolf Tag," 3 or more is needed.;
, Take three slips and label one ""Werewolf"", the other ""Hunter"" and the last ""Healer."" Label the remaining slips ""Villager.""

, Do not let anyone see your slip! Read it and put back in. The Werewolf is the person who counts and then tags others to make them werewolves. The hunter can tag a werewolf and kill it. However, the hunter can also be tagged. The Healer can tag a werewolf and make them a normal villager, however can only do this once. The Villager is simply a target, and does not have any special abilities.

, The villagers (including the Hunter and Healer) hide. The Werewolf tries to tag everyone before the Hunter kills them, and the Hunter and Healer try to stop the werewolves. If the Hunter kills the werewolves, the villagers win. If the werewolf infects everyone, the werewolves win. Once the game is over go and draw again.

, The vampire does not reveal their slip like the werewolf, but hides. The vampire tries too tag everyone and make them vampires. Vampires can't tag werewolves and werewolves can't tag vampires. Hunters cannot kill vampires but Healers can heal them.

, Then the game proceeds normally. Hint: Hide alone in this version to avoid being a werewolf.

Find a large space.,
Assemble a group of people.,
Establish a home base.",How to Play Werewolf1," The most exciting area to play Werewolf is in a large wooded area. This area isn't the safest for a group of kids. Playing around a cul-de-sac could also work for a safer environment.


The most important thing is to have enough places to hide.
The game feels more authentic at night.;
, There is not an age requirement for playing Werewolf. It is usually a kids game, but if there aren't enough kids grab a mom or dad. You'll need to gather at least 10 people.


The more the merrier.

, Designate a place where you meet for each round. This is where the Werewolf will be chosen, and where you meet after the round is over.Somewhere that is slightly closed off tends to work the best. A porch. for example, is a perfect home base for playing Werewolf.

"
"
Assemble the children against the wall in a line.,
Choose ""Mr. Wolf"" (star of the day).,
Play the game:


Mr Wolf turns his or her back so he/she cannot see the kids.,
Change Mr. Wolf.",How to Play What's the Time Mr Wolf,";
, Ask Mr. Wolf to stand at one end of the playing area.

,






The row of children chant:






""What's the time Mr. Wolf?""


Mr. Wolf will turn around and answer a time (for example, 4 o'clock).






The children advance the number of steps called out and then repeat the chant, waiting for a response and so on.






Eventually they will be standing very close to Mr. Wolf. Mr. Wolf can, at any moment once the line of children is close, respond ""Lunch Time"" in a loud growl, instead of giving a real time.






This is the cue for lots of screaming (remind them not to scream) and running because now Mr. Wolf has to chase the rest of the children and tag one of them.







, The child who was the wolf can choose another person (opposite gender) to be the next wolf.

Understand the flow of the game.,
Decide who is ""it."",
Choose the playing area.,
Decide on a ""safe zone"" as a group.,
Count out a head start for running.,
Tag someone.,
Keep going.,
Stop the game when everyone is done playing.,
Play hide and go seek tag.,
Try playing freeze tag.,
Consider playing toilet tag.",How to Play Tag," One person is ""it,"" and his/her job is to touch someone else. When you are touched by the person who is ""it,"" you immediately become ""it."" Now, it's your job to tag someone else. The game usually continues until everyone decides to stop, or until a predetermined number of people have become ""it."";
, This person will chase the other players, trying to tag them, until he/she tags someone. Then, the tagged person becomes ""it,"" and the original ""it"" person runs away to avoid being tagged. Many of the players will get a turn at being ""it"". To quickly decide who is ""it"" first, just say ""Who is it?"" or volunteer to do it yourself. The person should say ""I am it,"" and everyone should know who is ""it."", Set boundaries so that the ""not-it"" players can't run too far away. The smaller the space, the harder it will be to avoid the person who is ""it."" Pick a place that is easy to run on, but forgiving to fall on – grass and sand are good surfaces.


On a playground, for example: agree to only stay on the gravel and blacktop during the game. The grass and sidewalk are not part of the play area.

, It might be one of the slides on the playground, or a tree, or a bench, or a space marked out with cones. When you touch this area, you are safe from being ""tagged"".


To keep the game going, consider setting a time limit for long someone can stay in the ""safe zone."" For example, a person might have to leave after ten seconds, or thirty seconds – long enough that the person who is ""it"" will go off to tag someone else, but not long enough that the game stagnates., The ""it"" person counts out a ten-second head start to give the ""not-it"" players time to run away. At the end of ten seconds, the ""it"" player yells ""Go!"" or ""Ready or not, here I come!"" He/she can then start chasing the others, trying to tag them. Everyone who is ""not it"" will run away from the person who is ""it"" and try to avoid getting tagged. If the person who is ""it"" gets close to you, try to run to the ""safe zone.""

, The ""it"" player tries to touch another player in order to make them ""it."" The tag should be light enough not to hurt anyone, but firm enough that it is a clear tag – like a tap or touch on your body. Once the ""it"" player succeeds in tagging someone, the tagged player is now ""it"". As the tagged player: yell loud enough for everyone to hear that you are now ""it"". Now it is your turn to chase your friends and try to tag them!


A tag should never be physically aggressive. If someone is pushing or hurting other players, stop the game and remove the offending player. Make sure they know what they did wrong.

, Once a person has been tagged, continue the game with the new ""it"" player trying to tag someone. The game continues in this way for as long as you want to keep playing.

, When the game stops, the person who is ""it"" loses. There is no set rule on when to end. However, it is a good idea to set a time limit before players become exhausted or disinterested in continuing the game. Oftentimes, the players will all mutually agree to end the game when enough people don't feel like playing anymore.If you are orchestrating a game of tag: the younger the players, the shorter the game should be.

, The game begins in the same way as regular tag, except that all of the ""not-it"" players have time to go hide. The person who is ""it"" usually counts for longer than normal tag: as much as twenty seconds to a minute. Once ""it"" calls ""Ready or not, here I come!"", the ""not-it"" players try to run to the ""safe zone"" without being tagged by ""it."" If you are hiding, you can wait to be found, or you can take off running for the base while the ""it' person tries to find another player.The counting player also covers his/her eyes to avoid seeing where everyone has hidden. Don't peek!

, The setup is the same as regular tag, except for one major difference: when a player is tagged, he or she cannot move. If any of the other, unfrozen, ""not-it"" players touch a frozen player, he/she is unfrozen and can keep running around. The game ends once all of the ""not-it"" players are frozen, or once everyone agrees to stop playing., This is a variation of freeze tag. Instead of simply standing in place, the tagged players need to squat with their arm out, as though they are a toilet and their arm is the flusher. To unfreeze these players, push their arm down gently like you're flushing a toilet.

Prepare the cardboard pieces.,
Set out a course to be followed.,
Place an object at every second marker.,
Understand the game.,
Choose a suitable time allocation before the game.,
Play the game.,
Select the winner.",How to Play Stepping Stones," Cut two pieces of cardboard about 8""/20 centimeter (7.9 in) square per player. Each piece needs to be large enough to stand on.
, Using a convenient form of markers, set out a course to be followed by the players across the room or lawn.

Balls, flags, bricks etc. can all serve as markers.

, At least 3 objects should be a part of the game, requiring their retrieval as each player crosses the game area. These will need to be replaced after each player has moved through., The object of the game is for each player to cross the marked course in a certain time, only ever using the stepping stones (the pieces of cardboard) that they have been given. As they proceed, they must also capture the items along the way., Make someone the timer.,

Give each player his or her cardboard pieces (two each).
To cross the course, each player must continuously put down and pick up their pieces of cardboard without ever leaving the cardboard.

A player who stands on floor or grass has to return to the beginning and start again.


Call Ready, Set, Go and watch the players proceed.
Time the race. It can be helpful to do a practice run without forcing it to end within a set time; once players are more familiar with the race, set a deadline by which to finish the course. Alternatively, an overall winner can be selected from the fastest out of several races, or if there isn't enough room for everyone to run the race at the same time, the fastest can be timed from each race and played against each other for a final race.

, The winner is the person who crosses the fastest (or within a pre-determined time allowance) and retrieves the most objects successfully.

Depending on the amount of players, you might make it a best of 3 games or just have one game to be the decider.

Designate a Werewolf.,
Play as the Werewolf.,
Play as a non-Werewolf.,
Make it back to base.,
Start a new round.",How to Play Werewolf2," This person will count to 30 while covering her eyes. Once she reaches 30 she'll run after the other people.The Werewolf will tag as many people as she can. If the Werewolf tags you, then you become a Werewolf too.


The main Werewolf rotates each round so nobody should feel isolated for being chosen.

, Your objective is to tag as many ""non-Werewolves"" as you can. Try to be stealthy because once someone sees you, everyone will have an advantage over you.Werewolves aren't allowed to speak. To communicate to one another they are required to make grunts and point.

, The objective for the non-Werewolf is to find a hiding space quickly as the Werewolf is counting.Keep track of the Werewolf's countdown in order to be prepared when the time comes. It is not advised to wander because the Werewolf will easily be able to find you.


Finding a good hiding spot is key.
After a few rounds, the Werewolf will begin to know where to look so vary your hiding spot from game to game.
If the Werewolf tags you, you now must become a Werewolf and attempt to catch the rest of the ""humans."" To become a Werewolf, you have to kneel, close your eyes, and count for 15 seconds.

, When you notice you're one of the last people, call ""Werewolf!"" This is when every ""human"" left makes a run back to the home base.Werewolves will probably be waiting for you there so be quick and careful.

, The round is over once everyone gathers at the designated home base. The last people to be tagged or the ones that aren't Werewolves yet pick the next Werewolf. Then the game starts over again with a new Werewolf.


You cannot choose the same Werewolf from the last round."
"
Gather at least five people.,
Find a place that can comfortably fit the amount of people you have.,
Choose someone to be ""it."",
Have the person that is ""it"" count down from ten.,
Stay still unless you are it.,
Have the ""it"" person start looking for movements.",How to Play the Game Graveyard1," You will need one person to be it, and at least two other competitors.  The magic number is around eight, but it's okay if you don't have enough people.;
, Make sure there is plenty of space for everyone to move around. The designated place should also be clean, because people will be lying on the ground.

, You can do rock, paper, scissors, or just blindly choose a person. It does not matter who the ""it"" is, but there needs to be one.

, During that time, the players need to assemble into a position on the ground. Once time is up, everyone needs to be still. Anyone caught moving by the person that is it is eliminated.

, The only things you are allowed to move are your eyelids. You cannot move your mouth, legs, or hands.


Realize that even if you move, you are not out unless the person playing ""it"" sees it. This applies even if another player catches you.

, Once the person that is it catches you, you are out. Eliminated players can help ""it"" check the remaining players for movements, but they cannot eliminate players themselves. They can, however, tip ""it"" about where to look for movements.

Choose the traffic cop.,
Distance the cop at least 5m away from the other players.,
Form a straight line with the other players.,
Have the traffic cop face away from the other players.,
Have the traffic cop yell, “Green light.” This should be done while the cop is still facing away from the players.,
Have the traffic cop yell, “Red light” and turn around.,
Send players that moved on “red light” back to the starting line.,
Repeat until someone reaches the traffic cop.,
Let the winner be the next traffic cop.,
Play with the cop watching the players.,
Add a “yellow light” command.,
Allow for multiple “red lights” in a row.,
Choose a different form of movement.,
Make the traffic cop mobile.",How to Play Red Light Green Light," The traffic cop will be the one calling out the commands, directing traffic by yelling, “Red light” or “Green light.” The traffic cop is also the judge as to whether a child has moved on “red light.” Additionally, the traffic cop can be considered the finish line, the goal of the game being to make it to the cop. If playing with a class, the teacher can start as the traffic cop. If the teacher doesn’t wish to play, have a kid volunteer to be the traffic cop. Make sure the traffic cop has a loud voice so that everyone can hear the commands.This person can also be called a “stoplight” if you prefer. Whether you call them a traffic cop or stoplight, the function is the same. They will call out the commands and be the one in charge.;
, There needs to be enough distance between the traffic cop and the kids to make the game fun and challenging. Have the traffic cop move at least 5m or 15ft away from everyone else. Wherever the traffic cop stands will be the finish line.If playing with older kids, make the game more advanced by adding more distance between the traffic cop and the other kids. You could even use the full length of a soccer or football field! Just make sure the traffic cop’s voice can carry that distance.
It is best to start closer together and gradually add more distance as everyone learns the game.

, Everyone besides the traffic cop should be on the starting line. They need to be lined up next to each other in a straight line so that no one has an advantage. Leave enough space in between each player so that they can run and move comfortably, perhaps a foot in between each player., The traffic cop should start by facing away from the players. They should not be able to see what anyone is doing to start. This is to ensure that they won’t try to catch a particular player off guard., When the cop yells, “Green light,” the kids should immediately begin to run towards the traffic cop. The cop should wait a few seconds to allow the kids to move before yelling, “Red light."" The kids should move fast, but not too fast or they won’t be able to stop quickly enough on “red light.” The goal of the game is to reach the traffic cop first, so it is a balance between moving quickly and being able to stop immediately., The traffic cop should be looking for anyone who is still moving on “red light.” All players must immediately freeze when the cop yells, “Red light.”, The penalty for moving on “red light” is to be sent back to the starting line, nullifying any progress made. That is why the game is a fine balance between moving quickly enough to make progress, but slowly enough to stop immediately. The traffic cop is the judge of whether someone was moving or not., Each time, the traffic cop needs to turn away from the players to yell, “Green light,” and then face the players to yell, “Red light.” This will happen several times during a game. Anyone moving on “Red light” is sent back to the starting line. The first person to reach the traffic cop is the winner, which concludes the game., The reward for winning the game is to take the place of the traffic cop and be the one in charge. Then whoever wins the following game will take that cop’s place. The former traffic cop can move to the starting line to play the game with everyone else.In the event of a tie, you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors to settle it.

, To play this version, the cop simply never turns around, but stays facing the children throughout the game. This variation is useful for very young children that need to be watched at all times., This is a fun variation where kids may move on “yellow light,” but only in slow motion. The traffic cop can use all three commands and turn around on “yellow light” to ensure that everyone is moving slowly. On “yellow light,” anyone moving at “green light” speed or stopping completely will be sent back to the starting line., This is a lot of fun with older kids because you can trick them. Since they are used to “red light” interchanging with “green light,” they are likely to move on a repeated “red light,” expecting it to be a “green light.” This forces everyone to pay close attention and makes the game more challenging. The traffic cop simply faces away from the kids and acts as if they will say, “Green light,” but then quickly turns around and says, “Red light” instead, surely catching a few kids off guard.You can warn the kids that you will be adding multiple “red lights” so that they know to look out for it.
You can do a few times where you alternate “red light” and “green light” as usual, and then suddenly do two or even three “red lights” in a row to add to the surprise.

, Since kids normally run forward on “green light,” a fun variation is to change from running to a different activity, such as skipping, hopping, crawling, crab walking, or walking backwards. The traffic cop should announce the form of movement before calling, “Green light,” so that everyone knows how they will move. Any child not doing the appropriate movement will be sent back to the starting line., Let the traffic cop be the finish line and have them move around throughout the game. This will constantly change the scope of the game and will make it more challenging. A moving finish line can be a lot of fun and kids will constantly have to try to keep up. The traffic cop could take several steps away from the kids on each “green light” so that the kids have even more distance to cover."

Play outside.,

Lift the parachute.,
Call the names of one or two players.,
Lower the parachute as the players run under.,
Keep playing until everyone has had a turn.,
Add some alterations if you get bored.,
Practice moving the parachute at first.,
Use the ""Freeze"" rule.,
Make sure to listen.",How to Play Parachute Tag," Parachute tag should generally be played outside. This way, the ground is big enough to hold the parachute. However, if you have access to a gym, you may also be able to play parachute tag there.;
, You will need someone to hold each section of the parachute. Usually, a parachute is large, so you will need a big group. Get enough players together that you can easily lift the parachute off the ground.When everyone lifts their section of the parachute up, the parachute should easily lift off the ground and wind should blow it into the air slightly.

, In parachute tag, someone calls the players' names and, once called, a player has to run to the other side of the parachute. In order for the game to run smoothly, you have to designate someone to call names. Usually, if an adult is playing, the adult will call names. However, if you're playing without an adult, you will have to decide amongst yourselves.If you're struggling to decide fairly, try doing something like ""eeny, meeny, miny, moe,"" playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, flipping a coin, or drawing straws.

, To start, lay the parachute down on a flat surface. Everyone should assemble around the parachute. Keep everyone spaced out enough that you can lift the parachute evenly.Have everyone grab a piece of the parachute.
Parachutes are often cut into slices based on color. A good way to position yourselves is to have everyone stand before one slice.

, Once everyone is holding onto the parachute, lift the parachute up. You should do it on the count of ""three"" so you're working together. Raise your hands above your heads as you lift the parachute upwards., There are two ways to play parachute tag. You can have one player at a time run underneath the parachutes. You can also have two players on opposite sides switch places.Depending on what you decide, call either one player's name or two player's names.
The player or players will then let go of their section of parachute and run underneath. The goal is for players to reach the other side of the parachute.

, As soon as players start running, lower the parachute as a group. If the player who is running reaches the other side before the parachute touches them, they can remain on the other side. If the parachute touches them, they have to go back to their original spot., Parachute tag is not necessarily a game where there is a clear winner. You simply keep playing until everyone's name has been called. Once everyone has had a turn to try to run to the other side, the game is over., If you get bored with parachute tag, you can mix it up a little. For example, have people skip, run, or tumble under the parachute to get to the other side., It can be hard to learn how to move a parachute as a group. Before you start playing, have some practice runs. For a few minutes, lift the parachute up and down until you're used to moving it as a group., The freeze rule should exist for your safety. If someone yells freeze, especially a teacher or other adult, stop moving the parachute.You should yell ""freeze"" if someone is at risk for getting hurt. For example, yell ""freeze"" if a player has fallen under the parachute.

, Listening is vital for parachute tag. You need to listen to the group leader to know when to lift the parachute and when to bring it down again. You also need to listen closely so you can start running once your name is called."

Assume the position you put yourself in when in bed.,
Cover your face.,
Close your eyes.,
Stretch when the coast is clear.,
Choose a hidden place to stay still.",How to Play the Game Graveyard2," Usually, this will be the most natural to you, and it will not feel as hard to stay still.

, It is recommended to tuck your face under your arms or in your chest. That way, if someone comes by, they will not be able to see your mouth or nose.

, You will be less likely to panic if you do not know that someone is watching you. Take deep breaths and relax while playing.

, Make sure the person playing it is not near you, and cannot see you very well. If you are unable to turn your head to check, take breaks when you hear the ""it"" person's voice somewhere within ten feet of you.


It does not matter if another player sees you, whether they are still in or out. The one that is ""it"" is the only person with the power to eliminate other players.

, If you are out of everyone's view, then there is less chance the person that is it will come looking for you. Corners, under desks, and behind stuff are good places to hide. Avoid places where a lot of people are because ""it"" will most likely be there until he/she has gotten a good number of players out.

"
"
Be quiet.,
Ask the eliminated players to help you out.,
Check their face and hands.",How to Play the Game Graveyard3," Players are less cautious if they think that no one is watching. Walk up from behind and carefully make sure they're not moving.

, They can keep a close eye on certain people, and inform you where the person tends to move the most. Make sure you tell them not to make much sound when they spot movement, because the players will immediately know to be cautious.

, Players will know that any large movements, such as moving their legs, will be spotted, so they will prefer to move in parts that can be easily hidden. If their face is covered, try to lean over them without alerting the player.

, One person should be sitting in front of the other, excluding the lap person.

, (Make sure all hands are on the ground before starting the round to prevent cheating.)

, The name called should be the person in the front, not the back. The name called may not be the person sitting directly to the right or left of the lap.

, Try to get up off the floor and reach the lap.

, Do not let them reach the lap.

, You don't want your game spilling across the street and through the neighborhood. Set clear boundaries about how far players can run and hide. You'll want to give players room to run, but not too much space that the game gets boring.


Be careful to avoid trespassing on other people's property.
You may want to make certain potentially dangerous areas off-limits.

, This person will be your first Infected. You can either randomly select a person to be ""It"", or a fast and skilled player can volunteer or be nominated. Don't force a slow or unskilled player to be ""It"". This can be mean and wouldn't be fun for anyone.

, While closing their eyes, the person who is ""It"" will count to 30 and give the rest of the players time to run and hide., The person who is it will tag and infect other players. When another player is tagged, they are also infected. Once this occurs, they switch sides and begin to try to tag others. Uninfected players can ask if any other player is infected. If a player is infected, they must declare that they are.

, Keep playing until everyone is infected. The last person tagged is declared the winner. Then the game starts over, usually with the last person being the new Infected.

Go indoors.",How to Start a Leprechaun Hunt," Tell the participants in the Leprechaun Hunt that legend has it the leprechauns will only come out on Saint Patrick's Day, so you don't want to miss them.Don't tell them that they're fake and that parents do everything.;
, This step is optional, as you might not be interested in catching your leprechaun and indeed, he may be offended if you do. You might also want to bring a camera, and camouflage clothes.

, It's a lot more fun when two or more people are participating in the Leprechaun Hunt. Children might like to take along siblings, cousins, neighbors and friends.

, Start outside, because it's only natural that a leprechaun prefers the great outdoors. After all, leprechauns wear a lot of green and it stands to reason that green trees and grass provide perfect cover for them.

, If you see any, follow them. Leprechauns may also leave gold coins, or even chocolate coins!

, Since they're most probably scared of dogs, cats, birds and squirrels, it's best to leave Fido home and to not look up the trees for leprechauns. The better places will be where the animals are not.

, That includes trees, holes, and even sheds. The group leader should be prepared to look in tight and strange places.

, They could just be blending in. Are you sure you haven't seen one yet?

, Leprechauns may think it's a real gnome and try to entertain the gnome with conversation or a riddle or two. Other times, a leprechaun may be offended by the work of making one of his friends into a plastic mold.

, Once you've looked everywhere in your yard, start in your house. They might have already gotten inside:


Check near the door, that's where they'll go first.
Follow the same steps as for outside, except step 7.
P.S: Don't forget to check for little green sparkly footprints around the house of even on the cement outside and Don't forget to keep in mind if you find one and make him tell you where his gold is NEVER leave him unattended if you do he may trick you.

Try full zombie-mode infection tag.,
Try walking indoor Infection Tag.,
Play timed Infection Tag.",How to Play Infection Tag2," This variation works especially well if you need to play inside and can't run or risk damaging anything. Rather than chasing people, the person who is ""It"" merely needs to find them. Once found, a player assists the Infected person in finding other players. Last player found wins!

, In this variation, the original Infected is allowed to run as they normally would, but tagged players can only walk like a zombie, and must make zombie noises and moans when chasing other players.


This variation removes the need to ask other players if they are also infected - they'll be moaning and shuffling like a zombie!
This can also add an interesting element of strategy. Since zombie players can't move quickly, they need to work together to trap other players.

, This works well in really big houses and buildings as well, where running would be frowned upon. Since you shouldn't be running indoors, players are limited to walking when chasing and attempting to escape each other.


When walking, at least one foot must always be on the ground.

, This variation is more complicated in that it requires everyone to have a stopwatch or phone with a stopwatch app, but it can be a lot of fun. When tagged, players are infected for a set amount of time (usually 3 or 5 minutes). If this time elapses without everyone being caught, players are ""cured"" once their timer is up, and need to be tagged once more!

Name one of the players the Fox.,
Name the first child Mother Goose.,
Have the player who is Mother Goose stretch out her arms to protect her geese and not let the Fox catch one.",How to Play Fox and Geese," This player goes to one end of the room, and the rest of the children arrange themselves in a line, one behind the other, the tallest first and the smallest last.;
, The game begins by a conversation between the Fox and Mother Goose. ""What are you after this fine morning?"" says she. ""Taking a walk,"" the Fox answers. ""What for?"" ""To get an appetite for breakfast."" ""What will you have for breakfast?"" ""A nice fat goose."" ""Where will you get it?"" ""Well, as your geese are so handy, I will take one of them."" ""Catch one if you can.""

, The Fox tries to dodge under, right and left, until he is able to catch the last of the string. Of course, the brood must try to keep out of reach of the Fox. As the geese are caught they must go over to the den of the Fox, and the game continues until all are caught.

Get hold of either camouflage or a dark outfit.,Build up speed and endurance before the game will go down.,
The night of the game, (after it starts) move carefully to the border, crawling or staying low at all times.,
Once you reach the enemy flag on a two way radio call for a distraction 100–200 yards (91.4–182.9 m) opposite and behind your location.,Grab the flag and wrap it around your arm so less of you seems to attract attention,
Call for a party of 4-5 people once you reach the border to surround you and run very fast to the border.,
Celebrate like crazy.",How to Win at Capture the Flag at Night," Dark blues, grays, browns and greens tend to be less visible at night than actual black because of the silhouettes. Camouflage should match the local environment. The outfit must be comfortable and versatile. Waterproof, washable, durable clothing is desirable. Also, clothing should not be loud-this means no loose clothing that rubs together, things that jingle, or stiff clothing/shoes that creak. Sweats are best.
,, Once there, wait for 20-30 seconds, checking for defenders. Lunge across the border in a low stance. Dive or step into the nearest brush (depending on the amount of time you think you have).,

If you do not have a radio, simply wait for someone to do something stupid.

,, The people around you can block tags from the other team, giving you some cover.

If no one else is available, sneak out the way you came in. This almost always works.

, Be sure to rub it in. Now you have bragging rights!"

Set up boundaries for the game.,
Make the house as dark as possible.,
Choose one person to be “it.” You can do this in a multitude of ways.,
Find a good place to hide.,
Count to 50 or 100.,
Go find the person hiding.,
Ask, ""Are you the sardine?” to the person hiding.,
Continue hiding until one person is left.",How to Play Sardines," Since you can play this game either indoors or outdoors, it’s important for every player to know where they can and can’t go. For example, if you are playing outside, you want to make sure that everyone understands they have to stay in the yard and not wander over to the neighbor’s two doors down. Of course, the size of the area depends on the number of players and how much space you want to use.All that matters is that there are enough places to hide.;
, If you are going to play indoors, you want to try and make the area you’re using as dim as you can. Turn out the lights, close the blinds/curtains, turn off TVs, computer monitors and any other sources of light. Once you do this, your group can either go outside or start in a neutral area like a foyer.


If there are other people in the house while you’re playing, you can either restrict your group to one area or simply do your best to work around them.
If you're afraid of getting hurt in a dark house everybody could have flashlights and when you find the person remember to turn your flashlight off and don't make a sound.
You can also play another version where all lights are on, and the hunted hides in plain sight, but in a tiny space.

, For example, if no one volunteers, try playing rock, paper, scissors or pulling names from a hat. Once a person is chosen, have them go into the house and hide somewhere in the dark. This person is the hider/hunted and everyone else is a seeker/hunter., The place you choose may depend on how many people you're playing with. For example, if you are playing with 4 other people, you only have to fit 3 other people in with you. On the other hand, if you're playing with 15 other people, then that's 14 people you need to fit in your hiding place beside yourself.


You can try hiding under a table or a bed, in a closet under piles of clothes, in a pantry, a spacious cupboard, even in a doghouse if you find one. Just keep in mind the other people who will be forced to hide with you.
If you're the hider/hunted and don't like your hiding place you are free to move. However, be aware that you have to be very fast and sneaky if you hear footsteps.

, While the chosen person hides inside, the people left outside count to 50 or 100. They should do this slowly to give the person hiding some time to find and get into a spot. If you have a larger playing area, like a big house or yard, you will want to give the person hiding more time.

, When the people outside or the hunters are done counting they can split up and start looking for the person that is hiding. When you’re playing in a house, the darkness should help make finding the player more difficult. However, if you’re playing outside during the day, you will probably have to rely on playing in a large area to make it more difficult.Make sure that everyone looking works as individuals, there are no teams in this game.
When trying to find the hiding person/group feel your way through the house with your hands since you can't see. Or, if you are worried about breakable objects or bones, give each participant a small flashlight to help them find their way. The flashlight should be used only if necessary and turned off again after overcoming any obstacles.

, If that person is “it,” they must answer, ""Yes, I am the sardine."" At this point, you become a sardine, too. That is to say, you must hide in the same spot and stay quiet. You don't want anyone else to find you, so make sure to look around before you hide.

, As everyone discovers the original hider, they have to hide with them. This continues until there is only one person left. Whoever is last becomes the next hider or sardine. Depending on the number of people playing, packing everyone into one space can be both difficult and amusing.


If you're the last person to find the original hider and everyone else, you become it for the next game.

, Does your friend have the biggest backyard, but you have the woods? Take a vote so everyone involved gets a share.

, If you have an odd number or people, that's okay; just make sure it’s fair. Two of the groups will end up being hiders while one will be seekers.


If you divide your teams into more than three groups, make sure you have one group of seekers for every group of hiders.

, It would also be a good idea if you have everyone’s cell phone numbers.

, If they are wearing shorts, it might be a good idea to put them on their ankles, too.

, Cover pale faces with makeup or wear a ski mask.

, They are as follows:


There are two winners, one for the hiders, and one for seekers. The hider who wins is the last person out there. The seeker who wins is the one who doesn’t turn on the light without tagging anyone or who tags the most hiders.
The hiders can choose to hide anywhere inside or outside, and can change hiding places at any time.
Hiders have to stay hidden or out of sight. They can always run around a corner if there are some seekers coming!
The seekers each have to carry a flashlight, but can only turn it on if they see a hider and are going to tag them. You ‘tag’ them with the light.
When a hider is tagged by a seeker, they have to sit in an off-limits room and wait. You could also make them go along with the seekers.
If a seeker turns on the light to tag somebody and there isn’t anyone there, they must go inside and wait. This prevents against seekers running around with the lights on all the time.
When there is only one hider left that hasn't been found, a seeker goes around the house and turns on all the lights in the house. This is a signal to whoever is left that they are the only one out there.

, Change groups to accommodate everybody’s wants.

,, They can read it, but they can't let anyone know what's written on their piece of paper or if there is nothing on it.

Don't loiter around the opposing team's base.",How to Play Manhunt," The goal of Manhunt is for the hunted to get from the starting point to the escape zone. The hunters have to find and ""tag"" the hunted before they get to the escape zone.


The players both have their own bases. However, the hunted players have to reach their base. The hunters start at their base and patrol around to keep an eye out for the hunted.;
, (Keep the amount of players even.) Divide everyone into two equal teams and decide which team hides first.


Pick two captains of each team. Allow the captains to establish the bases of their teams - preferably close together.

, They both have their advantages and their disadvantages. Playing during the day grants more visibility (and more time to play the game), but it may be hot and the streets will likely be busy. Night will be cooler and less busy, as well as helping to hide the players in darkness, but your visibility is decreased, which increases the risk of people getting hurt or lost.


If playing at night, make sure all players have flashlights and some form of a communication device, regardless of what team they're on.

, In Captains, if the captain of the hiding team gets to base untagged, then the hiding team wins. In Majority (the more common and fun way), if the majority gets to base without being tagged, then that team wins.

, For example, if one of your players has asthma or is a slow runner, pair them up with an older or faster person.

, When establishing the rules of the game, make sure that everyone decides what areas are out-of-bounds, and if you are caught in these areas, you are automatically ""tagged"" and you have to go back to base.


Make sure players know that private property, cars, and abandoned or under-construction buildings are off-limits, since these could get you in trouble or be hazardous.

, Come up with a time limit for the hiding team to hide and get to base, so you can get through a good number of games before you have to go in. A good time is around 1-10 minutes, and make sure everyone is aware of this.

, An air horn or a loud yell is a good indicator.


The captains can call a time out for the group if necessary.

, A good way to communicate between players is a group SMS.


Use this to your advantage. Teams can create their own group SMS or walkie-talkie channel, making it easy to communicate amongst each other.

, Choose colors such as brown, grey, navy blue or camouflage. Avoid wearing black, as it tends to make your silhouette stand out against other objects. Don't wear clothing that restricts your movement, as it'll make it harder to run.


Be cautious with fluorescent or bright colors; if you're playing at night, this will make you more visible to cars and passersby, but it'll also make you more visible to other players.
Obviously, don't wear your best clothes. Manhunt can involve a lot of crawling around or getting into dirty areas. Pick out clothes that won't show a stain, or clothes that you don't care about.
If you're wearing shoes with laces, keep them tied, so as not to slow yourself down.

, Boundaries should have been established prior to the game, but if the boundaries are fairly loose, make sure to keep out of areas that could get you hurt. Stay out of abandoned buildings, cars, houses that aren't yours or a friend's, areas that are under construction, and areas with potentially dangerous materials in them (such as broken glass).


Don't play in forested areas at night or if you haven't explored them before. The risk of getting lost is always there at any time of day, and if you're playing at night, it's much easier to not see dips, tree roots, animals, or other potential hazards.
Cheating, or going out-of-bounds, can be fun, but it can also result in you getting lost. Stay out of areas that you don't know very well, and don't wander too far away from in-bounds.

, Regardless of which team you're on, it's important not to make yourself especially visible to other players, since that'll alert them of your presence. Try the following tips to make yourself less noticeable:


Turn the brightness on your cell phone down, and use flashlights sparingly (unless you don't know the area well).
Whisper to other players, rather than shouting to them.
Don't make a lot of noise in your surroundings, unless it's to create a distraction (e.g. slamming a park gate and running off).

Walk quietly, so as not to alert someone with your footsteps.

, Duck into areas or shrubbery such as bushes, sides of ditches with trees that have drooping branches for cover, alleyway corners, hills, behind trees, and more. Try to hide in areas that match the color of your clothes, if possible.

, Cars can provide good cover, but they can also drive away at a moment's notice. If you're using cars for cover, make sure to duck underneath the windows so that others can't see your silhouette moving through the windows, and don't look into anyone's car.


Don't hide in the bed of a pickup truck, since you don't want to run the risk of having to jump from the truck while it's moving.

Never hide underneath cars. Many people don't check under their cars before starting to drive, and you don't want to get hurt by hiding under a car.

, If you spot a hunter headed your way, and escape without detection is not possible, make yourself into the smallest object you can, stick close to shadows and stay extremely still. The hunter will be looking for movement; if you can blend with your surroundings, you may escape their notice.

, Make sure not to touch the other team's base, though! If you touch the other team's base, you're disqualified until the next game.


If you get tagged, you become a hunter or disqualified, depending on your group's rules of the game.

, You might think this applies to only the hunted, but keep in mind that the hunted will be on the lookout for hunters, too. Move quietly and try to blend in with your surroundings as best as possible. You want to avoid detection so that the hunted don't notice you so quickly (and, as a result, have less time to escape).

, Look for small things that might give away where someone is hiding. Even if it's something simple, like the color of something not quite matching, check it out and approach it if it doesn't look right to you. You might discover a ""hidden"" player from the other team!

, Most people tend to look for other people at eye level, especially when it comes to games like this. However, strategic players may hide in areas that you might not expect - such as up trees or underneath objects. Don't just look around - look up (and down, too)! This will increase your chances of catching a player who thought they were being sneaky.

, It might be funny to you to stand right at the hunted team's base to prevent them from getting to their base, but this isn't fair to them and doesn't give them a chance at winning, which kind of makes the entire game pointless. Before the game starts, discuss with both teams about how long the hunters can stay around the opposing team's base. However, if both teams aren't concerned about fairness, feel free to stick around. It'll make it even tougher for them!

Choose ""IT"".,
Pick the base.,
Have ""IT"" count.,
Hide, then try to get to base.",How to Play Hide and Go Seek Tag," Before you start the game, you need to choose the person who will be ""IT"". If no one wants to be ""IT"", use the eenie, meenie, minnie, moe chant. To do the eenie, meenie, minnie, moe chant, have the players stand in a line or a circle. Then, point at a different person every time you say a word. The chant goes like this: ""Eenie, meenie, minnie, moe, catch a tiger by the toe. If he hollers make him pay, fifty dollars every day. My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are IT!"" Make sure you're pointing at yourself as well as everyone else during the chant. You can also do ""Not it!"" where one player yells ""One, two, three!"" and everyone (including the player who says ""one, two, three!"") has to yell ""Not it!"" The last person to yell ""Not it!"" is ""IT"".;
, For hide and go seek tag, you'll need a base. It can be an old tree in your backyard, or the cherub statue in your lawn. You just need a base big enough for all the players hands to fit on it.

, Count the number of players excluding ""IT"", and multiply that number by ten. For example, if you have five players, subtract one for ""IT"", and multiply the rest (four) by five which would be 20. ""IT"" has to count to 20 with their eyes closed before they can go and get the other players. If you have less than five players (including ""IT""), have ""IT"" count to twenty so the players have time to hide.

, While ""IT"" is counting, the rest of the players need to hide somewhere at least 20 feet (6.1 m) from base. When ""IT"" says ""Ready or not, here I come!"" the players have to try to get to the base without ""IT"" tagging them. If all the players make it to base without ""IT"" tagging anyone, then the same person who was ""IT"" will be ""IT"" again the next round.

Traditionally played on soccer or football fields, ultimate Frisbee can be played in any open field that’s at least 70 yards by 40 yards, with marked-off end zones at each end, where points are scored. In regulation Ultimate Frisbee, the end zones are 20 yards deep.


Work with the space you have. If you’re playing in a backyard, don’t worry about measuring it off. Just set up two end zones at each end of the yard to give each team a territory, then start playing.;
, Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport that will require at least a handful of players on each side to play. Split up your group of friends into two evenly-divided teams.


The absolute minimum of players would be four–two per team–but that would be a challenging game. It’s usually best with between five and seven players, per side.
Regulation Ultimate Frisbee teams have seven players on each side, though the roster can include as many players as you want. Players may be substituted any time after a point is scored., You can play Ultimate Frisbee with any kind of Frisbee, though it’s typically easier and more recommended to play with a slightly heavier version of the classic recreational disc. This makes controlling your passes and your distance a lot easier than with a basic beach Frisbee.


175 gram Frisbees are recommended for playing Ultimate Frisbee, which are widely available at sporting goods stores. The Discraft Ultra-Star 175 is the official playing disc for the USA Ultimate Championship Series., As in soccer, American football, lacrosse, or other goal-based sports, each team has one end zone that they’re defending and will attempt to score in their opponent’s end zone. The object of the game is to move the Frisbee down the field by completing passes to your teammates.


The player in possession of the Frisbee may not move and must not hold the Frisbee for longer than 10 seconds. The rest of the players will move around the field and attempt to get open for a pass.
If a pass is dropped, goes out of bounds, or is intercepted, play is turned over to the defending team at the point of play.
Meanwhile, the team not in possession of the Frisbee will attempt to intercept the disc and otherwise disrupt the passes made by the team in possession.

, It can be hard to find enough people who know how to play informally, and get a regular game going. For this reason, the best way to learn the strategies, techniques, and enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee is to find a league in your area in which you'll be able to learn the ropes and have fun making new friends. You can find pick-up games in your area here.

, After dividing into two even teams and going over the basic rules, pick which team will start with possession. This can be done by tossing a coin, flipping the Frisbee, or using some other method of your choice, then launching the disc to start play.


The opposing team will stand at their end zone and “pull” the disc to the other team, essentially tossing it in the air for someone to grab, much as a ball is kicked off in American football. This will also happen after each point is scored.
The puller should make sure everyone is ready, then toss the Frisbee high toward the opponent's group of players. All the pullers teammates should immediately run toward the opposition to start playing defense.

, A point is scored by completing a pass into the opponent’s end zone territory. Upon scoring a point, the possession of the disc changes to the team that was scored upon. The team in possession of the Frisbee will be trying to score and the other team will be trying to disrupt play and get possession of the Frisbee, so they may score.


A point is scored when a player passes the Frisbee to another player who is standing in the end zone, and that player makes the catch successfully. At that point, play ends and the defending team will receive possession of the Frisbee.
Substitutions may be made in the transition period after a point is scored and before the other team takes over possession of the disc.

, Psychically contacting players on the opposing team is illegal. Picks, screens, and other disruptive plays are not allowed in Ultimate Frisbee. It’s important for defenders to be disruptive and guard the other team, much as in basketball, but without actually coming into contact.


It is up to the defender guarding the player in possession of the Frisbee to count to 10, usually aloud. It is this defenders job to police 10-second infractions.

, Typically, a game of Ultimate Frisbee ends when one team scores 15 points, though you can amend this rule to fit your time constraints and your desires for the game. Typically, a game to 15 can take as long as an hour and a half, so you might want to play to seven or 10, if you don’t have that long.

, Ultimate Frisbee is uniquely anarchic. Even in regulation play, no referees or line judges are used to govern play. Fouls, points, and disputes are resolved on field by the two teams. Ultimate Frisbee requires honesty and goodwill, making it a game of trust and fun.


Sometimes an “observer” is used to offer some objective party, uncommitted to each side, who may be used for procedural details, such as keeping track of the time,

, To throw a Frisbee correctly, place your index and middle finger under disk, close to the lip. Curl the two fingers to get a firm grip, and twist your body to your throwing hand side. Take a step forward with your dominant foot, and untwist your body. Once you have faced forward, flick your wrist, release the disc, and point where you want the disc to go. Keep the Frisbee parallel to the ground.

, As you advance, you can develop more complex throwing motions into your game with some practice. This is To ""hammer throw,"" put your index and middle fingers under the disk and put your thumb on top. Do not curl your index and middle fingers. Like you are throwing any ball, raise the disk over your head, and have the disk angled towards your head. Make sure you have about a 50-55 degree angle on the disk. Still keeping the angle, throw the disk forward and upward. The disk should fly perpendicular to the ground for a couple seconds and flip upside down to float softly to the ground. This throw is a little tricky to catch, but can be useful under heavy defense.


Try a sidearm toss. Place your index and middle fingers under the disk, and curl them against the lip of the disk. Place your thumb on top. Twist your body slightly towards the disk, and flick your wrist to release the disk. Make sure you twist your hand towards your body when you throw to put enough spin the disk to fly. This throw is very useful when you are being defended by an opposing player, but takes practice.

, The difference between teams that are good at Ultimate Frisbee and teams that are just playing is in the speed of the passes. Practice making quick, crisp, accurate passes with your teammates and moving quickly down the field to keep the defense off balance. Though the player in possession has 10 seconds to hold onto the Frisbee, it should be a rarity that a player holds the Frisbee for longer than five.


Don't worry about making ""hail mary"" passes that launch all the way down the field. These types of passes are low-probability and will more often result in picks, than in long point opportunities.

, Throwing a pass directly to a stationary player is a good way of getting your Frisbee toss picked off by the defense and losing possession. Instead, practice leading your teammates, passing into open space, and allowing your teammates to outrun the defense and run down the Frisbee. This is a more effective technique of moving possession down the field and gathering territory.

, Unless you see a great opportunity, you don't need to charge down the field as soon as you grab the Frisbee. Focus on making high-probability passes and controlling the possession of the disc, not in scoring immediately. If you've got the Frisbee, possess it. Make crisp and accurate passes and move down the field gradually, gaining territory.


Like in soccer, you can move in any direction when you've got possession of the disc. If you need to make a few passes backward to regroup and control the field, do so. You generally want to be going forward and not back, but it can be a good way of strategizing.

, When you're not in possession of the Frisbee, you need to be constantly moving into open space, looking to get open. Spread out. Make cuts, juke out your defenders, and hustle, hustle, hustle.


Learn to make crossing patterns in your cuts, taking short routes across the path of the player in possession of the disc, rather than moving parallel. This will result in higher probability passes and help you control the disc. It gives the player in possession more options.

, Like in basketball, soccer, or almost any team sport, it's important to have a few plays drawn up, especially when you get into scoring pattern. Whether you want to give them fancy names (""Flying V on one, on one!"") or just run them on the down-low, moving the offense in pre-drawn patterns is a good way to juke out the defense and stay ahead of the game.


If the player in possession knows what kind of route you're likely to run, the passes can go to open space and allow players to run them down.

, When you're playing defense, the best way to mark up is usually ""man-to-man,"" by marking up on one player for the whole game and sticking to them like glue. Defense should be played much as a combination of basketball and football, using your arms to disrupt the shots of the player you're guarding and trying to pick off passes.


Defenders need to give the offensive player a bubble, at least a yard around the point of possession. You can't get in close enough to physically touch the player in possession of the disc. Remember: no contact.
When you're running with players on defense, try to watch their hips instead of watching for the Frisbee. Stay between them and the player in possession of the disc, to give yourself the best chance of picking one off.

Much like hide and seek, you need to choose an ""it"" person and the people who will hide.,
If you are the ""it"" person, you probably already know what to do after choosing the players and what their role is for the game, hiding or seeking.,
When the ""it"" person is done counting, they must call out, ""Ready or not, here I come!"",
The ""it"" person must find someone.,
You become ""it"" after being tagged by the ""it"" person.,
Continually play as long as you want.",How to Play Hide and Seek Tiggy1," The ""it"" person is the person who must find the hiders in their hiding spots, but who now has more of a job to do. Make sure at least three or more people are playing, but do not include too many, lest the game become too crowded and difficult.;
, The ""it"" person must close their eyes and count to a certain number. Ten is the most popular number used. When the ""it"" person is counting, this is the chance for the people hiding to go and hide. The ""it"" person must also count out loud.

, and seek the people hiding. The people hiding are allowed to move spots if found, as the game is slightly changed. The ""it"" person must tag one of the people hiding in order for that person to be ""it"".

, However, it's not recommended for the people hiding to continually change hiding spots, or the game will become unfair and hard for the ""it"" person. The person hiding is allowed to run if they are found by the ""it"" person.

, Like hide and seek, it's possible to cheat in Hide and Seek Tiggy. Cheating is either changing spots or using certain tactics to ensure you are never ""it"", but the ways to cheat will not be revealed on here.

, This game has no time limit, and neither does hide and seek.

"
Choose an ""it"" person.

,
Choose a home base.

,
Have the ""it"" person count to twenty.,
The ""it"" person begins the look.",How to Play Hide and Seek Tiggy2,",, The players must all hide at least 5 meters (16.4 ft) away from the ""home base"".

, The aim of the game is for the hiding players to return to home base without being tagged.


Hiding players must run to the home base and say loudly ""123 home base!"". If a player gets tagged first, they're ""it"" next.
If you're ""it"" next and you don't want to be, you must do 10 push ups or do the Harlem shake.

Turn all lights off.,
Clean the floor.,
Gather a group of friends, or family members.,
Play in an area, like a huge basement, where you will have plenty of space to hide.

",How to Play Hide and Seek in the Dark (Inside)1," It's pretty self-explanatory. Cover up any computer lights, such as the mouse light, or any other lights.

, Make sure you pick up every thing you can trip over. Also make sure you pick up all laundry baskets; if you kick them, it can hurt badly.

, After you do that, say something like ""1 2 3 NOT IT!"" or do ""Bubble Gum Bubble Gum in a Dish"", or something like that to decide who is ""it"".

Using the proper Frisbee is vital to performing these throws correctly when one is a novice of ultimate Frisbee.,
Ideal Weather Conditions: As can be pretty easily guessed, the most important condition that allows you to throw a Frisbee well is no wind.",How to Throw a Frisbee Backhand and Forehand1," The kind of Frisbee you want to use is one that is the 175 grams (6.2 oz), which is the official weight for the game of Ultimate Frisbee. There are plenty of companies that make official ultimate discs, but a few include Discraft, which seems to be the most popular, and Wham-O, who were the inventors of the original Frisbee Flying Disc. All official Ultimate Frisbee discs are flat on the top, with the outside sloping down to a vertical lip around the entire circumference of the disc. The bottom looks like a flat bowl, or a plate with a vertical lip. This shape allows the most control and distance for the thrower.;
, When wind is a non-factor, the flying disc will go exactly where your muscles send it since there will be no outside force to blow it off course, slow it down, or even speed it up. As well as no wind, warmer temperatures (above 70 degrees Fahrenheit or so) are preferred, as warmer air will keep the Frisbee flying for a greater distance, and warmer temperatures are generally just more enjoyable. However, for health and safety reasons DO NOT practice these throws outside if the temperature is severely low or high, you are not comfortable with the current conditions, or the weather is too dangerous to be in for an extended period. Additionally, you may want someone to throw back and forth with, as retrieving your own throws can get quite tedious and boring! Now that we have gone over what we need to know before, we can move on to the mechanics.

"
"
Gather a minimum of eight people, choose captains, and choose teams.,
Decide on which team will hide first and which team will seek.,
Make sure all the participants know the rules:


While the seeking team is counting or waiting, the hiding team will run and hide in a hard to find area within the boundaries.",How to Play Jail Break the Outdoor Game," make sure the teams are even and fair. choose a spot for the ""jail"" with space to hold everyone on a team and easy ways in and out. Set up boundaries for the playing area, but make sure that they are pretty widespread.;
, The seeking team will wait 1-2 minutes in the jail.

,
When the seeking team is finished counting, they will all run out and search for hiding players on the other team. If they find a hidden player they have to catch them, but the hiding player is allowed to run. In order to catch the hiding player, they have to hold on to the player and say, ""1-2-3 You're My Man""

When caught, the hiding players must walk to jail. The only way for them to get out is to be ""Jail Broken"".
In order to be ""Jail Broken"", a player of the hiding team that has not been sent to jail can touch the jail and yell, ""Jail Break!!!"", and everyone in jail is freed.
The game is ended when, eventually, every player on the hiding team is caught. the players then switch sides, the hiding team switching to the seeking team and vice versa.

"
"
Have the team captains determine the order.,
After the toss each team lines up four players (often a 3:1 ratio of men and women) on opposing baselines on the basketball court.

,
Each player on the team pulling lines up opposite the person on the other team they wish to mark.,
The team with the disc then pulls.,
The opposing team receiving the pull has two options: a) they can catch it and if they do they must play from that point, or b) they can leave it to hit the ground and then play the disc from where it lands.,
The first person to pick up the disc after a pull must check it into play.,
Offence is prohibited from running with the disc.,
If a player catches the disc on the line it is out.,
When a player catches the disc the leg that is opposite to the arm they throw the disc with becomes their pivot foot and must remain stationary but they are able to move their other leg around allowing them to fake while trying to throw the disc.,
When offence has the disc, defenders must each have a player to mark.,
The defender marking the player with the disc counts a stall count out loud.,
If a disc hits the ground or is intercepted or knocked down by the opposition, then it is a turnover.,
To score, offence needs to catch the disc in the endzone that can be a marked out rectangle or, in New Zealand, we use the basketball key as the endzone.

,
After a team has scored a point, they keep hold of the disc and wait while the opposition walks back to the opposing end of the court.",How to Play Indoor Ultimate Frisbee," Before teams take to the court, team captains need to meet to do the disc toss to determine who will pull first. To do this one person calls ‘up’ or ‘down’ while the other person tosses the disc. If the call is correct that team captain gets to choose whether they receive the disc first or pull. The other team captain then gets to choose which end they want to start at. If the call is incorrect the other team captain chooses whether they want to receive the disc or not. Pull (definition): The throw at the start of each point that initiates play.;
,, Once organised, the person with the disc puts one hand in the air to signal that they are ready to commence play (this occurs at the beginning of every point). They must wait for someone on the opposing team to raise one hand in response before pulling.

, This is where they attempt to throw it as far down the court as they physically can. Afterwards, the other team takes possession.

, Dropping the pull in an attempted catch results in a turnover.


If the pull lands inbounds and rolls out, it must be played on the sideline at the point where it went out.
If the pull goes “out on the full” there are two options: a) put the disc into play on the sideline at the point where it went out, or b) put the disc into play from the middle of the court perpendicular to the point where it went out. For option b, you must signal your intentions by raising one arm in the air before picking up the disc.

, They do this by either a) waiting for a defender to tap the disc and yell ‘disc in’, or b) a self-check where they tap the disc onto the ground. After checking the disc they are able to throw it to another team member. This is similar to basketball rules when the ball must be checked into play at the beginning of a point.

, Upon receiving the disc, they must come to a complete stop before passing to another player. By passing from player to player, offence is attempting to work the disc up the court towards their endzone. Offence (definition): The team with possession of the disc. Endzone (definition): The area in which a team catches the disc in, in order to score.

, If the disc comes into contact with anything that is out of bounds, such as a spectator, then it is out. When catching the disc the player must ensure their first point of contact with the ground after making a catch is in bounds, otherwise a turnover ensues. If your first point of contact is in but your momentum carries you out, you must return to the point where you went out before carrying on play. If you land with one foot out and one foot in, you are straddled and this is out. Also, dropping the disc due to contact with the ground is a turnover. A receiver must make as few steps as possible to come to a complete halt when catching the disc otherwise this is travel. If the disc is caught at the same time by both a defender and an offence player possession goes to offence. Straddle (definition): when one foot is in bounds and the other foot out of bounds.

, Pivot (definition): When you plant your foot (left for right handers and right for left handers) and step to the side (allowing you to navigate a throw around your defender). Fake (definition): A pretend movement one way to fool your defender opening up space on the opposite side.

, Similar to man-on-man marking in hockey. The idea is that offence will not want to pass a disc to a player who is being marked closely. Therefore, offence players need to get free of their defenders by cutting. Cutting (definition): An attempt to get free to receive the pass. It begins with a fake then followed by a sudden change of direction and speed. Man-on-man (definition): The most common type of defence. It is where a defence player marks an offence player and attempts to stay as close as possible to the player in order to receive an intercept or forcing a mistake.

, They begin by saying ‘stalling, one, two…’ The player holding the disc has just seven seconds to pass it to a teammate. If the disc has not been released on ‘seven’ the defender takes possession.

, Turnover (definition): change of possession.

,, After each team has signaled they are ready the team that score the point then pulls.

Do things such as count to a number that the hiders pick.,
When you get to the area where everyone is hiding, listen closely; something as simple as breathing can give away a person's hiding spot.

,
Look closely.,
Be careful.,
When you think you've found someone, tag them.,
Once the tagger tags someone, it's their turn to be the tagger.

",How to Play Hide and Seek in the Dark (Inside)2," Make sure it is enough time so the hiders can hide.;
,, If something looks unusual, like a big, tall spot on the wall, it is most likely a hider.

, Feel around just in case you missed something while you were cleaning.

, Feel around their body to make sure it is a person (not to the point where they're uncomfortable).

"
Being a hider can be fun, but tricky.,
When the tagger is near you, TRY YOUR BEST not to laugh or breathe heavily.,
Don't hide by anyone.",How to Play Hide and Seek in the Dark (Inside)3," Make sure you hide somewhere that the tagger would most likely miss, or somewhere SO obvious that the tagger wouldn't even think to look there.

, Stay calm and quiet so they move forward to another place.

, This has to do with trust. If you completely trust someone, go ahead and hide with them. But, if you don't trust them and you believe that they will laugh or make a loud noise to give you away, don't hide near them.

Gather your supplies.,
Fold the paper in half on a diagonal.,
Fold the tip of the paper down.,
Use glue to put the pieces together.,
Repeat the process for every piece.,
Test out your creation.",How to Make a Paper Frisbee1," To use this method, you will need at least eight pieces of 3” x 3” paper (6 cm x 6 cm). You can use printer paper or origami paper, which will be thin and easy to fold. You will also need a ruler and glue.You can use thicker paper like cardstock but make sure they are 3” x 3” as this will make it easier to fold and fit the pieces of paper together.;
, Make sure the top right corner folds to meet the bottom left corner on a diagonal line. You can use the ruler to ensure you get a nice even fold on a diagonal.If you’re using double-sided paper, make sure to fold it so you can see the colors. Otherwise, they’ll just be hidden in the frisbee.

, Take the left top corner (or the tip of the triangle shape of the paper) and fold it so it touches the bottom left corner of the paper. Use your fingers or the ruler to make a nice, even crease.Repeat these steps for the remaining seven pieces of paper. Make sure the folds are on the same side. For example, if the first piece is folded so the left top corner touches the bottom left corner of the paper, you should do this for the remaining pieces of paper. This will make it easy to put the pieces of folded paper together and form the frisbee.

, Once you have eight pieces of folded paper, you can use glue to put them together in the shape of a frisbee. You will glue and slide each piece of paper together to form the frisbee. You can use other adhesives like tape or staples, but glue will work the best.Turn one of the folded pieces so the point of the smaller triangle faces to the left and the right point of the larger triangle faces to the right. Place a small dot of glue on the top corner of the folded piece where the smaller triangle and the larger triangle form a straight line.
Slide the section with the glue into the pocket of the second folded piece of paper. The pocket will be formed by the smaller triangle section of the folded piece of paper. Press down on the paper so the glue sets properly. The pieces of paper should make two 45° angles on the inner and outer edge when you’re done.

, Add glue to the piece of paper you just glued inside the other. The pieces will naturally make an octagon as you put them together. Make sure you don’t accidentally glue the paper to your work surface and risk tearing it. , It’s better to throw paper frisbees with more of a backhand flick than a full frisbee toss. The motion should be almost entirely in your wrist. Paper frisbees aren’t sturdy enough to stand up to a throw with all your strength behind it.Don’t worry if it doesn’t work the first time. Try to figure out what went wrong and fix it the next time you make one. Is it too floppy to throw? You probably made it too large or added too much glue. Did one of the connections come apart? Add a little more glue and try again.

Grip the Frisbee in your dominant hand, with your thumb resting over the top of the disc, and your other four fingers.

,
Raise your throwing arm parallel to the ground and tuck the Frisbee into your chest.,
Step into your throw while keeping your toes pointed perpendicular to the direction of the throw.

,
Move your forearm and wrist outward in a quick throwing motion, while keeping your entire arm parallel to the ground, and your shoulder in place.,
Release (quickly) the flying disc just before your entire arm is straight and in a locked position.,
Repeat and practice, practice, practice!

",How to Throw a Frisbee Backhand and Forehand2,",, Basically, you will be standing parallel to the line of the Frisbee’s flight.

,,, Your forearm and your wrist should be bent inwards.

,, Your shoulders should not move. Note: It is important during this step to keep your arm parallel to the ground, or the Frisbee will not fly flat and will veer off course.

Gather your supplies.,
Place both plates right side up.,
Decorate the plates.,
Cut a circle out of the center of each plate.,
Put the two plates together with the decorative side facing outward.",How to Make a Paper Frisbee2," To make a frisbee out of paper plates, you will need the following supplies:Two regular sized paper plates
Scissors
Tape or a stapler
Colorful markers or crayons for decorating your frisbee.

, Position the plates as if you were going to put food on them, with the right side facing towards you., Turn the plates upside down and decorate them as you wish with markers or crayons. You can put animals, shapes, or flowers on the plates. Make sure the decorations remain on the upside down area of the plates so they are visible when the frisbee is thrown in the air.You may also want to put circular shapes on the plates to mimic the movement of the frisbee when it flies in the air or create an interesting design on the plate that appears when the frisbee is flying in the air.

, You can do this by placing the plates together so the decorated sides are facing outward and cutting the circle out of the center of both plates. You can also do this one at a time by cutting the circle out of the center of each plate.Start by cutting a diagonal line from one end of the center of the circle to the other end. Then, cut another diagonal line so you have an ""X"" shape in the center of the circle. You can then cut out the center using the ""X"" cut.Try to cut only the center of the plate out and leave the rest of the plate intact.

, Use tape or staples to seal the edges of the plates together so the plates stay together. You should now have a frisbee with a hole in the center."

Don't be afraid of the disk.,
Get someone to throw you a Frisbee or aerobie.,
Find an open area where nothing can be broken or stuck in trees.,
Have the disk thrown in your general direction.

,
Now is the climax!,
When the disk is 1-2.5 feet (0.3-0.7 meters) in front of you, catch it.,
If the disk starts to fall early, do not run diagonally at it!,
If it goes too far, jump or run back and jump.,
Be happy inside you caught it!

",How to Make a Perfect Frisbee Catch," It's only a plastic toy, not a meteor hurtling towards you at the speed of light (it just seems that way). Closing your eyes will only make it more difficult to catch.;
, This is vital unless you have some kind of machine that throws flying disks.

, This is not entirely vital, if you and your partner(s) are careful. Windows, cars and trees are the most common hazards.

,, When the Frisbee (or aerobie) is in the air, move side to side with the movement of the disk. Do not go forward...yet.

, It is instinct usually. The basic idea is to close your hands around the disk the right time and not close your eyes. If the disc is an aerobie then the easiest way to catch it is too stick you arm in the large center hole. For Frisbee the easiest way to catch is the alligator method. Take both hands and clamp them around the disc like an alligator.


For a one-handed catch: Keep your thumb pointing up if the disk is coming in below your waist. If the disk is coming in high, keep your thumb pointing down. Use whichever position feels most natural for in-between heights. Squeeze your fingers and thumb tightly together to grab the disk just before it smacks into your palm.

, Run straight. If it rises at the last second, it is easier to stop when going straight than diagonally

, Not hard.

Stand with your non-dominant foot forward (the opposite of the foot used for a backhand throw).

,
Point the toes of your forward-facing foot slightly inward of your target, and the toes of your other foot perpendicular to the direction of the Frisbee’s flight.,
Point the shoulder of the arm you will not be using to throw toward your target.

,
Turn your head towards your target.

,
Spread your feet shoulders length apart and bend knees slightly.

,
Grip the disc with your thumb over the top and squeeze your middle and index fingers together then against the inside of the bottom lip so only the middle finger is touching the Frisbee, next squeeze your pinky and ring finger together and against the outside lip of the Frisbee so that your pinky and ring finger are clamping the lip against your middle and index finger.,
Raise your forearm parallel to the ground.,
Bend your wrist back (outward) about 45 degrees.

,
Cock your forearm back slightly, preparing to throw.

,
Quickly move your forearm inward while simultaneously flicking your wrist towards your target.,
Release the Frisbee just before your wrist is pointed towards your target, and watch it fly!

",How to Throw a Frisbee Backhand and Forehand3,", This allows for the best balance and comfort while throwing the forehand.

,,,, Only your middle and ring finger and thumb should be touching the disc. Your hand should look like the Spock hand clamping on the disc

, Your upper arm should essentially be straight down.

,,, Keep your middle finger pressed against the bottom lip until you release the disc. Most of the throws power should come from the flick of your wrist. *Note: Again, it is important during this step to always keep your forearm parallel to the ground, or the Frisbee will not fly flat and will veer off course.

Find thick paper.,
Draw a boomerang on the cardboard.,
Cut the pattern out of the cardboard.,
Fold down each prong of the boomerang slightly.,
Throw your new boomerang.",How to Make a Paper Boomerang," It should be thick enough to add some bulk to the paper, but thin enough for you to be able to cut it easily. You can take apart a cereal box, use a piece of cardboard, or even take apart an old shoe box or cardboard box.









To spice up your boomerang, you can pick a piece of cardboard with a pattern on it, or even draw your own pattern on the cardboard.

, Use a marker, pen, or pencil to draw three separate prongs of equal size and shape. If you want the boomerang to fly well, the three sides should be as equally-shaped as possible.









If you want your boomerang to be as uniformly shaped as possible, you can cut one prong out of a different piece of paper and use it as an outline for the three prongs of the boomerang. This will ensure that they really are the same size and shape.

, Use thick scissors to cut along the pattern that you traced. The boomerang should feel nice and sturdy once you've cut it out. If you don't want the part you drew to be shown, you can cut slightly inside your drawing, or place the drawing on the back of the side that you want to face up at the beginning. That way, it won't be visible even if you leave the outline on the boomerang.








, Turn the boomerang over and fold the right side of all of the prongs back slightly. Fold just one inch (2.5 cm) of the boomerang back just a tiny bit -- about 1/8th of an inch (.3 cm). Make sure you've folded the same side of each prong the same amount.








, Take your boomerang outside or to a cleared space and practice throwing it. It's all in the wrist -- just hold on to one of the prongs of the boomerang with your thumb and forefinger and throw it forward. Make sure it's parallel to the ground when you throw it so it doesn't instantly fall downward.

You don’t need to decorate the side of the plate you put food on because it will become the inside of the frisbee.

, Cover the side of the plate that you would place food on with clear packing or shipping tape. Cover the entire surface of the plate and trim the excess tape from around the edges of the plate.


You can use decorative duct tape to tape the plates and decorate your frisbee at the same time.

, Cut out the center of the flat portion of the plate. Your circle should be about 3 inches in diameter. Trace a circle using a large cup. Stab scissors through the center of the plate and cut out the circle leaving the edges of the plate intact., Attach the plates together with the packing tape around all the edges. Cover the entire decorated surface of the plate with the tape. Tuck the excess ends of the tape around the hole in the center of the plates., Hold the frisbee parallel to the ground and throw it by snapping your wrist as you release.

Pick a place where you want your hideout to be.,
Gather your building materials.,
Think about what you want your hideout to look like.,
Put up your supports.,
Drape blankets over the top of the supports.,
Bring in some of your belongings.,
Lay out separate areas.,
Include some basic furniture.,
Shine some light inside.,
Come up with a name for your hideout.,
Decide who will be allowed to enter.,
Set some rules.",How to Create a Hideout," The first step in building the hideout of your dreams is to find the perfect location. Look all around your house for areas that have the space and privacy you need. An attic or basement would be perfect, since they’ll be out of plain sight. You could also put your hideout in your own bedroom, or right in the middle of the living room.Putting your hideout in the family room is a good way to get a little more privacy without being too far away from the things you want to do.
Depending on the weather, you might be able to build a hideout outside. Just make sure you’re somewhere near your house where it’s safe, and be sure to hurry inside if it looks like it might rain.;
, Next, you’ll need stuff to build the hideout with. Grab as many blankets, sheets and/or beach towels as you can find. These will go on the outside of your hideout. For the rest of the structure, you can create a cozy nook with pillows or couch cushions, or you might use sturdier materials if you want your hideout to be more reinforced. Things like cardboard or plywood will help you put together a longer-lasting structure.Unused cardboard boxes make good building materials. They even fold up flat when you want to dismantle your hideout.
If you want it to build a quick and easy hideout, drape your blankets over a table or desk.

, Put some thought into designing your hideout. Start by getting the outside in order, then lay out the inside however you want. Your hideout could be tall with a pointed roof (using a broomstick as a support), or it might be lower to the ground so that you have to crawl on your stomach to get in. Get creative! You can make almost anything you imagine a reality.It doesn’t have to be complicated. You could make a good hideout only using the things on your bed.
Take advantage of the space you have. No hideout is too big or too small.

, Now it’s time to actually start setting up your hideout. Use furniture like the couch, the chairs from the dinner table or the laundry drying rack as your main foundation. You'll need at least four pieces of furniture to serve as the corners of the structure, and one in the center to keep the roof from collapsing if its really big.The most important thing is to have some way to stabilize your hideout so it doesn’t fall in on you.
Space out your supports so you have room to move around inside the hideout.

, With your foundation in place, you just need to finish your hideout by covering it. Stretch a few blankets or sheets over the outside of the hideout so no one can see in. Make sure you leave a hole in one side so that you can get in and out.Fitted sheets work nicely for building hideouts and forts. Their elastic edges will stretch around your supports and hold the sheet in place.
Hold sheets and blankets together with masking tape, clothespins or potato chip bag clips.

, Go to your room and grab a few things to take back to your hideout. Bring things like books to read, games, toys and sweets to enjoy. You could even plug in a radio or a video game system for entertainment. Load up on anything you think you’ll need once you’re inside.After you’re stocked up inside, you won’t have to leave your hideout again.
Remember to bring a jacket, especially if your hideout is outside.

, If your hideout is big enough, you could divide it into individual areas or even rooms. Have one area with a sleeping bag or blankets ready for when you get tired. Another can be your study, with your notebook and pens, pencils and markers for drawing or writing. Leave one side of your hideout open if you’re close to the TV—this can be your new theater.Create different rooms by hanging up a separate blanket or sheet.

, Move in some plastic tables and chairs to have a place to sit down and put things. Things like bean bags, foot stools and couch cushions make great furniture for small hideouts. If you don’t have any real furniture to spare, throw some blankets and pillows on the floor to set up a lounging area futon-style. Use whatever is available and comfortable.Construct your hideout around certain pieces of furniture, like the couch or coffee table, so that you’ll be able to use them while you’re inside.
Make sure it’s okay for you to use furniture and accessories from around the house before you take them to put in your hideout.

, You’ll need a way to see once it gets dark, especially if your hideout is enclosed. It’s easiest to just have a couple flashlights or a battery-powered lantern on hand to brighten things up. If you want to get fancy, string some Christmas lights around the edges of the hideout. With the right lighting, you’ll be able to enjoy all your favorite activities day and night.You might not need extra lighting at all if you built your hideout near a lamp, but it never hurts to be prepared.
Have an adult help you get the Christmas lights hung up and plugged in.

, Once your hideout is finished, you can give it an official name. You could dedicate it to you and your friends (something like “Lincoln Street Boys’ Club”), think up a witty title (“Casa de Joey”) or just give it a simple name like “headquarters” or “the base.” Since you built it, you have the right to name it whatever you want.Ask a friend for some suggestions if you can’t think of a good name on your own.

, Who will you let enter your hideout? Is it just for you, or is everyone invited? Be as selective as you see fit. If you built the hideout to get away from your big brother, for example, you could specify that it’s no boys allowed. Your hideout can either be a fun place for you and your friends to play or a quiet getaway just for you.Think about putting up a sign to let everybody else know who the hideout is meant for.
Don’t be mean or exclude people if you think it will hurt their feelings.

, Since you’ll be like the ruler of a castle in your hideout, what you say goes. Write out a list of rules that people have to follow inside your hideout. A few good basic rules might include: you can’t wear shoes, only 2-3 people at a time, and everybody has to share their snacks. The rules are your own, but try to be fair to anybody else who wants to see your hideout.


Write out your list of rules in bold letters and post them out in front of the entrance.
Invent a password for your hideout. That way, no one can come in unless they know it."

Fold the sticky ends to the center.,
Refold the post it in half.,
Push the square end toward the center and flatten to form a parallelogram.,
Fold seven more Post-its for a total of eight.,
Connect the shapes together.,
Throw your frisbee.",How to Make a Frisbee2," Fold the Post-it so that the sticky end sticks to itself. Position the Post-it so that the sticky end is on the left side. The sticky part will be on the inside of the fold., Fold the corner down so the right edge of the Post-it is aligned with the bottom edge. The post it should look like a square on the left half and a folded triangle on the right half., You will see a vertical crease down the center of the sticky portion and two diagonal creases along the bottom.

, The sticky end will hold the edges down. Fold both edges to the center. The Post-it should be in a “house” shape.

, It should now have a point on one end with the diagonal crease visible on the other side., Fold the end along the diagonal creases in an inward fold. This is the basic shape that will be used to form the frisbee. If you look at the post it from the open side of the folds, you should see a V shape.


One side of the parallelogram will be a single point while the other end will have two flaps.

, You will need eight folded parallelograms to create your frisbee.

, Attach the 8 shapes together by inserting the end with the single point between the two flaps of another Post-it.


Place one Post-it between the flaps of another.
Fold the ends of the two flaps over the flaps of the Post-it you inserted.
The flaps of the Post-it that were inserted will receive the next Post-it.
When all 8 Post-its are connected you will end up with a donut shape.

, Flatten the shape to get the best results when attempting to throw your pocket sized frisbee.


You can push the opposite edges of the donut shape together to transform your frisbee into a star shape.

;
, Your right foot should be in front if you are right-handed, and your left foot should be in front if you are left-handed.








, Your elbow should be pointing up and outward.








, Usually, you are throwing your Frisbee to another person, so you will want to aim your Frisbee so that your partner can catch it easily.








, Straighten your arm and, as your arm is almost fully extended, flick your wrist and release the Frisbee out towards the target.









Your wrist should snap with a spring-like motion.
Release the Frisbee at different heights for different effects during the throw. For the most stability, try releasing it just above your belly button.

, Too much power or too little will cause the Frisbee to hit the ground, wobble or fly wildly.








, Practice will perfect your own technique and give you a feel for how the Frisbee interacts with air currents.









Try throwing the Frisbee between two cones with a friend
Try throwing the Frisbee at a target. For example, you could throw the Frisbee into a box or toward a tree.

, During your throwing action, shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot while twisting your hips. For more stability, step outwards with your dominant foot.








, Remember these details while fine-tuning your throw.









Concentrate on your wrist snap. This action will add spin to your throw, which will make it more accurate and will keep the Frisbee from wobbling
Bend your elbow during your toss. The elbow bend will also improve your accuracy while increasing the power of your throw.
Keep the disc level as you throw. Imagine that the Frisbee is a dish of ice cream and that you are trying not to spill your dessert.

Do your research to find a safe place to dig.,
Pick the location and scan for debris.,
Decide on your dimensions.To make a simple fort you can create a 3 ft wide by 3 ft deep pit.,
Draw out your plan.,
Bring friends to help you.,
Dig your fort.,
Slope your walls.,
Dig out small cubbyholes.,
Arrange a way to get in and out.,
Smooth out the walls.,
Make it cozy.,
Use a plywood or wood cover.,
Use a tarp.,
Use an above-ground shelter as a roof.",How to Build an Underground Fort," Make sure that the spot you choose is legally your property, or that you have permission to build your fort there. Call your local government to check for utility lines where you plan to dig. The space for your fort needs to be away from gas, electric, and sewer lines.


Call 811 or any other relevant advice line where you live a couple of days before you dig and get help with locating utility lines in your area. Check with your parents, or other authority figures, before digging to get their permission.
If there is a septic tank, the homeowner should know where it is so you can avoid it. If they don't, you may need to contact local septic tank pumping companies to ask if they've worked on it, look for records of the location in any materials you have about the property and house.As a last resort to find the septic tank, you can scan the yard for any differences in the grass in the shape of a large rectangle. The grass may not grow in the area on top of the sewage tank, or it may be growing much greener than the grass around it depending on the sewage emissions.;
, Avoid areas with lots of tree roots and rocks, which will make it difficult to dig. You may have to test out areas by digging around here and there before you find the best location, but always be sure to avoid muddy areas where water may pool into your fort after it rains. Ideally the space for your fort will have good drainage, be clear of anything sharp, and the ground will be more earth than rock.


The best location will be in a grassy field.
Avoid building an underground fort in sand.
Do not dig a fort if you are in a flood zone.

, For a more complex fort, measure from your feet to shoulders to use as the depth and your total arms span for the width of the fort. You can also make a rectangular shaped fort; remember, the dimensions are up to you.


To avoid the walls collapsing you'll want to angle each wall slightly so that the opening of the fort is a half foot wider than the base.
Digging down further than 6 feet can be dangerous and isn't recommended as it's more likely for your fort walls to collapse and cause you or others harm.
In order to avoid the walls collapsing, never dig deeper than you dig across. The ratio should at least be equal.

, To help you 'see' the final product and to catch any structural issues, you should draw a sketch of what you want your fort to look like.Do this after you've picked the location so you have an idea of what you may need to work around – such as tree stumps or roots.


An example fort plan would be a 3x3x3 foot square box dug into the ground. (You can angle the walls after digging the original design.)
Write down the dimensions so you'll stick with the right measurements once you begin digging.
Check out how much arm room you'll have by using suitable markers, pegs or flags, and arranging them on the floor, in sync with your fort dimensions. Sit in the mock fort to see if you'll be comfortable and it feels like the right width.

, Ask people to help dig, and always tell someone back home where you are. Even after building the fort it's safest to let someone know when you are going to be in it. If you have a cellphone, be sure to bring it in case of an emergency.

, Start by grabbing your shovel and skimming off the top of the soil in the dimensions you've decided on. Check your measurements and if they're correct go ahead and begin digging out your fort. Do your best to evenly dig down and reevaluate your dimensions often so you don't dig too far off of the plan.


This will be hard work and may take a couple days, depending on the dimensions and how much time you have to dig. If you want to protect the work you've done, cover it with a tarp overnight. Hold down the corners of the tarp with small boulders or mounds of dirt.
You may want to use the dirt you've dug out to mark where your fort is to avoid anyone falling in the pit. Build it up as walls around your fort but leave one side clear to make sure you can still enter and exit your fort safely.
Otherwise, you may want to have a wheelbarrow to take the dirt to another area.

, To avoid collapse you will want to shape the walls of your fort so they are slightly wider and more open than the floor. You can skim off earth around the top of the fort while standing above the fort. Work your way down so that the top of the fort is 6 inches wider than the base and scrape the walls down with a small shovel so each one angles slightly out from there.

, Create small nooks or shelves in your walls, with your hands or a small shovel, so you can keep items in the fort and have a place for your flashlight or lantern.


Though a battery-powered light works best, keeping glow sticks in your fort can be a fun way to illuminate the fort for nighttime ventures.Avoid using candles or lighting a fire in your fort. Doing so may cause debris to fall and potentially injure someone. There is also a potential to suffocate from too much carbon monoxide.

, Depending on how deep your fort is you may want to build in a step to help you get back out of the pit you've dug. You can either carve small notches into the walls at appropriate distances for your reach to climb in and out, or you can build up a small block at the base of your fort.


To make an easy step you can use a couple of bricks or a cinder block. Just be sure to pack dirt all around the blocks, about an inch thick to cover sharp edges and corners.
To make a rope ladder get nautical rope, or nylon cord, around 1 inch in thickness and find a nearby tree or drive a post into the ground a couple feet away as an anchor for the rope. Wrap one end of your rope around the post or tree and tie an overhand knot. Tie more overhand knots in the rope at appropriate distances for you to reach with your hands and feet.Then you can cut off the end of the rope after it reaches the base of your fort. This is a fun way to climb out, but only if you already have a safe alternative such as a step.

, The walls of your fort should be somewhat smooth and clear of tree roots or rocks that may stick out and harm you on your way in or out. To help keep your fort walls strong, put gloves on and pat the walls down. You can also use the flat side of a shovel to uniformly beat the walls until they are smooth and don't feel crumbly to the touch.You can also cover the walls of your fort by cutting plywood boards to the size of each wall. You want the plywood flush with the walls starting at the base of the fort. Drive two pressure treated 2x4 posts down at each corner of your fort and then nail or screw the plywood edges to the 2x4s to create siding. The posts should touch on one corner, creating a small box of space at each fort corner with the 4inch side of the 2x4 flush with the walls, if you're looking from above.

, Check out thrift stores for small wooden stools and tables that are the right size to bring into your fort, but only if it is large enough for a sitting area. You can also lay out a blanket for the floor, just make sure your parents don't mind it getting dirty or use one you found from a thrift store.Take any blankets or cushions you bring out to the fort back inside after use each time so they won't become damp and get moldy.

, To cover your fort when it's not in use, you can use a piece of plywood that is at least a couple inches larger than the fort on all sides. Drill a hole in the plywood near one end to tie nylon cord or thick rope through. Use the rope as a handle to lift the wood off the fort when you're ready to use it.


You can also horizontally stack long sticks over the entrance if they reach a few inches longer than the fort and won't fall in. For a more durable alternative, use 2x4 pieces of wood, so long as they reach.
You'll want to cover the sticks and/or 2x4s with cut-out patches of grass for excellent protection from the rain and to keep the fort insulated.
Moss is another fantastic way to cover a stick roof over your fort and make it water-tight.

, Tarps are a great way to keep rain out of your fort. You can string up a tarp using trees around the area or by driving 4 poles into the ground. Pull the tarp taught to create a roof a couple feet over the fort, or drape the tarp over taught string, running right over the fort, and tie the corner to the ground to create a tarp A-frame.


You'll want to place markers around the entrance so no one will accidentally fall in the pit.

, Build an A-frame or a lean-to over the entrance of your fort for more room above-ground and to help block the weather.


The A-frame is built with three initial logs; one long piece of wood held up on one end at the intersection of two shorter logs in the shape of an 'A', or upside down 'V' which have been driven into the ground.The open pit will be located in the middle of the triangle shape that the A-frame makes. Sticks are then placed parallel to the two shorter logs all the way down the body of the long piece of wood. A light layer of mud can be packed into the frame to create a roof. You can then add pine cones, needles, leaves, and other natural material on top for camouflage.
The lean-to is started by hammering two poles into the ground slightly over the fort. The poles will then hold a board up which will be the peak of a slanted roof down to the ground. Again, sticks can be nailed to the peak of the roof, gradually getting shorter until you reach the bottom of the roof where it touches the ground. This can also be packed with a layer of mud and covered with clay, leaves, pine needles, and/or other natural material to mask the roof. "

Gather as many pillows and cushions as possible.,
Sort your pillows into groups.,
Select the furniture you will use for your fort.,
Gather weighty items to help support your pillows.,
Build the walls.,
Construct your roof.,
Secure the roof by using heavy objects like books to pin the edges of the sheet to the floor.,
Supply your fort.",How to Build a Fort in Your Room1," You can start with your bedroom pillows. Ask your parents if you can use extra pillows from the linen closet, sofa cushions, and the like.;
, Soft, fluffy pillows are good for creating a luxurious floor for your fort, but aren’t as good for walls. Couch cushions and other rigid or stiff pillows work best for walls.Memory foam pillows are also a good choice for walls because they are heavy and hold their shape.

, If you’re building the fort in your bedroom, you can obviously use your bed. Chairs, desks, and dressers are also good options. You can ask your parents if you can bring in furniture from other rooms, too.

, Heavy books are good to use as support, but you can also use shoes, large toys, and even canned goods (but ask your parents about that first). You’ll use these items to help prop up your pillow walls.

, There are two basic wall construction techniques, which you can choose from depending on what types of pillows you have. Start building at your bed and use it as your primary support structure.


The “sandbag” technique is best for soft, floppy pillows. Start the fort at your bed and place a row of pillows in a line outward until you have a wall as long as you want your fort. Then place another row of pillows on top of that one, and build the wall as high as you want it. Don’t go too high, though, or the fort may collapse.
The “vertical support” technique is best for firmer, rigid cushions like sofa cushions. Start the fort at your bed and build the wall outward by placing the cushions on their narrow sides in a line. Support the cushions on both sides with heavy items like books to keep them from falling over.
For extra sturdy walls, wrap a blanket around your walls to create a solid panel. Secure the blanket with clothespins or binder clips, then use heavy items to support the wall panels., Use sheets for the roof if you have them, because they are lighter and less likely to make your fort collapse under their weight. Stretch the sheets across the tops of your walls. Use clothespins or binder clips to connect sheets together if you need to.


If you have a bunk-bed, you can create a vaulted ceiling! Tuck a sheet under the mattress on the top bunk, then pull it down toward the fort walls. Use clothespins or binder clips to secure the sheet to the edges of the cushions.
Use flat sheets for the roof if you can find them. Fitted sheets don’t work as well because of their elastic corners.

, Alternatively, you can tuck the edges of the sheets under furniture, such as the legs of your desk or your bed.

, All forts need rations, so get some good snacks and drinks to stash away in your fort. If you’re planning to use the fort at night, you may also want a flash light or even some twinkle lights. And of course, you’ll want some books and games for entertainment.


Never use candles or other open flames inside a bedroom fort! Bedding is highly flammable.

Untwist the tension rod.,
Drape the sheet (or sheets) over the rod.,
Use a food package clip to secure the sheet in place.,
Help set up the nook with whatever your little one desires.",How to Build an Indoor Fort3," For this, either a shower or a curtain tension rod will work. You'll also need a flat twin sheet (or perhaps two) and 2 to 4 food package clips., It is best placed between two hard-to-move objects. These objects could be a wall, bed head/foot board, large dresser, bookshelf, entertainment center, etc., Secure it between the two objects. This is done the same way as you would mount the tension rod in a shower.

, Drape it so that the midpoint of the sheet is covering the tension rod and the top and bottom ends are pointed towards the floor.

, Pinch the sheet just under the rod so that it forms a temporary pocket for the sheet to slide securely without slipping out of place.

, Add cushions, pillows, a flashlight, books, etc.

Gather some long sticks or poles.,
Gather your other materials.,
Lay out three sticks in a tripod formation.,
Tie the sticks together.,
Get a friend to help you raise the teepee.,
Drape the sheets over the teepee frame.,
Place some pillows on the floor inside the teepee.,
Bring in some supplies.",How to Build a Fort in Your Room2," If you have a backyard, you may be able to get some long sticks from there. You’ll need between 5-7 fairly straight, sturdy sticks that are at least 5 feet long. If you don’t have a backyard to gather sticks from, you can ask your parents if they will purchase some long dowel rods (or even curtain rods or broomsticks) from the hardware store for you.

, You’ll need twine, rope, or thick rubber bands to tie the poles together. You’ll also need several sheets or blankets to form the walls of your teepee and some clothespins or binder clips.

, Lay two sticks on the ground to form an inverted “V” shape. Lay another stick in the middle of the “V” so that it looks almost like an upside-down “W”.

, The most secure way to do this is to use a clove hitch knot around the tops of the sticks. If you don’t know how to tie one, make sure to wrap the rope twine under the poles as well as around them. Leave a “tail” of rope.


If you’re using rubber bands, use several around the tops of the sticks to secure them.

, It’s much harder to raise the teepee on your own, so ask a friend or your parents for help. It should look like a camera tripod once it’s raised. Arrange the legs so that it’s fairly stable.


After the tripod is raised, place the other sticks around the center tripod. Use the rope tail to tie them to the frame, or secure them with rubber bands.

, Use clothespins or binder clips to secure the sheets to the sticks or poles. You can also use string or twine to tie the sheets to the frame.


If you get permission from your parents to do so, punching holes in the sheets with a hole-punch makes it much easier to tie the sheets to the teepee frame. Only use old, worn-out sheets for this, and definitely ask your parents first.

, This will make a comfortable base for you to hang out in.

, You’ll probably want some snacks and drinks to enjoy in your fort. Books, games, and maybe a laptop will give you fun things to do.


If you want to decorate the inside of your teepee, you can string twinkle lights around the sticks and plug them in.

Gather your construction materials.,
Move your furniture into a circle around your bed.,
Fill up any gaps in the furniture with pillows.,
Place the flooring.,
Construct the roof.,
Supply your fort.",How to Build a Fort in Your Room3," For this type of fort, you’ll want as many pillows, blankets, and sheets as you can find. You’ll also need several items of furniture that you can move around into a circle.Get an adult to help you with very heavy furniture such as dressers. Don’t try to move your bed, just build around it.

, The bed is probably too big and heavy to move, so just pull the other furniture into a ring using the bed as your starting place.


Chairs, desks, and tables work well, as do nightstands and dressers.

, If you want some light to come in, you can leave places such as under chairs open. For a completely secure fort, fill in all the holes.

, You’ll want the floor of your fort to be soft and cozy, so lay down some soft pillows. You can also use fluffy bath towels or down comforters, if you have them. If you use pillows, spread a blanket across all of them to create a solid floor.

, Use sheets to build your roof because they don’t weigh as much as blankets. Secure your roof sheets to the furniture using heavy objects such as books, as well as fasteners like clothespins and binder clips.


You can tuck the roof sheets into dresser drawers and secure them to the drawers with clothespins or binder clips. This will give you a higher, angled roof.
Tuck some roof sheets under your mattress for a secure hold.
If you used furniture with hard, flat surfaces such as desk tops and chair bottoms, you can hold the sheet onto them with a stack of books or another heavy item.
You can also pinch sheets between heavy furniture and the wall. Just tuck the sheet behind something heavy, like your headboard, and then push it all the way to the wall.
Use rubber bands or string to secure blankets and sheets to the tops of chairs that have protrusions or spindles, such as kitchen chairs.

, Bring some snacks and drinks into the fort. If you’ve used furniture like chairs or dressers, you can stash your supplies under the chairs or in the drawers. You may also want a flashlight, a laptop, and some books and games. A friend is always nice, too.

, This type of fort is very easy to build, but it is a lot smaller than some other types of forts.


Get two large pieces of furniture, such as a couch and a table, and put them side by side about 2-3 feet apart.
Stretch a sheet or blanket across the gap between the furniture to create the roof.
Secure the roof by placing something heavy on top of it on each side to weigh it down. Heavy books work very well for this.
Put some pillows or cushions on the floor of the tunnel to make a cozy floor. Now you have a fort!

, You can also use a small umbrella, but it won’t have as much room in the fort. If you have several umbrellas, place them in a circular formation. Then, stretch sheets over the top. Voila, instant fort!"

These spaces are typically in the living room, dining room, or bedroom.The room does not need to be empty! The furniture in the room can help to serve as some of the “walls” of the fort.;
, Chairs are most commonly used because their backs provide height for the fort. Also consider using furniture like tables, bed frames , and couches to help construct the framework of the fort.Use furniture with varying heights to create different spaces within the fort.

, You will need several blankets to drape over the frame of the fort. Sheets make great draperies for the fort as they are lightweight and won’t fall down quite as easily. You will also need blankets and pillows inside the fort for comfort., Place the furniture that you have collected around the room to construct the framework of the fort. Be sure to add space for hallways, doors, and secret passageways within your fort., Once the framework is in place, begin draping the blankets over the frames. Use different blanket weights to create different spaces within the fort.For example, drape sheets over part of the framework to allow light and and air into the fort.

,, Use clothespins or rubber bands to help secure the blankets that are creating the walls and roof of the fort. Large pillows or couch cushions can also be used to secure the blankets by propping them against the forts framework., Lay blankets down on the floor of the fort for added comfort. Sleeping bags can be added to a portion of the fort to create a bed., Carefully place pillows within the fort to create couches, chairs, and beds. Since you will be resting on the floor, multiple pillows will provide comfort to the fort’s guests., Christmas lights or flashlights are a good addition to any fort. The light will allow for reading or board games within the fort’s structure., Place a fan in an opening to the fort to help circulate air throughout the fort.

Fill the rest with dirt and a few torn up leaves. The mix should be the consistency of sludge. Then, using anything from your hands to a spoon, plop a bunch of the mixture onto the walls. Keep mixing this until you have all the weak spots covered. You can do the entire wall if you want. Let it dry., Secure it by lashing twine, rubber bands or parachute cord to the rest of the fort so that it makes a door frame., Tie that to the top stick., This can be done with black walnut stains or paint., Gather more (yes, more) sticks if your fort is small. If it is larger, consider a tarp or tin roof.,, The result should leave little shafts of light pouring into the fort., If you often get snow in your area, try not to make the roof too heavy- It could collapse.,"

Suspend a rope.,
Alternatively, suspend a hoop from the rope strung between the trees.,
Attach your sheets.,
Create your anchor points.,
Decorate and make it homey.",How to Build a Fort in the Woods1," String a rope between two trees. The length of the rope will equal or exceed the length that your fort can be.;
, Get a hula hoop or a very large embroidery hoop as well as rope. The hoop will be suspended from the center of the rope which is tied between two trees. You'll need 4 pieces of rope to attach at four points on the hoop (as illustrated), which will then meet at one point at the single rope running between the trees.

, Take your sheets and drape them over the rope, hula hoop, or within the embroidery hoop. Use as many as you need to make your fort as big as you want.

, Now your sheets will be hanging. Decide how wide you'd like your fort to be and create anchor points at the bottom to keep the walls apart. Use rocks or camping stakes to spread the fabric.

, Now that you've got your walls set up, you'll want to add doors, floor cushions or anything else to customize your fort to your needs. Enjoy!

Decide what kind of materials you want to use.,
Figure out a place to build your fort.,
Determine the size of the fort.,
Gather your materials.",How to Build a Fort1," Do you want to use materials for the outdoors? Furniture in your house? This decision will greatly inform what type of fort you want to make. The great thing about a fort is that you can use anything you have available to make a cool little hang out space. Couches, beds, sheets and blankets are great options for fort materials inside. Branches, leaves, and even dirt can all be used as material outside.;
, You’ll want a lot of space so you can expand your fort as you see fit. Building a fort in a closet is a lot more difficult than in an open living room. Similarly, if you’re building outside you’ll need to find an appropriate area to build shelter. Look for places that aren’t in danger of being flooded or hit by falling trees. If you're making a fort outside, try to look for overhanging rocks to act for a roof, or 'Y' shaped trees to act as the center of your teepee. If a tree has fallen down and ripped up the roots behind it you can use the pocket where the roots used to be to set up a fort.


Closets and corners are good places to build inside.

, The size of your fort will determine where you build it and how many materials you need. Try not to be too aggressive with the size of your fort. You might lose interest. Try to decide ahead of time how many people you want to be able to fit into your fort. Do you want to be able to lie down in it? Stand up? Factor these decisions into the type of fort you make, and where. For example, if you want to be able to stand up in your teepee you'll have to find longer branches and a taller tree.

, Now it’s time to get going! Decide what kind of fort you want to make and find the materials to get started. Most forts are pretty simple to make, so this shouldn’t be too challenging. However, you might need to spend a good amount of time gathering blankets or card board boxes or branches. Spend some time gathering the appropriate materials before you start construction.

Instruct the players to break into small groups while maintaining the large circle shape.,
Keep two players aside from the groupings.,

",How to Play Elbow Tag,";
,, Each grouping can consist of 2 (a pair) or 3 or 4 players, depending on how many people you have available. Don't make the groupings any larger. Players should not be holding hands; just linking arms so that they form small human ""chains"" of 2, 3 or 4 people. These chains need to stretch out to keep the large circle shape.

, One person will be reserved as ""It"" and other person will be the runner.

, The objective is for ""It"" to tag the runner. The runner will be trying to get away and not become ""It"". A runner can avoid capture by joining one of the human chains - the runner is safe if he or she links arms onto one end of a human chain. However, when the runner joins a human chain, it sets off a chain reaction which forces the person on the opposite end of the human chain to become the next runner.

, The runner should immediately link with one of the human chains to have a rest! ""It"" will then start chasing the new runner.

Sit in a circle.,
Decide who will be “it” first.,
Walk around the circle, tapping heads.,
Choose a ""goose” and run.",How to Play Duck Duck Goose1," Get at least four people together, and have everyone sit cross-legged on the floor or on the ground in a circle facing one another. Two of the advantages to the game are that it can be played indoors or outdoors, and you only need players, not equipment. The size of the circle formed depends upon two factors: a) the number of players and b) how far apart each player sits.


The larger the circle, the farther players will end up running.
When 2,145 students in a Missouri school district broke the Guinness World Record in 2011 for the largest game of duck, duck, goose, they had to form a massive circle outside the fenced perimeter of their football stadium.;
, “It” (sometimes referred to as the “picker” or the “fox”) will be the person saying “duck, duck, goose” and choosing who will be the goose chasing him or her. Because kids often don’t want to be “it” first, they might play rock, paper, scissors to decide. Or, if a parent or a teacher is overseeing the game, he or she might choose for the children.

, The person who is ""it"" will start walking around the circle and tapping the top of each player's head, saying either ""duck"" or ""goose."" Typically, ""it"" taps and says ""duck"" several times before selecting someone and saying ""goose."" This creates both suspense and an element of surprise for everyone sitting in the circle, wondering if they will be the ""goose.""


On the flip side, because this is what most people do, saying “goose” on the second or third person is unexpected and can give “it” an advantage.

, At a time of his or her choosing, ""it"" will tap a player's head and say ""goose."" ""It"" then takes off running around the circle, and the goose jumps up and chases after ""it."" The goose's goal is to tag ""it"" before ""it"" is able to sit down in the goose's spot.


If “it” makes it around the circle and gets back to the goose’s spot without being caught, the goose now becomes “it.”
If the goose catches “it” before then, “it” is “it” again and another round starts.A twist that is played a lot as standard duck, duck, goose but is actually called “mushpot” goes like this: If the goose catches “it,” the goose becomes “it” and “it” has to sit out the game in the middle of the circle until another player is tagged and they trade places."

Buy fence sections.,
Attach hinges.,
Add a door or windows.,
Decorate!,
Move as necessary.",How to Build a Fort in the Woods2," Buy sections of fence which are high enough for walls and wide enough that each section can make a good single wall. Picket fencing with no gaps works great for this.


You can also build your own.

, Use hinges to join the four or more sections together. Make sure you attach them in the appropriate directions, so that the fence sections can be folded together (picture a Japanese screen). Leave one joint unattached, so that the whole thing can be collapsed.

, Using a jigsaw, cut a square or rectangle in the center section of one or more wall portions (being careful not to cut the brace beams), in order to make windows or doors.


This is somewhat optional, since you can also just move a wall section to get in or out.

, You can paint or stain the wood, as well as add other decorations like a fort flag.

, Fold up the fort and move it into and out of the woods as necessary.

Get five sections of PVC pipe.,
Drill joining holes.,
Get a rope.,
Create your covering.,
Decorate!",How to Build a Fort in the Woods3," The diameter does not matter too much, but around 2"" is a good width. The length will determine the height of the ceiling, minus about 8"".

, You'll need to drill holes through the pipes in order to join them together. Drill these holes roughly 8"" from the top of the pipes. The holes should go through on one side and come out directly on the other side. The holes will need to be thick enough to get a string or rope through.

, String the rope through all of the holes and tie the ends together. It should be loose enough that the pipes can be turned and form the teepee shape.

, You can make a custom-fit covering (out of waterproof fabric) by measuring the average size of each triangular section and sewing together the correct number of panels. Just be sure to leave a door opening in one of them and a large hole at the top so that it can be fit over the poles.


Another option would be to get two or more tarps and wrap them over the poles, attaching them together with tape or cord. Again, leave an entrance.

, Decorate your fort as needed, making sure that the ground inside is great for sitting or sleeping on.

Assemble a fort using bookshelves.,
Build a couch and table fort.,
Set up a blanket fort over your bed.",How to Build a Fort2," Clear space for your fort and then put two wide and short bookshelves in a position so that the shelves are facing each other. Now stick an old mattress, foam, blanket pile, or other soft surface on the floor between the bookshelves. You can make a roof by putting a piece of plywood, a sheet, or other material over the two bookshelves if you want a roof.

, Remember to start by clearing some space for your fort. You probably want to build it somewhere near a couch so you don’t have to move too much furniture. A love seat will generally work best.


Place a table just a few feet away from the front of the couch so that the long sides are parallel. A dining table of any size will work, but usually, a rectangular, 4-seater works best.
Grab the cushions off of the couch place them on the floor, between or under the couch and table. If you can take the back cushions off as well, do that too.
Take a large sheet and place one long edge along the back of the couch and pin it in place. Drape the remainder of the sheet over the table. Hold the sheet down by placing heavy objects on top of it such as books. Take more sheets as necessary to add sides, or cover the front section of the table. Weigh down these sheets as well.

, This fort is super simple and takes advantage of the softness of your bed to play in. All you need to do is pin a light sheet to the ceiling above your bed. Put one pin at the base of your bed and one pin at the head of your bed. Now climb on the bed and tuck the sheet behind the sides of your bed. Climb under the sheet and you should have a fort inside your bed! "

Construct a cardboard box fort.,
Make a string and tarp fort.,
Set up a stick and log fort.,
Make a basic teepee fort.",How to Build a Fort3," Find an appropriate spot for your fort. You probably want to find somewhere relatively covered from rain and the elements. A cardboard box fort is appropriate for inside or outside, but outside you’ll have more room to expand your fort. Get cardboard boxes, the larger the better. You can get these for free by going to local grocery stores, furniture stores, or hardware stores and asking for extras. It may take a few weeks to get enough.


Cut some of the boxes apart so that they are flat. You'll want to mix boxes that are still together with boxes that are apart.
Build walls. You can stack boxes that are still together to make walls and other strong structures. Use flat boxes to make ceilings or floors. Very large boxes can be their own rooms, if you have any. Use glue, a staple guns, ropes, rubber bands, and weights to keep your fort together.

, Find two trees that are relatively close together and string up a clothesline or string between them. The height you string them up at will serve as the roof of your fort, so decide how high you want your fort to be. Now all you have to do is lay the tarp over the clothesline and secure the sides to the ground. Bingo! You have a fort. , This is a classic for idea when you’re young and romping about in the woods. Find a huge tree that has fallen down but left space between the trunk and the ground. Normally this will occur because the tree was still rooted when it fell down. Gather a lot of large branches and place these on either side of the trunk nearest to the roots. Continue adding branches as you head away from the roots. If you want you can leave a gap between the branches as a potential entrance. You can also enter from under the front of the trunk, or cover that entrance with a tarp. The branches that you set up will serve as your walls and the trunk of the tree will be your roof. It’s a basic fort, but it’s a lot of fun to make.

, Find a tree with low hanging branches that is small enough you can fit your arms around it. You want your hands to be able to touch if you hug the trunk. The branches need to be low hanging so that you can stack sticks up against the side of the tree so that they won't slip off. Gather branches and sticks of an appropriate height and lean them against the trunk at an angle. If you want more space inside your fort, lean the sticks at a lower angle. Make sure that they won’t fall off. Try to secure the sticks to the branches still connected to the tree.
Once you have done your first layer of branches it can help to string a rope around the trunk of the tree and the branches you have leaned against it to provide security.
Leave an entranceway. Don’t cover the trunk all the way around – you need to be able to get inside your fort.

Try extreme, or boot camp, duck, duck, goose.,
Swim to tag ""it."",
Couple up to sing and dance.",How to Play Duck Duck Goose2," Get together a fairly large number of people and form a circle, with each person facing outward and standing about 5 feet (1.5 m) apart while jogging in place. The youngest person becomes the picker, jogs around the circle clockwise and taps or points at each person, saying either duck or goose. If the person is called a duck, he or she must do a squat or a push-up. If the person is called a goose, he or she must chase after the picker, running counter-clockwise. When they meet, they try to block each other, therefore slowing the other down, and gaining an advantage in racing back to the empty goose spot.If the picker gets back first, the goose becomes the picker; if the goose gets back first, the picker goes again.
The degree of physical contact in blocking, such as wrestling and tackling, is up to the group.
Here’s a twist: While the picker and goose are running and blocking, any player in the circle can get up and move to the goose’s empty spot, repeatedly, thus prolonging the round.

, This variation of the game would not only be fun, but it also would be a great way both to get some great exercise and to work on your swimming technique. Find a few fellow swimming buddies and meet at the pool. Get in and form a circle facing outward, with each person treading water. Choose a picker and a swimming stroke – freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke or butterfly. The picker then starts swimming around the circle using the chosen stroke and taps each person, saying either “fish” or “shark.” The person who is called shark then swims after the picker using the same stroke.


If the picker gets back to the shark’s spot first, the shark becomes the picker.
If the shark tags the picker, the picker has to go the middle of the circle and either do somersaults in the water or tread water holding a dive brick until another person is tagged.

, This version of duck, duck, goose would be fun for all kinds of gatherings and parties. Gather an even, not odd, number of at least 8-10 people, keeping two people out. The rest will form a circle facing inward and hold hands. The people outside of the circle are the pickers and will also hold hands. They will walk around the circle and, with their linked hands, touch the linked hands of any two people, saying either “duck” or “goose.” The two people called goose must then run in the opposite direction, continuing to hold hands, and try to beat the other couple back to the geese spots.


If the pickers get back first, the geese become the pickers.
If the geese arrive first, the pickers go to the middle of the circle and put on a performance. They must either sing a song or do a dance together and then wait in the circle until another pair of geese is tagged.
If you have a karaoke machine, you could bring that along and have the geese sing a song to that.
You could also have them sing and do the dance motions of classic children’s songs, such as “I’m a Little Teapot,” “Row, Row, Row Your Boat,” or “If You’re Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands.”
Other possibilities include doing the Macarena, the ""Gangnam Style"" dance, twerking, a line dance, the twist, the mashed potato, the waltz, the tango and so forth.

Teach English while playing.,
Hoot and hop to learn about animals.,
Teach shapes, colors, numbers and themes.",How to Play Duck Duck Goose3," For young children in the U.S. whose native language in not English, going to school can be frustrating. Here’s a way to help make the transition fun, while also teaching English at the same time. Have students sit in a circle facing inward. The teacher then walks around the circle, tapping each student’s head and using English vocabulary words such as “duck, duck, dog.” When dog is called, that student chases after the teacher. If caught, the teacher must go again. If not, the student can take a turn as the picker, thus practicing pronunciation.


Using words like these will help students recognize the difference between similar sounds like “u” in duck and “o” in dog and “ck” in duck and “g” in dog. , Before starting, the teacher should talk with students about different animals, including how they sound and how they move. Now have the students sit in a circle facing inward. Choose one child to start as the picker, only in this case the picker will be a duck and will quack and flap its wings while walking around the circle, tapping each child’s head and saying “duck.” Then the duck will choose another student, tap his or her head and say the name of another animal. That child will then hop up and chase after the duck, using the appropriate sounds and movements of the animal he or she was called.


If the duck is tagged before making it to the new animal’s spot, the duck must sit in the middle of the circle until a new animal is tagged.
If the duck isn’t tagged, the new animal then walks around the circle, tapping heads and saying his animal’s name until he chooses a child, taps his or her head and calls out a new animal name, which starts another chase.This variation is great in that it integrates dramatic and expressive play with learning.

, Using masking tape or chalk – depending upon whether you are playing inside or outside – ask your students to help you create a large circle (it's also a trick to keeping children in the area you want them). While you're doing that, review a subject or area they've been learning. Have the children sit in a circle facing inward, choose a child to be the picker and use your topic as for the basis for the words the picker will say while he or she is tapping heads. For instance, if you were going over shapes, the picker might say “square, square, rectangle.” The picker will circle around, tapping heads and saying “square” until finally saying “rectangle.” When rectangle is called, that child chases after the picker.


As with traditional duck, duck, goose, if the picker gets back to the vacant seat first, the rectangle becomes the picker; otherwise the picker goes again.
This can be modified for seasons of the year, characteristics of plants and trees, parts of the body, colors, elements of writing, for math, etc.
For example, if students are learning how to count, write a number on a piece of paper and put it in the center of the circle. Have the picker go around the circle tapping on each child’s head, counting from 1 upward until that number is called. When it is, that child then chases the picker. This could also be done when teaching how to count by 2s, 5s and so forth.

Play Minnesota Duck, Duck, Grey Duck.,
Learn the Chinese 丢手绢, or Drop the Napkin, variant.,
Try out the German Der Plumpsack geht um, or The Plumpsack Goes Around, version.",How to Play Duck Duck Goose4," Minnesotans often claim the rest of the U.S. is playing the game all wrong, that Duck, Duck, Grey Duck is the original. Whether this is true or not remains to be definitively answered. But here’s how it works. Just like the “traditional” version, players sit in a circle facing inward. The picker, or “it,” walks around the circle, tapping on each player’s head. Only in the Minnesotan version, instead of just saying “duck,” you give the duck a color. So the picker would say “red duck,” “blue duck,” “green duck” and the like, in whatever order they want. When “grey duck” is called, the chase begins.Like the traditional game, if the picker gets to the grey duck’s spot first, the grey duck becomes the picker. If not, the picker picks again.
Some say this version is more challenging because the players sitting in the circle have to listen more carefully to what is being called – “blue duck” versus “grey duck” is more similar than “duck” and “goose,” for instance.
Also, according to a woman cited in a newspaper article, kids like to add to the suspense by drawing out the “Grrrrr” sound to keep players off guard as to whether they’re going to say green or grey., Here, the children squat in a circle facing inward, while the picker, or the “mailman,” holds a napkin or a piece of material. The children begin to sing as the mailman goes around the circle, dropping the napkin behind a player’s back. The singing doesn’t stop. When the child realizes the napkin is behind him or her, he chases after the mailman.


If the child catches the mailman, the mailman goes to the center of the circle and puts on a performance, such as telling a joke, doing a dance or singing a song; if he doesn’t catch the mailman, he becomes the mailman.
Also, if the mailman runs all the way around the circle before the child notices the napkin, the child has to sit in the middle until being replaced.
Lyrics to the song: “Drop, drop, drop the napkin. / Softly behind your friend's back. / Everybody hushes. / Quick, quick, get it!” Then repeat., The children sit in a circle facing inward, with one chosen as the Plumpsack, which is translated to mean policeman.The Plumpsack holds a handkerchief, walking around the circle as the children sing a song. Then the Plumpsack drops the handkerchief behind one of the children’s backs while they continue singing. In this variation, if any child looks behind his or her back and the handkerchief is not there, the child has to go to the middle of the circle. When the child who does have the handkerchief behind his or her back notices, the chase after the Plumpsack begins.


If the Plumpsack gets back to the spot first, the other child becomes the Plumpsack.
If the Plumpsack is caught, he or she goes to the middle and all the children sing, “One, two, three, into the rotten egg!”
Also, if the Plumpsack makes the full circle without the child noticing the handkerchief, the child goes to the middle of the circle and the children also sing “One, two, three, into the rotten egg!”Lyrics to the song: “Do not turn around. / Because the Plumpsack goes around! / Whoever turns around and laughs. / Gets a slap on the back. / Therefore: Do not turn around.” And repeat.There are similar variations across Europe and in parts of Asia and the Middle East, though the songs vary in context.

Call the winners!",How to Play Zombie Tag2," This game requires at least five players to work well.


One person is the Doctor, who has the imaginary antidote to the zombie outbreak.
At least two people will be Humans, who help the Doctor get to home base. They can run.
At least two players are zombies, who cannot run., You’ll need a space with plenty of room and at least one landmark to act as home base. Parks, rec centers, or gyms would be great places to play., The object of the game is for the Doctor to make it to home base with the antidote. Choose a visible landmark to act as home base, like a tree, a sign, or a sidewalk., You can choose a Doctor by any method you want--elimination games, picking a number, or simply volunteering.

, The Doctor chooses at least two zombies by tapping them on the head. The zombies can open their eyes and look at each other, but everyone else must keep their eyes shut.

, If you have more than ten people, you can have the Doctor choose a runner zombie and an angel zombie as well. The runner zombie can run, unlike the other zombies. The angel can turn zombies back into humans, but only once for each person. The angel also is unaffected by zombies. This step is completely optional, but it might make the game more fun!, Everybody, including the zombies, should close their eyes and wait one minute for the Doctor to hide. The game begins when the minute is up! You can count to sixty, or set a timer on your phone.

, If you are a zombie, wait an extra minute before you start playing your role. This will give the humans a chance to get further away from you, which will help the game last longer.


Show the other players that you’re a zombie by walking slowly with your arms out in front of you, groaning the word “Brains!” over and over again., If you are a zombie, tagging the humans or the Doctor will turn them into zombies. Your goal is to turn all of the humans into zombies before they can bring the Doctor to home base., If you’re a human (or the Doctor!), your goal is to bring the Doctor to home base. If you’re turned into a zombie, you can start tagging others.

The Doctor can only get to home base alone if all the humans have been turned into zombies.

, If the humans bring the Doctor to home base safely, then it's a human victory! If everyone has turned into a zombie, then it's a zombie victory!

Choose at least four players.,
Set up the racetrack.,
Get everybody into position.,
Start running.,
Cheer the winner!",How to Play Zombie Tag3," You’ll need at least four players for this game. There should be one zombie for every three or four runners. The zombies can’t run, but the runners can. You can pick your zombies any way you’d like., Your track should be at long enough for the game to last about five minutes. There should be clear start and finish lines, and clear side boundaries--runners can’t leave the track!

, The runners should be lined up at the starting line, but the zombies can be anywhere they want along the track.

, The object is to reach the finish line without being tagged by a zombie. Zombies can be anywhere on the track and can even stand outside the track.


If a zombie tags you, you become a zombie.If you bump into another runner, you become a zombie. The person you bumped into does not become a zombie, but you can tag them.
If you leave the track area, you become a zombie.

, The winner is the first human to cross the finish line. If no humans make it across, there is no winner."

Split everyone into two groups.,
Decide on where you want the ""home base"" to be.,
Decide on a location for the jail.",How to Play Fugitive (Night Game)1," You could play in your neighborhood as long as you don't get a lot of cars going through it at night. A friend's backyard would also be a good spot, or even the park.;
, You will want at least four people, but the game will be even more fun when you have a lot of people.

, The cops and the fugitives.

, This is the destination that all the fugitives must make it back to without being caught by a cop.

, If a fugitive gets tagged by a cop before making it back to the ""home base"", they will go to jail. If a fugitive is tagged and put in jail, another fugitive from their team can tag them. If they succeed without being tagged by a cop, both fugitives get a free walk-back, meaning a cop cannot tag them while they walk away.

Find a big place, a soccer field will work, and divide it into two parts.,
Divide into two equal or as close to equal as you can get teams, but make sure the teams are fair!

,Make sure each team has a flag, like a dish towel or an old washcloth, and go to your side with your team

,
Have both teams hide their flag, but make sure it is visible, and possible to take running by it.

,
Start the game, have some people stay and guard it, no puppy-guarding, while others run across the line and try to get the other teams flag and bring it across the line into there territory.

,
A lot like Capture the flag huh?,
After you are unfrozen, you have a free and mandatory walk back to your territory.

",How to Play Capture the Flag Freeze Tag," Try as hard as possible to make it even, or when one person loses their excuse will be ""my side was smaller, and your side was bigger!"";
,,,,, Here's the twist, if you get caught across the line, you're frozen, and you cannot move until a person from your team touches you.

Find a spot outdoors that isn’t well-lit.,
Gather a group of people and bring a flashlight.,
Choose who is 'it.',
Hide!,
Seek!,
Play until everyone is ‘out.’ When you are tagged, you must go to “jail,” a specified location where all the people who are ‘out’ must wait until everyone else has been tagged by the person who is ‘it.’Once you are ‘out,’ you can no longer participate in the game, but watching and cheering from the sidelines is also fun!,
Restart the game.",How to Play Flashlight Tag1," Make sure that there are a lot of hiding spots and that it’s a safe place to run around.


Although flashlight tag is typically played outside, you can also play inside with the lights off! Just be sure to clear away anything that someone could trip on during the game.When playing outside, you don’t have to play when it is completely dark. If you need to be home by a certain time or if you get scared at night, you can play at dusk or in a better lit area (such as a park).You can also play with silly string during the day instead of a flashlight.;
, You only need three people to play this game, but the more people you can get to play, the better!Ask some of your neighborhood friends to play on a weekend. This game is also fun to play when you have a party or sleepover.
Flashlight tag can also be played with your family. If you have brothers or sisters, ask them if they would like to play. If you are an only child, ask your parents or grandparents.
If your parents hesitate to let you play outside when it’s dark, ask if one of them would play or at least come with you. Your friends’ parents might also feel better knowing an adult is there.
Bring some extra batteries with you, in case the batteries in your flashlight quit working in the middle of the game., This person will have the flashlight and will be responsible for ""tagging"" people.


If more than one person wants to be ‘it,’ you can draw straws, pick numbers out of a hat, or flip a coin.

, Have the person who is 'it' count to a set number (such as 100), while everyone else hides.


The person who is ‘it’ should close their eyes or wear a blindfold during this time.
Good hiding places can be found through nature. You could, for example, hide behind a tree or a bush. You could also crouch below a large rock or hill. If you're playing in someone's backyard, make use of the structures. Hide underneath a slide. Hide under the table in the playhouse.

, After counting to the specified number, the person who is ‘it’ can then start to look for people. As with regular tag, once you are tagged, you are out. However, to tag someone in flashlight tag, the person who is ‘it’ must tag people with the beam of the flashlight and call their names.


In regular tag, if you can run faster than the ‘it’ person, you can evade them for a while. But with flashlight tag, the ‘it’ person can tag you with the light from a distance. Thus, while you are hiding, scope out your location and look for other places you could dart behind. To avoid being tagged with the beam from the flashlight, you’ll need to put something between yourself and the ‘it’ person.

,


Alternately, instead of playing until everyone has been tagged, you can also play with a rotating ‘it’ person. In this case, once someone is tagged, they become the new ‘it’ person and the person who tagged them hands over the flashlight.With a rotating ‘it’ person, you will need to hide not only from the current ‘it’ person but from everyone playing the game. Be sure that none of your friends see where you hide!

, The first person tagged and sent to “jail” in the last round will be the ‘it’ person for the second round.If you are playing with a rotating ‘it’ person instead of a “jail,” you don’t need to restart the game, because it is never over!

Play with a home base.,
Play with multiple taggers.,
Play jailbreak.,
Play sardines.,
Play manhunt.",How to Play Hide and Go Seek," The first thing you need to do to play ""Hide and Seek"" is to recruit players. At least two players are needed to play the game. Naturally, however, the more players you have, the better.


If you have players of different ages, take this into consideration. Younger players can fit more places, but they sometimes choose less-than-brilliant places to hide and don't have the longest of attention spans.;
, If you do not set down rules, you will have people running to places that shouldn't be hidden in -- either antiques end up breaking or private places get intruded upon -- or someone gets stuck in a washing machine. And, people may run outside when everybody's inside. Block off rooms like the attic, parents' bedrooms, any room that holds heirlooms, and bedrooms. Or let people hide in those places, just say things like, ""All right, you are allowed to hide in my bedroom, just don't mess up the bed and put everything back in its place.""


Make sure everyone stays safe. You don't want your friends falling out of trees or climbing onto the roof. Make a rule to only hide in places two people could fit or to hide in a place everyone would/can go.
We'll talk about game variations in a bit. But for now, set down the ground rules -- who's hiding, who's seeking, where to hide, how long you get to hide, etc.

, An outdoor location works best, although indoors is fine for rainy days. It will be necessary to set boundaries for hiding or you will have players running off to too many far-off locations. It's not called Run a Mile and Go Seek!


If you're playing with your parents around, make sure they know what's going on. They may not want you hiding in the cobwebs of the garage, under the porch, or they may not want to jump in the shower to already find you in it.
Try to play in different places every time. If you do it in the same spot (different games, not rounds) then people will remember the good places and search there first.

, Working out who is ""It"" can be done a variety of ways, for instance: the youngest person might be ""It"" first; or the person whose birthday is next might be ""It"" first; or use an elimination word game, such as ""One Potato, Two Potato"" or similar game. Or just pick a number out of a hat, and #1 is ""It"".


If one person is older than the rest, they might make a natural ""It."" The younger you are, the more frustrated you could get with people who are really good hiders. Older people have longer attention spans and can think outside of the box better than their younger counterparts.

, Once the person who will be ""It"" has been chosen, he or she stays at home base, closes his or her eyes and begins counting out loud to a decided number at a steady pace. Or they could say a rhyme or sing a song. Anything that kills some time so everyone else can go hide! Make sure to establish this first and that everybody knows how long they have!


Make sure they're not cheating! The person who is ""It"" needs to have their eyes closed, hands over their eyes, and preferably facing a corner. No peeking!

, All of the players who are not ""It"" should run off and quietly hide from the player who is counting. The person who is ""It"" is not allowed to peek at the players hiding from him or her. Make sure you're quiet as you're hiding or ""It"" can use his or her ears to tell the general direction you went.


Once you hit your spot, be silent and still. You don't want to give yourself up once you're hidden! . If you're noisy, even the best hiding spot won't conceal you.

, Once the player who is ""It"" has finished counting, he or she yells ""Ready or not, here I come!"" At this point, they must try to find all of the other players who have hidden. Be sure to look with your eyes and listen with your ears, seeker! When you see them, be sure to tag them. If you are hiding and ""It"" is close to discover you, move deftly. Crawling or slithering are the best options. However, if it is too late, be still and silent. The ""It"" can actually overlook you and go away.


The players who are hiding can move or switch hiding places, if they so choose. It's a good idea to change positions and go hide in a place the seeker has already looked. That's called strategy.

If some of the hidden players do not return home before a predetermined period of time or they can't be found, the person who is ""It"" should give the universal ""all clear"" signal. Yell, ""Olly, olly oxen free!"" That way they know it's safe to come back.

This is a variation, if you're curious, of ""All ye, all ye, outs in free"" or perhaps, ""Alle, Alle auch sind frei,"" both roughly translating to ""everyone is free.""



, The player who gets found first becomes ""It"" in the next round of the game. You could play it that once one person is found it's the next round, or you could play it that everyone has to be found before the next round can begin.


You could set time limits on it, too. If the person who is seeking doesn't meet the time limit in 3 tries (for example), switch seekers anyway. Give everyone a chance to hide!

, This variation adds an extra challenge to Hide and Go Seek. You have your seeker and your hiders -- but the hiders don't only just hide, they have to get back to home base, too. Without getting tagged! So while the seeker is seeking, they have to come out of hiding, risking their safety. It's like Hide and Go Seek: The Intense Version.


The hiders don't have any way of knowing what's going on in the game. Another element to this version can be that all the hiders have to get back to home base before everyone else is tagged. Or they're out!

, Instead of those poor lil' hiders that have been found just milling around doing nothing, have them assigned as additional seekers once they've been tagged. All of a sudden it's 4 people looking for one person -- where could they possibly be?


Still start with one ""It,"" starting the game the same way -- just have the first ones found team up to help look, too. Or have a couple seekers from the get-go!
The first person tagged is still ""It"" for the next round, they just get to practice their seeking skills this round, speeding up the rest of the game.

, This makes the game even spicier. As players get found, they have to go to ""jail."" Generally this is a specific room, porch, or just designated area. The object of the game is for the seeker to put everyone in jail. However, those not in jail can free the ones in jail! They just have to get to jail without being tagged. Pressure's on!


Once someone is freed from jail, they can either go hide again or sit out the rest of the round, enjoying their freedom. If someone frees a few people in jail but some are still hiding, the same principles apply. Of course, you can add any flavor you like!

, This is technically hide and seek -- only backwards! You have only one person hiding and everyone trying to find them. But when they do find them, they hide with them in the same place! So by the time the last person finds them, what they're really finding is a pile of smushed people. Kind of like a can of sardines!


Oh, and play in the dark! It's much, much more fun that way. When you find someone, ask them ""Are you the sardine?"" And if they tell you yes, they are, join 'em!

, This is like jailbreak, but team style. You have two teams (preferably of 4 or more) and they're each assigned a home base. The teams go hide around the other team's home base and try to make it back to theirs. When everybody makes it back home without being tagged, they win.


This is best played in really, really large areas, like parks. And if it's nightfall, even better! Just make sure no one gets lost and you can communicate. People have to know when the game is over!

Have the cops count to a certain number while the fugitives hide.,
Let the cops out.,
Send caught fugitives to jail.,
Get to home base.,
Decide who wins.,
Play again.",How to Play Fugitive (Night Game)2," Once they finish counting, the game begins.

, They are free to run around and try to tag the fugitives. Have some cops stay back and guard the home base so that the fugitives have a smaller chance of getting back easily.

, If a fugitive is tagged, they go to jail and cannot get out of jail unless one of their teammates tags them and gets them out of jail.

, If a fugitive makes it back to home base, they are safe, as long as they stay on home base. If they step out of the home base, they can be tagged and sent to jail.

,


If all the fugitives make it back to the home base without going to jail, they win.
If the cops tag all the remaining fugitives before they make it back to home base, they win.

, After winning, the winning team can decide if they want to rotate teams or stay the same.


For example, if the cops won, they can choose to become the fugitive team and the fugitive team become the cops. If they don't want to change, they can choose to stay in whatever position they are in and play again.

Pick teams.,
Determine a location for the “jail.” The size of your “jail” will depend on how many people you have on each team.,
Choose one team to be ‘it.’ The easiest way to decide which team is ‘it’ would be to flip a coin.You could also choose a representative from each team to play rock-paper-scissors.,
Hide!,
Tag members of the other team until no one else is left.,
Continue until all of the members of the not-‘it’ team are in “jail.” A game of team flash light ends when everyone from the not-'it' team is caught and put in jail.",How to Play Flashlight Tag2," Make sure there are a lot of hiding spots and that it is a safe place to run around. If a friend has a large backyard, you could play flashlight tag in an area away from street lights or porch lights. If you know a playground will be open after dark, consider playing there.


You can also play indoors with the lights off. This works best in a big, open room, like a furnished basement without too much furniture. Be careful playing around heavy furniture or household items that could break.

, Team flashlight tag is best played with a lot of people. If you have ten or more people who want to play, team flashlight might be more fun than playing with only one ‘it’ person. With team flashlight, half of the people playing are ‘it’ at the same time, so be sure to have enough flashlights for half of your friends.


Be sure to have extra batteries handy so that if someone’s flashlight stops working mid-game, they can replace their batteries quickly.
You may also want to set a rule to employ if batteries do run out. For instance, if someone’s batteries do run out, they would have 30 seconds or one minute to “pause” and replace their batteries before rejoining the game. During this “pause,” they could not be tagged ‘out.’

, Be sure to split the group into two even halves, with approximately the same number of people on each team.

, Your “jail” should be large enough for everyone from one team to fit comfortably.You can outline the “jail” with sidewalk chalk if you don’t have a clearly defined area to use as the “jail.”Be as specific about the parameters of the “jail” as possible, since people can be tagged out of “jail” by another member of their team.

,


Once a person goes to “jail,” they can be tagged back into the game by one of their team members. Thus, the ‘it’ team will need to guard the “jail.” Choose one or two people to act as guards during the game., Allow one minute for the team who is not ‘it’ to run and hide. During this time, the ‘it’ team must remain in “jail” with their eyes closed. After the minute is up, the ‘it’ team can leave jail and begin tagging members of the other team., To tag someone, a person should sneak up on a member of the other team and shine the flashlight on them. This person is then out and must go to “jail.”Make sure to quickly shine the light on the person you want to tag and then turn it off immediately. Otherwise, another person hiding in the area might see you and run away.
During this time, members of the not-‘it’ team should try to rescue the team members in “jail.” You can do so by tagging their hand, at which point they are back in the game., However, if a game is taking too long, you can always agree that, after a certain point, the 'it'-team loses. For example, give the 'it'-team an hour to locate all the players before they lose.


After a complete team has been tagged ‘out,’ you can restart a new round. The not-‘it’ team from the last round will now be the ‘it’ team."

Keep the field of play away from the campfire and tents.,
Use dim flashlights and avoid laser pointers.,
Keep your playing area small.,
Keep track of all players, if you're the adult.",How to Play Flashlight Tag3," If you're playing flashlight tag while camping, make sure to keep the field of play safe. Do not play too close to the campfire and tents. You do not want to risk getting burnt by the fire, or accidentally knocking down a tent late at night., You should play flashlight tag with somewhat dim flashlights. You do not want to be shining bright lights into other player's eyes, as this can cause eye irritation.Never use laser pointers to play flashlight tag. Laser pointers can be extremely harmful to eyesight and even cause temporary blindness. This puts players at risk for falling and getting hurt.

, If you're playing flashlight tag, try to keep the play area small. For one, this can make the game more fun. If you're playing in an open area, like the woods, it can be nearly impossible to find everyone with unlimited access to hiding spots. Also, playing in a small area is good for safety. You do not want any players getting lost., If you're an adult supervising a game of flashlight tag, make sure you keep track of all the players. You do not want any kids to get lost or injured during a game. Do a quick role call before and after a game of flashlight tag to make sure everyone's accounted for.

Start out by using common sense.,
Remind yourself of earlier games you've played.,
Very carefully, look around your back yard, or where ever you're playing.,
Do not move from your hiding spot!,
Remember to have the correct attire for the game!,
Leave no evidence!,
Do not have anything that makes noise or has light!,
Keep your lips shut!,
The Golden Rule Of Hide and Seek!,
Never go to the same hiding spot in the same game!,
Always Have a Back-up plan (or a plan-B)!,
Keep your friends close; but your enemies closer.,
Use code!,
Secrecy is key!,
Have fun!",How to Have the Ultimate Game of Hide and Seek (Outside)," Think about what kind of friends you have. For say, if you happen to have a friend who likes to take risks, and if very athletic, they are more likely to hide in places where others cannot get to; such as, high trees, or on a roof. Or if you have a younger friend that is scared of the dark, they are more likely to follow one of the other hiders and give away their spot by being loud. Figure out what you, and your friends are.;
, Where did your friends hide, where did the seeker look the most. Then you'll figure out where is the best place to go, and run if a seeker sees you.

, Look for good, dark places, such as behind a bush, or corner of the house. If you want you may write these down so you don't forget them.

, Most people get caught when they are running to find a new hiding spot! If you have a good hiding spot do not move! This may get boring, but at least you'll be the winner, and not have to be seeker next. (Unless it is an absolute must)

, Make sure you blend in with all of your surroundings. If you are playing in the dark, be sure to wear black. Weather conditions may change, as in winter, summer, fall, etc. Make sure you change with the season to be absolutely camouflage. (Night: Black clothes, Snowy: White clothes, etc.)

, Okay, you have just found the best spot! You are sure no one will ever look here! But, wait, someone is coming! The next thing you know, you are found. How did the seeker find you? Maybe it is because it is your lack of secrecy. Maybe it is winter outside, and you forgot about the snow on the ground and you left footprints leading to your hiding spot! Or maybe you had some loose change in your pocket that had led a trial right to your hiding spot. Make sure you carefully get to your hiding spot, with no one looking, and no evidence left behind.

, So, your phone randomly goes off in the game. It makes a loud sound, and the light from it is showing through your pocket. Day or Night this will not do you any good. Remember to leave all electronics, noisy items (keys, coins, etc.) and anything else that can give you away, inside of your house.

, Many of your fellow Hiders my find a spot next to you and then try to talk to you to go meet up in a new space. The best way to get these people to stop talking to you is to simply ignore them until the end of the game. If that does not work, try simply saying ""I can't hear you. Tell me after the game."" That shows them that you really don't care (in a nice way) and to just be quiet!

, Keep your Hiding spots a secret! Look for some good hiding spots and write them down. But make sure no one in the game finds your list of hiding and spots and never tell anyone your spots. But you might say ""she/he is my best friend and will never tell anyone else."" Yes, that may be true, but in the game of hide and seek, its one man on his own. If you tell your friend you best hiding spot, and they become the seeker, they will know right were to find you! So, lock your lips and throw away the key!

, Once you or a fellow teammate has been in a spot many times, it will become one of many of the first places a seeker will look. That's why you should have many Spots to choose from (that are different). You should also think about going to a spot in one game, don't go to it again for a couple more rounds, and then use it again. Most seekers forget places after a while.

, Remember to never move spots (unless it is a must) Well, Plan-B is where the must part comes in. Somewhere in the game, someone will give away your spot (to either try to be funny, or to get back at you for something you did earlier in the game) It's just like if your house where on fire; you would have a back up plan to get out of wherever you are!

, Okay, so your friends are not exactly your ""enemies"" but in hide and seek; they sure are! Be sure to keep close (secret) contact with your fellow hiders; but not too close. At some point in the game you might have to turn on them to save yourself from the seeker. Make sure you don't do anything to tick your friends off; they can be useful sometimes! But also remind your self that you are playing to win - not to be Mr. Nice Guy!

, Your friends can be useful sometimes! You and some hiders can create a code for when you are either signaled to run, the seeker is coming toward you, etc.

, Keeping yourself on low-profile or on the ""DL"" (down low) is the key to winning the game.

, Sure this game can get pretty competitive, but remind yourself constantly that these are still your friends and you are just playing for fun. There is no reason to fight or cheat at all!

Play Laser Quest as a player.,
Be enthusiastic about Laser Quest.,
Be polite and friendly to all customers, whether they are playing, parents of players, or just enquiring.,

Be gentle with kids and take your time, especially if they’re scared.,
Be honest and ethical.,
Keep busy and do something useful.,
Finally (and possibly most importantly) Make it feel special.",How to Be a Great Laser Quest Marshal," It is best if you are already a member or at least play regularly before you become a marshal because this helps you understand the basics: How to play the game, the layout of the arena, the equipment.;
, Again it helps to be a member. As someone who plays Laser Quest for fun, you will have no problem getting your customers excited about Laser Quest too.

, Remember that a smile can go a long way.

, Be clean, tidy and hygienic and look smart. Wear sensible shoes because marshals do a lot of walking around.

, If you don’t know the stuff yourself, you will find it extremely difficult to explain to customers. Memorise the deals, special offers and events so you can explain them to customers.

, When you have to give the safety/how to play briefing to a large, noisy group, be sure to speak loudly and make sure that you are listened to. Make sure you are actually enforcing rules such as no physical contact - they are for everyone's safety.

, E.g if you have only a small group playing, let them choose whether to play a team or solo game, and if they choose a team game, let them pick their own teams.

, Being in the arena with the players gives you more of an idea what is going on in the game and allows you to see if anyone is behaving dangerously or unfairly and do something about it. The only reasons to be in the airlock/pack room during the game is if you are sorting out a pack problem or starting/ending the game.

, If you have a small group, offer to join in to make up numbers or even out the teams if there are an odd number. For a group of young children, try putting on a pack but not shooting anyone, just walking around as a target. Just remember that you are being paid and the customers are paying - so don't play to win (especially if you are an experienced player) and don't play in a way that is irritating or unfair (e.g. covering sensors, stalking, repeatedly hitting the same person).

, If someone’s pack is not working, make sure you can get them back in the game quickly and efficiently.

, (Assuming you have these). If the players are interested, show them how you hold the gun in a tournament/how to stand sideways to minimise the targets they display to opponents/tell them about how you know the guy whose picture is in the trophy cabinet/ mention that you’re going to the European Championships. They’ll think you’re awesome. (OK, maybe a bit weird too, but definitely awesome).

, It’s such a simple thing but easily forgotten. Hand them to the players before they have to ask you for them.

, Let them know you think they’re pretty good at Laser Quest. They’re more likely to come back, and more likely to consider becoming a member.

, Some children are scared of the dark or just nervous about playing for the first time. Take time to answer all their questions, even if they seem silly. Make sure their pack is done up properly and tightened. If someone is scared, offer to go in with them and look after them in the arena. Encourage kids to play (even if they’re scared) but never force them. For groups with a lot of small children, keep the lights on in the airlock and make sure the music is not on too loud.

, This means if games are, say, 15 minutes long, never run a 13 minute game and pretend it’s 15 minutes, even if you are running behind schedule. Don't rip anyone off.

, If there are no customers and you have nothing else to do, do some tidying or cleaning, catch up with paperwork, make sure all the packs are hung up correctly, or ask a colleague or manager if there is anything you can do to help them. Nobody is paying you to stand around doing nothing.

, This requires some imagination and getting to know the particular individual/group. It’s not possible to make it extra-special for everyone, especially on a busy day, but there’s always something you can make time to do. For example:


Let the group choose standard game or frantic, and take the time to explain the difference. (Standard game is one second down-time, frantic is one second down-time, so is a faster-paced game).
Go the extra mile in answering the tech-obsessed kid’s questions about how the pack works.
Allow yourself to be used as a human shield by a bunch of teenagers.
Let the birthday girl pick the teams.
Ask whether a group want to play alone or with another group and accommodate that.
Allow a group to take pictures of themselves with their packs on. Offer to take the picture.

Know the basics of capture the flag to get playing quickly.,
Find a large, open area to play.,
Find an even number of people to play with.,
Choose two similar objects to be flags.,
Mark all of the boundaries of the playing field together.,
Hide your team's flag secretly.,
Pick ""jails"" for each team.,
Talk about any ""specialty"" rules before starting the game.",How to Play Capture the Flag1," In capture the flag, two teams hide an object (""the flag"") on their territory. Usually, the territory is made by splitting a playing area in half with cones, trees, or other markers. Your team tries to take the opponents' flag and bring it back to your territory before they find yours. To defend your flag, you can tag any opponent on your territory and send them to ""jail"" until they are tagged by their teammate to be set free. The first team to capture the other's flag wins the round. If the game was quick you usually switch sides, re-hide the flags, and play again.


Teams are even, made up frequently of 5 people or more per team.
You need a large area to play in, otherwise it is too difficult to explore the opponent's territory without immediately getting tagged.;
, You need plenty or room to run around and places to hide the flag. Lots of obstructions and obstacles, allowing you to hide as you search for the opponents flag, can make the can more fun as well. Try to pick an area with a large obstruction near the center so no guards can see all the way across the field. Some great spots include:


A house with a large front and back yard, or two equally large sides.
A paintball course.
A large stretch of woods, especially with a stream or set of power lines in the middle.You can play a modified version of capture the flag on completely flat ground as well. To do so, you simply place the flags at the farthest possible ends of the field in plain sight. Split the field in half, then start playing. The game then becomes more about running, dodging and tagging than hiding.

, You can play with any number of people, but it is best with at least 10 or 12. This way you have two even teams of 5 or 6. If possible, try and find a way to separate the teams with different color shirts, hats, or bandanas.


You can still play with an uneven number of players. Have the extra player hide the flags by themselves, for example, so neither team knows where to look. They can then ""judge"" the game, officiating whether or not someone was tagged. You can also make it so that the team with the ""better territory"" (for example, a backyard with many more hiding spots) has one less player, evening the playing field.

, These just need to be two objects of similar size and shape. If you are playing at night it is best to have something light colored. Some good options include:


Bandanas.
Old t-shirts.
Balls and Frisbees (you may make a rule that they can be passed once found, or they have to be carried)
Cones
Old toys.

, First and foremost, designate the center line dividing your territory. It is often easiest to use a natural line, like the edge of the house or everything even with two big, noticeable trees. Then decide how far back and to the sides you be playing. This prevents one team from hiding the flag incredibly far from the center line.


While natural lines (trees, shrubs, roads, etc.) may be easy to see, old shirts, athletic cones, and small markers like toys can make it easier for everyone to see the center line if there are no good natural dividing lines.
You don't have to mark off the back and sides. As long as everyone knows not to hide the flag past the boundaries there should not be a problem.

, Once the boundaries are set, each team will designate 1-2 players as ""hiders"" who will run off to secretly tuck the flag away. The other team members will stay together, out of sight (in the house or garage, at the center line, etc.), and make sure no one is looking where the flags are hidden. There are a few rules to flag hiding, but you can modify or skip them if you want the game to be harder:


The flag must be visible from one angle (not underneath a covering or stuffed in a mailbox).
The flag cannot be tied down or wedged -- you need to be able to grab it as you run past.
The flag can't be buried or raised up so that it can't be quickly snagged., Jail is where a player goes if they get tagged by an opponent. If your teammate is tagged, you can run over and tag them to ""free"" them again. Jails are usually picked right in the center of each team's territory, and they should both be the same distance from the center line for each team., Capture the flag is a pretty simple game -- you try and get the flag from the other team back to your side. If you get tagged you go to jail until someone on your team saves you. But there are some small rules that are best worked out before you start playing. There is no ""right"" way to play, so simply pick the rules that you like the most:One-handed tagging, or two-handed tagging?
When a player is freed from jail do they need to run back to their side before getting re-tagged, or do they get a free walk back?
Can a player save everyone in jail at once, or just one person?
If you grab the flag and are tagged, do you drop the flag there or let the other team return it?
Can you move your own team's flag somewhere new?
How far must a player stand away from their own flag (ie. no guarding the flag so that it is impossible to pick up)?"

, One half of the people will be the foxes, the other half will be the hounds.

, This game is designed to take place in a very large outdoor space. Ideally it should be about six blocks/a mile of playing space, although it depends on the terrain and how many hiding places there are.

, The foxes are given a 10-20 minute head start, and they run off to hide wherever they want.

, After the foxes have been given a good head start, the hounds go out and try to find the foxes. Once all the foxes have been found (or the hounds give up), the game is over.

Don't give up.",How to Be a Master at Hide And Seek," This is considered to be good for you, as a good way to gain differing perspectives and to use different parts of your brain.Switching roles can help you to gain insights into what the other party will do when you're in the opposing role, because you've already played it yourself, helping you to empathize and comprehend likely moves. Moreover, switching between both hider and seeker roles is likely to assist you in better spotting errors or anomalies around you.All of these features make hide and seek a good game for all ages, kids and adults alike.

, The closet is an okay place, but it is pretty obvious. If you are small, empty cabinets are perfect. Hiding underneath a bed is also good as long as your hair, arms, legs, feet, or hands aren't showing. Small people can also hide behind solid curtains just as long as they don't move around. If you are big, you can resort to hiding in a closet behind some hanging clothes or behind a chair or couch. If it is a sleepover, hiding in a sleeping bag is perfect for any size of person.


Before the person who is seeker starts to count, take a good look around, and survey the place you are in. Look for potential hiding places. Try not to make it obvious what you're looking at though; if you're staring at one particular area, it is quite easy for the seeker to guess that that is where you will hide.;
, If there is a base, it might be best to hide somewhere near the base. But be careful, because you don't want to be too revealed. Once the seeker leaves the room, run to base and yell, ""Safe!"" or ""Base!"". Otherwise, if you are in a spot that is far from base, just stay there until you hear the seeker tag another person first. If there isn't a base, hide in a place that is far from where the seeker was counting.

, If you happen to be playing outside, day or night, a field can be good. Make sure to lie down, especially if it isn't tall grass or wheat or grain etc. Get comfortable fast, moving can cause the wheat or grass to move about, this is very noticeable and can be loud. Always lie down, you may think you're very noticeable, but in fact you are not. The seeker may think the same and dismiss it as a prime hiding spot and move on to other places he or she thinks are better hiding spots.

, For example, if you plan on hiding behind a curtain or the shower curtain, shut the closet door quietly, but loud enough for 'it' to hear. They will most likely think you are going into the closet and you will delay their search.

, If you see that the person is near, try to find an alternative place to hide and move to it, making sure that you are not seen as you shift.


For example if you were behind a car, you could crawl around to the opposite side but go very slowly, so that they don't see you, then and run into some bushes.

, If you haven't yet been spotted, try to make your way somewhere around the place that the seeker has already looked in. The chances are that they are not likely to go back.


Continue to alternate your hiding places, moving will make you harder to find. Carry on this tactic until the seeker eventually gives up!

, If you know where others are hiding, leave a note for the seeker, outing where the others are. This will increase your chances of being found last.


Make sure to tell the seeker that if he or she tells anyone about the note, then you won't aid the seeker next time.
Don't just say everyone's hiding spot besides yours. Skip a few names, so it will be hard to tell who left out the note. You could even decoy by including your own name but a fake hiding spot.

, Don't laugh. That is an automatic giveaway and you will be found. Cover your mouth and stay low. If you are in a closet, keep your back faced towards the door because if by chances they come in, they might think you are a pile of clothing or a bag. Bathrooms are not great places to hide because any sound that is made will usually echo.

, Before the game begins, ask for five minutes to go and check the layout and spot potential hiding spots as you do so. Some hiding areas will become immediately apparent to you, while knowing the layout gives you the opportunity to prepare your trajectory for seeking.


If you've played the same area before, remember where the hiding spots were last time––these are the ones to check first this time.

, Some people might give away their intention to hide in certain locations or to head in particular directions by looking or even shifting their body in that direction.

, This makes it a lot more fun for everyone involved, as they have to dash madly to get to their hiding spot on time and you don't have to wait around impatiently counting.

, Check every single room, if playing indoors. Try to be quick about it. Hiders may become frustrated if you never find them. While you are searching, scope out other places to hide. Be aware that if it looks impossible, it probably isn't, someone may well have tried it.


Check the checked spots toward the game's end. Some hiders shift back, hoping you won't check again.

, This is so that you can listen for any breathing, movements, etc. and not alert hiders to your presence before you reach them (potentially giving them the time to move to a new hiding spot).


As much as you're quiet, listen. If you hear sniffles, sneezes, giggles, shuffling, creaks, etc., these are all giveaway indicators of where your hiders are.

, People don't look up often and a good hider is aware of this. However, if you're playing a very hands-on hide and seek game, don't go climbing up that ladder or wall if you're liable to be pelted back down again. Find another way to get up or call them out of their spot by shouting that you have spotted them.

, This knowledge can be used both ways, and the seeker can start to look for the hider's telltale signs through knowing the hider's tricks. This is clearly something you need to do beforehand, out of sheer interest. It might even encourage you to put your hand up to be seeker at the next hide and seek game you're party to.

, Never resort to 'olee-olee-oxen free'. Masters of hide and seek look until they find.

"
Break your team up into ""guards"" and ""attackers."",
Plan your modes of attack.,
Hide your flag cleverly.,
Switch sides after every game.",How to Play Capture the Flag2," The best way to play as a team is to have set roles. This way you know that a certain number of people will be defending your flag, no matter what. You may want one more guard than attacker, someone who focuses on getting your team out of jail if anything goes wrong.



Guards: Patrol the center line and the rest of your field, ready to tag anyone who crosses or tries to find your flag. Often calls out to the rest of the team when they've found someone hiding or sneaking on their side. They also try and prevent jailbreaks.

Attackers: Try and sneak away or outrun the guards, looking for the flag. They will go to jail often while searching, so other attackers need to take turns saving them so that all the attackers don't end up in jail at once. Once they find the flag, they tell the rest of their team and try to capture it.

Scouts/Rangers/Recon (Optional): If you have a big team, you'll want a few fast players who can switch between offensive and defense, depending on the team's needs. These players usually save others from jail, help search for the flag near the border, defend when the guards are outnumbered, or slowly sneak into enemy territory while the attackers distract the guards.

, The fun of capture the flag comes from the strategy involved. Do you want to play defensively, picking off the other team's attackers and then rushing them with superior numbers? Or do you want to try and sneak into their side, hiding and moving slowly to spend as much time looking for the flag as possible? Talk with your team to work out a gameplan for the best results. Some strategies include:



The Mad Rush: A desperate move, or one used if you know where the flag is, this involves sending almost everyone in at once in the hopes that one person gets the flag back safely.

The Decoy: Risky but rewarding, this involves sending some of your fastest players all to one side of the field. Their goal is simply not to get tagged, drawing as many guards to chase them as possible, while another player on the other side of the field quietly sneaks around to look for the flag.

Blockers: If you have the flag or know where to find it, group up with 3-4 other teammates. Run together towards the flag with your fastest person in the middle and the rest of the team 4-5 feet away on either side, taking tags as ""blockers."" Note, however, that once a player is tagged they must stop playing and go to jail. They cannot keep blocking after they've been tagged.

, There are a lot of things to consider when hiding a flag, and the ""best spot"" might not be what you expect at first. Try to think about the first places you would look if you were the other team, as they will likely look their first as well. You usually want a spot that is far back in your territory, but not too near the jail.


The farther away your flag, the more ground the team has to cover without being tagged, making it easier to defend. That said, mixing in a very close location once in a while may be a risk worth taking, as the other team might not even look at the nearby hiding spots if they expect it farther back.
If the flag has to be visible, try and make it only see-able from behind so that the team needs to run all the way around to get a view of it.
Putting the flag near your jail may lead to a prisoner seeing it while they wait, so try and keep some distance.

, In order to prevent one team from feeling like they got the ""worst side,"" you should switch sides every game. If the games are quick, play until one team wins by 2 games (3-1, 5-3, etc.). This ensures that the winning team fairly won on both sides of the field.

"
Freeze people on tags instead of sending them to jail.,
Play with a frisbee or ball for your flag that you can pass to teammates.,
Hide multiple flags per team.,
Try out Night Capture the Flag.,
Tag people with water balloons or ""flour bombs"" instead of your hands.,
Set up a neutral zone where no one can be tagged.",How to Play Capture the Flag3," If you're tagged, simply stop moving and stand in place until someone on your team tags you, at which point you can play again as if nothing ever happened.

, This often makes the game much faster and more offensive minded. If you capture the flag you can throw it to a teammate to try and get it out of your territory. The tagging rules still apply, and you can add the rule stating that if the flag is dropped (by a bad pass or missed catch), the flag must be returned to the starting space.


This is a great variation for Open-Field games, where it is impossible to hide a flag.

, This is a great way to extend the game longer, or make it more fun for larger groups (20+) in large areas. Give each team 3-5 flags to hide individually. The game is not over until all the flags are found by one team.


You can also give each flag a point score, based on the difficulty of finding and returning it to your base. Set a time limit on the game, and the team with the most points at the end wins., Don flashlights or headlamps and head out for a spooky, extra challenging game of CTF. To prevent dangerous collisions, make a rule that you can only be running with a light on. However, turning your light off and sneaking slowly around is a great way to search for the flag, or spring a trap on an unsuspecting attacker.

, For a safer, easier version of paintball capture the flag, cut up several pairs of pantyhose into small, 3-4 inch long strips. Tie one end up and fill it with enough flour that it is easily thrown back and forth. Tie the top up, and make sure all the players are wearing dark clothing. Now, instead of tagging someone, you have to hit them with the flour bomb, which will leave a puff of flour as proof.Water balloons or water guns can be substituted as well, but refilling them takes time, especially over a long game.

, Having a neutral zone prevents impossible-to-judge situations where two players tag each other near or on the line. To do so, simply make the center line 3-5 yards wide. If you're in this area, no one can be tagged and sent to jail. Players are not allowed to go to the neutral zone and stay there! That is considered cheating.

Wear proper clothing.,
Cover your head.,
Camouflage your skin colour.,
Use twigs and grass.,
Move silently.",How to Camouflage Yourself Well in a Wooded and Grassed Area," Have combat pants on or DMPs (these are camouflage clothes). Wear 2 t-shirts and a jacket if necessary for the temperature and make certain the top layer matches the color of the terrain you're hiding in.


If you are in an environment with large amounts of vegetation, a dark green is the best choice.
If you're in an area in the middle of a drought, a brown or light tan would work best.
If there is snow on the ground, avoid any color except white.
Avoid wearing black in a wooded or forested area as it isn't natural and tends to stand out too much, unless it's nighttime.;
, Make sure to wear a hat in a color that matches the environment. A ""boonie"" style hat is best, as you can put in pieces of vegetation to further disguise the shape of your head, but any hat will do.

, You can use camo cream or dirt. Cover all the skin that will be showing with your cream or dirt, and rub a bit on where your clothes could blow in the wind and show your skin.

, Put twigs or leaves or grass around all your body leaving only your already camouflaged face showing. Then do the same with your kit and any other equipment you may have.

,


Avoid twigs, dried leaves and all wood on the ground. Twigs snap, wood can crack and leaves rustle, alerting people to your presence.
Avoid sharp rocks as best you can or hold your innate reaction to cry out.

Maximize your team's strength.,
Get in the right position.,
Take small steps backward.,
Push back with your legs as much as you can.,
Use teamwork.,
Keep practicing.",How to Win at Tug of War," You should put the strongest person in the back so that he can use his strength the most and will have the least chance of slipping. Some people say you should put the strongest person in front; the problem with that is that if this player slips up, you will lose your strongest player right off the bat. You can put the strongest person in the back while keeping one of the other strong players up front. In general, you should mix up your weakest and strongest players so you don't have a row of several weak players keeping you down.









If each end of your rope has a loop to place a player in, then your strongest player should go into the loop.;
, First off, do not wrap the rope around your hands or wrists. This is guaranteed to harm you and possibly lead to a broken bone or a sprain. You should hold the rope with an underhand grip, keeping your arms as extended as you can so you can lean back most effectively. Remember that winning tug of war isn't about using your hands to pull the rope; it's about using your legs to push against the ground while holding onto the rope with your hands. If you plan to win just by pulling, you will get tired -- fast.









Keep your arms and body almost straight as you lean backwards with your upper body while planting your feet into the ground, using both of your legs as anchors. Pretend like you're sitting back into a seat that is very reclined.
Your feet should be positioned a little wider than shoulder width apart.
You and your teammates will all be positioned on one side of the rope, with your arms gripping the rope from both sides.

, Everyone should move in small baby steps so that both of the strongest muscles in the body (the thighs) can keep the rope on their side. If you take huge steps, you'll be much more likely to fall or trip. If you feel that your team is really beginning to dominate, you can do the power walk, by slowly walking backward sideways, with your chest facing the other side of the rope.








, Use all your leg muscles; arms should be locked out; don’t waste energy trying to pull with your arms or you will quickly run out of energy and will lose your grip. As you slowly walk backwards with your feet, rotate your shoulders backward slightly as you inch your arms and legs backwards. Make sure to always remain in the ""nearly falling"" seated position, and to never let your legs or body get behind your arms, so that you're scrunched up under the rope with your arms ahead of you. You won't be able to get any power from this position.








, Everyone should pull at the same time. This will generate the maximum amount of force that your team is supposedly capable of. Much like a dragon boat team, a good fluid and coordinated motion can easily propel ""the boat"", which in this case the opposing team forward.








, It may take a while for your team to find a winning rhythm. As you practice together more as a team, you will find the best coordination and the best order of team members that will lead to your success. Don't get frustrated right away; once you master the technique and the teamwork, you'll be well on your way to being tug-of-war champions!

Devise a way for you and your partner to take turns simultaneously.,
Make your move.,
Repeat steps 1-2 until someone dies.",How to Play the Shotgun Game1," For example, one person might count to 3 and both of you make your move. Another way is to face each other with your palms out, and make your moves when you touch hands.;
, You can only make one move per turn. There are three different moves:


Reload: Make the shape of a gun and point it up in the air. You must reload at least once before shooting. Reloads can be accumulated. A certain number of accumulated reloads grants a specific weapon. One reload gives a pistol, three gives a machine gun, and five a shotgun.






Shoot: Pantomime the action of shooting your opponent. You may use any weapon that the number of reloads you have allows for. For example, if you only have one reload you can only fire your pistol once, but if you have three reloads you can either fire your pistol three times (that is, across three separate turns without needing to reload) or fire your machine gun once. Make sure that it is clear which weapon you are shooting your opponent with. You may only fire ONE shot per turn (one pistol shot, one machine gun shot, etc.)






Block: Cross your arms over your chest. This will block all shots. In simple shotgun, your shield can never be compromised.







, Someone dies if they are shot while reloading. If both players shoot each other at the same time, whoever has the more powerful weapon wins (the machine gun overpowers the pistol, the shotgun overpowers the machine gun and pistol). If the weapons are of the same strength, the game is a draw.

Pull as hard as you can.,
Keep pulling until there is a victor.",How to Play Tug of War1," In tug of war, opposing player or teams will pull on a rope until one of the teams or players succeeds at pulling the majority of the rope over to one side. To get started, all you need to do is take your rope and lay it out in a straight line on the ground.


There should be a flag or marker in the center of the rope. If not, then place one in the center of your rope before you start the game.;
, You can play tug of war in teams or as a one-on-one game. If you are going to have a team game, then make sure that you have an equal number of players on either side of the rope. If you are playing with just two people, then stand at opposite ends of the rope.

, Have all of the players pick up the rope and grip it tightly with both hands. Do this before you start the game so that everyone has a chance to get a good grip on the rope.Never anchor the rope around your waist or coil it around other parts of your body. This can result in severe rope burn, dislocations, or rope breaks that can snap and inflict other severe or even fatal injuries., If you have not chosen a judge yet, then do so now. The judge can be someone who does not want to play or an extra person if you have an odd number of players. Have the judge stand in the center of the rope.


The judge will also need a whistle (or a loud voice) to signal to other players that the game has started., The judge can blow a whistle or yell “Go!” to signal to the players that the game has started. Have the judge signal the start of the game so that the players will know when to start pulling. When the judge sounds the whistle or yells, then the game has officially started.

, All players on either side should lean backwards with their feet planted as they pull to start. Try to use your body weight and leg strength to pull the rope back and away from the other team., Each team’s goal is to pull the marker or flag past the center point. When one team or player has accomplished this goal, that team or player will be declared the winner.


Don’t stop pulling until the judge declares a winner.

, The moderator will not be an assassin, but rather the game's ""director."" The moderator will keep track of kills, rule-breakers, and help decide resolutions to disputes that may arise.

, Commonly used weapons are sharpies, spoons, nerf and water guns, toy swords, cardboard tubes, water balloons, socks, etc. There are also ""indirect eliminations,"" where the assassin can kill their target without necessarily being near them. They could use alarms on wristwatches or kitchen timers as ""bombs,"" which usually have a ""blast radius,"" killing anyone within the explosion. In addition, there could be ""poison,"" where a strong flavour or piece of paper with ""poison"" written on it is added to the victim's food. Decide on proper targets on body (usually the inside of wrists, back of neck, behind knees)

, These are areas were ""kills"" are not permitted. They are usually put into place to minimise disruption. They may include school, places of worship, players' workplaces, etc.

, This can be done randomly, by pulling names out of a hat. In particularly large games, where players may not know each other well, addresses, phone numbers, etc may be given along with the name of the target.

, If they succeed, they acquire their now-dead target's target. This goes on until only one assassin is left.

Devise a way for you and your partner to take turns simultaneously.,
Make your move.,
Repeat steps 1-2 until someone dies.",How to Play the Shotgun Game2," For example, one person might count to 3 and both of you make your move. Another way is to face each other with your palms out, and make your moves when you touch hands.

, You can only make one move per turn. There are now five different moves:

Reload: Make the shape of a gun and point it up in the air. You must reload at least once before shooting. Reloads can be accumulated. A certain number of accumulated reloads grants a specific weapon. One reload gives a pistol, three gives a machine gun, five a shotgun, and ten a bazooka.






Shoot: Pantomime the action of shooting your opponent. You may use any weapon that the number of reloads you have allows for. For example, if you only have one reload you can only fire your pistol once, but if you have three reloads you can either fire your pistol three times (that is, across three separate turns without needing to reload) or fire your machine gun once. Make sure that it is clear which weapon you are shooting your opponent with. You may only fire ONE shot per turn (one pistol shot, one machine gun shot, etc.)











Block: Cross your arms over your chest. This will block all shots. Your ""shield"" can now only take a limited amount of damage before you either die or can no longer block. It can take 9 damage, while the player can take 1 damage. The damage a weapon inflicts generally depends on how much reloads it requires to fire, with a few exceptions: the knife and the pistol cannot damage the shield (but will still do 1 damage to the player, killing them). The machine gun does 3 damage, the shotgun does 5 damage, and the bazooka does 10 damage (making it unblockable in practice).
Take Out Knife: Pantomime the action of taking out some sort of bladed weapon. This only has to be done once. Once your knife has been taken out, you may now stab as one of your moves.






Stab: Pantomime the motion of stabbing your opponent with a knife. You must have already taken out your knife on a previous turn. Stabbing does not require any reloading.






Emergency reload: This is an optional rule. Players may be allowed to block and reload at the same time, once per game. Cross your arms over your chest, with one hand in the shape of a gun. You must also announce that you are using your emergency reload.

, Someone dies if they are shot/stabbed while reloading or taking their knife out, or if their shield is compromised. If both players shoot each other at the same time, whoever has the more powerful weapon wins (the pistol overpowers the knife, the machine gun overpowers the pistol, the shotgun overpowers the machine gun and pistol, and the bazooka overpowers all other weapons). If the weapons are of the same strength, the game is a draw."

Pick the right rope.,
Mark the rope.,
Chalk up your hands.,
Choose a dry, level playing ground.",How to Play Tug of War2," You will need to have a good strong rope to play tug of war. The rope should be free of knots, fraying, or any flaws that might allow extra holding or rubbing. You may want to select a nylon rope to reduce rope-burn incidents.Make sure that the rope is long enough to accommodate all of your players as well. All of the players should have room to grip the rope and stand beside it.

, You will need to place a marker in the center of the rope so that players will be able to find the center. Find the center of the rope and mark it with one color flag or marker. Make sure the rope is straight when you measure it to find the center.You may also want to place markers on both sides of the central marker to indicate where players should start holding the rope. Place these markers about three feet away from the center point on both sides of the rope.

, Resin is an optional way to enhance your grip on the rope. Use resin or chalk from a sporting goods store or department store. Take out a palm full of the substance and clap or rub it between your palms. Work the substance around and between your fingers as well.This isn’t common in casual tug of war games, but can help you hold onto the rope for more organized games.

, It can be fun to play tug of war on a slippery, muddy terrain, but this may also make it harder to win based on strength. If you want to play a fair game of tug of war, then choose a level, dry playing ground, such as a dry field or the floor of a gymnasium.

"
"
Choose comfortable clothing.,
Pick the right shoes for indoors or outdoors.,
Wear padding if available.",How to Play Tug of War3," While you can wear just about anything you want for such a casual game you might want something more athletic. You might consider wearing shorts, or sweat pants. These are going to be more flexible than other forms of outwear for your legs. A t-shirt will be more likely to flex with your movements as you play the game.Whatever you choose to wear you should expect it to get dirty if you fall.

, Consider where you will be playing tug of war before you pick your shoes. If you are paying a game of tug of war indoors, then a regular pair of sneaker should be fine. If playing outside, you may want to choose a pair of sneakers with rubber cleats or even go for a pair of boots if the terrain is muddy.Avoid metal cleats, steel toes, and shoes that have metal anywhere else on the sole. These types of shoes pose a hazard to your fellow players.

, This is optional, but it is a good idea. You should consider wearing head gear, knee pads, and elbow pads. These are the areas you are most likely to fall on and injure during a tug of war contest.While most casual games of tug of war don’t require any padding you can still opt to put on protection to reduce the chance for injury. You can find rubber and plastic padding in any sport shop and many department stores.

Draw a sword on paper.,
Cut and copy the stencil.,
Cut your wood.,
Mix epoxy and glue the pieces.,
Sand your sword.,
Check your hilt and make final adjustments.,
Add decoration.",How to Make a Sword1," More specifically, draw the outline of a sword. Use rulers to make it reasonably straight, and be as creative with the design as you want. It doesn't have to be perfect. This will be the master stencil for your sword.


To make a long sword using this method, you'll need longer paper. Consider using a length of butcher paper, or buy oversized sheets of craft paper from a craft store.;
, Carefully cut the sword stencil out of the paper, and then lay it down on the wood you plan to use, which should be a fairly thin (no more than 1” thick) board of whichever wood you like. Copy the stencil onto the wood, and then copy the hilt (the handle and crosspiece) of the stencil twice more.


The hilt will be thicker than the blade, so you'll cut three pieces of wood for it and glue them together.

, Using a jigsaw, cut out the three pieces of wood you've outlined – two hilt pieces and one full sword design. The cuts will probably be fairly rough; that's fine. Be sure to cut a little wide rather than a little narrow: wide can be sanded down, but narrow can't be fixed so easily.

, The next step is to take a strong epoxy wood glue and mix it to activate it. Mix it on a piece of paper for easy cleanup. Once the mixture is active, spread it evenly on one side of each hilt piece and glue them firmly to the center piece, one on each side.


Once the pieces are glued, wait for the epoxy to dry fully, at least 10 minutes.
Get the pieces as evenly lined up as you can, but don't worry if they aren't perfect yet.

, Start with the hilt area. Use fine-grit sandpaper to sand down rough edges and even up all three parts. You can use a rotary tool to expedite the process, if you want. Once the hilt is even, use your sandpaper to bevel each side of the blade, making it “sharp.”

, Check to be sure your sword's hilt isn't too thick to hold easily; if it is, sand in from each side to make it more slender. Lay your sword on a graph-lined surface and check to be sure both sides of the crosspiece are even, and the blade is reasonably even on both sides. Sand down uneven parts until your sword looks more or less symmetrical.

, Begin by painting your sword. At the very basic level, you should spray paint it with a gray primer coat. Once the primer has dried, you can add metallic paint for a shiny blade, or colors like blue or red to make a “lightsaber.” Once the paint is dry, add a grip. Duct tape works well, as does wrapped cloth held in place with glue. You can also wrap leather cord around the grip and tie it off. Finally, using whatever decorative elements you want, add finishing touches.


If you cover the hilt of your sword when you spray the paint and primer, you can leave it with a natural wood appearance. Alternatively, consider spraying the hilt gold and the blade silver.
Try gluing large rhinestones to decorate the center of the crosspiece and the pommel (base of the hilt).
Once you're done spray painting, you can use small paintbrushes and acrylic paint to add details, if you want.

"
"
Start with a length of PVC pipe.,
Wrap with foam rubber.,
Add a crosspiece.,
Add more foam.,
Unleash the duct tape.,
Wrap up and have fun.",How to Make a Sword2," The pipe should be firm but wobbly when shaken. 1” to 1.5” diameter pipe works well. Using a saw, cut the pipe down to the length of the combined handle and sword blade. Think about whether or not you want the sword to be usable with two hands, or one-handed only.

, Cut a piece of closed-cell foam rubber (which comes in a cylindrical shape, with a hole for pipe in the center) down to the length of your sword plus a few inches. Slide the tube onto your PVC pipe.

, If you want to, add a crosspiece by sliding a four-way pipe fitting onto the hilt end of your main PVC piece. Cut two short pieces of PVC pipe, both the same length. Slide one piece into each open side of the fitting to create a crosspiece. Once you're happy with the width and positioning, use plastic cement to secure each piece in place.

, If you want, to make the sword safer to use, add small pieces of closed-cell foam to each end of the crosspiece and the base of the hilt. This has the added benefit of creating a “pommel” of sorts.

, Start by wrapping your grip in duct tape. Cut it when you reach the base of the crosspiece and smooth it flat. Next, wrap duct tape thickly around the base of each piece of foam rubber, helping secure it to the pipe. Add straps of duct tape pulled tightly around the foam to further secure it. Finally, wrap the entire foam blade in duct tape from bottom to top.


The last few inches of the foam should extend past the PVC tip for safety; feel free to wrap this “soft tip” as well, closing off the hole in the top.

, Completely wrap any other pieces of foam you added with duct tape as well. The duct tape gives them a shiny metallic look, and protects the form from the elements. Once your weapon is finished, it can be used to stage fun sword fights with your boffer-wielding friends. The weapons are soft enough to prevent any serious injury, so have at it!

Purchase your supplies.,
Scour your ruler.,
Cut the dowel.,
Attach the dowel grip.,
Sand and prime.,
Wrap the grip.",How to Make a Sword3," You'll need a metal yardstick or meter stick, a thick dowel with a diameter the same as the width of your ruler, rough steel wool, sandpaper, primer, and cloth or duct tape for wrapping the grip, as well as contact cement or metal epoxy adhesive. You'll be using a saw to cut and split your dowel; a vise clamp is also recommended, but not strictly necessary.

, Use plenty of steel wool and scour the ruler as much as you can to roughen and clean the surface. If your ruler's markings are painted onto the surface, the wool might also get rid of them; feel free to scour them away, if this is the case. When you're done, wipe the ruler clean with a dry cloth.

, Measure out a length of dowel that will work well as a handgrip, and cut that piece off the end of the dowel. Measure and mark across one end at the midway point, then carefully saw the dowel into two even, semi-cylindrical halves, using a saw guide to hold the dowel steady.

, Lightly sand the flat insides of each dowel half with very fine grit sandpaper. Following the instructions for your metal epoxy or contact cement, evenly glue one half of the dowel to each flat side of the base of the ruler, and let it dry completely.


If you have a vise clamp, clamp the pieces firmly (without damaging the soft wood) and let it dry that way to improve the bond.

, Once the dowel grip is secure, sand away any excess glue from the seams, and then heft it in your hand. If the grip feels awkward, try sanding down the sides a little bit at a time, alternating evenly on each side, until the grip becomes a bit more oblong and can be held more easily. When you're satisfied, cover the grip with painter's tape and spray a coat of primer onto one side of the blade, then the other. Apply another coat to completely obscure any markings on the ruler. Let both coats dry completely.

, Remove the painter's tape from the grip and sand it with ultra-fine grit sandpaper to remove potential splinters, then wrap it in adhesive medical tape, duct tape, or leather cord to make a soft grip. Your new katana is complete! The flexibility of the ruler blade will ensure that it wobbles rather than breaks or bends when you hit things with it.


This sword may have a square tip and a flat blade, but it can still cause a lot of pain. Be very careful when you play with it. Only hit inanimate objects, like practice dummies.

, Give the people on your team certain jobs. The person who has the best plans might be elected the commanding officer, while the person who is the best at sneaking around can be used as a scout or lookout.

, Water balloons and water guns make good weapons. Pine cones and sticks will also work, as well as Nerf guns, hula hoops, or just about anything imaginative. Be careful to choose a weapon which doesn't have the possibility of severely injuring other players. Keep the weapons distracting but safe.

, Put bandages, plaster, and candy in these to be used as ""medicine"". This will make the game more realistic

Take it to the next level.",How to Jump Double Dutch," This accounts for the two that will turn the ropes and at least one who will jump. You will always have two people turning the ropes, but you can have more jumpers. You can jump two at a time and change jumpers as you go. This means you can have up to eight or so participants and everyone can have a chance to jump., There are all types of jump ropes and everyone has different preferences. The material of the rope is up to you. Try a few and see what feels comfortable. There are cloth ropes, speed ropes, leather ropes, and beaded ropes; it simply depends on your preference. The important thing for getting started is to find ropes that are 12–14 feet (3.7–4.3 m) long. This is sufficient length to fit a jumper in the middle. Make sure to get two ropes that are the same length and material., The two people who turn the ropes should be able to maintain a steady rhythm. If anyone is already familiar with Double Dutch, those people should be turners because this role is fundamental to the success of the game. Without consistent turners, it is not possible for the jumpers to succeed. Turners are of vital importance in setting the cadence of the game. Choose your turners wisely and let the others be jumpers., Your stance is highly important in maintaining your balance. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent. This will allow you to move your arms freely without throwing yourself off balance. Make sure you don’t inadvertently move in towards the middle when the jumper joins. Your feet should stay still., Having a solid grip will allow you to move the ropes at speed without them slipping. Hold the rope with your thumb and forefinger and curl the rest of your fingers under the thumb. Your grip should be firm, not clenched. If you hold too tightly, this can hinder your movement.

, Decide which rope will start and begin to rotate. To ensure you and your partner begin rotating at the same time, one of you can say, “Ready, set, go.” The first rope can start on “set” and the second on “go.”Keep your elbows near your sides with your forearms extended. From the elbow, move your left arm clockwise towards the center of your body in a circle, and move your right arm counterclockwise towards the center in circle. The circles should not overlap, but should just barely touch in the middle. Your hands should be opposite one another so that when your right arm is up high, your left arm is down low. The circles should span from about your chin to your waist.It is important for the circles to be the same size. Oftentimes, beginners struggle with one arm and are more comfortable with the other. Work on consistently making the same circle with both arms, even though these circles move in different directions.
If you are struggling to learn the movement, practice without rope. Use pencils or sticks or anything that is similar to a jump rope’s handles. Practice the movement against a wall, tracing the circles on the wall. This will help you to get comfortable with the rotation without having to worry about the rope or your partner’s timing., This will be best accomplished by listening to the ropes. You are looking for a consistent sound. Try counting 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, and stay on beat. When you and your partner hear the same rhythm, you will be able to stay in sync. Make sure the ropes go high enough to encircle the person who will be jumping. The ropes should be taut and graze the ground each rotation. Try turning the ropes at different speeds once you get comfortable with your initial rhythm., The turner will often say, “Ready, set, go.” Then the jumper enters on “go.” If the jumper is new to Double Dutch, you may want to slow down a bit for them to enter. You can practice it a few times as well so that they get comfortable with the entrance., Once the jumper(s) join in, it is the responsibility of the turners to adjust to their speed. This is why the role of turner is so important; the outcome rests largely on the turner's ability to adapt to the jumper and stay on beat. Just be sure to keep a consistent rhythm as you change pace. Continue to listen to the ropes and to the jumper so that everyone is in sync.

, Turners often rhythmically chant rhymes. You can recite one such as, “Ice cream soda pop cherries on top, how many boyfriends have you got? Is it 1, 2, 3…"" You can also make up your own! These chants add to the fun and help you stay on rhythm.

, Before you enter, take time to watch the turners and listen to their rhythm. Try a couple of jumps outside of the rope so that the turners can become familiar with your pace. This way, you will all be starting at the same speed and can avoid any mixups. It is important for all of you to function as a unit. Teamwork is key to Double Dutch success.

, Start beside one of the turners. It can be tempting to start from the center, but this is actually more difficult.The turner should say, “Ready, set, go,” and you will enter on “go.” This should happen when the rope closest to you hits the ground. As that rope lifts, take a big step into the center and begin hopping on both feet. For example, if you are on the right hand side of the turner, jump in when the rope in their left hand hits the ground. Try this a few times with the turners until you are comfortable making a seamless entrance.If you are struggling to enter into the middle, you can mark the middle with tape or chalk. This way you will have a target to aim for as you enter.
If you are having a hard time entering, you can try starting in the middle before the turners begin to rotate the ropes. This will help you get used to finding your rhythm and can eliminate some of the initial awkwardness of making an entrance.

, Your feet should be together and your knees slightly bent. Your jumps should only be about 2” off the ground and should be at a steady rhythm. Keep your arms near your stomach so that they don’t get in the way. Start slowly and as you get comfortable, try to speed up and slow down. The turners will match your pace., Once you get used to the basic hop, you can try mixing it up. You can move laterally back and forth between the turners. Try raising your knees in a way that is similar to running in place. You can also try crisscrossing your feet for an added challenge. You could even rotate while jumping to gradually turn around in a circle. The possibilities are endless!


Try jumping on only one leg and then switching to the other. To stay on balance, pick out a stationary point of focus and stare at it. This will help you to stay centered while you switch legs so that you aren’t swayed by the swinging ropes or moving people.
To rotate while jumping, start by making a quarter turn and land on both feet. After you make it around in a circle by quarter turns, try to complete a half turn. Eventually, you can rotate in a full circle on one jump. To make this even more difficult, you can try it on one leg!

, Once one person has a solid rhythm in the middle, have another person join them. Two people is more challenging and a lot of fun. As these jumpers fatigue, switch them out with others who are waiting. Try to keep the rope going at all times as jumpers enter and exit. When another jumper joins, move over slightly so that there is enough room for both of you. Try to stay in sync with the other jumper.

, Exiting from jumping is similar to entering. You will want to exit diagonally towards one of the turners. Try exiting in the opposite direction as you entered. After the rope on the side you will exit hits the ground, take a large step out of the middle and land on both feet. For timing, you can even have the turners count, ""Ready, set, go."", When playing with friends, you make can make up rules of who goes first and how many games you have to jump in order to win. You can also compete in a competition. Double Dutch competitions have pre-established rules to follow, just like any competition that awards trophies and prizes. To improve and win, spend time practicing. You will continually get better.


If you are competing against teams, doubles are made of two turners and two jumpers while singles have two turners and one jumper. Make sure to build your team accordingly."

See who can jump the highest!",How to Chinese Jump Rope," A Chinese jump rope goes around the holders’ ankles, so the best type of rope for this game is a loop made of rubber or some other type of stretchy material. Some toy shops even sell elastic circular ropes that are meant for playing Chinese jump rope.


You can also use a 9 to 12 foot (2.7 to 3.7 m) long elastic band. Just tie the ends together to form a circle.;
, You will need at least three people to play Chinese jump rope, but you can play with more than three as well. Two of the players will be the rope holders and one (or more) will be the jumpers., The rope will need to be stretched out so that it looks like a long, skinny rectangle. Make sure that you have enough space to play. You should have several feet on each side so that jumpers can run in and out of the ropes.

, The holders should step into the ends of the rope so that they are facing each other. They should stand with their feet about shoulder-width apart and inch back a bit until the rope is taut.There should be enough space for a third player to safely jump between the first two players. If there isn’t enough room, then you need a longer rope!

, Chinese jump rope patterns can be made up of basic moves in any combination or order you want. The basic moves include:In: The jumper’s feet land inside the rope.
Out: The jumper’s feet land on one side of the rope.
Right: The jumper’s right foot lands inside the rope.
Left: The jumper’s left foot lands inside the rope.
On: The jumper’s feet land on the rope.
Turn: The jumper spins in mid-air to face the opposite direction.
Straddle: The jumper’s feet land on either side of the rope.

, To play Chinese jump rope, you will need to come up with a pattern for the holders to call out as the jumper jumps. You can make the pattern as short or as long as you want, but keep in mind that the longer the pattern, the more difficult it will be. The pattern can be something simple or more advanced. Some sample patterns include:

In-Out-In-Out-On
Out-On-Right-In-Out-On-Left-In
In-Straddle-Turn-Right-Out

, When you have decided on the pattern to use, the holders and jumper can all chant it together while the jumper jumps. If the jumper does all of the moves successfully, then you can speed it up or try a harder pattern. If the jumper messes up, then someone else can have a turn.

, If the jumper completes the pattern without touching the rope, you can also raise it a little higher. Then, the jumper must complete the same pattern at this new height. Keep raising the rope until the jumper touches it or makes a mistake.Start out with the rope around the holders' ankles, then move it up to their knees, and then move it up to their waists.

, You can make Chinese jump rope harder by having the holders take one foot out of the rope so that the inner rope area is not as wide. This will make it harder for the jumper to get both feet into the rope., The next jumper should try to repeat the first jumper’s skip pattern. Once everyone has had a turn, move on to a different pattern. Try coming up with longer and more complicated jump patterns as the game goes on!

, If you’d like, pay attention to how high each jumper successfully completes the pattern. For each round, award two points to the highest jumper, one point to the middle jumper, and zero points to the lowest jumper. Tally up the points at the end to see who won!

Choose the right rope.,
Stand up and pick up the rope.,
Step over the rope.,
Use your hands and wrists to swing the rope over your head.,
When the rope is coming toward the front of your feet, hop over it.,
Set a pace that works for you.",How to Jump Rope1," You should find a rope that reaches nearly up to your shoulders when it's folded in half. This will give you enough room to comfortably jump over it, but not so much that you trip over the rope.









The rope should have handles that are easy to grip and shouldn't be too light or too heavy.;
, Hold the rope's handles in each of your hands. Extend your hands and forearms at least a foot away from your body, at a 45 degree angle. This will create a larger arc for you to jump through.








, The rope should hang behind you, so that the middle of the rope hits the back of your feet.








, Don't move your arms -- try to keep the motion limited to your wrists.








, Stand on your tiptoes, and push off with the balls of your feet.









Try to keep the motion in your ankles. Bending your knees to jump will make the exercise a lot harder.

, For beginners, it's best to move the rope slowly, so that you have enough time to take a small hop in between each jump over the rope. Maintain a straight back and keep your gaze set straight ahead as you fall into the correct rhythm. If you watch your feet as you jump, you'll be more likely to get off balance.









As your skill increases, you can swing the rope more quickly and eliminate the middle hop.
As you improve your skills, you can count how long you can go without messing up. A fun way to track your progress is to count how many skips you can do in one stretch, without fumbling.

Reverse the rope.,
Do the ""criss-cross"" trick.,
Do the ""side-swing."",
Combine the tricks.",How to Jump Rope2," When you get better at jumping rope forwards, try going backwards. Start with the rope in front of your feet and throw it over your head to the back. Jump over it before it hits the back of your feet.








, To execute the ""criss-cross"" trick, all you have to do is cross your arms in front of you between each jump. It takes practice to get the timing right, but once you've fallen into a rhythm, you can work on alternating between crossing and not crossing the rope between each jump.








, Fold the rope in half while still holding on to each of the handles. Then, move the rope by crossing your right hand over your left and moving it toward your left hip, and then cross the rope again, so the right hand returns to the right hip. The right hand will essentially be drawing a sideways ""8"" in the air.









The shape made by the jump rope will create an ""X"" shape in the air, or a shape that looks a bit like a squashed bow tie.
Sway your hips to get the momentum of the rope going.
Once you finish making this shape, bring the right hand up and over to create a shape, or a ""rainbow,"" to jump through.
Jump through the shape, make the ""X"" shape again, and keep repeating the process.

, Once you've mastered a few of these tricks, you can combine them together. Try doing the ""cross-cross,"" jumping, and then doing the ""side swing,"" for example.

Choose a longer rope.,
Jump after standing between the turners.,
Run into the turning rope.,
Jump double dutch.",How to Jump Rope3," This rope should be long enough to easily go over the head of the jumper or jumpers while the turners stand a comfortable distance apart.








, Face one of them and place the rope to the right or left of your feet. Have them throw the rope over your head, and jump when it reaches your other side. Get the rhythm of this jumping pattern before moving on.








, It takes some timing, but it can be done. Once you're comfortable running into the rope, you can practice jumping while looking between the turners instead of at them.









One or two other jumpers can join you as you run into the rope, but you should approach the rope one by one. Once one person finds a rhythm, the next person should jump in.

, For double dutch jumping, the two turners have a rope in each hand. The turners should turn one rope, and then turn the other in the opposite direction when the first rope is halfway through its arc.









Once the ropes start moving, you should jump over each rope while still facing the turners. Remember that you'll have to jump twice as fast as you would with one rope, because you'll have to jump over two ropes in each jump cycle.
Double dutch is more challenging and more fun if there is more than one jumper.
You can even sing songs to count how many times the jumpers have jumped. One popular song begins, ""Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish?"" After those words, you can start counting, ""one, two, three..."" to mark how many times the person or people jumping have successfully jumped.

The day is done.",How to Make a Pretend Wolf Pack (Kids)," This could be your backyard. Some people won't have to worry about making a forest; they have a giant backyard!;
, It helps to draw your wolf you're going to be because then you can show people what you look like and how you act. You can be a mean scary wolf that eats people or fights other wolves, or make a lean one that is blind and deaf that needs help when battles happen. The options are great!

, Make sure you have lots of people that have preferably read this article or another wolf article.

, Make sure you have a few pups, a few yearlings and a few adults.

, Real wolf packs are led by the parents, the dominant male and female with no other ranks, there is a misunderstanding that they have ranks. Here is the order from most respected to least respected: Alpha Male and Female, Beta Male and Female, Subordinate Male and Female, and Omega Male and Female.

, While real wolf packs don't fight, it can be fun to have two packs against each other like in a movie. Your fight needs a cause, like the other pack claims the only water in your forest or something like that. The movie ""The Lion King"" gives great examples. Let one of the packs come in first and the other second. It's fun to play pretend if cats are fighting wolves or dogs. If you are left with your best friend fighting, be nice and don't act like you really hate them. Just bump your friend on the elbow and say "" You won."" if you're really nice. After the ""war"" fix people up if they're hurt or have hurt feelings. If someone is bleeding, tell a parent or supervisor. If no one is home, get bandages and clean and wipe the cut.


Have a snack! You're done fighting so why not relax and have a nice snack. You've worked hard and now you deserve to rest. After your snack, when your friends leave, say ""goodbye"" and ""I'm sorry"" if you hurt them or their feelings.

, A single wolf can hunt prey like rabbits, mice, and voles. Before hunting large prey, rally the whole pack together by howling and pretending to wag your tail by waving your arm behind you. Stalk whatever you want to be prey, whether a sibling, a tree, an imaginary creature or your dog, and when the leaders give command chase! When or if the prey is caught, enjoy a nice snack.

, Wolves love pups, and teaching them to hunt of playing with them. Real wolf pups usually eat regurgitated food, or when they are two months or older, small pieces of meat. As your pups grow and learn, they can start hunting small prey for themselves.

, Go to bed and sleep tight. You have been a nice wolf for the day!

ASSAULT OPERATIONS-Assault operations are often linked with an Observation Operation.,
The OP (Observation Post) team- The OP team should be inserted as per an Observation Operation.,
Before the main assault force arrives, the OP team need to do a series of CTRs (Close Target Recces) to establish these.,
The main force -The bulk of the force will infill in a different place to the OP team.,
Seaborne- If your target is particularly close to the sea, consider an amphibious landing.,
River and lake insertion-


Rivers and lakes are easier to insert from than the sea for several reasons:




Usually gets you closer, if not into, the target area
Is less risky in most cases
Less violent weather systems
More shore cover




As before, approach your target in the twilight and hide your boats in a suitable area.,
Execution-


For this example, we will presume that the attacking force is a Detachment of four companies; 3 infantry companies and 1 support company.,
Ambush- This is a useful technique to master, as some of your mission briefs will be to disrupt enemy communications and transport.",How to Plan and Execute Assaults in a Warzone," Remember, you will have some limited intel, satellite photography et cetera... but some aspects may have changed from when the photograph was taken;
, They are to watch the facility/target for several days gathering vital information such as:


Guards: how many, how alert, patrol timings, shift changes etc...
What defences are there? Are there mines, motion sensors, spotlights or otherwise?
Do they have an alarm system, can it be disabled?
What entrances and exits are there to the facility-are they guarded?
How nearby is the enemy QRF (Quick reaction Force)? How long would it take them to get there?

, The OP team should also build a model of the facility in a hidden area to aid the commander to create a plan of attack.

, Whilst a standard vehicle DOP (Drop Off Point) is valid, the larger force will draw attention to itself if it all de-busses at the same place in this manner. Therefore it is recommended that the force infills in a different way. Here are some options open to you:

, The only safe method for this is to hire a motorised boat from the nearest harbor and take it about 5 miles (8.0 km) out to sea to reduce noise-do this about 2-3 hours before sunset. Make sure you are roughly parallel with the landing beach. Start your advance towards the shore about 30 minutes before sunset and moor the boat a little way out from the shore. Two members from each boat crew should use wetsuits to swim ashore and check the landing beach is clear. They should use a torch to signal to the rest of the boats that the shoreline is clear. The boats should make their way to shore quietly at low throttle. Remember: when the water starts getting shallow, pull the motor screw into the boat. When the boat is in shallow water, all crew members should leap out and drag it ashore. With two people covering each team, the rest of the crew should lift the boat into the nearest cover higher than the high tide line. If possible, hide the boats under an overhang at the top of the beach or in dunes. When done, flip the boats over and cover with a suitable camouflage sheet.


Once all the team members are changed into their DPMs, collect your bags and tab to the RV point, where someone from the OP team will meet you.
A similar technique can be used for river raiding or assaults across lakes. With narrower channels of water, go across right before dark.

,
Climbing
This is useful in mountainous country where the hills are bare with little cover. Instead of walking up a hill, insertion directly into a facility can be accomplished with this method.
Often, where steep cliffs meet the boundary of a facility, the area is left unguarded and offers a safe way in.
Climbing can also be used when infilling off a beach, the surrounding cliffs offer cover whilst the climbers secure a way to the top. The rest of the force can follow. An extra support company should camp at the cliff top (or other LZ(Landing Zone)) to support the rest of the unit as they retreat.

, For assaults of this type, the companies will have been put together for the mission, unless you are part of a Special Forces Regiment (Greens and Royals or Victor Force). More clandestine assaults are carried out by SDSSOE (Street Defence Service-Special Operations Executive) operatives, secretly and quietly lifting a target as opposed to all-out warfare.The bulk force will tab to the dead ground behind the OP (forest is more than ideal) where the OP team commander will give a briefing about troop strengths etc... and will demonstrate weak and strong points on the model he has built of the base (an OP commander will bring a box of certain materials such as ribbon, chalk etc... to assist him in model making). He will then hand over to the Detachment Commander who will give the plan of battle. The attack should go down at sunrise-about 0430-0500 hours when the enemy will be at lowest guard. The assault usually, this involves the support company hiding at the edge of the forest and either raining down shells on strategic targets or providing covering fire. The assault groups should attack at weak points, but if you are attempting to lift a human target-a war criminal for example-you must attack at the place in the perimeter that is closest to their location.
You should divide your force into several groups: one to hit the main target, another to take out secondary targets and the facilities the enemy may have to follow you up, i.e.; vehicles, artillery etc.... Also causing a large fire with the fuel or ammunition dumps will most likely keep the enemy off your tail when retreating-but only start the fires when you are about to retreat.
The third unit should keep as much of the garrison occupied as possible whilst the other two deal with targets. The OP team should keep in contact with all other units during the assault so as to direct support and give warning of approaching enemy units. If the enemy has a local QRF, part of the support company should be ready to stop them on the approach road.
So long as each group knows where the others are operating, there is little chance of a blue-on-blue situation. If a group is moving into a different area to the planned one, the commander of that group must make sure the other commanders know so they can make sure their men will watch their fire.
If the target is a hostage, see instructions on how to treat a hostage in a combat situation on page (...n/a). When the Detachment Commander feels that all objectives have been completed to satisfaction, he will order the retreat. As they pull back, the support company should hit buildings and fuel and ammunition dumps.
Once all the assault companies are back at the OP, all units will fall back to the LZ (Where the main force infilled), the support company should lead, with the rest of the infantry companies taking turns to guard the rear. While the assault and support teams are pulling back the support team at the LZ give covering fire for them. Forward spotters pick out targets, enemy infantry etc... for the support company to pin down.
The first companies back should get the boats/vehicles or exfil transport ready. When all the companies are at the LZ, including the OP team, each group should get into their boats or transport and go. The last company to leave should be an infantry company, who can provide their own covering fire. Then retreat back to the harbour/port/extraction point where you either dispose of your boats or take them with you.

, At other times, it allows you to lift a hostage without having to fight through a well-defended residency.


The basic requirements for ambush are these: Covert LUP, detailed recce and lightning-fast action.
Explanation: Covert LUP (Lay Up Point), you must set up camp a reasonable distance from the ambush site so you can observe patterns (if any) of enemy movements. A detailed recce is required of the immediate area around the ambush point; make sure this is done two nights before the ambush. Scouts must recognize commanding fields of fire, physical cover, aural cover, escape routes and entry routes. Here are 6 points for an ideal location:




Set the ambush in a site you can move in and out of unobserved
Use a night ambush only if you can complete the objective with a short, intensive burst of fire
Choose a site where the enemy will be forced to bunch up
If enemy re-enforcements can reach the scene quickly (and you have enough units) it might be a good idea to set up a secondary ambush to tackle those coming to the scene
There should be wide fields of fire but plenty of cover




Escape routes must allow all the units to join together for the escape
Lightning-fast action is necessary so that any survivors will be too dazed to react when you make your escape, ensure that when the shooting has stopped, you rapidly disengage the target and leave the immediate area quickly as ‘revenge patrols’ will be chasing you down.

Learn the zones of attack.,
Learn the basic parry for each zone.,
Know that the basic attack for each zone is at right angles to the basic parry.,
Always move forwards.,
Try to link your attacks together fluidly.,
Learn the disarming strike and the Sarlacc sweep.,
Use Shii-Cho against multiple enemies.,
Practise.",How to Learn the Basics of Shii‐Cho," There are six zones of attack used to describe the moves in lightsaber combat. These are:

Zone 1 - the head
Zones 2 and 3 - the right and left arms and sides, respectively. Also refers to the right and left sides of the front torso.
Zone 4 - the torso, specifically the back.
Zones 5 and 6 - the right and left legs, respectively.;
,

Zone 1 - a horizontal parry, in front of or above the head.
Zones 2 and 3 - a vertical parry, with the lightsaber handle held near the chest or waist, and the blade pointing upwards. Less commonly, a drop parry (blade points downwards) with the handle held near the head.
Zone 4 - a drop parry with the handle held behind the head.
Zones 5 and 6 - a drop parry with the handle held near the waist.

, So a zone 1 attack is a (usually downwards) vertical stroke and other attacks are horizontal sweeps. Note that decapitation is classed as a zone 2/3 attack., Don't retreat. Keep pressing forwards and cutting off your opponent., Shii-Cho has great potential for improvisation, as it is very simple. This makes it random and unpredictable, making it harder for your enemies to predict your actions. Mainly, though, it consists of broad sweeps linked together., In keeping with Jedi philosophy, the disarming strike attempts to disarm the opponent instead of killing them. It consists of a strong attack at your opponents weapon, in an attempt to rip it from their grasp - or chop it in half. The Sarlacc sweep is a rapid, sweeping movement designed to hit as many enemies as possible., Because of it's broad, sweeping movements, Shii-Cho is suitable for use against multiple opponents. However, a single opponent can easily find and exploit flaws in your attacks. In addition, the second lightsaber form, Makashi, was specifically designed for lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat. Do not use Shii-Cho against a Makashi user., Practise as much as you can. Then practise some more. You can never practise too much."

Master the basics.,
Get on the team.,
Invest in a rifle.,
Practice.,
Increase your vocabulary.",How to Get Good at Armed Exhibition," Ask team members to teach you how to do the most basic moves and focus on perfecting those. Master the Manual of Arms from your service's drill and ceremonies manual and then, begin to incorporate some basic exhibition movement. As you master basic movement, add more and more of moderate to advanced moves.;
, If there are tryouts, prepare in whatever ways you feel is right to get ready. Meet the team commander ahead of time to try to see if he/she will reveal to you what moves you may need to know for tryouts.

, If you are sure Armed Exhibition is something you want to get into, invest in a rifle. Try the Daisy Drill Rifle (a 1903 replica) or the Glendale Drill America (an M1 Garand replica) depending on what rifle your team uses. If you don’t have the means to purchase a rifle, practice at school as often as you can.

, Once you have a rifle of your own, start spinning for 30 minutes outside and increase your time as your strength and stamina allow. Try to work up to completing at least one hour per day. Do all the moves you know how to do until you can do them without even thinking about it.

, The next step is to move on to more moves. Do not be afraid to step forward and ask others how to perform moves. Attempting to learn the move on your own may result in a spin that looks very similar but is not identical. Work on increasing your vocabulary of moves. YouTube is an excellent place to see Drillers either creating moves or performing. Pay attention to the way professionals spin. You will notice that many Drillers have their own style. Practice can only benefit you.

Create a detailed fictional universe.",How to LARP," The first step of planning any LARP session is to decide what sort of scenario you'll play. In popular culture, LARP games are often associated with settings and characters from the fantasy genre of art and literature and works like the Lord of the Rings novels. Though many LARP games stick to these conventions, many do not. Realistic settings and storylines, such as those set in the modern age or based on history, are possible, as are science fiction and alternate-world scenarios. Be as imaginative as you'd like — your LARP game is the product of your own imagination, so there's literally no limit to the types of scenarios you can design.


For example, let's say that, for our first LARP game, we want to attempt a classic middle ages/fantasy scenario. If we're feeling uninspired, we might chose characters and settings from a familiar fantasy universe (like those portrayed in the Lord of the Rings or A Song of Ice and Fire novels). However, we can also create our own — let's be adventurous and do this instead! In our scenario, we'll be brave warriors from the kingdom of Karyphesh. For our purposes, let's say this is a vast fantasy kingdom that contains a variety of different sub-regions. This way, we'll be able to visit a variety of different settings!
Let's be honest — if you're making up your own scenario for the very first time, there's a decent chance it will end up being cheesy or hackneyed (like the one above). This is OK! LARPing is basically playing pretend for grownups, so a healthy measure of good humor is advised when playing. With time, your stories and scenarios will become more nuanced.;
, LARPing can be whatever you want it to be. There's no rule that says you have to have a conflict in your LARP game. If you really want to, you can LARP a completely uneventful, normal day in the life of the world you've created. But why do this when you can have so much more fun with an exciting conflict? Giving your fictional setting a conflict is a great way to make your LARP instantly engaging and to give everyone something to do. Make a conflict that fits the fictional world you've created, but be creative! Feel free to add as many minor details and wrinkles to your conception of the central conflict as you desire.


Because much (though certainly not all) LARPing involves fictional combat, wars or clashes between two or more fictional nations or entities are always a good bet. These can be normal wars between humans or can have supernatural aspects — it's all up to you. Regardless of what you choose, try to make your fictional conflict engaging and urgent.
In our example, let's say that mysterious demons have begun to terrorize the outer reaches of the kingdom of Karyphesh. As it stands, this is a pretty cliched plot line, so let's spice things up by saying that these so-called demons have been causing entire villages to disappear, leaving only giant symbols in an ancient tongue burnt into the ground in their place. As the story unfolds, we may find that the so-called demons are actually sent by a benevolent deity to protect the kingdom from the true villain — the king of Karyphesh, who wants to convert his subjects into mindless slaves. Remember that everything is up to you and that the conflict in your world can unfold however you want it to.

, Much of the fun of LARPing lies in the fact that it allows you to be someone (or something) you are not. No one is a valiant knight or a space marine in real life, but LARPers enjoy pretending to be these types of people and acting the way they imagine they would act if they were real — in a word, roleplaying. Based on the setting you've chosen, design a character who fits into your fictional world. Consider both his or her physical appearance and his or her personality traits. Ask yourself the following questions:


What sort of being is my character? Is s/he a human or non-human?
What is his or her name?
What does s/he look like?
What does s/he do for a living? Anything is possible here, though, since many LARPs focus on fantasy combat, you may want to choose a profession that would logically confer some martial skill (soldier, knight, pirate, assassin, thief, etc.)
What does s/he act like? Is s/he kind or cruel? Guarded or outgoing? Fierce or cowardly?
What sort of knowledge or training does s/he have? Does s/he know multiple languages? Know a craft? Have an education?
What quirks does s/he have? Does s/he have any bad habits? Fears? Odd talents?
In our example, let's say that our character is Melchior, a royal knight from the capital of Karyphesh. He is big, tall, strong, tan-skinned, and has short black hair. He usually wears steel armor and carries a massive broadsword. However, when he's not defending the kingdom, he's a total sweetheart and runs a kitten orphanage as a side job. What a hunk!

, How does your character fit into the world you've created? What happened in his or her past? Why does s/he do the things s/he does? These are all things you'll want to consider as you complete your character. Giving your character a backstory isn't just for ""flavor"". On the contrary, it's actually a way to give your character a compelling motivation for getting involved in your LARP game's conflict. A logical backstory can also help guide your decisions as to how your character might participate in the conflict based on past experiences.


In our example, let's say that Melchior has a troubled past. At the age of 5, his parents were killed by bandits and he was left by the side of the road to die. However, he was saved by a band of feral cats and raised for two years until he was old enough to strike out on his own. After years of poverty, he eventually won the favor of a wealthy lord and trained as his squire until becoming a full-fledged knight. Because of his experiences, Melchior has an undying compassion for cats but sometimes finds it to connect to other people, who he often sees as cruel and unloving. However, he is incredibly loyal to the lord who pulled him out of the gutter and plans to fight for his honor in the coming war against the demons, who have killed one of his lord's sons.

, Again, there's no rule that says you can't LARP by yourself, but it's usually more fun to interact (and do battle) with others, so try gathering a group of willing friends to LARP with you if you can. Since your friends will be joining you in your fictional world, each should design his or her own character (complete with backstory) so that each person is able to experience the world through the eyes of an active participant in it. If you're looking to have fighting and combat as part of your LARP session, you may want to have some of your friends be characters that are opposed to your own (such as soldier for an opposing faction) unless you're willing to fight imaginary enemies as a group.


In our example, let's say that we're able to get five other people to LARP with us for a total of six players. To make it an even battle, we'll split up into groups of three. The two other players on your team might design characters who are allies of Melchior (for instance, other knights, mages, or soldiers fighting for the greater good), while the three you're fighting against might design characters that would logically want to fight you (for instance, the demons attacking our fictional kingdom).

, If you and your friends have decided to run around pretending to be knights and wizards, you may as well look the part. When it comes to costumes and gear, your options can be as simple or elaborate as you please. The most casual LARPers use their ordinary clothes and weapons made from foam, wood, or PVC piping, while serious LARP enthusiasts are known to spend thousands of dollars on lavish, period-accurate costumes and real (or real-looking) weapons. Generally, most first-timers will want to stick to cheap, casual options, but it's up to you and your fellow LARPers to decide how far you want to go.


In our example, Melchior is a knight, so we'll probably want to find him a sword and armor at the very least. If we're looking to stay thrifty, we might want to use a broom handle or a yardstick as our sword. To represent our armor, we might make a breastplate out of a thin piece of foam or simply use an old shirt painted grey. If we wanted to go one step further, we could make a shield from a trash can lid or a circular piece of plywood and use a bike helmet to imitate a metal helm.
Some LARPers also like to replicate consumable items with actual food and drink. For instance, if Melchior carries around a magical potion in case he's injured in battle, we might want imitate this with a small flask filled with a sports drink.

, When you've designed a fictional world, a conflict in that world, and all of the characters who are participating in your LARP session, you're more or less ready to play! All that remains is to imagine a reason for your characters to meet and interact. Ask yourself, ""what do I want to do during my LARP session?"" If, for instance, you want to have an exciting battle, you might want to invent a set of circumstances that would cause your characters to meet and engage in hostilities. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more cerebral, you might envision a more open-ended scenario, such as one where the two groups of people involved are not mortal enemies or are matched in a battle of wits, rather than a literal battle.


In our example, let's say that Melchior and his two companions are on a mission to scout the area for demons when they run into three such demons. Melchior is immediately shocked — the leader of the demon band is the very one who killed his lord's son. The ensuing fight practically writes itself!

, At this point, virtually every part of your LARP game is set up for success. The rest is up to you. Dive into your fictional world with no hesitation. The sooner you get into character and start thinking and acting like your fictional counterpart, the sooner you can start enjoying your LARP experience. Keep an open mind, stay respectful of our fellow LARPers, and be open to letting them influence your role-playing experience. Most importantly, have fun. If don't enjoy your LARP session, why go through the bother of having one in the first place?

, LARP games can be serious, grim affairs or casual adventures with a group of friends, but regardless of the specifics of your LARP game, it's almost always better to have players who are committed to their roles than those who aren't. LARPing games are essentially continuous amateur acting sessions. While different players may have different levels of acting ability, LARP experiences are usually the most engaging when everyone tries to take the acting portion of the game seriously.


Understandably, first-timers can be shy about the prospect of running around in foam armor pretending to fight monsters in the presence of other people. To ""break the ice"", you may want to try doing a few basic acting exerciseswith your fellow players until everyone is feeling a little more open. For instance, try the classic ""Question Scene"" exercise — have one player ask another a question to which the second player must respond with their own logical follow-up question. The players keep asking each other questions at a faster and faster pace until one hesitates or fails to ask a question, at which point s/he is replaced by another player and the scene starts over.

, When you want to LARP, you typically have two choices — making your own game or joining another person's. If you choose the former, you'll be responsible for organizing and planning the game, but you'll have total freedom to do exactly what you want. If, on the other hand, you join an established game, you won't have to worry about as much, but you may have to abandon your preferred characters, scenarios, and/or rule set if your game's organizer feels strongly about these aspects of his or her game.


Your geographical location can actually have an effect on the ease of creating or joining a LARP game. Certain locations, like large population centers, may have an active LARP community that organizes lots of local games, while more sparsely-populated areas may not have a LARP community, which means you may be forced to make your own game even if you'd rather start by joining someone else's. If this happens to you, try to look on the bright side — if your LARP game is really good, you may be able to plant the seed for the beginnings of your area's very first LARP community.
One way to find other people's LARP games is through online LARP resources. For instance, the website Larping.org has a LARP-finding utility which allows for you to search for LARPing activities near your address.Another useful tool is larp.meetup.com, which has information on LARP groups worldwide.

, LARPing is a game based on the players' physical, bodily actions. By physically acting out your character's actions while in-character, you make the experience more real than if you were just to say, for instance, ""I swing my sword at you"". However, to get into the physical aspect of your LARPing, you'll first need a place to play. This can be almost anywhere, though, if you can, you may want to choose places that resemble the fictional setting of your scenario for added realism. For instance, if your adventure takes place in a forest, try finding a forest clearing in a local nature preserve to LARP in.


Though every LARPing session is different, much of the fun of a typical LARP game is in the combat aspect of the game. This can involve running and jumping, swinging, throwing and shooting (fake) weapons, and other athletic activities. Thus, you'll want to choose a site for your LARP game where you'll have the space to safely do these things. Fields, parks, and athletic spaces (gyms, soccer courts, etc.) are all great locations to use (though if there are other people at these places, first-timers may get embarrassed).

, If you've played role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, you may already be familiar with the concept of a DM (Dungeon Master) or GM (Game Master). In the context of LARPing, GMs are participants in the game who don't pretend to be fictional characters. Instead, they stay ""out of character"" and ensure the game stays engaging and fun by staging conflicts, facilitating the gameplay of the other players, and, in some cases, controlling the story of the LARP game. For large games, GMs may be the people who run and organize the event (though this is not necessarily so). In these cases, GMs may additionally be in charge of planning and promoting the event itself.


Compared to GMs and DMs of tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, GMs in LARP scenarios generally have a looser, more supportive role. While tabletop GMs have a great deal of control over the types of characters and situations the other players may encounter, LARP GMs can't control the actions of real people as effectively and thus often opt to facilitate fun adventures, rather than dictate them exactly.

, The rules of player interaction and combat for LARP games can be as diverse as the games' settings and storylines themselves. On one end of the spectrum, some LARP games have no rules other than staying in character. In other words, it's up to the players to decide many aspects of the game on-the-fly. For instance, during combat, if one player is injured by another, it's essentially up to him or her to decide how much so and whether or not his injury will affect his or her fighting skill. On the other of the spectrum, some LARP games have extensive rule systems that account for every possible scenario. In these cases, players may, for instance, have a set amount of ""life"" that is drawn from every time they are injured in battle, meaning that they are definitively wounded or dead after being hit a certain number of times.


If you're organizing your own game, it's up to you to determine how extensive you want the rules to be. However, because LARPing is a group activity by its nature, you'll definitely want to consult with your fellow players before making a decision.
Note that many online LARPing resources offer pre-made rule sets for players looking to jump right into the game. For instance, Larping.org hosts LARPing-related blog posts, some of which contain the authors' preferred rules., Depending on the dedication of everyone involved, LARP games can be serious undertakings. If you're organizing your own LARP game, you'll want to ensure that you have the best game possible by taking the time to solve logistical issues before the game itself. For instance, if people are traveling to your LARP game from far away, you may want to send directions to everyone a few days beforehand, and if you plan on relaxing with the other players after the game, you may want to make reservations at a local restaurant ahead of time. Ask yourself the following questions as you plan your LARP event:


Can all of the players easily make it to the event? If not, are carpools or public transit options available?
Will there be an offsite meeting place or will all players meet at the site of the event?
Will there be food and drink for players at the event?
Will there be any after-LARP events?
What is the plan if there is inclement weather?

, If you've enjoyed your first few LARP games and you'd like to continue participating in them, you may want to consider starting a dedicated LARP group or club for your local area. On the most basic level, forming a LARP group means that you'll be able to schedule the games that you and your friends want, when you want them. More importantly, however, it also means that you'll be able to meet new people who are also interested in LARPing who can in turn influence your LARP activities with their own characters and ideas.


This is an especially good idea if your area doesn't already have an established LARP community. Be the first person in your area to start a LARP club and, with luck, you may be able to watch your LARP community grow more than you thought possible!
If you're forming your own LARP group, you'll want to promote it to ensure that you get the best turnout possible. While classified sites like Craigslist, etc. offer one possibility for online promotion, you may also want to try posting your group's information to online LARPing sites which welcome community submissions like Larping.org.

, The biggest LARP groups with the most members occasionally host enormous LARP games which can have hundreds of participants (or more) and last for days at a time. For a truly unique LARP experience, try participating in one of these massive LARP sessions. Because of the scope of the game, you'll be able to experience scenarios and character interactions that aren't really possible in smaller LARP games. For instance, while an ordinary LARP game between a dozen or so friends might give you the opportunity to experience fantasy combat on a small scale, a LARP game with hundreds of players allows you to become a soldier in a huge battle teeming with opposing forces. For some, participating in one of these large-scale meetups represents the pinnacle of the LARPing experience.


To find one of these massive LARP events, which aren't necessarily everyday occurrences even among dedicated LARPers, you'll want to become an active member in the worldwide LARP community. The aforementioned Larping.org is a great place to start, as are nerolarp.com, larpalliance.net, and other regional sites.

, If you've become an experienced LARPer and are looking for an additional challenge, try designing your own rule set for LARP play. While this can be satisfying as a creative endeavor, it's also a chance to correct any unfair or annoying aspects of the rules that you've been using thus far. If you're unsure of where to start, try looking up other LARPers' self-created rule sets online (on Larping.org or similar LARPing websites as well as role-playing resources like rpg.net) and working from there.


Once you've created a ""draft"" of your rule set, try playing a game or two with your new rules. You may find that they don't work exactly as anticipated — this is OK! Use your experience to help you revise your rules as needed.

, LARPing allows you to indulge your imagination and explore your creative capabilities to the extent that you please. If you're looking for ways to express yourself creatively beyond planning typical LARP sessions, try expanding the fictional worlds you've created, adding detail and individual flourishes to your characters, and creating fictional histories and mythologies. You can go as deep as you please here — some LARPers may be content leaving some aspects of their fictional creations up to the imagination, while others may want to account for even the smallest details. Your world is yours to create and explore. Enjoy your journey!


Extremely detailed fictional worlds can serve as great fodder for fiction writing. In fact, it's not completely unheard of for novels exploring both in-character and out-of-character LARPing universes to experience popularity and success.If you've given the time and effort to creating an amazing fictional universe, consider writing about it. You may be the next J. K. Rowling!

Do not keep on the move when acting as a sniper.,
Make sure when fighting on the front-line to hide behind thick cover and lie prone when shooting so as to give accuracy, balance and again camouflage.

Trust your team, but make sure you gave them a reason to trust you.,
Try to be on your feet at all times.,When moving through light (only do this if being chased or completely necessary) do the nose test (see below) to find out if they can see you

,Stay down and don't move but if needed very slow

, Usually people will look around - not up or down.

,, Running will likely make a ton of noise.

,, Don't allow them to sneak up on you!

, If a comrade is caught attempt to distract the opposition by throwing small objects in the other direction.

, Find a place with good natural cover and camouflage. If possible, conceal yourself with personal camo such as a gillie suit and remain prone or on hands and knees at almost all times.


Inch along when prone like a worm to avoid anyone seeing movement. This movement creates rustling so be warned, but it is the least visible of all. It is called the Sniper's low crawl. Also don't forget to camouflage your weapon or keep it in an Alice bag, which must also be camouflaged. Never use too much camo as it can give you away rather than hide you.

,,, Be kind and share in camaraderie to avoid in-team conflict and possible deception.

, It's convenient and does not make much noise when moving, as long as you remain crouched to at least the middle of your possible crouch height. Always maintain a low silhouette.

Choose an appropriate setting and time.,
Maintain open lines of communication.,
Divide the discussion into thirds.,
Be respectful.,
Remove certain words from your fighting vocabulary.,
Keep the discussion to the topic at hand.,
Take responsibility for your part in the disagreement.,
Remain calm and do not engage in physical violence or threats.,
Forgive your partner and yourself.,
Engage a mediator or seek professional counseling.",How to Fight Fair1," Have the discussion in a neutral location, such as the living room or the kitchen. Avoid the bedroom or ones' office. Have the discussion in private without other people involved such as friends, children or parents. Avoid distractions like computers and phones, so you can each turn your attention towards the conversation at hand. Have the discussion at a time when both partners are rested and not distracted. Don’t worry about the adage, “Never go to bed angry.” It is usually better for both partners to be able to rest, calm down, and gain some perspective on the disagreement.Take breaks when necessary. Fighting, even when done fairly, is exhausting, and you will both have more productive conversations when you can clear your head. Even taking five minutes apart can make a difference.;
, Don’t let little things build up into big things. If you are angry about something, tell your partner about it. Keep talking through problems. If you stop talking and give your partner the silent treatment, nothing is going to get resolved.

, Spend one-third of the time talking about your own perspective, one-third of the time listening closely and intimately (holding hands or otherwise touching each other) to your partner, and one-third mutually engaging in the dialogue at hand., Do not engage in name-calling. Even terms of endearment can be hurtful if they are used heatedly. Don’t tell your partner how they feel or how they should act or respond. Be respectful of their feelings and do not project your own feelings on them.

, Don’t use words like “always” and “never.” An example is, “You always do this,” or “You never do that.” These words are exaggerations and only serve to alienate your partner. Also, do not use the word “but,” as in, “I understand what you’re feeling, but…?”

, Do not bring up past grievances. Keep the conversation rooted in the immediate issue, so that you can address that first.

, Admitting when you are at fault can be a huge step in reaching compromise or resolution. Your honesty will help your partner trust you more.

, You should not threaten or physically hurt your partner or their belongings. If your anger feels like it’s starting to boil over, take a break, get some fresh air, and return to the conversation when you've calmed down.

, No human is infallible, yourself included. Your partner might make mistakes, but if you are willing to work on your problems together and having calm discussions together, you should work towards forgiveness.

, If the discussion is not productive and continues to be hurtful and unresolved, you may need to bring in an objective third party. A professionally trained mediator or counselor is preferable over a family member or close friend, who may bring their own perspective to the problem and complicate the matter further.

Create a character.,
Choose a Clan to join or the Andulan Kingdoms.,
Invite friends to RP with you.,
Focus on a usual Clan horse's behaviors.,
Leaders/deputies: Get a binder in which to store bios of your Clan mates, territory maps, important info, peace treaty signatures of other leaders, ranking lists, and other information.

,
Get your Clan noticed!,
Have fun LARPing and experimenting with your character!",How to Act Like a Horse When LARPing," This is fun, figuring you can do about anything to your horse. They can be a pegasus, unicorn, dragon/horse hybrid, demon, wolf/horse hybrid, etc.


You will need to fill in the following information: Name, rank, gender, species, appearance, mate/crush etc. Experiment a bit. Think outside of the box, trying something different than your usual character preferences.
Your horse's name must be a double name (two names combined). Leader's names should end with 'tail', apprentice's names should end with 'hoof', foal's names should end with 'foal' and Pegasus names must end with 'wing'.;
,


Some major Clans are RiverClan, FireClan, DragonClan, CoyoteClan, StarryClan, MossClan, IvyClan, PolarClan, FeatherClan, Clan of the Hawthorn Bush, Clan of Whispering Willows, and finally, the Rouges of Cascaded Darkness.
You could make your own but you need at least four members to do so.

, Alternatively, go to warruorcatsrpg.com and go to 'Horses' and search Clan of the River RP thread. If you are LARPing you will need: a territory that stretches for at least half a mile in all directions; a main camp complete with leader, scouts, warriors, hunters, herbal horse, fading hooves (elders), apprentice dens, prey, a nursery, other people to RP with, and anything else your little growing clan needs. Try to get other friends to start their own clans with which you can battle, raid or assist.

, They believe in MoonClan, which is like heaven to them. They are noble, strong horses and have different personalities and traits depending on their Clan. Be loyal, steer clear from No-tails, any clans your Clan is enemies/alliances with, treat them the way they should be. Also, if you are in Clan of the river, don't make your horse deathly afraid of fish or water. Stick to your Clan's skills, abilities, and traits.

,, Maybe put flyers in the park, near stores, in school and other places, if you are not embarrassed by the idea of other people thinking it is stupid.


Start turning down requests to join. Show people around the camp and let them see the info pages about your clan before they join to see if they like it. If you aren't sure about accepting them, have them do a sample role play with another member or yourself.
Deputies can also decline and accept members, take the clan on patrols, organize meetings with LARPers, and take charge if you can't come to meetings. You should pick two deputies, even three, just to be safe.

, You can also claim part of the school playground as your territory.

Know how to use water balloons.,
Know how to shield yourself.",How to Be a Water Fight War Lord," You have a choice here, you can choose a large weapon and run slow, or a little weapon and run fast. It's usually easier (and more fun) to choose a large weapon, as this will give you more ammunition, range, and power in your shooting. A good large weapon is the Water Warriors Orca.


Weapons can be more than water guns. For example: Water hose, sponges, water balloons, water drenched rags, etc.;
, No matter what size your primary weapon is, have a backup, just in case. The easiest backup is just an inexpensive water pistol that can fit in your pocket.

, If you chose to have a small weapon, you can omit this step. However, the extra ammunition can change the tide of a battle. To carry extra ammo, simply carry two water bottles full of water. Use water bottles with squirt tops to speed up the refilling.

, If you have access to the battlefield beforehand, hide ammo in places where only you'll be able to find it. Try hiding 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottles full of water in bushes, underground, in trees, or wherever else you can hide them. Don't let the enemy know where they are.

, Try to wear colors that can blend in with your surroundings as much as possible. If you are fighting at night, where a dark, dark blue. If you chose to use a large weapon, try to wear ""cargo"" pants so that you can carry your extra ammo in the ""cargo"" pockets and backup gun in the pockets.

, Raincoats can provide good protection but are sometimes too heavy. A light windbreaker is better.

, Water comes off of skin easily, so opt for going shirtless or wearing a swimsuit.

, If you have access to the battlefield beforehand, look around it. Remember where any good hiding spots are and where your ammo is hidden. Look for good sniping spots, easy-to-climb trees, etc. If you have time, you can even draw and label a map, and share it with your teammates.

, Before the battle, get to know your gun. Know how far it shoots, if it has more than one nozzle, how much water it holds, how many pumps it takes, etc. Practice angled shots to learn how far up to angle your blaster to range your opponents at a given distance. Practice shooting targets. You can use stood up paper plates, styrofoam cups, people, etc. as targets.

, Now that you know your primary gun, you need to know your backup gun. Know everything about it. Practice switching from your primary to your secondary gun while running. If your primary has a neck strap, just let go of it and pull out your secondary. Remember to do it while running. Again, practice shooting targets with this.

, You should use your backup gun when you are reloading or pumping your primary gun, you ran out of ammo for your primary gun, or you dropped, lost, or gave your primary gun to a teammate.

, You should only reload or pump when you are hidden or guarded by team mates. It is not safe to do it out in the open. If you are running away and need to pump before you can shoot again, just use your backup.

, If your opponent has a good chance of dodging your shot, don't waste the time and ammo on a full shot. Instead, use brief tap shots. You can recover more quickly from this using just one or two pumps, and you can be ready to shoot again faster.


Re-pump after every shot. Most pressurized blasters only need 1 or 2 pumps after a quick tap shot but if you let it run out of pressure it can take 20 or more pumps making you an easy target.
Shoot your enemies when they're weakest. Sneak up on them when they're refueling or pumping and won't be able to retaliate.

, Sniping isn't always shooting from far away, it is just shooting from a concealed location. A good tactic if you have a big gun is to hide in a bush or tree and wait for someone to pass. When they do, just shoot them with your biggest nozzle and run away fast.


Choose your hiding places carefully when sniping. While shooting from high up in a tree can give you a great view of everyone else, it also makes it harder to escape. Plan your escape route when choosing a hiding spot.

, Work together to come up with a battle plan. For example, have the person with the longest-range gun take out opponents while the rest of the team ambushes.


Choose people who are easy to work with and enjoy victory (preferably friends).

, Water balloons should usually only be used as a last resort. They are too hard to transport, and they sometimes don't break on impact. However, if you are hidden in a tree, you can throw them across the battlefield (with a slingshot if you can't throw very well) at a formation of enemies, taking out multiple people with one shot.

, Hide behind anything you can. Try to let only your nozzle and eye (covered in eyewear) be visible to others. If you are being shot at, you can use your gun as a shield.

Decide the boundaries of the game.,
Choose bases.,
Choose teams.,
Place a cloth of each teams color at every base.

,
To capture a base, switch the cloth that is in the commanding spot with your team's cloth.",How to Play Base Command,";
, These can be anything from a slide to a car to a building.


Each base gets its own territory. This is usually a mid-sized area surrounding the base.

,


Each team is assigned a color.
Each team is assigned a starting base.

Teams can use whatever strategies they want to capture and defend bases.
There is no ""Puppy Guarding"" or ""Baby Sitting"" cloths or imprisoned players.



,,


Cloths can not be hidden, thrown away, or stolen.
When a base is controlled by a team, any enemies in that team's territory can be tagged and brought to that bases prison.
To tag someone, grab them and yell ""1,2,3 Tag!""
To free someone from jail, tag them and yell ""1,2,3 Free!""
When a team is in control of no bases, they have 1 minute to capture one or be kicked from the game.
The game is over when a team controls all bases for 1 minute. This team wins.
In the beginning of the game, players can set a time limit. If the game is not over when the time is up, the team with the most bases wins. This is optional.

Choose an appropriate setting.,
Establish ground rules.,
Find common ground.,
Acknowledge and validate emotion.,
Listen closely to all viewpoints.,
Have time-outs if necessary.,
Engage a mediator.",How to Fight Fair2," Have the discussion in private without unwanted or uninvolved participants. Avoid distractions like computers and phones, so you can each turn your attention towards the conversation at hand. Have the discussion at a mutually convenient time, so each participant can reflect on what they’d like to discuss prior to the meeting.

, Making a conscious decision among all involved participants to abide by a set of ground rules will ensure a productive conversation to resolve conflict or advocate for a certain perspective. Ground rules might include:


Maintain professionalism in manner and language.
Stay on topic.
Do not threaten other participants.
Do not attack other participants on a personal level.

, Determine the points that you can agree on before launching into fights about what you don’t agree on. This will enable a clearer route to resolution because you recognize that there is something positive to build upon.

, While workplaces often do not appreciate the emotional investment associated with certain projects or other aspects of one’s professional life, it is important to acknowledge the existence of that emotion. Demonstrate respect to your colleagues (or manager or subordinate) that you understand they have an emotional investment in their work. This will also serve to move the conversation back to solid ground.

, Allow your opponent to express their perspective fully. Wait a few seconds before responding so that you fully understand what they’re saying.

, Unproductive, combative conversations in which the same points are argued over and over should be set aside for a day or two before resuming discussions.

, If it seems like the conversation is degenerating into unproductive, unfair fighting, it may be necessary to bring in a third party to keep the dialogue on track."

Choose an appropriate setting.,
Don’t bully your opponent into fighting with you.,
Examine your motives.,
Establish ground rules.,
Enter into the fight with self-confidence.,
Treat your opponent with respect.,
Do not use weapons or other objects to fight if your opponent does not have these objects as well.,
Allow opponent to get back onto their feet if they are knocked down.,
Fight the fight on your own.",How to Fight Fair3," Choose a location that is semi-private and is somewhere neutral. Refrain from choosing locations where there might be other people (especially children) who do not want to see fighting. Schedule the fight at a time that works for both opponents.


If you are playing in a team sport, choose an appropriate time to fight during the match. If your teammates are depending on you to help win, they will not appreciate it if you derail the match with unnecessary fighting.
Do not expect sportsmanship in a fight that is not planned. You might go into a fight expecting it to be fair, but if you are surprising your opponent, that person may not fight fair. Similarly, if your opponent has surprised you, they are not fighting fair from the start, and may not use tactics that are on the up-and-up.

, If they do not want to fight and are willing to resolve the conflict in another way, give them a chance to do so. Forcing someone to fight with you is not a fair way to fight. Both parties must be willing participants.

, Understand why you want to fight. Are you working on your combat skills? Did the other person insult you? What are you trying to prove with your fight? Taking some time to understand your motives might also diffuse your need to fight.

, Making a conscious decision among all involved participants to abide by a set of ground rules will ensure that no one will use dirty tricks to win a fight. If you are fighting to build your skills, ground rules will also ensure that no one gets seriously injured. Ground rules might include:


Do not hit in the face or the groin.
Do not scratch or bite. These are dirty tricks that will label you as an unfair fighter. After biting an opponent's ear, Mike Tyson was disqualified and even lost his boxing license.Allow an opponent to tap out if they are hurt or tired. The fight quickly becomes uneven if one of the fighters is compromised physically. If your opponent is seriously hurt, take them to a doctor or call the Emergency Services.
Refrain from serious name-calling. A little harmless name-calling is probably fine and even warranted in a physical fight. But when the name-calling turns to very personal, vicious attacks, it can change the tone of the fight.

, Even if you are quaking with fear, projecting self-confidence will alert your opponent to take the fight seriously and to fight fairly and respectfully.Stand tall, breathe deeply, and smooth away any worried expressions from your face. Think positive thoughts like, ""I can win this,"" and ""I am tough.""

, Your opponent is taking a risk with their body, just as you are with yours. By treating each other with respect, you can have the fight as safely as possible.

, These can inflict serious injury and should be avoided if possible. Reexamine the reasons why you are fighting and determine if your fight warrants using weapons at all.

, If your opponent is on the ground, they can’t fight back very effectively, and it makes the fight uneven. Demonstrate good sportsmanship by helping your opponent stand up, or at least standing back while they get to their feet.

, Do not allow other people to fight with/for you. Bringing in reinforcements to fight with you, even if it is just one or two other people, will make the fight unbalanced. As a result, you will look like someone who can't handle their own fights. Take responsibility for the reasons you want to fight, and resolve the altercation on your own terms.

Take crucial conversations offline.,
Wait before you post.,
Examine your motives.,
Find common ground.,
Replace “hot” words with “cool” words.,
Don’t be a troll.,
Don’t assume everyone sees the world as you do.",How to Fight Fair4," If the discussion is personal and you risk being misinterpreted, you should engage in the conversation face-to-face. A lot is lost online, which contributes to many mis-communications, including body language, voice inflection, and so on. Having an in-person conversation is more respectful to both you and the other person, and is likely worth the effort.

, When you read online content, you may be tempted to post a response immediately. In doing so, however, you risk making inflammatory statements that can be easily misunderstood. Take some time to cool off, go for a walk, and get a little perspective before responding. This will also give you time to construct a more sophisticated, intelligent response.

, Understand why you want to have conversations or disagreements with people online. Are you looking to start a productive dialogue? Do you want to just prove yourself ‘right’? Do you have an axe to grind? Being honest with yourself will help you understand why you want to argue with someone online.

, Determine the points that you can agree on before launching into fights about what you don’t agree on. This will enable a clearer route to resolution because you recognize that there is something positive to build upon.

, Mitigate the harsh tone in your writing by replacing phrases such as, “I think you’re stupid…,” with phrases such as, “I disagree with you for these reasons…” Your argument will be more structured and will carry more weight.

, Many arguments that happen online are inflamed because the attackers seem to forget that the other person is an actual person. Serious, personal, and violent insults and threats plague the internet and only serve to paint you as a horrible, mean person. Once you are a troll, you have stopped fighting fairly.

, In online forums, you are writing to the world. You should take the time to express yourself coherently so that you represent yourself and your opinions accurately."

To play this game you'll need a blank piece of paper and a pen or pencil., On one side of your paper, you should write two lists of people: one male and the other female.These lists should have an equal number of people in each and can even include famous people, if you want to have fun with it!

, On the back of your paper, write a list of simple actions. You can include as many or as few actions as you wish, some examples of actions including: hug, shake hands, poke, wave., You can do this many different ways, but you'll want to fold your paper so that your lists are hidden from view. Try folding your paper in half three times - depending on where you've written your list, this kind of fold might work for you.

, Now that your paper is folded in such a way that your lists can't be seen, blank parts of your paper should be all that is visible. On the side that is face up, draw a button and label it ""Button"", ""The Button"", or ""Push.""

, Ask a friend who is willing to play to ""push the button"" and, when she does, open your paper to the side with your lists of people. Be careful that you do not show your friend any of your lists. You should keep your lists of people and actions secret.

, You should ask your friend what gender she wants to choose for this round of ""Push the Button."" When she has chosen either ""Boy"" or ""Girl,"" you should ask her to choose a number. This is the subject, or the person you will be performing an action to/on.

, Now that you know the ""who"" you and your friend need to find out what will happen to that person. Turn to your action list and ask your friend to choose a number. Once she does, you will can tell her what she is going to do and who she will do it to!

Cut a spray bottle to make the handle.If your spray bottle has a molded handle, you can cut just below that.,

If you can't find a spray bottle, use a small air pump instead, like the kind used to fill basketballs. Be sure to take the unscrew the top nozzle.If you'd like, you can wrap some colored tape around the bottom, cut edge of the spray bottle. This will add a little design, and hide any jagged edges.;
, You can also cut it just a little bit shorter too. This will prevent the tube from getting caught on anything.

, The hole should be big enough for the nozzle of the spray bottle to fit though. You can drill the hole with an electric drill, a dermal, or even a pair of scissors.Make sure that your bottle has a sports cap. They are the kind that you pull to open, and push to close.

, Twist the nozzle on the spray bottle until it is in the ""open"" position. Draw a ring of hot glue around the nozzle, then push the nozzle into the hole. Wait for the glue to set, then add more glue around the seam. You want it to be perfectly airtight.

, Pull the cap open, and place a straw right over the opening. Draw a line of hot glue around the seam. Be careful not to get any glue inside the straw, or you may block the hole. You need to be able to push and pull the cap close/open.If you want something sturdier, you can use a short plastic or metal tube instead. You can also take a ballpoint pen apart, and use the body., You will eventually be pushing the circle hook over the top of your sports cap, so make sure it is big enough. The wire needs to be long enough to reach from the sports cap to the trigger on the spray bottle, plus extra.

, Hold the small bottle firmly in one hand as you do this so that you don't accidentally break the gun apart. If you can't fit it, position it so that it sits comfortably on top of the cap, then secure it with lots of hot glue.Make sure that the end of the ring and the wire are pointing down.

, Cut the popsicle stick in half, then use a folded piece of sandpaper to carve a U-shaped notch into one end.


This ditch is important; it will act as a groove for the hook/lever.

, The circle hook should rest comfortably in the groove you made earlier. If you'd like some extra security, you can tie the hook to the water bottle using zip ties.

, Make sure that you can comfortably reach the loop with your forefinger. If the wire is too long, you may need to cut it.


Twist the end of the wire around itself. This closes the loop and keeps it from coming undone.

, If you are using the kind that are hallow inside, you can glue some toothpicks inside to make them more lethal. Only do this if you plan on being responsible; never shoot your toothpick bullets at another person or animal.

, If the Q-tip won't slide into the straw easily, you'll either have to pull the cotton batting off, or cut it off with a pair of scissors. You can only load one Q-tip bullet at a time.

, Simply squeeze the spray bottle trigger repeatedly. As the small bottle fills with air, the trigger will become harder and harder to pull. Once you can't squeeze the trigger anymore, stop.

, If you made a trigger for it, pull on the metal loop. This will open the sports cap and send your ""bullet"" flying.If you didn't make a trigger, simply pop the sports cap open. The built-up air will push the bullet out, and send it flying!"

Design with purpose.,
Create your results first and work backwards.,
Let fun dictate the results.,
Inject your personality or a distinct tone to your quiz.,
Create unambiguous questions.,
Get creative with your title.",How to Make a Quiz2," People have an innate yearning to know more about themselves. Attention to detail can draw more people to your quiz because it will feel personalized. Create a custom background related to the content of your quiz. Include people in your quiz to give your audience someone to relate to.A bland personality quiz can be overlooked because it may subconsciously say to a person that he has a bland personality. Colourful and distinct images are more likely to draw attention to your quiz.

, Once you know what personality someone is going to achieve, you can work backwards in writing questions to help them achieve this end result. For example, if your personality quiz is “Which Star Wars character are you?”, you can choose the main characters like Yoda and Darth Vader as possible outcomes. Now you can choose images and construct questions based on either a Yoda or Darth Vader result., Personality quizzes are popular because of the final results. If you err on the side of positivity, chances are your quiz will be popular. Have fun and be creative but keep your audience in mind when conceiving your results. Create results that will seem personal and reward the person taking your quiz. Random results can be just as alienating as negative ones because it may make the person feel like he just wasted his time after receiving a random result.For example, a personality quiz similar to ""what kind of animal are you"" could provide bear as a good result. The description could be something along the lines of ""While you enjoy a good refreshing slumber and may get cranky when you're hungry, everyone knows how much you love your children and that giant hugs were named after you."" This description is fun and seems personal because it reflects how a bear protects her cubs while using ""bear hugs"" as an indicator of warmth. Both of which can be relatable to a lot of people.

, Whether you’re snarky or optimistic, create questions with a distinct flair. It is a fine line between creating a result that is fun and personal. Tone and humour don’t translate well over text, especially when the person taking the quiz doesn’t know the person who wrote it.For example, a snarky quiz title could be along the lines of ""Which 90s one-hit wonder are you?""

, Write questions that are simple and straight to the point. Be concise. People want to finish quickly and don’t want to be bogged down with complicated description., The first thing that will draw someone to take your quiz is the title. A person will want to know how they relate to your given title so make sure that it is bold and compelling. For example, a good title could be ""Which apocalypse are you most likely to survive: zombie, vampire, robot, or puppy?""


5 tools for creating a catchy titles are: using the phrase “How much do you actually know about (insert topic)”, using celebrity, using an adjective, placing someone as a type, and comparing people to popular items. For example, you can use a celebrity in your title like “Which Walking Dead Character are you?” An example of using an adjective for a title would be something like, “How fit are you?” A title placing someone as a type would be something like “How big of a Bro are you?” A title that compares popular items would be similar to “Which brunch meal are?”

As she answers each question, she is immediately told whether she got the answer right or wrong.
A single questions quiz is just one question and one answer.
A % correct quiz is not like a standard quiz in that the person taking the quiz does not know whether his answers are right or wrong until he is finished the quiz and learns what percentage of the quiz he got right.
A Personality Quiz allows the person taking the quiz to choose from a variety of answers. Each answer has been assigned to a different result. The more answers that line up to a specific result determines the final outcome.
A Checklist Quiz poses a question with numerous possible answers. People can check off all that is applicable to them from this list and share that number with others who have also taken the quiz. An Image Checklist Quiz is similar but uses images over text.

, Get creative and title your quiz something that will make it stick out. Appeal to an audience using humour and intrigue., Create your quiz using a conversational tone, injecting as much personality as you can. Make your reader part of the joke. It’s a fine line between sarcasm and offensive but you want to avoid bland writing as well.Write persuasively and emphasize positivity. The person taking the quiz wants to feel gratified for taking the time to answer your questions. Pay them off with humour or a positive message about themselves.

, Bold images can help people immediately visualize the message you’re trying to get across. A face can draw a person in while a short blurb tells the rest of the story.Use images and content that you have the rights to if using your quiz for the public. Make sure that you only use original content or have received permission to use someone else’s work.If using images make sure that they are in the public domain, e.g. if the have a CC0 Creative Commons license.

, There are two ways to play: the first involves people asking whatever questions come to mind, and asking them at random. The second has the pair (or group) come up with a set list of questions which are then posed to each person.Writing a list beforehand is the easier choice, as everyone knows what they will be asked, and will likely agree to answer. Asking at random may be the more entertaining choice, but is also at higher risk of getting too personal or inappropriate.

, If you decide to play this game with strangers or acquaintances you meet in a specific setting, you may want to take that setting into consideration when forming some or all of your questions.


If meeting with members of a book club or writer's group, you might ask questions like, “What is your favorite book?” or “If you could be any fictional character from any book, who would you be?”
If meeting with a church group, consider questions such as, “What is your favorite Bible verse/story?” or “When did you first develop an interest in religion?”
If meeting someone new at the grand opening of a coffee shop, consider questions like “What is your favorite snack to enjoy with coffee?” or “Would you rather give up coffee for a month or stop showering for a week?”

, Although many of the people playing 21 Questions use is as a method to ask probing or otherwise inappropriate questions, respect the privacy of the person being asked questions--particularly in a group of people. If they want to sidestep something, or answer in vague terms, allow them to do so.The golden rule is a great thing to keep in mind when playing this game. Treat the target the same way you’d like to be treated during your turn as a target.

, There are some questions that should not be asked in any circumstance. Before you begin the game, identify any questions that might be too inconsiderate, thoughtless, or crude to ask.These questions can include broad categories such as sex and intimacy, or can be specific questions, such as, “Have you ever committed a crime?”
You can also create guidelines about the sort of questions being asked based by theme. For instance, if playing 21 Questions at a church youth group, you might indicate that at least half of the questions must be religious in nature.

, There may be a question that is just too probing or intimate for someone to answer. To safeguard against people getting upset, make a rule before starting the game for these instances.A simple rule could be that a target can pass on a question, but must then be asked a question in its place, or that the target can pass on a question, but will forfeit their turn to ask the next target a question.

, In a group, there are going to be multiple targets and multiple people asking questions, so you need to choose a fair method for deciding who goes first, second, third, and so on.


Rolling a die is a great way to choose a sequence. Each person rolls, and the person with the lowest roll goes first, followed by the second lowest, and so forth.
You can also do something like “Rock, Paper, Scissors” to determine who will go first, and do it again before each new game.
You can also go in a circle when deciding the order of targets. Once the first person has gone, the person to their left is the next target, and that cycle continues until everyone has had a turn.

, Now that the target and sequence have been decided upon, each member of the group should take a turn asking the target questions. You can divvy up the questions based on the number of people in the group (a group of 3 askers could have 7 questions each, for instance), or you can go in a circle and have each person ask one question at a time.


If there is a number of people unable to divide evenly into 21, sit in a circle and have someone start the questions. The next round, the person to their left can start the questions, and continue in this manner until everyone has had a chance to ask first.

, Once all 21 questions have been asked, either move on to the next target in the predetermined sequence, or take a minute to determine a new target using Rock, Paper, Scissors, or a coin flip.

, When you are playing with only two people, you may be asking more personal or intimate questions than you would in a group. For this reason, you should both agree upon boundaries for before the game (questions that are off limits), as well as after the game (such as, “We cannot treat each other differently after answering the questions”).This game can injure friendships and relationships quickly, if proper precautions are not taken. Do not ask questions you do not genuinely want the answer to.
If you are not sure whether a question is appropriate, simply ask, and give your playing partner a chance to either accept the question or request another one.

, The simplest way to choose the first target when only two people are present is to flip a coin. Once you’ve flipped your coin, understand that you must take a turn after the first target has completed their questions.


Do not use this game as a means to gather information and refuse to play after the target has finished. This game should always be played on equal footing.

, Ask the target 21 questions, using the previously agreed-upon list of off-limits questions as a guide. If you are playing with a friend, ask questions that tell you more about your friend, your friendship, and your friend’s preferences. If you are playing with a romantic partner, ask questions about their life, background, your relationship, and their needs.This game can be great for new couples who want to know more about each other quickly and easily.
This game is also wonderful for breaking the ice with a new acquaintance, and should focus on basic, getting-to-know-you questions or silly questions rather than deep or intimate ones.

, Once you have finished asking questions, take your turn! Submit yourself to the same questions you’ve asked, or answer entirely new questions. Give the new asker the same courtesy they gave you and answer questions honestly and succinctly.


If you do not feel comfortable answering a question, be gracious in asking for a new question. The game is supposed to be fun, and should not cause anger or emotional injury.

, To start out, ask basic questions, such as someone’s favorite color, their first celebrity crush, or where they grew up. You’ll want to ask small, easy questions at first to build trust between the asker(s) and target.Ask “favorites” questions, such as, “What was your favorite age?” “What is your favorite place to visit?” “What was your favorite part of school?” “What is your favorite way to travel?”
Ask “what if” questions. You can ask, “What if you could visit any time period in the past?” “What if you could fly?” “What if you had fingers on your feet, and toes on your hands?”

, Once you’ve built some groundwork with basic questions, you can ask more personal questions, or you can simply build off of the questions you’ve already asked and the answers you’ve received.


To build off of answers you’ve received, take an answer and phrase a question around it, such as, “Your greatest fear is spiders, so what would you do if you moved into a house with a spider infestation?”
To build to more personal questions, you can say something like, “The person you’d most like to meet with in the past or present is Susan B. Anthony. Why is she so important to you?”

, Some questions are going to be simple (i.e. “What is your favorite movie and why?”), while others are going to require a little bit of thought. Even if you are asking serious questions, ask the target questions that require some creativity or ingenuity to answer.Ask silly questions such as, “Do hair stylists go to other stylists or do they cut their own hair?” or “If an ambulance accidentally injures someone on its way to save someone else, who do the paramedics choose to save?”
You can ask serious questions, too, such as: “If the world was ending and you had to save one person, who would you save?” or “If your relationship was starting to go sour, what would you do to try to save it?”

, Whether you playing with a friend or a romantic partner, you could always stand to learn about other people’s family and backgrounds. Asking about family can help you get to know your playing partner’s habits and traditions, and asking about their background can lend insight into any cultural differences or interesting ideas they may have.For family, ask questions such as, “Who raised you?” “Was your family close growing up?” “Did you have any special traditions during holidays?”
For background, you can ask questions such as, “Do you know where your ancestors are originally from?” “Did you celebrate any special holidays growing up?”
When dealing with family and backgrounds, remember to exercise sensitivity; both are very personal topics and require kindness and open-mindedness.

, Questions about past romances have the potential to be silly, entertaining, or informative. When deciding what type of past romance questions to ask, consider the tone of the game. Are you playing to deepen your connection to your playing partner, or are you playing to escape boredom on a weekend?If you want to develop a deeper connection with your playing partner, you can ask questions such as “Who was your first kiss?” “What is the best date you’ve ever been on and why was it the best?” “Do you have any fantasies?”
If you are asking silly questions, you can ask thing such as, “What was your most awkward kiss?” “Have you ever sneezed in a love interest’s face?” “How long should you wait before passing gas in front of your significant other?”

, When asking about goals and aspirations, you must also be somewhat delicate, as you don’t want to laugh or make light of other people’s dreams. When asking these types of questions, you can keep things light-hearted, but avoid mocking your playing partner’s answers.Light-hearted questions can include: “What did you want to be when you were 5?” “Where do you see yourself in 10 years?” “Do you hope to be famous one day?”
More serious goal questions can include questions such as: “What do you want more than anything else in the world?” “If you could do anything, and money and living were already taken care of, what would you do and why?”

Choose your marbles.,
Place the marbles in an oven or toaster oven.,
Bake at 180ºC for 20 minutes.,
Set up a bowl of ice water.,
Transfer the hot marbles to the ice water.,
Wait until the marbles crack.,
Inspect the marbles.,
Make a cracked marble necklace.,
Paint flat marbles with nail polish.,
Turn flat marbles into rings.,
Make wire-wrapped jewelry.",How to Make Cracked Marbles," You can use any clear, mono-color marbles, or marbles with a cat's eye pattern. Opaque marbles won't look any different when cracked, and two-tone marbles will just crack in half.You may want to start with five or six marbles to make sure you like the effect.


You can use ""flat marbles"" and other decorative glass pieces as well, but they have a higher chance of breaking.;
, Lay the marbles in a single layer on a baking tray with raised edges. Use a stainless steel pan, not one with a nonstick surface.







, If your oven uses Fahrenheit, set it to 350º instead.


Some craftspeople prefer heating as high as 260ºC (500ºF).

, Fill a bowl with cold water, plus enough ice to keep it chilled.








, Remove the marbles from the oven carefully with oven mitts. Without touching the hot glass, use a spoon or other utensil to place them gently in the bowl of water.










Warning: although unlikely, the hot glass could explode on contact with the water. Do not put your face over the bowl, and wear safety glasses if you'd like extra protection.

, You should immediately hear a hissing or crackling noise when the marbles enter the water. Within a minute or so, the inside of the marbles will crack.








, The marbles will cool within a couple minutes, so you can take them out by hand. Some of the marbles may have cracked apart, but most will be smooth on the outside, with cracked patterns on the inside.









If some of the marbles only have tiny cracks, you can dry them off and repeat the process to get more cracks., Glue a bell cap onto a cracked marble using E6000 glue or another high strength glue that adheres to glass. Wait until it dries completely, then push a jump ring onto the ring of the bell cap. You can now fit a necklace chain onto the jump ring.Use needle-nose pliers for greater control. You may need two pairs of pliers, so you can grip both sides of the split jump ring and rock them back and forth to ""walk"" over the necklace chain.
Find a glue tube with a long nozzle for precise control., This adds an even more colorful sparkle when the polish reflects through the cracks in the glass. Simply coat the flat side of the marble with nail polish and let dry before using in rings or other jewelry. You may need two or three coats, depending on the opacity of the nail polish., You can easily glue cracked flat marbles onto a ring base with E6000 glue. To make your own ring base, wrap two wires around a ring mandrel, or any object the same size as your finger. Secure them by wrapping around the ring setting, then spiral the rings around each other to create a flat surface for your marble to rest on. Finish by tucking the wires around the ring beneath., You don't need much practice to make a wire cage. Just make three or four wire loops, and bunch them together at the top by wrapping the ends of a piece of wire tightly around them. Push the marble into the center of the cage, then use pliers and wire cutters to make adjustments and loop the wire around jump rings or other jewelry components.If you enjoy this look, there are all kinds of techniques you can learn. Try this classy wrapping pattern.
Aluminum wire is easy to manipulate and doesn't tarnish. 20- or 22-gauge wire works well for more jewelry projects."

Get a piece of paper, grab a pen or pencil, and gather around a table with your fellow inventors. As you all take turns sharing, write down every idea.


Allow your ideas to be vague or even impossible.
Don’t criticize or edit the ideas of others.
Let the ideas of others inspire you.
Allow everyone a chance to speak.;
, Take time to consider each idea on your brainstorm list. Eliminate ideas that are impossible to execute. Strike concepts that seem unoriginal. Circle exciting potential new games. Highlight ideas that you and your fellow inventors are familiar with, such as a new game that combines your favorites sports or expands upon your favorite board game. Merge ideas that excite—hybrid games can be really fun! Whittle the list down until it contains one idea: the concept of your new game., Choosing a name for your new game is a process that requires creativity and patience. When selecting a name, assess it against the following criteria:


Is the name unique?
Is the name appropriate?
Is the name catchy?
It may take you awhile to settle upon the perfect name for your game., Sports and games are often played on a field or a board. Devote time to determining where your game will be played.


Will you repurpose an existing sports field, like a baseball diamond, or game board?
Will you create an entirely new space or board for your game?
What are the dimensions?
Are their lines and boundaries?
What images and designs appear on your board?
How does the space function within the context of the game?, Sports and games are played by one or more players. How many players may participate in your sport or game? Occasionally, players will have different roles. List the roles players may choose between. Describe the responsibilities, advantages, and disadvantages that accompanies each role., Sports and games are often played with a variety of equipment and or pieces. Make a list of the equipment and pieces required to play your sport or game.


Can you repurpose existing sporting equipment and game pieces or do you need to design your own?
Does the game require uniforms?Do different players need different pieces of equipment or accessories?, Each set of rules should begin with a brief summary, or synopsis, of the fame. The purpose of the summary is to provide the context for the objective and rules that follow. If a summary is well-written, the objective and rules should make sense.Craft your summary as you would write an elevator pitch. It should be clear, concise, and powerful. It should have a hook and be visual. It should not take players more than one minute to read., The objective, or goal, is the outcome players are striving to achieve. It provides the game with a purpose. The goal also lays the foundation for all of the game’s rules.What is the primary accomplishment players are striving to achieve? Does the person or team with the most points, money, or resources win? Does the person or team that crosses the finish line win?

, The rules of your game should be clear, brief, and complete. When creating the rules of your game, keep the following in mind:


Only use words that help teach an individual how to play—strip down your rules, removing all unnecessary words, asides, and jokes.
Use lists, bullet points, diagrams, and examples to explain and demonstrate the object of your game.
Group together related rules.
Explain all terms that may be unfamiliar.
Anticipate the questions players may have and incorporate the answers into your rules., Well-written rules should only need to be read or heard once before the game is played. Rules that require additional explanation or a translation are not well-written. To test the quality and clarity of your rules, read the rules aloud to family members and friends., Once the rules are understood, ask friends and family members to play the game. As they play, sit back and observe their actions and reactions. Note when they appear frustrated, bored, or confused; record when they appear excited and engaged with the game.


Consider having multiple groups of people test the game., Assessing the results of your tests will inform the changes you make to the game. Ask your participants for their thoughts on the rules and the game. Allow them to ask questions share concerns. Remain open to their feedback and write down the constructive comments.After assessing their reactions, comments, and criticisms, select the components of your game you wish to change. Revise or completely alter these parts of your game."

Catch balloons.,
Keep your knees bent.,

Perfect your grip.,
Aim for unexpected targets.,
Fake a few throws.,
Aim for the center of your target.",How to Win a Water Balloon Fight," You will be significantly more difficult to hit if you are on the move. You should try to stay in motion constantly throughout the fight.Move side-to-side rather than forward-backward to maximize the difficulty for the person aiming at you.;
, If your evasive maneuvers involve moving over the same distance or in the same directions over and over again, you’ll become predictable. Try to mix it up as much as possible.

, The best water balloon fight spaces will have some obstacles you can use as cover. If you can throw balloons from behind something, part of your body will be covered while you’re throwing and you’ll be a smaller target.You could hide behind a rock, a tree, or a bush.

, The best way to irk your opponent is to catch a balloon they thought would splatter all over you. You can then use the balloon you caught to return fire.


If your opponent is throwing balloons designed for water fights, known as water bombs, they will have a harder exterior and will be much easier to catch. If you’re fighting with cheaper party balloons, you may want to avoid trying to catch them because they will break more easily.
If you fail to catch it, hitting an incoming balloon with your hand can either deflect it away or pop it away from your body so your clothes won’t get as wet.

, If you keep your knees slightly bent, you’ll be able to duck and sidestep incoming balloons more easily., It's basically inevitable that some water will get on you. Make sure you wear clothing that you don’t mind getting wet. It’s also a good idea to take off shoes and socks as they can be difficult to dry out.

, Gripping a water balloon too tightly can cause it to pop in your hand but a loose grip could hurt your throwing accuracy.


Keep in mind that the water will shift around in the balloon. If you’re having difficulty handling the balloon, it may help to hold your hand underneath the balloon and throw it overhand in a catapult motion.

, If they aren’t looking at you, they won’t be able to react and will be an easy target. Look for people throwing balloons at others so they aren’t paying attention to you.

, Fake throws will throw off your opponents and cause them to duck or dodge the throw too early. You can then hit them more easily immediately after they’ve moved.


Too many fake throws could cause the opponents to get annoyed and target you. Use your fakes judiciously.

, Aim for your target’s body just above the stomach. This spot will give you the widest margin of error if your throw isn’t perfect.

Find at least six people to play.,
Pick a captain for each team.,
Divide the players into two equal teams.,
Have each team stand in a straight line, holding hands.,
Call a player over.,
The player who was called runs across the space between teams and tries to break through the arms of two players.,
If the player doesn't get through the line, they join the opposing team.,
Continue playing until one team is down to one person.",How to Play Red Rover," Red rover is a team game, so you will need at least three people on each team to play.The more people you can get to join your game of Red Rover, the more fun you will have.


Since you want a lot of players, Red Rover is an ideal game to play at recess in school when you know lots of potential players will be there to join.
If you want to set up a game outside of school, plan it a day or two in advance so you have more time to get players to join.;
, The team captains can then flip a coin to determine who gets the first pick. The captain that doesn't win the coin toss can take the first turn in the game.

, The captains can take turns picking players until everyone has a team.

, The teams will face each other, standing between six and ten yards apart. The further apart the teams are, the more distance players have to pick up speed before they reach the other team's line. It's a good idea to keep the distance between teams smaller for younger children to lower the chance of injuries.


Use strategy when creating your line. Have stronger players join hands with weaker players to make sure your line holds.

, The team that goes first decides who to ""call over"" from the other team. Once the team has decided, they sing, ""Red Rover, Red Rover, will (name) come over!""


When choosing who to call you will want to use some strategy. Don't call the biggest, strongest person who is likely to get through the line first. Pick the player who you think you can stop.

, The runner should use some strategy when taking their turn. Find the weak link and go for it. Avoid going at the strongest players unless you feel confident you can break the link.

, However, if they break through, they go back to their own team. They can take one of the players whose arms the broke through with them.


Some people play where only the runner goes back to the original team, without taking additional players.
You can also play where the runner selects anyone from the opposing team once the break through the line. If so, break through the weakest spot and take the strongest player., When one team is no longer able to make a chain, the other team wins. If your friends have time and are up for it, you can pick some new teams and start playing all over again.

March with high knees.,

Hop one foot at a time.,
Practice galloping.,
Step forward, then hop on that foot.,
Repeat that motion on the other leg.,
Lift and bend your non-stepping foot.,
Swing your arms in alternate directions.,
Speed up as you get comfortable with the motion.",How to Skip," Locomotive skills are one of three essential motor skills; the other two being stability and manipulative skills.If skipping is difficult, then start with some of the more basic locomotive skills and work your way up.Marching with high knees mirrors the movement of skipping closely. Bring one foot up and bend at the knee to create a 90 degree angle. As you step forward, bring the other leg up in a quick motion.


Keep your eyes focused forward and swing arms opposite of your feet. If the left foot is up in the air, the right arm should swing forward and vice versa.;
, Stand with feet close together and push off with both feet. Try lifting your feet off the ground at the same time. Practice landing quietly by landing on your toes and letting your ankles and knees bend. See how high you can jump.


Add a jump rope and try jumping rhythmically. Extend your knees, ankles and hips as you jump. The main bounce should happen in your ankle. Activate the elasticity in your achilles tendon as you jump up and down., Learning to hop on one leg is a prerequisite skill to hopping. Lift one foot up, bending at the knee, and hold it there. Balance on your standing leg and try to stabilize by tightening the muscles in that leg. Once you have steadied yourself, lift off your heel and push off the ground with the ball of your foot. Try landing an inch or two forward back onto the ball of your foot.


Keep yourself balanced by bringing your arms to your sides in a wide A shape.
Switch feet and try balancing on the other foot.

, Thrust your foot up and bend at the knee. Step forward with the lifted foot and shift your weight into the foot in front of you. Quickly close the gap between your feet by moving your back foot forward, so it rests just behind the front foot. Continue this motion forward with the same foot.


Make sure you switch sides and gallop with your other foot.
A gallop is nearly as difficult as skipping. Once you’ve mastered the gallop, you can then move on to skipping.

, The basic skipping motion is step, hop, step, hop.Start by stepping forward with one foot, then hopping on that same leg. It helps to step on just the balls of your feet, keeping your heel lifted. Push off your ball and propel yourself forward a few inches as you jump. Land lightly with bent knees.Point your toes in the direction you want to be skipping towards.
Keep your head up and eyes forward. You may need to look at your legs as you get used to the motion, but eventually you should look up and ahead.
Hold your abs in and chest up. Keeping a good posture will add height and distance to your skips.
When you land, don't make a lot of noise. If the ground makes a loud noise when you land, you’re wasting too much energy. Keep control of the jump through your Achilles tendon and knees.

, After landing, step forward with the other leg and repeat the previous motion. Step on the ball of your foot, hop, then land lightly with a bent knee.


Another way to think about skipping is to add hops in while marching. Practice marching with high knees. When you lift up one leg with knees bent, the standing leg should do a hop. Repeat on the other leg. Continue the march-hop motion in a series.

, Let your foot that isn't hopping go with the momentum by moving it forward and letting it rise about 45 degrees. To increase the energy of your hops, you can lift your knee to as much as a 90 degree angle.

, Getting your arm actions right has a small but important role in improving your jump performance.Keep your arms relaxed and let them swing with the momentum.


Swing your arms forwards and backwards, not side to side, just as you do with walking.
As your left knee pops up, swing your right arm forward, and vice versa.

, Try going faster, increasing the distance between each skip, and jumping higher.


If you’re having problems, try slowing down and doing it one foot at a time. You can skip in place by stepping on one foot, hopping straight up and down. Then shift your weight to the other foot and hopping straight up and down again. Once you get comfortable with this, try skipping in motion again.

Look for a steep hill.,
Check around for obstacles.,
Scope out an open space where no travelers are passing through.,
Dress appropriately.,
Sled during the day.,
Create a runway.,
Find a good sled.,
Be as safe as possible.,
Prepare for a good start.,
Get a big shove from the top of the hill.,
Slide down the hill.,
Land safely and slowly.",How to Sled Without Snow," A hill with a nice incline and an unobstructed area at the bottom is best.


The hill should be inclined enough to easily slide down without needing to scoot yourself along, but not so steep that you might lose control and fall headfirst off of your sled.
Avoid hills that end on a street or another major pathway. You’ll need a safe, open place to land and slow down at the bottom of the hill.
It doesn’t matter whether the hill is made of dirt or if it’s covered in grass, just as long as it is steep enough to sled down.;
, Find a space that is open and free of any obstructions that will hurt you or hinder your sledding path.


Avoid locations with lots of trees or wandering animals. It can be hard to slow down or quickly turn a moving sled, so choose a spot where you won’t risk ramming into a tree or cow while sledding.

, You want to avoid creating a risk to yourself and other people.


Pay attention to the traffic in the area. If there are lots of runners, cyclists,or pedestrians around, you run the risk of sledding right into someone else.
Stay away from any hills with dirt roads running through them. This means that there is probably a steady flow of traffic, and the area isn't safe for sledding.

, Wear clothing that will protect you from injury and the elements.


Always wear a helmet. It will keep your head safe in case you fall or run into something. Ski helmets and bike helmets work perfectly.Wear jeans and long sleeves, no matter what time of year you’re sledding in. They will protect the skin on your arms and legs if you fall off of the sled, and will also help keep you warm if it’s cooler outside.
If it’s cold outside, wear a hat, coat, and mittens.
Do not wear scarves or anything that could possibly get caught in the sled and choke you.If you have longer hair, pull it back so that you can see where you’re going at all times.

, Being able to see around you while sledding will help prevent any injuries.


Sledding in the dark makes it more difficult to see if an obstacle is coming your way or blocking your path.
If you choose to sled at night, make sure the hillside area is lit very well., Your hill needs to have a slippery pathway that is easy for your sled to slide down.


If the hillside is grassy, you may not need to do anything. As long as the grass is alive and glossy and not crisp or dead, a sled will have an easier time sliding down the slope.
A muddy hillside does not take any extra effort, since mud is naturally slippery.
If the hill you choose is covered in dry dirt or dead, thin grass, you might need to create some mud by pouring water over the dry space. You can use a water hose if there is one close by, or bring along some buckets of water to pour down the hill.
You can also create a runway by covering the hill with a long tarp, trash bags, palm leaves, or something similar.Use anything that is slick enough for a sled to easily glide down.
Make sure the runway is as smooth as possible by removing potentially painful obstructions such as jutting rocks.

, Anything large enough to sit on and grip, like a smooth garbage can lid or a manufactured sled without runners, will work.


Look for something that is sturdy, thick, and safe. The sled should protect your behind while going down the hill.
Do not use a sled that has runners. The runners are meant to cut through snow, and can be unsafe on regular ground.
You can use a big plastic sledding saucer, or a toboggan (a sled without runners) with added steering.
There are even some sleds made specifically for sledding on dry land if you don’t mind shelling out some money., It is important to practice safe behaviors when riding on your sled to prevent serious injury.


Remain seated on your sled at all times. Staying seated will help you maintain control while you're riding down the hill. Never stand up, as the sled will likely slip out from under you and cause you to fall.
Ride feet-first down the hill. Lying on your stomach while sledding downhill increases your risk of head injury. Sit with your behind on the sled, or lie back if necessary.Surround yourself with friends. If you get hurt while sledding alone, it is important to have other people there to help you or to run for help if you can’t move.

, Sit firmly on your sled and hold on tightly to the handle or sides.


Brace yourself for your ride to the bottom. Hold on to any handles, reigns, or lips of the sled.

, Have a friend give you a strong push to get you started down the hill.


Let a friend push you, rather than getting a running start on your own. It is safer to start out seated than to run and try to sit on the sled while it’s moving.
For a little more speed, start several feet back from the top of the hill and have a friend push you while running forward.

, Hold on tightly the whole time and steer your sled if necessary.


While sledding down the hill, keep your eyes open to avoid any dangers.
Be sure to shift your bodyweight front, back, left, and right to keep yourself on a steady course and facing straight ahead.

, Allow yourself to glide to a stop at the bottom of the hill.


Don’t force yourself to stop unless you absolutely have to do so. Putting a leg, arm, or any body part out to stop yourself may result in you tumbling off of the sled, breaking a limb, or smashing into something.
Slow down naturally and let your sled stop itself. Then you can run back uphill and do it again!

,, If they look, they have to ask that person out. If they don't ask them out 24 hours after they look, they have to kiss them.


Don't look at your hand to win. Most of the people who write the information write down the dorkiest/nerdiest kids they can think of so you will just be embarrassed if you ask them out. So just don't look at your hand.

Gather a group of friends.,
Find an area to play.,
Mark boundaries and discuss the rules.,
Get toy weaponry.,
Make supply packs.,
Assign an announcer.",How to Play the Hunger Games Outdoor Game1," Six people is a good minimum, but the best games have around twelve. Distribute walkie-talkies so you can alert people if you're ""killed"". Alternatively, get everyone's phone number so that you can do alerts by text.;
, The first thing you’ll need to do is make sure the area is large enough for the group you have. Try to find an area that encompasses a number of different terrains, from urban, to a large field, to rocky terrain.

, Make sure everyone is clear on the boundary lines and the rules, because anyone who goes out of bounds or breaks a rule will immediately be dead.


When fighting, a hit to the torso should be a “kill”, whereas a hit to the ankle or any other insignificant place should not count as a “kill”. If anyone plays dirty (i.e. hitting someone in the face), the offender is ""killed"" instead.

, Toy bows and arrows, play swords, and things like that from the dollar store should suffice. The more diverse you can make the selection of weapons, the more fun you can have. You can also make the weapons yourself. Ideas include:


A crossbow out of household items
A pen blowgun
A bow using a ruler
Five-minute bow and arrows
A mini bow and arrows

, Have each player bring a backpack and a set of supplies. Before you start the games, put a bottle of water, a snack (like a granola bar or pack of crackers), a couple of weapons, and a jacket in each backpack. Place them in the center of your area.


If you want, you can also make special packages which one person can hide around the playing area. Put extra food, weapons, or other items in the package to help the players through their game.

, The announcer is responsible for enforcing the rules, keeping track of everyone's alive status, and letting the other players know who is still alive. The announcer will also be the mediator for any disputes. Give the announcer a walkie-talkie so the player can alert the announcer if they die.
