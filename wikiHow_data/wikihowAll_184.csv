Think out what you want to zap them to do.,
Approach the victim.,
Write zap in all capitals on the back of your victim's hand.,
Write what they have to do.,
Write down who they have to do it to on the palm of their hand.,
If you get zapped, don't look at the palm of your hand before the designated time or let people tell you who's on your hand unless you think doing what's on your hand isn't that bad.

",How to Play Zap2,", Do you want them to hug a guy they like? Say hello to that cute older boy? You can write almost anything. Also, think of a time in the future (two or three hours gives the victim to most suspense to find out who they have to talk to.) Just make sure the time isn't too far in the future. Everyone has a limit as to how long they can wait.

, Most people will appreciate you asking them if you can zap them, but you don't have to if you don't want to.

, Write what time it has to be before they can look at the zap (or find out who's on it) without having to do what it says. For example: 2:00

, For example: Hug

, For example: Bob in Social Studies (you could also write the last name, instead of what class they share with the victim.)

Start everyone in a semi-circle around the pile of backpacks.,
Use skill and strategy.,
Hunt each other down.,
Notify the announcer when someone dies.,
Sponsor players.,
Declare the winner.",How to Play the Hunger Games Outdoor Game2," Have the announcer set two timers: one for one minute and one for two minutes. When the first timer goes off, everyone can race forward to grab a supply backpack. However, they cannot kill other players until the second timer goes off.

, Play this as a free-for-all game, but don't be afraid to make alliances. Learn to be stealthy by walking silently and using grass as camouflage. Sometimes just laying down in some medium- to long-grass terrain can keep you out of the enemy's sight. If possible, grab both a ranged weapon and a melee weapon. This will also come in handy if you lose one weapon or run out of ammunition.

, Remember the following when you fight:


If you get hit on the torso, you're dead, but if you get hit on a limb you're okay.
If you are hit on a hand, that limb is lost and you are not able to hold weapons in that hand.
If you are hit on a leg or ankle, you are not able to stand on that foot.
Ration your food and water: if you eat or drink too much to begin, you might starve to death or die of thirst later!

, Though the announcer should be keeping a close eye on game play, they cannot always keep track of everything. If you're texting, both the killer and the victim should text the announcer. If using walkie-talkies, just one person can notify the announcer.

, Once you are killed, you can sponsor other players by giving them your unused helpful items or bringing them new weapons that you make.

, The last person standing is the winner!

Add even more fun.",How to Play the Hunger Games Outdoor Game3," Find a big area with lots of places to climb and hide.

, Play with water guns; put non-staining red dye in them.

, If you are shot with the water in your head or torso, you're dead and you must lay down until the games are over.

, The victim or the killer should text the game-maker so they can mark them dead on a list.

, The game is most fun when it goes on for one to two hours. The time it takes depends on the number of people and how large an area you've chosen.

, The last person standing is the winner.

, Let players decide a tribute name and what district they are from. You can even do reaping, and have someone be Caesar Flickerman and do interviews.

Gather all necessary supplies.,
Construct a trap door.,
Attach the trapdoor to the tube.,
Decorate the tube and fill the tube with glitter.,
Add a cone-shaped top.,
Release the glitter.,
Turn your glitter popper into a glitter cracker.",How to Make a Glitter Bomb1," Glitter bomb poppers are similar to confetti poppers used to celebrate New Year’s Eve, weddings, birthdays, or other holidays. Party poppers or crackers first appeared as British party favors in the 1840s.Save money on poppers – and fill them with glitter – by making them at home. You will need:


Paper towel roll cut in half or toilet paper roll
Glitter (different colors)
Scissors
A Stapler with staples
Bakers twine or string
Scotch tape
Hot glue gun and sticks
Beads
Ribbons for streamers
Cardstock
Tissue paper;
, Glitter bomb poppers explode when someone pulls a string attached to a ‘trap door’.Cut a tissue paper square that is large enough to cover the bottom of your tube (about 3 inches or 7.5 cm). Trace the end of the tube onto a piece of cardstock and cut out the circle. Use the hot glue to glue this circle to the center of the tissue paper square. Let dry for several seconds. Use scissors or a needle to puncture the center of the circle and thread an arm’s length of string or twine through the hole.

, Before gluing the tissue paper and cardstock trapdoor to your tube tie a bead to the end of the string, making sure it is on the side that will face the inside of the cardboard tube. Attach the trapdoor by using the hot glue to glue the edges of the tissue paper to the sides of the tube. At this point, your glitter bomb popper should look like a tube with one end sealed off, and a string ‘tail’ extending from the base., Be creative when decorating the body of the tube. You can wrap it in colored construction paper or metallic foil, or glue ribbons or streamers to the sides and bottom. Before sealing the opposite end, use a funnel or measuring cup to fill ½ to ¾ of the tube with glitter.

, Turn your popper into a rocket by adding a cone-shaped top. Draw a 3.25 inch (8.3 cm) circle on a piece of cardstock. Use the scissors to cut this out, and then cut a single snip from the edge to the center. Pull the edges of the cut together until they overlap about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) to form a cone. Stable the edges together.Attach the top by punching two small holes just below the opening of the tube. Thread a string through the holes. Bring the two ends of the string together over the opening and thread them through a bead. This will help keep the string centered. Next, thread the string up and through the hole at the top of the cone. You can use this string to hang your popper from the ceiling or attach it to a string of garland., Pull on the string extending down from the trap door. This will cause the trap door to rip-off and cause the glitter to rain down on unsuspecting partygoers.

, Modify this design so you can include them as party favors, rather than party decorations that need to be hung up. The glitter is released when you ""crack open"" the ends of the tube, instead of pulling on a string. Wrap your cardboard roll in tissue paper. Use enough tissue paper that it extends several inches beyond each end of the roll.Next, glue cardstock, construction paper, or metallic foil onto the body of the roll (over the tissue paper). Twist one end of the tissue paper and tie it off with ribbon. Use a funnel to fill the tube with glitter. Finally, twist and tie the tissue paper at the opposite end to seal-off the roll.


Release the glitter and crack-open the tube by gripping both ends with your hands and pulling them apart. Instruct people to pull as hard as they can so the glitter will explode and not simply fall out.

Mix your potassium nitrate (60 g) with sugar (40 g).,
Let the mixture cook.,
Remove when cooked.,
Stir in baking soda.,
Add dye.,
Fill your container.,
Push a pen or pencil into your mix.,
Wrap the bomb.,
Replace the pen.,
Light your smoke bomb.",How to Make a Colored Smoke Bomb," Put this mixture into a saucepan and warm it over low heat. If you don’t have capability of measuring in grams, use tablespoons. This would be 3 tablespoons of potassium nitrate and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of sugar.Be careful when mixing chemicals. Always take proper precautions.;
, Continuously stir the mixture over low heat. Let it cook until it caramelizes and browns. This will take less than 15 minutes so keep a constant watch over your mixture.


Once again, take proper precautions when cooking the mixture. Do not walk away from it.

, When the mixture starts to look like peanut butter, take it off of the heat. It should have a thick, creamy consistency.








, After you remove the mixture from the heat, stir a rounded teaspoon of baking soda into the saucepan. This measurement doesn’t have to be exact.


Baking soda can cause a chemical reaction, be careful when mixing it into your mixture.

, Take three large tablespoons of dye any color dye that you’d like and mix it into your saucepan. Mix it thoroughly. It helps to have your dye previously measured and sitting in a separate bowl ready for this step.








, While your mixture is still hot and pliable, fill your tube, paper, etc. with the mixture. It should pour like hot caramel or be in powder form. Pack it evenly to the top.









Because your mixture is hot, be careful when pouring it. Wear heat resistant gloves if you have them available. Keep your filled tube away from any possible ignition sources., Take a pen and push it straight down into the center of your mixture. It doesn’t have to be pushed down to the bottom of your tube; but, it needs to be far enough down so that you it stands on its own. Leave it for at least an hour to harden.

, Use duct tape to cover the top, bottom, and sides of the tube. You can use any color duct tape that you have available. Leave a small hole for the around the fuse.







, Remove the pen and replace it with a firework fuse. Use a piece of a cotton ball to help secure the fuse in the smoke bomb. Be sure there is at least ½” of fuse left so that you can light the smoke bomb.


The fuse itself isn’t dangerous until lit. However, make sure to do this away from any open flame.

, Use a lighter to light the fuse of your smoke bomb. Do so outside because the smoke will billow out of your bomb quickly as soon as the fuse burns down enough.









If you feel that the flame is growing at any point, throw the smoke bomb into an empty space where it can safely burn out.

Gather all necessary supplies.,
Cut the paper straws in half.,
Glue one end of the straw.,
Fill the straw with glitter.,
Release your glitter bomb.",How to Make a Glitter Bomb2," This glitter bomb is easy to make and a great way to add some sparkle to Birthdays or New Year’s Eve parties.You will need:


Paper straws (different colors)
Glitter (different colors)
Scissors
Tape
Scrap paper
Bowl (optional)
Hot glue gun and sticks

, Bend the straw in half and cut it in the center with scissors. You will use the paper straws to hold the glitter. By cutting them in half, you double your number of glitter bombs. They are also easier to hold and break open than full size straws.

, You will want to plug one end of the straw, but keep the opposite end open for now. Use a few drops of hot glue at one end to create a plug. This will make it easier to fill the straw with glitter. Let the glue dry.

, Hold the straw vertically over the bowl so the open end is facing up. Use your piece of scrap paper to make a funnel.Place the funnel over the open end and tilt it upright to fill the straw with glitter. Once the straw is filled, pour extra glitter back into its container. Tap the end of the straw to remove excess glitter. Plug the open end with hot glue and let dry.

, Pull both ends of the straw with your hands until it breaks open. It should release a small explosion of glitter. Wave the ends around to release extra glitter trapped in the straw.


At a party, countdown and have everyone release their glitter bombs at the same time.

Gather all necessary supplies.,
Crack open the peanuts.,
Fill the peanut shells with glitter.,
Glue the peanuts back together.,
Crack open the glitter bomb.",How to Make a Glitter Bomb3," Empty peanut shells make great impromptu glitter bombs. They are lightweight, portable, and easy to add to small packages. You will need:


A bag of unshelled peanuts
Scissors
Glitter (different colors)
Hot glue gun and sticks
Acrylic paint (optional)
Paint brushes (optional)

, Use scissors to carefully crack the peanuts. Place the peanut lengthwise between the blades of the scissors and gently apply pressure. Once the peanut splits, use your fingers to separate the two halves and remove the nut from the shell.Repeat until you have your desired number of “peanut glitter bomb” cartridges. Make sure you keep associated shell halves together.


Discard peanuts that develop any cracks.

, Place associated shell halves next to one another and fill one side with glitter. Repeat until all shell halves are filled.

, Apply hot glue to the edges of the shell half with the glitter. Position the half without glitter so the edges line-up with the glue and press the two halves together. Let the glue dry.Once you glue the halves together, you can paint the exterior of the shells with acrylic paint. Consider pouring the paint into a plastic bowl or cup, and mixing glitter into the paint. This will turn the dull peanut shell into a colorful, sparkly glitter bomb.

, Give the peanut to a friend. Tell them to hold each end and quickly crack the shell. Watch as glitter is released from the center.

Gather all necessary supplies.,
Fill the balloon with glitter.,
Inflate the balloon.,
Pop the balloons.",How to Make a Glitter Bomb4," Sparkle balloons are great decorations for adult or children’s birthday parties. Once you are finished using them as decorations, you can pop them with a pin to release the glitter inside. You will need:Balloons (different colors)
Glitter (different colors)
A plastic funnel
Helium tank with helium (optional)

, Insert the long portion of the funnel through the neck of the balloon. Pour the desired amount of glitter through the funnel.


You can use this same technique to fill a balloon with paper confetti. Simply cut tissue paper into small circles. Grab a small handful of the tissue paper circles, fold them in half, and then fold them in half again. Use the bottom of the funnel to poke the ball of tissue paper into and through the neck of the balloon., You can either blow the balloon up with your mouth, or inflate it with helium if you want it to float. Tie off the neck of the balloon. You can also tie a string or ribbon the balloon for decoration.


Inflate balloons at least one hour before your party. This allow enough time for the static electricity inside the balloon to pull the confetti and/or glitter up and along the sides., Tap the side of the balloon with a pin or needle until it bursts. This will cause glitter to fly out in every direction.


Attach balloons inflated with air and not helium to a length of garland. Either tape the balloons directly to the garland or tie them on with string. String banners with glitter and/or garland filled balloons along the wall or ceiling. Give you guests pins and tell them to pop the balloons – coating everyone (and everything) in a sparkly layer of glitter."

Find a suitable place to play.,
Set up the game requirements.,
Have two volunteer players stand behind the taped line, on either side of the center line.,
Start the game.,
Say ""Go"".,
Stop the timer and call out ""Stop"".,
Play rounds.",How to Play Plastic Bottle Toss," It needs to be a fairly large space, measuring about 20 by 20 feet long and wide.
,

Put the two trash cans against the wall and about five feet away from each of the trash cans.
Place the two buckets measuring about five feet or more apart. Place a piece of tape in a straight line behind the buckets, then place tape in a straight line down the center as well, so as to create two separate ""courts"".
Fill the buckets with plastic bottles, ready for tossing.

, Do a few test throws, to check that you haven't made the placement of the trash cans too easy or impossible. Shuffle the trash cans about a little if needed., Have the first players stand in place behind the taped line. Get ready to start timing the game., The players must start tossing the plastic bottles into the empty trash cans in front of them., The player with the most bottles in the trash can wins.

Collect the bottles and return them to the buckets for the next game.

, Keep players moving through in pairs. Then pair off the winners from each game until only two people are left to battle it out and win the ultimate prize (whatever that may be).

Have as many rounds as you want. At the end of each round tally how many water bottles you get into the trash and by the end of the rounds whoever has the most points wins the whole game!

Choose games which you enjoy being involved in.,
Look for a safe and wholesome location to pursue your fun.,
Talk to your parents, grandparents, or older relatives like aunts and uncles about the days before video games.,
Choose games that don't require a lot of hardware or a large investment to begin.,
Learn some jump rope rhymes, and maybe learn Chinese jump rope too.

,
Check out the local athletic park and see what is offered.,
Look for ""frisbee golf"" (Disc Golf) courses, which are becoming more popular in many areas.,
Try your hand at real golf, or miniature golf.,
Pick up a horseshoe set and build your own horseshoe pits, then let the neighbors know they are welcome to drop by and pitch a game or two.

,
Stay out of the midday heat if you can, and play these, or other games in the evening or early morning when it is cool.,
Take the Game Boy or the PSP outdoors.",How to Play Outside," There are lots of topics covered in ""Backyard Games"" here on wikiHow, plus the usual team sports like basketball, baseball, and soccer. Get involved in these, or be creative.;
, This may be your own backyard, if you are fortunate enough to have a large one, a local public park, or a church or school grounds if they permit off hours use of their property.

, They may help you to discover lost games like shooting marbles, mumblety peg, jacks, or even plain old tag. If no one has time to relate the rules and strategies for any of these games or others, search them here at wikiHow, or google them.

, With a very small space, games like kickball, croquet, and badminton may be out, but if you have room for these, the cost of setting up the basic games is not too expensive, and they can give you a good dose of competition as well as some good exercise.

,, There may be basketball and tennis courts available for public use, and often it is just a matter of bringing your ball or racquet and hanging around a while for a challenger to show up alone to get a game started.

, Many of these are free access, and the rules are posted at the course entrance. There are all types of golf discs to choose from, but one disc is all that is really required to play the game.

, If you don't have clubs and equipment, they can usually be rented, and many communities have ""par three"" courses with low green fees and no need for a cart. Design a golf course in your backyard, or maybe you can find an unused soccer field and pick up a bucket of range balls and practice driving and chipping without paying any green fees at all. Be polite, though, and don't divot up the grass.

,, Drink lots of cool water, and take frequent breaks.

, This doesn't give you a lot of exercise, but at least you can get some sun and fresh air, and stay out of your parents' hair for a while. And, while you are sitting outside playing your game, someone may come by and invite you to play other games with them.

Check out shady places in your backyard like under a thick growth of plants.,
Find a corner where 2 walls meet.,
Now look in any place where insects fly, and where there are branches to connect the corners of the web.,
Look on plants and find a caterpillar.,
To look for hornworms, look on tomato plants.,
Look for funnels in sandy places, often next to the foundation of houses where grass does not grow.,
Go to some flowers and look for any moths or butterflies.,
Look at the flowers some more, you might see bees.,
Wasps like the same types of flowers as bees and butterflies.,
Turn over a large piece of wood, a pile of damp leaves, or a large rock.,
Pill bugs, or ""roly polies"", roll into a ball when scared.,
Slugs are soft-bodied blobs which make slime.,
Worms will also be found in damp covered places.,
Centipedes are also found here.,
Millipedes are also here.,
Ants are also found under objects, or between cracks in the sidewalk.,
On plants you might find a shield shaped bug.,
You might also find other types of beetles.,
Streams and ponds are fun places to find critters.,
Use the net to scrape the bottom of a stream or pond.,
Crayfish are simply freshwater lobsters.,
Minnows are also found in ponds and streams.,
Water scorpions (the US name) live underwater but they breathe air.,
Tadpoles are baby frogs or toads.,
The giant water bug is football-shaped, and 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) long, dark colored, and mostly flat.,
Mosquito larva, aka ""wigglers"".,
Glass shrimp are found only in some southern US ponds without fish.,
Triops are also found in temporary ponds that dry up in the summer.",How to Take Your Kids on a Backyard Safari," Toads love cool and damp places like that. Toads are like tan colored frogs, but they have bumpy skin. The large brown wart behind each eye tastes bad if bitten, so that makes animals not want to eat toads. Toads eat small insects, like mosquitoes, and come out at night. Toads will try to scare you if you pick them up, they will pee on you!

, Now look for a horizontal web with a funnel in one corner. Funnel spiders in the US are not dangerous. Funnel spiders in Australia are! This is where the female spider hides during the day. She comes out in the evening when the light is dim and eats insects that fall in the web. Male funnel web spiders do not spin webs and wander around your yard eating things like mosquitoes. Funnel spiders look somewhat fuzzy, are light tan, with darker stripes on the back.

, Look for a circular web shaped like a bulls eye. Orb weaver spiders make these webs. At sunrise the webs collect dew and are easily seen.

, Caterpillars are baby butterflies or moths. They eat plants. What color is it? Some caterpillars get quite large, up to 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) long, like tomato hornworms. If you have tomato plants in your yard, you will probably have tomato hornworm caterpillars. Hornworms have a little horn on their rear end.

, Look for a little pile of droppings in the evening. Now look to the leaf right above the droppings, under the leaf. Is he there?

, Ant lions are also called ""doodle bugs"". The ant lion waits for an ant to fall into the funnel, then he throws sand at the ant to make it fall down to the base. When the ant gets to the bottom, the ant lion drags him under the sand. Don't worry, there are plenty of ants left.

, In general, moths have feathery antennas, and butterflies have thin, smooth antennas. Butterflies love: purple coneflowers, butterfly weed, butterfly bush, and other flowers that have lots of nectar. Do not touch the butterfly, you are a giant to them and you could easily damage their wings.

, Bees also like the nectar from the same flowers as butterflies. There are many kinds of bees, including honey bees, larger bumblebees, and even larger carpenter bees. Honey bees are just a little fuzzy with a yellow/gold abdomen. Bumble bees are very fuzzy with black and yellow. Honey bees gather pollen on their legs and use it to make honey in their hive.

, You will often find them together. Do not touch the wasps, they can sting if they get scared. Wasps come in many colors too. The yellow-jackets are yellow and black. Steel blue cricket killers are an iridescent black/blue. The cuckoo wasp is a metallic green. Wasps in the US range from very tiny 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), to 4 inch (10.2 cm) long cicada killers (they do sting), to 6 inch (15.2 cm) long megarhyssa. The megarhyssa has a 3"" body, 3"" egg tube, but no stinger.

, There are several bugs you might find here.

, You can pick one up. It might crawl on you and tickle you, or it might roll into a ball. Gently poke it to make it roll into a ball. After a minute (be real still) it will unroll and wander around in your hand. Pill bugs eat dead wood or dead leaves.

, They are safe to pick up, but are messy. They have 2-4 antennas which are their eyes. They leave a slime trail wherever they go. They need a damp place to live.

, They eat dead leaves also.

, The common centipede is a golden color, flat, and has many legs that stick way out from its side.

, They look like a tube with legs going straight up and down. They are not flat. You can catch them, but they will probably freeze. If you hold real still and do not breathe on them they might start moving again.

, There are many sizes of ants, from the tiny brown sugar ants, commonly found between your sidewalk cracks (which also appear in your kitchen looking for sugary foods), to larger carpenter ants which eat wood.

, They eat other bugs and are called ""shield bugs"".

, Japanese beetles are smaller beetles and have iridescent, metallic green and yellow colors. June beetles are a dark brown. They do not bite, and are slow moving. They can fly and they might try to fly away if you pick them up!

, You should get a heavy duty minnow net with a 5 foot (1.5 m) handle so your teacher can scrape the bottom of the pond or stream.;
, Make good contact with the bottom the whole time then quickly bring up the net so nothing swims out of it.

, Crayfish can really hurt if they pinch you, you must be specially trained to pick up an adult crayfish. If the crayfish is under an inch it should not be able to pinch you. Crayfish eat dead and dying plants and animals on the bottom of the stream. Crayfish have many names like: crawfish, clawfish, mudbug, and others.

, They eat things that are smaller than themselves. There are too many types of minnows to name. but if the adult is less then 4 inches (10.2 cm) long, it's probably a minnow. In the spring they swarm by the hundreds or thousands in the same place to lay eggs.

, They look like skinny sticks with legs. Some have a breathing tube as their tail, which they poke above the water to breathe. If you catch one in a net it is safe to pick them up GENTLY by the breathing tube. Don't get near their mouth, they will bite if scared! They eat anything that swims by.

, Toad tadpoles, or ""toadpoles"", are solid black and the smallest of the bunch. Frog tadpoles are always shades of green and tan. Bullfrog tadpoles can take up to 2 years to turn into a frog, and they are the biggest of them all! The head and tail can measure 3 inches (7.6 cm)!

, Pick it up by the sides so it doesn't bite you. It is also called a ""toe biter"" because sometimes swimmers step on them, they get scared, and bite the person on the toe. The bite is not dangerous but it sure hurts! Giant water bugs can fly. They come out at night and can be found below porch lamps there were turned on at night. They can also be found after they land in a pool, or land on a car windshield because it looks like water. In some countries, like India, the giant water bug is called a ""water scorpion"".

, Mosquito larva are worm-shaped, but have to breathe air. If they feel someone walking buy, or see a moving shadow, they will wiggle themselves in an ""S"" shape to the bottom of the pool. Wigglers can be found in almost any standing water. Adult midges look just like mosquitoes but midges do not bite. Larva get to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) long at most. Mosquito larva that look like a comma will hatch into adults within 24 hours.

, They are called ""glass"" shrimp because they are clear. Their stomach is at the top of their back, behind their eyes, and you can see what he ate. They are also called ""ghost shrimp"".

, They are also called ""tadpole shrimp"". They have short life spans, about 6-8 weeks. They look like tiny 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) long horseshoe crabs. Their eggs survive drying, so they are sold in hobby stores. The triops got its name because it has 3 eyes, although you can see only 2. The shape of its eyes make it look mad, but it is safe to pick up. It may flop around in your hand and tickle you.

For the rubbing alcohol, simply take a shoelace, and soak about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in the alcohol, for several seconds, and then use sooner than later, as the alcohol will evaporate.,
For the potassium nitrate, mix the potassium with sugar in a container, at the ratio of 1:1.

,
Then take a 6 inch (15.2 cm) piece of shoelace, and soak it in water for several seconds, and then place in the container of potassium and sugar, so that the string is fully coated.

,
Take the string and then let it sit flat out, so it can dry for 24 hours.

,
And there you have your homemade fuse for smoke bombs, along with any other bomb that needs a fuse.

",How to Make a Firework Fuse for Smoke Bombs," Simply use as a fuse and light. This will make a flame towards the explosive on the string, opposed to a series of sparks, as the average fuse.;

Place the baking soda square inside the bottle.,
Find a safe place to set off the bomb.,
Take the bottle and the bottle cap outside.",How to Make a Bottle Bomb1," Tear a paper towel in half or tear off a square of plastic wrap, approximately 7 inches by 7 inches. Measure out about a tablespoon of baking soda and place it in the center of the paper towel or plastic wrap. Set aside.;
, Pour about an inch to an inch-and-a-half of vinegar into the bottle. Be careful not to fill it too full or the bomb may explode before you’re ready.

, Pick up the paper towel or plastic wrap by the corners so that the baking soda is cupped inside. Stuff the cupped paper towel or plastic wrap just inside the mouth of the bottle so that the portion with the baking soda is just past the mouth and the corners of the paper towel or plastic wrap are poking out of the top of the bottle.


Don’t let the paper towel/plastic wrap drop all the way into the bottle.

, You want a place with plenty of open space, away from people, animals, and property. Keep in mind that you’ll be throwing the bottle, so there should be enough open space for you to be able to throw the bottle a safe distance away from you.

, Bring them to the place where you plan to set off the bomb. Push the paper towel or plastic wrap all the way into the bottle. Screw on the cap and vigorously shake the bottle. As soon as you feel the bottle begin to harden from the internal pressure, throw the bottle up and away from you. The bottle should explode when it hits the ground.


Be very careful when shaking the bottle because it could potentially explode in your hands. Take the proper precautions.

Throw the ball against the wall.,
Allow the next player to receive the ball.,
Play until the ball is out.,
Throw a fumbling receiving player out.,
Continue the game after someone is out.",How to Play Wall Ball1," Find a large, flat wall with no windows and decide who will start the game. Establish the parameters of the court by either marking lines or using ready made boundaries like bushes or lines on the concrete. The game starts once the first player serves the ball, or throws the ball, at the wall. Ensure that the ball must bounces once before it reaches the wall.You may play with just 2 players or with multiple players at once. Decide the order of players to keep things organized. Depending on the size of the court and the variations of the rules, players must determine how far they are allowed to stand from the wall prior to the serve. For example, some rules indicate that everyone must stand back behind the throwing line prior to the first serve, in line with the server. Other rules state that only the thrower must stand behind the line.
Do not choose a wall that you may damage or is close to items that you can damage like windows or cars. It also is ideal to find a wall where the ground has a slight decline towards the players.;
, As a receiving player, allow the ball to bounce once after it has hit the wall and then return it. Return the ball by hitting it with your hand and letting it reach the wall directly, without bouncing on the ground.Follow your order. If you’re first, that means you're the server! Serve the ball. If your turn is second, third, or fourth, but you play the ball out of order, you are out.

, The ball is out when it bounces on a boundary line or outside of the boundaries completely, hits the ground before it hits the wall, bounces twice before a player is able to return it, or if a receiving player doesn’t let the ball bounce after it has hit the wall., If a receiving player fumbles the ball in an attempt to return it, she must run to the wall. Another player may then go for the ball in an attempt to throw it at the wall before the fumbling player reaches it. If the fumbling player does not touch the wall before the ball gets there, she is out of the game.If the fumbling player touches the wall before another player can throw the ball, she is still in the game.If the fumbling player reaches the wall first, she gets to serve again. If she is out, the next player takes her turn and serves to begin the game again.

, Depending on the rules, players may be eliminated in a variety of ways. Once someone is out, play is continued dependent on the rules that you and the other players have established. Common ways to continue play are:


If the thrower is out because another player catches the ball, play continues with the catcher as the new person serving the ball.
If the thrower is out because she has fumbled the ball and someone has thrown her out before she has had a chance to reach the wall, play continues with the person who threw her out as the new person serving the ball.
If a person who is not a thrower tries to field the ball but fumbles it, he must then try to reach the wall before someone throws him out. If he is thrown out, the same server still continues to serve.
For younger or less skilled players, play continues by establishing a throwing order at the beginning of the game. This gives everyone a chance to throw.

Open the plastic sandwich bag.,
Pour the vinegar.,
Place the plastic bag inside the bottle.,
Find a safe place to set off the bomb.,
Take it outside.",How to Make a Bottle Bomb2," Pour about a tablespoon of baking soda into the bag and hold the bag up by one of the upper corners so the baking soda will settle into one of the bottom corners of the bag. Cut the top off of the plastic bag and set aside.

, Pour about an inch to an inch-and-a-half of vinegar into the bottle. Be careful not to fill it too full or the bomb may explode before you’re ready.

, Pick up the plastic bag, making sure to keep the baking soda gathered in one corner. Stuff the end of the plastic bag containing the baking soda just inside the mouth of the bottle so that the portion with the baking soda is just past the mouth and the corners of the top of the plastic bag are poking out of the top of the bottle.


Don’t let the plastic bag drop all the way into the bottle.

, You want a place with plenty of open space, away from people, animals, and property. Keep in mind that you’ll be throwing the bottle, so there should be enough open space for you to be able to throw the bottle a safe distance away from you.

, Take the bottle and the bottle cap out to the place where you plan to set it off. Push the plastic bag all the way into the bottle. Screw on the cap and vigorously shake the bottle. As soon as you feel the bottle begin to harden from the internal pressure, throw the bottle up and away from you. The bottle should explode when it hits the ground.Be very careful when shaking the bottle because it could potentially explode in your hands. Take the proper precautions.

If you need help getting the object through the center of the Mentos, you can gently tap it with a hammer to push it through. Be careful not to hurt yourself.
You can also try tying the string or floss around the Mentos rather than through it, but be sure it’s tied very tightly., Run about four inches of string (sewing thread or floss works best) through the hole in the Mentos. Hold the string by the two ends so that the Mentos is suspended in the center.

, Put the Mentos just inside to the mouth of the bottle—don’t let it touch the soda—and drape the ends of the string over the lip of the bottle.

, Keeping the ends of the string outside the bottle, screw the cap back on so that the string is held in place by the tightened cap. Cut off the portions of string left dangling outside the cap.

, When they unscrew the cap, the Mentos will drop into the soda and cause the soda to explode out of the bottle. (Be prepared for a mess.)"

Using baseball rules to give each player 3 strikes.,
Adding a butts up rule to the 3 strikes process.,
Create rules for throwing.,
Evoke a no bouncing rule.",How to Play Wall Ball2," When a receiving player fumbles the ball, the player must still touch the wall before another player is able to throw the ball, however, if the ball gets to the wall before he does, he gets a strike and continues playing until he gets her third strike. Allowing each player to have 3 strikes extends the game if you play until everyone is out except for the winner., When a person receives a strike, you may penalize him by making him place his hands on the wall while the other players each get a turn at throwing the ball at his butt. Only allow one throw per person and only allow players to throw at the butt because it’s very unlikely the player will get injured., For advanced players, you can add bonus points or penalties for things like one handed catches, one footed catches, using your left hand to throw or catch, etc. If a rule is broken you can penalize a person or reward a player for pulling off a difficult trick.


For example, you can evoke the rule of only catching with your left hand. If your opponent uses his right hand to catch then he gets penalized with a strike or butts up.

, Speed up the game by removing any bounces. Players must move closer to the wall and be ready for the fast pace of back and forth. Be careful as the quickened play can become dangerous as players try to cover their ground.

"

Psych out other players.,
Think about how to get quick strikes on other players.,
Look to be the thrower.",How to Play Wall Ball3," Strategize ways to get your opponents out including using dodgeball rules to be able to direct the ball at an opponent instead of the wall so that she drops it and is then out. You may also distract your opponents before he tries to receive the ball so that he fumbles it and is penalized with a strike.You may throw at the direction of players you know are scared to catch the ball to build on the nerves and increase the likelihood that they will fumble and be out of the game.
Dare a bad thrower to throw in your direction if you know you can catch it and get him out.

, Use the rules to your advantage. For example, if you are playing with rules like “left handsies” where everyone must only catch with their left hand, aim at player’s right hand so that it makes it difficult for them to reach over and catch it with there left.


You may also throw the ball close to the end line so that a receiving player may be forced to step out of bounds if she attempts to catch it.

, The thrower has an automatic advantage because only she knows where the ball will go. If you have good aim and timing you will be able to continue your turn as the thrower as you get other players out. However, this may be difficult if you do not start as the thrower. Look to catch the ball if the server fumbles or for similar opportunities to establish yourself as the new thrower.

Use a lighter to heat the bottom.,
Back away quickly at first sign of smoke.",How to Make a Cheap Smoke Bomb1,";
, Use a hobby knife, small screwdriver, a toothpick, or ice pick.

,, This may take 5 to 10 seconds.

, Because the smoke is toxic and it smells bad. Run quickly and cover your nose.


If you are afraid of holding it or if its in a windy situation you could use a fuse. Fuse could be bought in stores or you could create it from paper. To do it, you need to take a paper (size depends on your bomb), wrap 1/2 of the bomb using the paper but, if you wrap them all, the result is that it wouldn't smoke, but a huge fire. So, after folding it 1/2 of the bomb, you need to make a tail out of it. Now as usual, light up the tail. Yes it's slow but its better if you do this on windy days.

Go out to a densely wooded area.,
Gather as much Moss as possible.,
Lump the dry lichen and moss together.

,
Get some twine of any length over 5 inches (12.7 cm), give or take.,
Bundle it into either one large loose ball shaped mass or multiple small ones.,
Get some more twine in a length of 10+ inches and this time only ""loosen it up"".

,
Take the loosened twine and soak small parts of it in a flammable liquid (lighter fluid, gas, oil?, etc.),
Use the loosened twine to gently bind up the loose ball shaped lichen/moss/twine fiber mass.,
Tie the loose twine ends together in a Square Knot.,
Set it outside somewhere.",How to Make a Cheap Smoke Bomb2," Gather as much lichen as possible. The best kind of lichen are ones that are, for lack of better word, ""spongy""

, The best kind of Moss to get are likewise ""spongy"" and appear green-white or light yellow -green/brown in color and generally hang off of tree branches in long hair-like looking clumps.


Make sure it's DRY, if not set it somewhere air-tight and warm (""room-temperature"")

,, Unravel it so it's a tangled mess of fibers, then add it to the lichen/moss lump.


Thoroughly scramble/mix/toss/combine them with each other.

, It's your choice but it works better as one large mass.

,,

, Loop it around and through the ball multiple times finishing with both ends next to each other.

,


This is optional but for added measure you could spray or ""mist"" the tied up LMTF (lichen/moss/twine fiber) with bug spray or an aerosol deodorant as both of these are equally flammable.

, Make a small opening in the LMTF ball that goes straight to the center of it, light a matchstick it into the opening, and drop it inside it. Now step back and wait a little, as it takes the moss and the lichen a little bit to ignite.


If it works properly it should start sending up huge thick gusts of white smoke. There exists a chance however that the twine will actually catch fire eventually turning the whole thing into a fireball.
This one is much less noxious then the ping-pong ball one because moss and lichen do NOT burn naturally, it just smolders and makes nothing but minimal heat and LOTS of smoke. (They can burn if drenched in lighter fluid or if the fire is ridiculously hot.) Therefore the smoke it makes smells just like that; smoke. Not a nasty smelling smoke or a pleasant campfire smoke. Just smoke-smoke it's completely neutral smelling, but that does NOT mean you can just stand there and smell it all day! Smoke is still bad for you lungs regardless of smell.

The twine also doesn't burn but it still smolders and generates more heat then moss or lichen does, plus it goes up in minute flames in a matter of seconds.

You and nine other of your colleagues, friends, family, or complete strangers arrive at a Whirly Ball court.,
Spend a moment to stretch out your arms and back, by pulling one arm across your body for ten seconds and then repeat with the other arm.

There will be 15 minutes on the scoreboard, so you and four others use that time to compete against five other players.,
To move the “whirly bug”, place one hand on the crankshaft located in the middle of the whirly bug and move it left or right.,
To put the “whirly bug” into reverse, complete one circular revolution with the crankshaft; to return to forward direction, complete a circular revolution once again.

,
After conquering the crankshaft operations and “whirly bug” steering, identify which backboard and net relates to your team, and direct your whirly bug towards the wiffle ball.

,
The goal of the game is to carry the wiffle ball in your track-ball racquet until you are in a position to launch the wiffle ball towards the net.

,
Upon hitting the net with the wiffle ball, a sensor will trip, a horn will sound, and your team will be awarded two points.

Play until the victor is decided.",How to Play Tetherball," The equipment for tetherball is relatively simple. Each court is composed of a ball on a rope attached to a ten foot pole. The court is divided into two sides, one for each player, that should evenly divide the pole in half. Your goal when playing tetherball is to hit the ball with your hand in a way that gets it past your opponent so that the rope winds completely around the tetherball pole.





;
, The tetherball court is divided in half and is usually marked off by chalk or a line in the cement. If there are no markers for the side boundaries, be sure to ask other players. You will be expected to stay on your side of the court while facing your opponent.









Going off-sides will result in the offending player getting a penalty., Opposite of soccer rules, tetherball requires you to only touch the ball with your hands. Touching the ball with another part of your body can result in a penalty against you. Open, closed, or double handed strikes are allowed - use what works best for you!








A popular house rule, sometimes called ""beach tetherball,"" allows for the use of any part of the body during play.

, Using the rope, a player can launch the ball in a way that makes it difficult for opposing players to return. This is why touching the rope is considered an illegal move. Touching the tetherball pole is also illegal and will result in the immediate loss of the game for the player who touched it.








A common house rule allows players to hold the rope where it meets the ball only when serving.

, This might seem obvious, but violating this rule can be tempting. By holding the ball for a split second, you can redirect it out of the reach of your opponent, which is illegal and referred to as ""carrying.""









All contact between you and the ball should result in it bouncing off your hands right away, otherwise it is considered a rule violation.
Unless a house rule says otherwise, serves must also be hit and not thrown or ""carried."", Each time the ball crosses onto your side of the court, you are allowed a single hit. The one exception to this rule are rebounds off the pole. If the ball hits the pole and returns to a player, the player may hit the ball again as though it were his first hit. Hitting the ball more than once is often called ""juggling.""









Each time the ball passes the boundary line or bounces off the pole, the hit counter is reset to zero.Hitting more the once will result in a penalty.

, Because of the fact that tetherball is an informal game, there may be special rules, called ""house rules,"" that you'll need to take into account while playing. These rules might be slight variations on rules you are already familiar with, but by asking for the house rules up front, you'll prevent yourself from getting an unnecessary penalty.








, Whenever a player breaks the rules, play should be stopped immediately and the ball returned to its position when the violation occurred. This includes the number of wraps; wraps around the pole gained from violations should be unwound. Additionally:









Possession of the ball goes to the player who did not break the rules. This player should then serve the ball.
Three rule violations results in an immediate loss for the rule breaking player.
Some house rules allow an extra wrap in favor of the player who did not break the rules., When both players commit a violation of the rules, a pole drop will decide play. This is where both player hold the tetherball with a single hand over the boundary line about three feet ( .91 m) away from the pole. Both players then drop the ball and after the ball hits the pole, game play resumes.







, Having poorly marked or unclear boundaries can result in arguments as to whether or not someone stepped off-sides. Keep this from happening clearly marking boundaries with clear lines drawn in the dirt, gravel, or on the cement with a piece of chalk.








, You'll also have to decide which player will serve first. The victor of the previous game is typically allowed the first serve, however if there was no previous game, you might select the serving player with a coin toss.









The direction of the first serve is always the decided by the player returning the serve., The game begins when one player serves the ball, usually by holding it in one hand and hitting it with the other. You might try a punching motion, as this can pop the ball outside the reach of your opponent.







, Each player should try to hit the ball, one clockwise, and the other counterclockwise. It is generally acceptable to hit the ball with either the fist or the open hand, but be sure you don't ""carry"" the ball when using an open handed strike.







, There is no rule in tetherball stating that you must hit the ball, so you might allow the ball to zoom past you intentionally to throw off your opponent. You can also hit the ball in the same direction as your opponent, sometimes sneaking it by him and giving you a better position to strike the ball out of his reach. To trick your opponent, you also might:









Pop slower balls over the head of your opponent by lightly punching the ball upwards with your knuckles.
Hit the ball lightly when your opponent expects a harder return.

, When one player manages to wind the ball all the way around the pole so that it can be wound no farther, the game ends. A match can consist of one, three, five, or more games depending on house rules.









In some versions of the game, the ball must strike the pole with the final wrap above a height goal marked on the pole, generally a five foot (1½ m) high mark.
A height goal lower than five feet (1½ m) can be used for younger players.
If you want to mark a height goal for your tetherball set, consider using some colored electrical tape."

Make sure that each player has their own number.
, It must then shout out a number while throwing the ball in the air. All players, including ""it"", must run away from the ball. But, if your number is called, you must catch the ball and say ""Spud!"" When you say ""spud"", everyone must freeze., Now, they have to throw it at that player. If they miss, or the player catches the ball, the thrower gets an ""S"". If the player gets hit, they get an ""S"". The player that they hit (or missed) is the next thrower., If a ghost number is called, everyone must rush up to the ball and touch it. The last player to do so gets a letter., For each letter a player gets, spell out S-P-U-D. If you spell out S-P-U-D you lose. The last player standing is the winner."

Understand the field.,
Learn the positions.,
Learn how to score.,
Understand how to get someone out.",How to Play Kickball1," The field is set up like a diamond. If you have ever watched baseball, it is the same as a baseball diamond.Home base, where the ‘batter’ kicks the ball from, is the base of the diamond. First base is diagonally fifteen yards away from home base up to the right. Second base is diagonally up to the left fifteen yards away from first base, and third base is diagonally up to the left from home base.


Foul territory is everything outside of the line from home base to first base, and home base to third base extending into the outfield. ;
, The defensive positions include a pitcher, a catcher, three players to cover each base, three out fielders, and one shortstop to cover the area between second and third base. When your team is on offense you take turns standing at home base and kicking the ball that the pitcher from the opposite team rolls at you. The pitcher rolls the ball to the kicking team across home plate. They stand about 10 yards (9 m) away from home plate.
The catcher tries to tag players out at home base and passes the ball back to the pitcher.
The players covering each base try to get the ball after the opposing team kicks it. Once they get the ball the goal is to tag the runner out before they get to the base safely.
You tag a runner out by touching them with the ball or throwing the ball at them.
The outfielders want to get the ball if the opposing team kicks it away from the players covering the bases and pass it to one of the bases so that their teammate can tag a runner out.
The shortstop tries to stop the ball from bouncing into the outfield and also wants to tag runners out or pass it to the players covering the bases.

, A team scores a run when a player touches all four bases in order and touches home base without getting out. When it is your turn to be up at bat, the pitcher from the opposite team will roll the ball to you. You try to kick the ball in such a way that it stays in the field of play. Once you kick the ball, you immediately try to run to first base before the opposite team tags you with the ball or touches first base with the ball. If you make it to first base, you are safe.Whenever you are on a base you cannot be tagged out.


If you have a really good kick, you might be able to run all the way to second or third base before they catch you.
The team with the most runs at the end of a game wins. A Kickball game lasts six innings. During an inning each team gets a chance to kick. Your team continues to kick until you have accumulated three outs., The defensive team needs to get three outs before they can switch to offense. There are four ways to get an out.The pitcher can strike the batter out. If the pitcher rolls three good pitches at the batter and the batter fails to keep the ball outside of the foul zone or misses the pitch all together, that is called a strikeout. The next player on the offensive team will then come up to bat. Some friendly kickball games play without strikeouts.
A tag out occurs when a defensive player touches an offensive player with the ball when they are not on a base. The defensive team can cause a force out if the ball gets to a base before the offensive player arrives and they offensive player can’t go back to their previous base. They can’t go back to their previous base if it is occupied by a teammate or if it is home base. The defensive team can catch a fly ball. If the ball is kicked into the air by the offense and the opposing team catches it before it hits the ground that is considered an out.

Gather your materials.,
Find an open space.,
Assemble a group of people who want to play.",How to Play Kickball2," You need four bases, although you can use shoes or shirts to designate bases if you don’t have any real bases available. You also need a rubber ball about the size of a basketball. , You do not need to play with an official size field, but you should have enough space to run around and kick the ball. Since people are going to be kicking a rubber ball you should make sure you are not in a place where you will damage anything fragile or valuable. , Ideally you want nine people on your team and eighteen people total. You can’t play kickball by yourself, and it’s generally accepted that you should have at least four people on each team. With fewer people it becomes much harder to play the field or to get people on bases.


Remember to decide who will be on which team.

Roll the ball.,
Kick the ball.,
Switch sides after three outs.,
Determine the winner at the end, based on the number of runs.",How to Play Kickball3," The other team will have to take the field while choosing defensive positions. One person on the defensive team must be the pitcher.

, The team who kicks first should choose a kicking order. The offensive team should get in a line to determine who will kick the ball first, second, third and so on.

, The pitcher rolls the kicking team the ball. The kicker stands at home base and the pitcher rolls the ball directly toward them over home base. They should roll it in such a way that the ball stays flat to the ground. The ball shouldn’t bounce wildly – that is considered a bad pitch. You are allowed to roll it fast, but kickball is supposed to be a fun game. Generally you want the other team to kick the ball and then it is up to your team to play good defense.

, The first person in line on the offensive team will try to kick the ball out towards the field as it rolls towards them. Start running as soon as you have kicked the ball as long as it remains in the field of play. You can kick it on the ground or in the air.


Try to kick the ball so that it doesn’t go right at a defender.
The kicker runs to first base, then second base, and so on around the bases. If you get back home base again after touching all other bases, you score one run. The defensive players try to catch the ball in the air to earn an out. If the defensive players are unable to catch the ball, they run to get the ball and then run or pass the ball to the base ahead of the kicker. They want to get to the base in time to touch the base while holding the ball, or touch the kicker himself with the ball. , Once the team gets three outs, the two teams switch places. The offensive players take up defensive positions and the defensive players form a batting order. You then continue to play the game in the same way.


Once each side has batted once, the inning is over. You play six innings in kickball before you determine the winner of the game.

, The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.After the game the two teams can line up side by side and shake hands and say "" good game"" to show good sportsmanship.

You need to mark off a 33 foot (10.1 m) line which is the distance balls are initially thrown from parallel to the trunk and extending three feet to either side from the end of the trunk width (so the initial throw line is three feet wider than the trunk on either side).,Game starts as one player is on offense (at throw line) and the other on defense (playing goalie at the trunk--can essentially stand anywhere)

,
Offensive player throws at the trunk to score a goal.,
Note that securing the ball after a shot must be with two hands.,
Note that in free ball scenario, there are no rules for moving toward goal or defending the goal other that general rules of fair play such as no hitting, kicking, tripping, punching, or other universally recognized acts of violence.,
A goal is scored when ball enters trunk and remains there.,
Games continue until one player announces that each player has ""X"" number of shots remaining.,
Sudden-Death Overtime: If players are tied at the end of regulation play, there is a sudden-death overtime scenario.,
Believe me, you will be tired after this game.

",How to Play Trunkball,";
,, If ball is caught or secured by goalie, the ball is dead and goalie switches to offense. If ball misses target but does not strike vehicle, ball is also dead and positions switch. If ball strikes car and bounces away, it is a live ball and either player may pursue. If goalie secures, ball is dead and positions switch. If offensive player secures, they may shoot at goal from any location. In this scenario, the goalie may seek to block the shot or swipe ball free and secure.

, A single-hand hold may be legally stolen.

, However, bumping, pushing, and hand/arm waving are allowed.

, A ball that enters trunk and bounces out is no goal (as it cannot necessarily be verified by the defensive player).

, If the other player agrees, this scenario is played out. The other player may, however, offer an alternative number (usually higher if that player is behind in the game), and a negotiation ensues until an agreement is made. If no agreement, play continues until another announcement is made. If no agreement is made a second time, an automatic ten shot each rule is imposed. Whoever is leading at the end of all remaining shots used is the winner.

, Players determine who shoots first by a best of three rock-paper-scissors game. Game ends when first player scores.

Field of play;

As a kicker, it's still three strikes and you’re out for most leagues, including WAKA.,
Unlike baseball, there are a variety of rules regarding foul balls.,
You can’t kick the ball before it begins to cross home plate.,
The key to a good kick is to step past the ball with your non-kicking foot (but not out of the batter’s box) and slam the ball with the laces part of your shoe.,
Understand that kicking with the front tip of your foot can lead to erratic consequences.

,
For a good bunt, first decide where you want the ball to go before the pitch.,
In the rare circumstance that you want the ball to go along the 1st baseline, if you are right-footed, do the same with the outside of your foot.,
Kick harder when you know the catcher has a good throwing arm so it takes him/her longer to get to it.

,
Try to aim the kick - a kickball travels more slowly than a baseball, so you will have more time to set up before it comes to you.

,
If you know there is a “weak-link” in the outfield, move in an arc to get behind the ball and be able to kick it straight to that person when the ball passes in front of you.,
No stealing, no lead-offs.,
You can still run past first base (but not second or third).,
If you’re on base and there are two outs, run on any kick.

,
You must run along the baseline, whether it is real or imaginary.

,
Regardless of how the ball got there, if you touch the ball while running, you’re out.

,
If you are already on base when the kicker is up, remember that you must tag up if the ball is caught before advancing to the next base.",How to Play Kickball for Adults1,", For other leagues, however, it may be four strikes or more.

, For WAKA, foul balls never count as strikes and a total of four are allowed before the player is called out. In some leagues however, foul balls always count as strikes – even a third (and fourth, depending on how many strikes are allowed to begin with). In ZogSports, ...

, If you do, it’s a foul or a strike (depending on the league). You can kick it as far back as you like, as long as it gets into fair territory.

,


When the top of your foot makes contact the ball it should be nearly vertical and your knee – along with the rest of your body - should be over the ball.
If the top of your foot is nearly horizontal when you make contact with the ball (which probably means you kicked the ball too late in your kicking arc), your kick will result in a pop-fly which is far easier to catch.

,, If you are right-footed and want the ball to go along the 3rd baseline, pivot and kick with the side of your foot, so the instep of your foot is facing the field. This is the more useful direction to bunt because, based on typical circumstances, a bunt is used to help get a runner on 1st base.

, The opposite applies for both of the previous two tips if you're left-footed.

,,,


“Sacrificial Pop-fly” - if there are no outs or only 1 out and a runner is on 3rd, do not bunt because the runner will get out at home. Instead, go for the kick – even if it’s a pop-fly and caught, the run scores. Kick towards right field so it is unlikely to touch the runner when he/she is coming home.

, Your foot must be on base until the ball is kicked, otherwise you’re out.

, This is encouraged – there is no point in slowing down to stop on it, it just matters that you touch it.

,,,,


Under certain circumstances, some people would recommend always trying for an additional base. It will likely catch the opposing team off guard. If you are going to try though, do not hesitate – you’ll have wasted your window of opportunity.

Find at least four people and a tennis ball.,
Make two bases.,
Pick two ends.,
Play.",How to Play Pickle," The more, the better. Why four? You need two ends and at least two runners. You could have one runner, but the game would become boring very quickly. If you can't find a tennis ball, another small ball that is not to hard will work fine.;
, You need two bases about thirty yards apart on the ground that multiple people can stand on. You can use a baseball plate, draw a circle with chalk, a sewer lid on the street, or anything else that works as a base.

, Pick two people to be the ends. Each end stands near, but not on, one of the bases. During the game, they will throw a tennis ball back and forth to each other, trying to get the runners to run.

, The rest of the people are the runners. The runners run back and forth between the bases while the ends try to hit them with the ball. When they are touching the base, the end cannot hit them. They can stay on a base as long as they want. In the beginning of the game, the runners stand in the middle of the playing area. The ends throw the ball back and forth three times, then play begins and the runners run to a base. They can leave the base whenever they want to go to the other base, or, go back to the original base. When a runner is hit or tagged by the ball off a base, they get an out. After three outs, the runner becomes an end. The end that recorded the final out becomes a runner.

"
"
Know that throwing is probably the most difficult part of kickball since the ball is so large.

,
If you have large enough hands you can palm the ball and throw it.,
Throwing the ball to a cutoff (a person between you and the person you want to eventually get the ball), when available, is strongly encouraged.

,
When attempting to catch a kicked ball, try to get under the ball.

,
Cup your arms in front of you, elbows touching your torso and in a ""V"" shape - almost as if you were carrying firewood.

,
As soon as you touch the ball, immediately bring it to your chest and clamp it.

,
Be aware that if you hold your arms out too far from your body, the ball - being rather slippery - will likely go right through your hands.,
Also, play further out in the outfield and expect to run in.,
Communication is essential: yell “got it,” otherwise collisions may ensue.

",How to Play Kickball for Adults2,", For the rest of us, you can either cup the ball with one arm, squeezing the ball into your elbow, and fling it - or just throw it with two arms.

,,,,,


If you do not clamp fast enough, the ball may bounce off your arms or chest.
Remember: you’re catching the ball with your full upper body, not just your hands.

, It’s far easier to run forward to catch a ball then it is to run backwards.

Choose a ball.,
Find a site.,
Gather some friends.,
Start the game by having a designated person say ""Ga"".,
Hit the ball at the other players while using your hands to block.,
Don't hold the ball.,
Remove eliminated players.,
Continue to the final players.,
Ease the rules for younger players.",How to Play Ga Ga," It should be a good sized, ball that inflates. A kickball, volleyball or a soccer ball is perfect for this game though both have their faults. A kickball is soft and bounces well, but it is harder to hit and is almost too bouncy. A soccer ball is perfect, except that it can hurt if hit too hard. A smaller ball will work if nothing else is available, but be careful what size ball you choose. Too large, and it complicates things. Too small, and it makes the game harder, if not impossible.;
, Choose an enclosed space that is clear of debris. It could be a room clear of furniture or a squash court. It must be as level as possible, as inclines will make the game harder.

, The game is intended to be for a large group, hopefully for five people or more. There should be no more than 30 people. Obviously, the number of people you can have is limited by your playing space.

, Have everyone else say ""Ga"" back, to indicate that they are ready The designated person then throws the ball against the side of the playing area or throws it up in the air. When the ball has bounced once, it is live and the game begins.

, For the best stance, hunch over and hold your arms and fists in front of your legs, with your palms facing outward. Face the ball at all times, and you will be tough to eliminate.


Other tips in include hitting the ball with your fists (although this is not for everyone, as stronger players could hurt younger ones), being defensive as well as offensive, and trying to stop the ball instead of trying to hit it.

, You are allowed to hit the ball, but no more than once in a row. If you ""double hit"" the ball, then you're out. However, you may hit the ball twice if it has bounced off a wall in between hits. Note that even touching the ball counts as hitting it.

, They should stand off to the side or in a corner, and make sure they are stationary. If the ball bounces off these people by accident, treat them as walls.


Another way to do this, if you have boards enclosing the area, is to have them crouch outside the boards (they are free to move around the outside of the boards). In this version, the eliminated players can try to hit the ball and get a player who is still in the game, out. If they do so, they take that player's place.

, When two people are left, it becomes a showdown. Eliminated players can still try to get the final players out. In the showdown, players are allowed to touch the ball three times in a row, although still may not hold the ball.

, Consider a rule where younger children have to be hit below the knees multiple times to be out.

Set up a field.,
Form two equal teams.,
Each team should go to their side and play begins.,
When all six cones are covered by tennis balls, you win.

",How to Play Cover the Cones," The field should be cut into two equal halves with a center line dividing them. The players are safe on their own side, but on the opposing teams side, they can be tagged. Parallel to the center line, at the end of each half there should be a safety line. If a player gets behind the opposing teams safety line, they are safe. The cones should be set up in a vertical line about five feet from the safety line. There should also be sidelines that if a player crosses, they are out of bounds.;
, The game works best with at least ten people on each team.

, Players can act as offense, defense, or both. However, it is wise to keep at least one person guard each cone with a ball on top of it.


Offensive players run into the opposing teams side. Their goal; grab a tennis ball and return it to their side. If they are tagged by an opposing player, or they step out of bounds, they become ""frozen,"" and must stay where they are and cannot catch a tennis ball. Likewise, if a frozen player is tagged by a teammate, they become unfrozen and can run again. If a player passes the safety line, they cannot be tagged. They are safe as long as they have some part of their body in the safety zone. If a player manages to grab a tennis ball from the other team, they can either try to run it back to their side, or throw it to a team member on either side. They can go into the safe zone to make their throw. If they are tagged with the ball, the ball is returned to the cone and the player is frozen. If the throw hits the ground before it is caught, the ball is returned. If the player does manage to bring the ball to their side, they place it on an empty cone.
Defensive players stay on their own side. Their goal; tag opposing players and guard the tennis balls. You cannot touch your own tennis balls when they are on the cones. However, you can put them back if they fall or touch the ground and intercept it if an opposing player attempts to pass it.

Pick your teams.,
Make sure you have a ball.,
Start the game.",How to Play Balance Ball," Similar to when playing games such as Netball or Basketball, team leaders (captains of two teams) will have to choose their team. there must be an even number of people on each team but it doesn't matter how many people there are. Balance Ball is a game for large groups so it really doesn't matter if there are lots of people.
, For this one, it really doesn't matter what type of ball it is as long as it is small and round like a tennis ball, but it has to be soft because you have to be hitting people with it.
, This game doesn't have a particular time limit so it just goes on until you want to stop. Basically, the teams have to decide who is going in first. If for example, if the Blue team is going in first, the Red team would have to choose two people to stand on each side of a distance of your choice. Don't make it too far away though because then the other two might not be able to throw the ball far enough.

After all that, one person in the Blue team is going to stand in the middle of the two people who are standing from a distance. One of those two people will hold the ball. They have to try to hit the middle person from the opponent team with the ball and the middle is obviously gonna have to balance by moving away from the ball and running to the other side.
For example: the Red team has the ball. The person standing on the right hand side of the distance will throw the ball to the person on the left hand side but will also try to hit the person in the middle. The middle person will move to the other side. Basically, the middle person can only stand next to the person without the ball, otherwise they will be hit.
If the ball is on the right, they run to the left and if the ball is on the left, they run back to the right, still making sure the ball doesn't touch them. If the ball touches any part of their body, they are out and another person from the same team would come in until everyone in the Blue team is out. Then they swap.

"
"
Follow the rules as they are quite simple.,
Game play continues until one of these things occurs:


The ball is hit out (that means out of the squares)
Once someone gets out they swap with the person below them.,
There are also other rules used during the playing of this game an these are as follows:


There is a thing called Reserves.,
You may change the rules if you want but the main thing is that there is 4 squares or 2 squares and there is always king, queen, jack and dunce.

,
If you want to play 8 square then you would have to split a square in half.

",How to Play Downball,"


There is a king, queen, jack, and dunce (like any 4 square) or if you are playing 2 square then it is only king and dunce.
The king serves the ball, bouncing the ball (you can buy rubber ones in most sport shops, if you can't just use tennis ball) in his square first then it lands in an opponents square.
The player who receives the ball hits it by hitting it in his square first which goes into another square;
, For example, King gets out and has to swap with Queen.
The ball is fulled (meaning that the player hit the ball into his opponent's square without first hitting it into his own) This is called straight.
The ball is double bounced (meaning that the ball is hit, but does not reach another square on the second bounce)
The ball may bounce in a square, then be hit into that square and then from there into the next square, although this is optional. You may let it not bounce
If a line call (where it bounces in the middle of the squares) is unclear, then it is deemed a 'liner', where whoever gets the ball first bounces the ball into middle the of the squares,(in the middle of all points of squares) and when the ball bounces game play resumes
The ball is double touched (by a person on any part of body or clothing)

, With reserves you can play handball with over four player, though might be little boring for the reserve. A reserve sits on the sideline until Dunce gets out. Once Dunce gets out it swaps with the first reserve and the person just in Dunce goes into Reserve. If you have four Reserves then once Dunce gets out the first reserve goes into Dunce. The person in second reserve becomes first reserve. The person in third reserve becomes second reserve and the person who just got out goes to fourth reserve
You can also use things called footsies and headsies. Those are when you kick the ball or head the ball. When you kick or header it you are allowed to do fulls with the ball (hitting it over line without bouncing in your square first.
During the playing of the game the player in the King Square can call a certain number of squares such as Top, middle, or bottom 4, for the amount of players they want out during that round.

Serve the ball.,
Rally your serve.,
Set yourself up for the kill.,
Hit with the side of your fist.,
Watch the ball.,
Control your speed.,
Let it wrap.,
Be a good sport.",How to Excel at Tetherball," This is done by slowly tossing the ball out in front of you, then striking it in the middle with the side of your fist. Make sure you put all you can into this serve.;
, You do this by letting the rope wrap around twice, then hitting it in your favor with an open palm. You will build up momentum for an eventual kill, which will be discussed later.

, This is done by hitting the ball slower, yet higher, then bounce the ball off the pole, keeping it on your side. Once this is done, you hit the ball the same as you did to serve. Hopefully this will kill the opponent, giving you victory.

, The part of the hand you hit with is crucial. Make a fist, turn it sideways, and hit with the side. You can damage your hand palming or punching it, and you will not get good results.

, If it goes high, make the return strike higher. If it goes in the middle return in in the middle, but hit harder than your opponent. This will surprise your opponent and gain you a point!


Be sure to focus on the ball, not your opponent. While it's good strategy to watch your opponent for a second to see if you can guess his plan, try not to take your eye off the ball for too long.

, Rather than flailing as fast as you can, hit the ball with slow, deliberate motions. Your hits will have more power this way, tiring your opponent out faster.

, Sometimes you can trick an inexperienced player by letting him wrap once or twice and then standing by the side of the pole high and over his head (or slow and in front of him to unwrap and counter-strike). Be sure to return the strike with lots of power!

, Once you win (or even if you lose), be a good sport. Say ""good game"" to the other player, and mentally take note of things you need to work on for next time.

Inspect your lawn bowl.",How to Clean Lawn Bowls," If dirt, mud, or grass has collected in the grips of your lawn bowl, use a wooden skewer to pry the dirt out of them. Be gentle when doing this in order to avoid scratching the surface of your bowl. You don't have to remove all of the dirt at this point, but being able to remove the biggest chunks of dirt stuck in the grips will facilitate the next step.
, Using a sponge or rag soaked in warm water, wipe the surface of the bowl to remove any dirt that is left there. Be sure to wipe inside the grips as well to remove any residual dirt that you couldn't pry out using the skewer. Once all the dirt and grime has been removed, dry off your bowl completely before proceeding to the next step., This is similar to the microfibre cloth that you can use to clean your glasses. Using this cloth, wipe around the lawn bowl for about 10 minutes, turning the bowl as you go to ensure that you wipe over every bit of its surface at least 5 times. This will make sure that any dust on the bowl is gone so that it will be smooth and ready for the next step., This product is used to cover, fill, and hide any scratches or tiny chips on a lawn bowl. Spray it over the bowl lightly and use the microfibre cloth to firmly rub the spray over the surface of the bowl., Use a wax or gel polish that is specifically made for lawn bowls (this can be purchased from your local sports store) and follow the product's instructions to polish your bowl. Doing so will help improve the grip to ensure that you can play to the best of your ability., To get any excess materials or dust off of your bowl, cut the end off of a stocking and place the bowl in it. Then grab both ends of the stocking and rotate your arms to a 180 degree angle both sides. Once this is done, you can carefully remove the bowl from the stocking., Once you've completed the above steps, do a quick inspection of your bowl to make sure that it is clean. When inspecting the bowl, check for grip; shine; presence of dust, scratches, or chips; and the paint job. If you're unsatisfied with the way your bowl looks, repeat any of the above steps to improve its appearance."

Align yourself with the ball.You'll need to move your body so that you are in catching distance of the ball, but you should also try to line up your eyes with the ball so you can clearly see it incoming.,
Meet the ball with your hands.,
Grasp the ball.,
Cushion the impact of the ball.,
Stand so that you're ready to throw.,
Position your arm to throw the ball.,
Practice your wrist motion.,
Add a windup to your throw.",How to Catch a Ball1," Keep your eyes focused on the ball, and:


Adopt a wide stance to keep your balance when catching. It can help to keep one of your feet a little in front of the other.;
, As the ball moves through the air toward you, you're going to need to reach out with your hands to grab it mid-flight. Do not tense your hands; this can lead to pain from the impact. Instead:


Keep your hands wide-spread.
Keep your fingers relaxed.
Reach toward the ball., Depending on the speed at which the ball was thrown and the amount of spin on it, you might use either or both of your hands. For lobs and light throws, simply follow the ball with your eyes while reaching with your hands, and:


Watch the ball move into your reaching hands.
Squeeze your fingers around the ball to trap it in your hand.
NOTE: catching with two hands may be easier while you learn how to better coordinate your catching., This is especially important for cannon-throws or balls thrown at high speeds, which can hurt your hand. As you trap the ball with your fingers, allow your hand to follow the motion of the ball and ease it to a stop, as opposed to catching and stopping it immediately where it meets your hand.Keep your knees bent and your stance wide to improve balance when catching.
Bend your arms at the elbows to help reduce the force of the ball's impact.

, How you stand when throwing a ball can dramatically affect the outcome of your throw. When trying to throw a normal sized ball, you can achieve best results by standing so that:


Your feet are shoulder width apart.
You stand sideways to your target.
Your throwing arm is the farthest away from the target.
You are turned at the waist and facing your target., Holding the ball in your hand with your body in the proper stance, hold the ball upwards, so that your elbow is about the same height as your shoulder. At this point, your arm should form an L-shape., The motion of your throw should flow smoothly from start to finish. To prevent yourself from making the error of locking up your wrist, practice using it as part of your throw by holding the ball in your hand and then:Bend only your wrist backward.
Snap your wrist forward.
Allow your elbow straighten out.
Release the ball as you straighten your arm., A windup is simply where you reach farther back when throwing a ball while stepping through with your leading foot to add more power and distance. Get in throwing stance, and then hold the ball in your hand straight up while keeping your elbow and shoulder at about the same height. From that position:


Reach slightly backwards while keeping the ball facing your target.
Raise your leading foot slightly at the backmost part of your reach.
Shift your weight forward to your front foot.
Follow through with your arm and wrist.
Release the ball at the frontmost part of your throw, as your wrist is snapping forward."

Meet the ball with your hands as soon as possible.,
Absorb the force of shots on net through proper form.,
Make use of the ""W"" catch.,
Catch the ball in the air when shots go high.,
Catch ground balls with proper body blockage.Ground balls can give the illusion of a simple catch, which can open you up to letting a ball through your legs.,
Guard the ball to prevent drops.,
Know the rules for a throw-ins.,
Pick a teammate you will throw the ball to.,
Throw the ball while stationary to prevent yourself from fouling.,
Take a running throw for longer distances.,
Try your hand at the difficult handspring throw.",How to Catch a Ball2," A goalkeeper's greatest advantage in soccer is his ability to touch, catch, and punch the ball. By making sure your hands get to the ball as soon as possible, you improve your chances of catching or punching the ball away.


A foot block might be necessary sometimes, but this is often a less controlled. A goalie should use his advantage (his hands) to his benefit whenever possible., Professional soccer players and coaches call this having ""soft hands."" This means that a goalie must be able to engage his arms, legs, and back muscles to cushion balls shot on net. By absorbing the force of the ball, you stand a better chance of holding onto it. You should:


Keep elbows at least slightly bent, even when reaching for the ball.
Be ready to bend back at the waist for high kicks at fast speeds.
Always move forward toward the ball, to cut down on the shooting angles of the striker., This style of catching is also called the contour catch. It gets its name from the W shape a goalkeeper's hands should take when catching, with thumbs meeting behind the center of the ball and the hands slightly off to the side.Goalkeepers who have smaller hands should bring their wrists close together and their thumbs almost parallel to protect the ball from slipping through their hands.

, You never know when a ball is going to sail through the air at the net, so anticipate the ball by bending your knees, keeping your eyes attentive, and holding your hands open and ready.When you jump to catch an high shot on the net, you should:


Jump to meet the ball at the highest point possible.
Raise your knee closest to pressuring attackers, being careful not to injure any oncoming players., Experts agree, you can prevent letting a ball past you by getting your body behind the ball. This way, if there is, for example, a lot of spin that tears the ball loose from your grasp, it will hit your body and either be stopped or ricochet away from the net.

, When offensive members of the other team are charging in for a goal, you can be jostled around enough to lose your grip of the ball, especially if you are holding it away from your body. By cradling the ball to your body with both arms and hands, you stand a better chance of maintaining possession and keeping hold of the ball., While playing a game of soccer, players are expected to follow strict rules regarding body position and throwing technique when throwing in a ball kicked out of bounds. Most serious soccer leagues use FIFA throw-in rules, which state:The ball must be thrown from the point where it left bounds.
You must throw the ball using both hands.
The ball must be thrown from behind the head.
Both feet must be touching the ground at the moment of release.
You may not come in-bounds, but may step on the field boundary line.
The thrower may not touch the ball until it has touched another player., Survey the state of the field and look for any teammates who are maneuvering into a strong position to receive the ball. Be careful not to throw the ball at a player who is offsides; this will result in a penalty.Players must be at least two meters (6.5 feet) away from the thrower before he throws.
If your team is on the attack and in position while your opponents are scrambling, a quick throw in is sometimes ideal.
You can also throw the ball back to your goalkeeper if you don't have many options for where to throw, though in this case a goalkeeper will have to play the ball with his feet., To prevent yourself from lifting your foot while throwing, or from forgetting to reach the ball fully behind your head, you may want to make your normal throw stationary. To perform this throw, you should:


Position your feet shoulder width apart.
Hold the ball with both hands on either side of the ball.
Point your elbows out to the side to increase the power of your throw.
Reach your throw behind your head.
Follow through with your arms and body.
Raise your heel to keep your balance, if necessary, without losing ground contact with both feet., Many advanced players use this tactic. By running toward the throw-in point, you can build momentum and throw the ball farther than you would normally. However, this style of throw is prone to raised feet or missteps, and can result in penalties. To take a running throw in soccer, you should:


Take several steps away from the boundary line of the field.
Hold the ball with both hands, as normal.
Reach the ball behind your head.
Run toward the throw-in location.
Plant your lead foot outside the sideline boundary to come to a stop.
Throw the ball the moment you stop.
Drag your trailing foot to prevent fouls., These kinds of throw-ins are rare due to their difficulty in executing. A handspring throw will require you to perform a forward flip while holding the soccer ball, throwing the ball the moment both your feet touch the ground.While performing this throw, it's especially important for you to stay off the field so a penalty is not called.
Avoid attempting this throw in slick conditions; rain can result in you slipping and hurting yourself or receiving a penalty."
"
Position your hands to catch the ball.,
Use the ""window"" in your hands as a sight.The space between your pointer fingers and thumbs should form a diamond shaped window.,
Relax and spread wide your hands.Tensing your hands to try to immediately stop the ball when you catch it can result in pain or even injury.,
Employ your entire arm for aerial catches.,
Tuck the ball to your chest to maintain possession.Defenders will try whatever legal move they can to take the ball from your possession.,
Grip the ball in the way most comfortable for you.,
Keep your knees bent and lower body engaged.,
Cock your arm back and grip with your fingers.,
Initiate your throw with a step.Putting your body weight behind your throw will result in more power, and you can trigger follow through with your body with a step forward.,
Coordinate your body motion for best follow through.,
Follow through with your throwing hand and release.,
Continue your throwing motion until the range is fully completed.After you have launched the ball from your hand, you should continue the motion of your release.",How to Catch a Ball3," The most reliable way to catch a football is to bring your hands in front of you to form a diamond shape. You can imitate this hand position if you:


Bring your hands in front of your body.
Spread your hands wide.
Nearly touch the tips of your pointer fingers and thumbs., Look through this window to help position your hands in line with the oncoming football.


This technique is especially useful for training those who are new to football. Keeping eyes on the ball is a vitally important part of catching a football.
Underhanded catches result in an inverted hand shape: position your fingers slightly downward and touch pinkie fingers together., Allow your hands and elbows to follow the motion of the football, easing it to a stop.


By keeping your fingers spread and your hands ""big,"" you increase surface area and make the ball easier to catch.

, Raising your arms stiffly to catch a ball dropping in on you will likely result in a fumble. Keep your arms bent, even when extending to catch a high pass. This will lessen the force of impact and improve your chances of catching., You'll need to protect the ball once you have caught it by tucking it to your chest, firmly holding it between your body and arm.

, There is no standard grip for holding a football, so the most natural feeling one is the one you should use. Generally, when throwing a football, you should:


Grip the back half of the football so that you can feel two or three laces.
Hold the ball close to your chest.

, A slight bend in your knees will engage your lower body more so you are prepared to throw at a moments notice. Some quarterbacks further recommend distributing your weight slightly more towards your back leg, allowing you to follow through with more body weight for a better throw.Your feet should also be shoulder width apart to create a strong, balanced stance that is ready to throw., Your throw will begin by you pulling the ball back high, so that your elbow is a little above your shoulder and the bottom of the ball about in line with your ear. Use your fingers to grip the ball and allow an air pocket to from between palm and ball., With your leading leg, step toward the target you are throwing at., Draw your non-throwing hand down to your hip and then out and away from your body to begin rotating your hips. Now square your shoulders so you are facing your target and pivot so your front foot points straight ahead., The motion of your left hand, rotation of your hips, and opening of your shoulders should have caused a follow through motion in your cocked and ready throwing arm. Allow that arm to:


Come forward, rotating your arm with the motion of the throw.
When the rotation or your arm causes your thumb to point downwards, release the ball.
Allow the ball to roll of your thumb and fingers., Follow it until your throwing hand reaches the area of your left pocket to train yourself in a consistent, smooth release.

Get some dry ice and break it into chunks that will fit in a bottle, any bottle.,
Take a plastic bottle, such as an empty 2 liter (0.5 US gal) soda bottle, and fill it about 1/4th full with warm water.

,
Put a few chunks of dry ice into the bottle using either your gloved hand, or some tongs, and squeeze the middle of the bottle.,
Eventually, most likely within a couple minutes, the bottle will explode from the pressure.

Step Two: Pick the Thrower.,
Step Three: how to play as a player.,
Step Four: how to play as the thrower.,
Step Five: Have fun!

",How to Play 500 with a Ball," You can play this outside, in a pool, in the ocean, in your backyard, or even inside if you have a big space. Make sure if you're inside there are no breakable items that could easily get knocked over.;
, The thrower will throw the ball, determining how much it will be worth and whether it will be dead, alive, or both.

, The object of the game is to get 500 points first. The thrower will throw the ball, saying the amount of points it will be worth for the person who gets it. The throw can say dead, which means it has to fall on the ground before anyone can pick it up. If someone catches it while it's in the air it will count for nothing and has to be returned to the thrower. If they say alive, you must catch it before it hits the ground, and it will count for nothing if it hits the ground. If they say dead or alive, then it's basically whoever gets the ball first, no matter if they catch it in the air or if it falls on the ground and they pick it up. Whoever reaches 500 points first is the new thrower!

, First you say dead, alive, or dead or alive (see above) then when you throw it up, saying how much it will be worth. You can say any number between 0-500. Another way to play is to also add negatives, meaning whoever catches a negative numbered ball (i.e., -200) it will take away that much points from their score.

To make it, separate the shorter part of the clip to make a wide enough base then pull up the lip part of the clip taking care that the lip looks down to the base, so the rocket can nestle easily on the launcher.You may have to shorten the stem of the matchstick for a proper hold.,
Place rockets on a safe surface and in a safe area.,
Strike a match and light the rocket about mid length.The flame should go up and ignite the head to propel the rocket.

,
By striking the three rocket heads, it should flare light it the same way the three stems did and with quick succession.,


",How to Create a Mini Cannon from a Matchbox," To make the head of the rocket, take a 2 centimeter (0.8 in) wide strip of kitchen aluminum foil.Tear a rectangle by 2x3 centimeters.Then, make a fold for 0'5 centimeter (2.0 in) along both longer sides. Once this is completed, wrap the head of the match tightly.Twist the upper part of the match to get a quite cool pointed tip. The cool pointed tip should look similar to a cool looking rocket.


Take your thumbnail and strike the three matchsticks with your thumbnail. This way you can create a nice tripod. It is recommended that you keep the heads together and roll the foil over them tightly (3-4 times is enough). Follow the same procedure mentioned above and proceed as if you were creating a single head rocket.;
, During the first stages of creating a single head rocket, an adult should be around to help you and to supervise with the project should an accident occur when creating a single rocket head.

,, It's great fun because it might topple down,and might not ignite or it could be a real success.

Note large packages.,
Check the company at the return address.,
Watch out for large amounts of stamps.,
Inspect the parcel for lumps or unusual bulges.,
Check how the package is secured.,
Look for any openings and tears in the package.,
Take note of stains, especially oil marks.,
If you have clearly identified the item as a bomb, or can confirm it is dangerous, call emergency services and report it.

",How to Identify a Letter Bomb," Letter bombs can be small, but flat, thin envelopes are very unlikely to contain them.;
, If they do not exist be very wary. Try searching for reviews on the companies services to make sure they are legit. Be aware that companies will almost never hand write addresses, and will usually (although not always) use pre-pay stamps.

, As said above, pre-pay stamps usually are a good sign, while many smaller stamps could be a cause for concern.

, Letter bombs are usually bulky, and can be of an irregular shape, with many protrusions. When inspecting, never apply pressure to the parcel, or push down on any lumps or bumps, as this could trigger an explosion.

, Most companies do not use string, but secure boxes, or neatly applied tape. String is a sign of poor packaging, and maybe someone who does not have the equipment to professionally package a parcel.

, If there is an opening, take a look to see whether you can see wires, or any other suspicious items.

, If there are any fingerprints of oil, or oil soaking through the package then immediately move away, or place the item safely outside. This is the same with protruding wires.

This means they can only reach up to Level 50. Rare or Epic Spider-men can have 5 and 6 stars in their ranks, respectively. This means they can reach up to Level 90. The higher the levels of your Spider-men, the higher the score multipliers when using them.
, Once you have the Spider-men in your team roster, you have to increase their ranks by increasing their stars. The more stars they have, the higher maximum level they can reach.

Refer to this article for more details on how to rank up your Spider-men.

, In order for the Spider-men to increase their experience, or XP, you have to level them up. The higher the levels of your Spider-men, the higher the score multipliers will be.

Get your Spider-men up to their maximum levels. Common Spider-men can reach Level 30, Uncommon Spider-men can reach Level 50, Rare Spider-men can reach Level 70, and Epic Spider-men can reach Level 90. You can level up your characters by doing the following:

Play the Unlimited Mode. The Unlimited Mode is the classic endless runner game, where the main objective is to run as far as you can and get the highest score possible. The higher score you get, the more XP points you earn. Once a Spider-man’s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up.
Play the Events. Events are time-limited endless runner games, similar to Unlimited Mode but with different objectives and rewards. The higher score you get, the more XP points you earn. Once a Spider-man’s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up.
Play the Missions. Each mission has a defined objective, and the game ends when the objective has been reached or you’ve lost. XP points are awarded for completing every mission. Once a Spider-man’s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up.
Go on Ops. The Spidey Ops contain at least four different ops with varying objectives, times, and rewards. This is a good way to use your Spider-men to earn some Vials and increase XP points while you’re out or not using them. If the ops was successful, each of the Spider-men you sent on the ops will be awarded with an increase XP points. Once a Spider-man’s progress bar for its current level has reached its maximum, the Spider-man will be levelled up.
Level up using other Spider-men. Levelling up a Spider-man means using your other Spider-men as XP points and merging them to add to this Spider-man’s current XP points or level. The Spider-men used to level up will be removed from your team roster. The XP points will increase the Spider-man’s current level and if it reaches the maximum, it will be levelled up.



, You start the game with just one slot. The first slot is where you put the Spider-Man you’re going to use for a run. You cannot use the other three slots until they’re unlocked.

You can find the slots on the right side of every pre-game screen. Tap on the slots or boxes to identify which of your Spider-men you will use.

, Complete Issue 1 under “Missions,” and defeat all Goblins. After you do, the second slot will be unlocked for you to use. When that happens, use the two slots for all games you will play.

These will increase your score multipliers, computed by combining the score bonuses of both Spider-men you’ve put in the slots.

, Complete Issue 2 under “Missions,” and defeat all Vultures. After you do, the third slot will be unlocked for you to use. When that happens, use the three slots for all games you will play.

These will increase your score multipliers, computed by combining the score bonuses of the three Spider-men you’ve put in the slots.

, Complete Issue 3 under “Missions,” and defeat all Electros. After you do, the fourth slot will be unlocked for you to use. When that happens, use the four slots for all games you will play.

These will increase your score multipliers, computed by combining the score bonuses of the four Spider-men you’ve put in the slots.

, The score bonus tagged to each Spider-men is determined by the level they’re in. A newly imported Common Spider-Man has a score bonus of x1, a Spider-Man at Level 10 has a score bonus of x3, and a Rare Spider-Man at its maximum level of 70 has a score bonus of x9.

The more slots you use and the higher score bonuses of the Spider-men used, the greater score multipliers you will have for the games.

, Each of the Spider-men has different abilities. Abilities range from additional combos to score bonuses. Rare and Epic Spider-men unlock a second ability when they’re ranked up to 5 stars.

Refer to Part 1 of this article for more details on the different abilities available.

, Although all games involve getting the high scores, there will be goals, missions, or events that will ask for another objective. Objectives vary, but all of them have a Spider-Man ability that can be of use.

The trick here is to know which ability can give you the most score for the specific goal, mission, or event. Refer to Part 2 of this article for more details on the different game objectives.

, The first slot is for the Spider-Man you will use for the game. The remaining three slots are all for score multipliers. Use all of them.

Get your Spider-men with the highest levels and score bonuses into the game. Playing with a score bonus of x1 versus a score bonus of x36 makes a lot of difference.

, The first section of the Shop is “Consumables.” Consumables are game helpers that will give you some bonuses when used. There are three consumables you can buy to help you increase your scores.


Sensory Overload—This provides a +25% score multiplier. When used, it will increase your score multiplier by 25%!

Formula Fanatic—This multiplies the vials you collect after defeating an enemy by 3. When used, you will get three times more vials from attacks. Vials also add to your scores.

Crushing Combos—This multiplies your combos by 2 for 3 minutes and your combo counter lasts 3 seconds more. When used, you will get more (and higher scores) from your combos.

, The second section of the Shop is “Power-ups.” Power-ups themselves cannot be bought. They appear randomly in the games. When collected, they provide certain powers that last for a few seconds. What you can buy from the Shop are additional time for using these power-ups when collected. For example, instead of lasting for just 10 seconds, you can extend a certain power-up by 5 more seconds. There are four power-ups you can buy:


Web Hammer—When collected, your Spider-Man clobbers your enemies and all other mechanical obstacles with ease. You just have to pass them to hit them. No need to swipe up or down to do an attack. All enemies and obstacles hit will increase your scores and add to your combos.

Web Magnet—When collected, your Spider-Man brings all vials in sight directly to it. No need to pass them to collect them. Vials also add to your scores.

Stats Multiplier—When collected, your Spider-Man gets to double all vials collected and all combos earned. Needless to say, the vials and the combos both add to your scores.

Web Shield—When collected, your Spider-Man gets protected from a damage. It’s like a free life within the game. This won’t necessarily increase your scores, but having a shield definitely reduces the risks when playing the game, allowing you to go further even if you get hit.

, The third section of the Shop is “Unlockables.” Unlockables are permanent bonuses or abilities for all the Spider-men characters in your roster. Unlockables won’t necessarily increase your scores during a game, but having them can help you increase your vials faster and improve your experience or XP faster, which indirectly will help increase your Spider-men’s levels faster, getting you higher score bonuses., A good preparation means a higher chance of getting high scores. Even before going on a game, prepare your Spider-men team for the run. All needed preparations to enable you are detailed in Parts 1 to 4., As you run, collect the vials on your path. Vials are the basic currency in the game, which you can use to bring in standard Spider-men for levelling up. They also add to your scores., It may be easier to avoid enemies, but don’t. Enemies are easy to defeat. You just have to attack them at the right moment. Attacks add to your scores, and enemies give out vials when hit too.

Hitting enemies also add to your combo counter.

, Near misses may be risky, but they can be rewarding. Near misses are earned when you avoid obstacles on the last moment. One downside of going for these is actually hitting the obstacles instead, which ends your game.

Near misses add to your combo counter.

, Rings appear all throughout the game. Pass through them to add to your combo counter., As you earn your combos, your combo counter increases. The higher the combo counter, the higher the score bonus being given. Try to maintain your combo counter by attacking enemies, going for near misses, and passing through rings.

The combo counter goes away and resets when there’s no combo earned for a few seconds. You should continuously increase your combo counter if you don’t want it to reset back to 0.

, Power-ups are randomly placed in the game. Get them when you can and use the accordingly. These will significantly help you get higher scores., If you’re lost and uncertain which path to take, follow the path of the vials. More often than not, vials lead to a safe path. They normally won’t appear on the same spot of obstacles., When you reach a boss, there’s really no way to avoid it. Fight your way and defeat the boss. Each hit counts as an attack combo. Once you’ve defeated a boss, a bonus score will also be added.

Defeat a boss with a high combo counter to get greater multipliers for your score bonus.

, As they say, practice makes perfect. Play often to get the hang of it. Most maps in the game repeat, so you will get quite familiar with where things are as you continue playing."

Ask teachers and childcare providers for suggestions.,
Look for educational books.,
Find an endless amount of learning games on the internet.,
Purchase a ready-made learning game.",How to Find Learning Games for Toddlers1," When parents are trying to find educational games for their children, they should ask the child’s teachers and childcare providers for ideas.


These people work with children in an educational setting on a daily basis. They should be able to help with ideas of games to play with the child or, at the least, ideas of where to look for games.
Teachers have resources that are not readily available to parents. Parents can ask the teacher if the childcare facility has a resource room for parents. Ask if there are books or resources that can be borrowed overnight or over a weekend.;
, Go to the public library or a local bookstore. Check the education section or browse through the card catalogue, which is probably online.


Find books that are for teachers of toddlers and preschoolers. Find books that specifically reference learning games for toddlers in the titles.
When you have the books, check the Table of Contents in the front or the Index in the back. Look for games about the specific topics the child likes. If the child likes math, look for counting games. If the child likes building, look for games that incorporate that skill.
If the books have something useable, check it out and take it home. Go through it more thoroughly to get the details about the games. Then play some of the games with the toddler.

, Many learning resources exist online. Type the words “learning games for toddlers” into Google and sort through all the results to see what kind of games can be found.


Play around with some of the games to see if they are suitable for your child. Add more words to the search, like “free learning games for toddlers” or “math learning games for toddlers”. It will help to narrow the search a little and give more pertinent results for the child.
Add as many descriptive words as you want, but keep in mind that the more words that are added, the more limited the search is. Yes, it is more specific; however, it is also more limiting. Search through the pages of results to find games that the child will like and can play.
Some of the games may be physical games that do not involve electronics, but other games could be online or electronic. Find a mixture of both kinds to keep the child interested and interactive while he/she is playing the games.

, For those parents that prefer to purchase ready-made learning games, there are plenty to be found at stores.


Parents should not simply purchase the most popular educational game or the one that looks the most technologically advanced. Instead, it is a good idea to look for games that are manufactured by a company that is in the field of early education or early childhood development. LeapFrog and Fisher Price are two well-known manufacturers of learning toys and games for various age ranges.
It is important that the parent consider the age range for the game to be sure that it is appropriate for their toddler, but they should also keep in mind the skill level that their child has already achieved. In order to keep the learning fun and beneficial, it is best to purchase learning games that are a little above the child’s skill level and build on what is already familiar to them.
An example of a purchasable learning game is the LeapFrog Scribble n Write which can be used to teach letter recognition as well as proper pencil control while writing.

Don't be afraid to come up with your own learning games.,
Look to other homemade games for inspiration.,
Make a game using flashcards.,
Do some learning games outdoors.,
Use your daily activities for inspiration.,
Collect items from around the home to make games with.",How to Find Learning Games for Toddlers2," All of the learning games for toddlers that are currently available to today’s parents were originally just someone’s thoughts on how to help a toddler learn a certain concept or skill.


The people that came up with the ideas are really no different from the average parents.
This simply means that anyone can come up with their own games for teaching their toddler new things.

, For example, someone came up with the idea of using a basket of various colors and styles of clean socks for teaching toddlers about colors, matching, and counting.


Another great idea for a homemade learning game for a toddler is to buy two sets of identical magnets and store them in a metal container. The child can use the lid as a board and stick the magnets with their pairs on the lid.
Of course, it is important that the magnets that are chosen will not pose a choking hazard.

, If the toddler is learning his/her colors, make some flashcards using index cards and markers. Color a spot (circle, dot, square) on the front of the card. Hold it up for the child to see.


Explain to him/her that if he/she gets four of the cards right in a row that there is a prize for it. Then, when he/she accomplishes what is asked, give him/her some free time or time on the electronics or whatever else the child may enjoy.
The cards do not have to have anything difficult on them. They can have pictures of people, if the child is still trying to learn words like “mommy,” “daddy,” and “nana”. The cards can have colors or shapes. They can have pictures of animals. Anything that the child can look at and name (or say) can be put on cards.

, If the child is really interested in the outdoors, the parents can use that to their advantage. Go outside with the child.


Tell the child to find something green, blue, orange, or any other color (that can be seen where you are, of course). Tell the child to point out all the green things. Make it a game by “competing” with the child to see who can say all the green/red/blue/purple/white things first.
Make it a physical game by trying to see who can run to the “blue flower” the fastest or who can skip to the “brown tree trunk” more quickly. The child gets to learn and practice his/her colors, spend time with the parents, and get some physical activity.

, Just about everything that a parent does while in the company of their toddler, from grocery shopping to cleaning the house, can be turned into a learning game by using imagination.


Aside from teaching the toddler through everyday things, it also makes these things more fun for both the child and the parent.

, Some parents choose to collect all sorts of previously used items in order to use them to make their own learning games or add them to a craft box for the kids to use.


As long as the item is clean, has no sharp edges, and does not pose a choking hazard, a use for it can probably be found. Some parenting websites offer lists of common items that have been proven useful.
Dollar stores are also a great source for inexpensive items, such as ice cube trays, that can be used in creating learning games for toddlers.

Inspect your hand.,
Keep your hands clean.,
Pick a chant that you like and keep it consistent.,
Learn the quick attack.,
Get good at maneuvering your thumb with no intention of attacking.,
Familiarize yourself with the main different types of pins.,
When you get your opponent in a pin, try to feel them out.,
Counter Attack


The method for a counterattack is to slide out and pin your opponent very quickly.,
Never fast count.,
Rely on your sense of touch primarily.",How to Dominate at Thumb Wars," Every hand is different, and some hand shapes can give a person an edge in thumb wars.


Long thumbs are great for offense, but terrible for defense.
A hitchhiker's thumb is useful for defense, as you can bend it upwards while pinned to make the pin no longer count.
A double jointed thumb is the greatest advantage a thumb wrestler can have - it doubles your reach and makes your thumb too agile to pin.
A short thumb has concentrated muscle, which is useful for offense, getting out of a pin, and being hard for your opponent to reach.
A large hand is good for reach and gives you the ability to move your thumb out of your opponent's reach so you can rest a minute.
A small hand makes it easy to get out of a pin, but offense can be difficult.;
, If thumb wrestling is a consistent part of your week, wash your hands often.

, Using the same chant will give you knowledge of which side your thumb will end up on after the chant, which will let you get a quick attack or dodge once it is over.


""One two three four, let's have a thumb war"" is a common one.
Also, make sure that you know the joke chants just in case you have an opponent who thinks they are clever. If they use one such as ""One two three four, let's have a thumb war, five six seven eight, I use this hand to masturbate"", you don't want that to throw you off your quick attack or quick dodge.

If they use joke chants, they may look for your reaction or possibly laugh themselves. This puts them in a vulnerable position.
If you do a quick attack you will almost always be successful and immediately win.
You will also look more mature if you do not react to their joke.



, This is a term used for attacking immediately after the chant. Position your thumb before the chant so that after the chant you can get them with a counterclockwise (clockwise if lefty) attack.


Counterclockwise is the more powerful direction for right handed thumb wrestlers.

Be careful to make this attack quickly, powerfully, and carefully. If it is well executed, you are likely to win.

If something goes wrong, a key element of this attack is getting out of the attack fast.
You are very susceptible to counterattack if anything goes wrong.
Being able to get out of the attack quickly if it fails is more important than being able to consistently score a fast win.
After all, there are no points for winning quickly. If properly executed, this attack should look like a semicircle mostly vertical yet slanted a bit away from your body.





, Between battles you should move your thumb in a pattern that you can do quickly. If done properly, you're opponent should have a hard time aiming an attack at your thumb, and it should put you in a position that you are comfortable coming in to an attack with, or moving your thumb farther away.

,


Thumb on the fingernail is the weakest pin there is.
Being pinned down on the joint in the middle of the thumb

The one who is pinned should force their thumb downwards and then a quick jerk directly own in a straight line towards their body.


Being pinned down behind the joint in the middle of your thumb.

Note that this pin can come from either side of your thumb whereas the other two usually come from head on.
If you get in this type of pin (the opponents thumb horizontal across the stem of your thumb) look where the thumb has an opening, on the side where it is not connected to the hand. force your thumb towards the opening and you should get out okay.
That is the most difficult pin to escape. As a general rule of thumb for escaping pins, push down as you make your escape, and quick jerks always beat constant outward pressure.



,


Pin with as little pressure as you need to.
If you feel a quick jerk coming, add pressure as try to get away, moving your hand with theirs.

,
Counterattacks have a higher chance of landing a fatal pin because you can your your opponents downward force against them for a second or two.
Counterattacking takes some planning.

For a fingernail pin, you want to slide downwards and then swoop over their thumb to get a behind the joint pin.
The other two types of pins require you to slide downwards, touching their thumb for the downward slide and then using the base of your thumb, which is most likely touching the tip of their thumb, as a fulcrum you can leverage a strong pin either on or behind the joint.


Counterattacks are the most effective attacks but are the hardest to execute and require you to be in a dangerous situation to even attempt one. A good thumb wrestler won't rely on them but will never miss a chance.

, If you are going to be a pro you have to be perfectly fair. Every win must be indisputable.

, Feeling something and having a reflex is much quicker than seeing something, considering your next move, and then reacting.


Practice by looking away during some of the thumb wars against opponents that you are confident about beating.

Choose which warband you want to collect and build; there are many to pick from so take your time deciding.,

,
Write down all the names and strengths of your warband on a roster sheet.",How to Build a Mordheim Warband," Here's a rough example of the more common, official war bands that are available, although many more unofficial warbands exist and you can always create your own:




Human Mercenaries - Human mercenaries are the basic warband types which are good if you are beginning to play Mordheim or want a well-rounded army; Reiklanders, Middenheimers and Marienburgers are the three dominant types available, but there is also the likes of Averlanders, Kislevites and Ostlanders. All these warbands come from the region called The Empire based in the Warhammer world. Although they are not exceptionally good at any one thing, they have few disadvantages and are perfect if are about to collect your first warband.
Witch Hunters - Although they are humans, this warband is built for close combat and has access to prayers (used like magic), a feature the human mercenaries lack. The witch hunters are comprised mainly of fanatical witch hunters who loathe magic users and demonic entities. In addition to foot troops, this warband also has the choice of including war hounds in their group.
Sisters of Sigmar - The Sisters of Sigmar are similar to witch hunters, except that their warband is comprised entirely of female nun-like warriors. They too hate demons and witchcraft and have prayer systems of their own. Other than the sling, the Sisters of Sigmar have no missile weapons and thus are built to fight in hand-to-hand combat.
Dwarves - Dwarves, although tough, are very slow in regard to movement. Out of all the warbands, the Dwarves have the biggest advantages and the biggest disadvantages; they're slow, but very tough. They're few in number, but they're much better at finding treasure and although their weapons are more expensive, they're characters are much more skilled than other races'.
Shadow Warriors - Basically High Elves, Shadow Warriors are fast, nimble, good shots and lethal. Although the Shadow Elves were one of the first warbands to be released, many gamers now consider the list to be ""broken"", which is gamer-slang for overly-advantageous, and the warband has been often been banned from tournaments and campaigns. Shadow Warriors are great shots and have a higher movement rate than most other races.
The Undead - One of the more popular warbands, the undead are comprised of living corpses lead by necromancers and vampires. None of the warriors, other than heroes, may use weapons of any kind, but to make up for this, the whole warband cause fear which is useful in hand-to-hand combat. The undead also have access to dire wolves, which like warhounds, have a high movement rate.
The Possessed - Comprised of demonically possessed fanatics and sorcerers, the possessed are designed to represent the forces of Chaos in Mordheim. Although they have limited equipment, some members are allowed to have mutations, which are a result of the demons inside them creating extra appendages. Although they have very little missile fire, the warband is very good in close quarters fighting.
Orcs and Goblins - This warband is predominantly for fun; with fun magic and characters, this warband is fun to play and allows access to trolls. Trolls can technically never die in a campaign, as they never have to roll for injuries. With little missile fire, the warband is good in hand-to-hand fighting, but has good magic and upgrades.
Skaven - Skaven are great at hit and run tactics, being highly mobile and great with special weapons and abilities. The warriors in this warband are a lot cheaper than other races, so you can have a lot more for your gold coins. The warband also has access to magic, which is short-ranged but deadly.
Other Warbands - There are many other unofficial warbands (Amazons, Bretonnians, Tomb Kings, Beast men and Pirates to name a few) which you can use if your opponent gives you permission. See which warband suits you the best and if need be, try it out before you decide.

;
, Although any old model can be suitable depending on which race you're playing, it's best to try to acquire box sets such as those for The Empire in Warhammer if you're playing as Human Mercenaries or Orc regiment boxes if you're using them. If you use your imagination and modelling skills, any model can be converted to make a certain character or hero.

, It's no use giving a hero a mace when the model clearly shows he's holding a sword and bow! Rules and army lists can be downloaded online for free or be bought from model stores and off online traders. They contain the equipment lists and how much you can spend on your warband; in campaigns you can only spend 500 gold coins (600 if you are using a Marienburg warband) which can only buy you so much equipment and warriors.

,, Use pieces which relate to what equipment the model's using and make sure you've got all the pieces before you being building the models. There are several ways to build Mordheim models, or any plastic soldier for that matter; find what's best for you.




The Fast Way - If you don't have time and you just want to get your warband together as quickly as possible, then use the principles of this technique. First of all, clip off all the pieces you need to make the models from the plastic sprue. Get an adhesive (Plastic glue works best for binding plastics together while super glue is best for metal-on-metal or metal-on-plastic) and stick the pieces together in the correct fashion (IE, don't stick the arm on the back or the legs the wrong way round). Attach the model to a plastic base and you're quite welcome to play with the model as is. You can add further detail by then painting the model if you want; if you want a fast paint job, then use flat coloring with little detail.
The Detailed Approach - This way is for those of you who want to play games, but want your models looking great whilst on the battlefield. After you've removed the components from the sprue, you can either glue them together and then de-mold line them or you can de-mold line them first before you stick the pieces together. De-mold lining (Also known as filing) involves removing the mold lines from the model using either a craft knife or file. After this is complete, you can then glue the pieces together. Again, you can play with the model whilst it's in this state, but if you want it looking great, it's best to paint it. This time, try using better detail when painting, using techniques such as highlighting, dry brushing and washing to make the model really stand out. It pays to spend a bit more time on your heroes, as they will be the ones that people will look at the most.



,, You can have games and participate in campaigns. If this is your first warband, you'll probably now have the confidence to start another one for some variation.

Be accurate, at most arenas you get accuracy bonuses and you could get up to 100 more points.,Don't abuse the equipment, don't throw your laser on the floor, hit it against the wall, or take your pack off for no reason.,
If your pack is broken go and inform the marshal.,Follow the rules.People respect people who play by the rules plus they won't have a reason to discredit you if you do win the game.,
Become a member if you are not one yet.",How to Become Good at Laser Quest," Remember that practice makes perfect. Get used to the pack that you have to wear and know how to play and know the rules, there's nothing more embarrassing than you being chucked out of a friend's party or tournament.
, Call the different parts by their correct name, don't call the sensors 'flashing lights'.

If you are going to play in a tournament, research some of the Laser Quest champs and know their tactics.

, If you spend all of the game at Laser Quest trying to figure out how to get around the arena, then you're not going to get many points.

Ask the marshal beforehand if you can look around the arena in a tournament.

, If you play regularly, you'll soon know which packs work better than others.

To know if your pack has a low battery, look at the screen on the back of your gun where your name comes up. If it's got a dim screen, it could mean it's low on battery.

, If they are camping in one spot, try to tag them until they leave so you can claim the best spot.,, It is a lot harder for your opponents to tag your front, back or one of your shoulder sensors if you are standing sideways., If you are constantly tagging someone and they are only getting a few tags on you then it's more likely that you will hit them first.,, For example some packs may have weak shoulders. If this is the case try to tag their shoulders instead of their other sensors., Make sure you don't tag walls or anything for no reason.,, You won't be in trouble because you haven't broken it. Most packs are prone to breaking.,, It allows you to get a few bonuses and discounts."

Keep score as follows:

If the Frisbee is deemed catchable, the throwing team is awarded 1 point.",How to Build a Beersbee Set," You will want to lay out the 10-foot section of 3"" PVC and mark a line at the 5-foot mark. This mark will serve as your cut line.;
, Carefully cut along the line, cutting the 10 foot PVC into two 5 foot sections.

, Insert a 3"" PVC flange into each of the 5 foot PVC poles, this will serve as you bottom support for the poles.


You can use PVC cement if you want to glue the flange to the pole.







, Snap in the 3"" drain grate to the pole, this allows you to set a bottle on top of the pole when it is set up.


You can also use the PVC cement for this piece to glue it into the pole.

, Typically 4 stakes can be used to secure the flange (bottom of the pole) to the ground.

, The rules say that the pole should be placed about 36 feet apart, but feel free to move either further or closer.

, Put an empty bottle (usually an empty beer bottle) on top of the pole on the drain grate.


You can duct tape bottle to help reduce the risk of the bottle shattering.

At one point, it becomes a cakewalk. It will also speed up your reactions, once you master dodging his attacks. With the money, you can buy potions, new weapons, and sandwiches, not to mention other things like pets and so on. This can also be useful for XP.;
, What's a strong guy without good defence? What's a person strong in magic but slower than a snail? If you don't level your attributes up equally, you'll be left with a double edged sword; strong with one thing, but weak with another. To become tough, you must have no weak points. You must move fast, hit hard, defend yourself and throw magic into the mix (more powerful than your bow).

, Each weapon has different stats, such as +1 in magic but -1 in strength and defence or vice versa, for example. Find a one that you're comfortable with, and stick with it, until you find a weapon that you like more.

, Pets can't die, and only give you an advantage in combat. They're sometimes hidden, so explore the level to find them. Never stick with one forever though, change them to take advantage of the level. Water level? Use Seahorse. Groups of strong enemies? Use Bitey Bat or Dragonhead. Ice level? Use Yeti. Good pets all around are Meowburt and BiPolar Bear. You get the idea.

, Friends can back you up in difficult boss fights, hold off groups of enemies, or help you in other ways. Play with people more experienced than yourself, but not serious about the game, as they will get mad at your screw-ups.

, If you enter a boss fight further into the game without potions you will probably die. Bosses like the one in Wedding Crasher can deal a lot of damage quickly, so potions will be needed there. Also, you can heal yourself as you enter the boss.

, Bosses usually have short, repetitive patterns of attack which can be memorized to your advantage to dodge them and know when to attack. Take for example the boss in Rapid Ride: the cat will spit out a furball. If you destroy it in time, the king's ship will load it's cannon and fire at the cat, dazing it, and giving you time to attack. If you don't destroy it, it will damage the ship.

Gather your supplies.,
Play on a hard surface.,
Gather your players.,
Decide who goes first.",How to Play Jacks1," All you need is a small bouncy ball and a set of jacks, which are six-pronged metal pieces. The number of jacks you need depends on which variation of the game you're playing: The simplest games can require just five, while more complicated ones can involve up to fifteen.









Jacks sets, which include a ball, a set of jacks, and a pouch to hold them in, can be found at most toy stores.
The ancient form of jacks was called knucklebones, because instead of today's modern metal jacks, the knucklebones of sheep or goats were used. ;
, Jacks requires a hard, flat, smooth surface for the ball to bounce on.









If you're playing outdoors, a wooden porch or a paved surface like a sidewalk or a blacktop is ideal.
If you're playing indoors, a hardwood or a linoleum floor works best.
It's possible to play on a table, but standing is better than sitting in a chair, because it gives you more mobility.

, Jacks can be played in pairs, groups of any size, or solo.








, There are a number of ways to do this, some more traditional than others.









The most traditional way is called flipping. Place the jacks in your two cupped hands, throw them into the air, and then catch as many as you can on the backs of your two hands, linked together with your thumbs. Toss them back in the air, and then catch as many as you can again, this time with your palms cupped again. The player who catches the most jacks goes first. It can be easier to catch the jacks if your fingers are spread apart a little.
Flipping can also be done using only one hand.
Use a simpler decision method, like rock-paper-scissors or a coin toss.

"
"
Scatter the jacks onto the playing surface.,
Toss the ball into the air.,
Pick up a single jack.,
Let the ball bounce once.,
Grab the ball before it bounces again.,
Collect all the jacks in this manner.,
Continue on to the next rounds.,
Move on to the next player after a foul.,
Pick up where you left off.,
Keep going until you have a winner.",How to Play Jacks2," Throw them directly in front of you, and try to scatter them evenly, not too close together and not too far apart.








, Throw it straight up, and give it enough height to give you time to pick up your jacks, but not so high that it veers off beyond your reach.








, Scoop the jack into your hand before the ball bounces.








, The ball can only bounce one time - if you let it bounce more than once, your turn is over.








, Use the same hand that you used to pick up the jack.









The jack must stay in your hand while you grab the ball.
Once you've grabbed the ball, transfer the jack to your left hand. Continue transferring your collected jacks into your left hand.

, Keep scooping the jacks one at a time. This first round is called ""onesies.""








, Scatter the jacks again, and this time pick up two jacks each time. This is called the ""twosies"" round. Next, pick up three each round, then four, then five, and on to ten.








, Your turn ends and goes to the next player counterclockwise to you once you foul. There are a number of different ways to foul, including:









Missing the ball, or letting it bounce more than once.
Failing to pick up the correct number of jacks.
Picking up the wrong number of jacks.
Dropping a jack that you've picked up.
Accidentally moving a jack from its placement on the ground (this is called ""tipping""). , If your turn is reached again, start from where you were before your foul.








, The winner can either be the first person to complete ""tensies"" or the first person to complete ""tensies"" and then work their way back down to ""onesies.""

, Allow the ball to bounce twice before you grab it.








, Before each pick up of the jacks, clap your hands. 







, Use the other hand than the one you would normally throw with.








, You must go from ""onesies"" to ""tensies"" without making a mistake. If you do, you have to start over at ""onesies"" at your next turn.








, After you throw the ball, make a circle in the air around it with your hand before it bounces.








, Try using a wooden ball, like earlier forms of the game did, or a set of small, similar-sized stones instead of metal jacks.

Set up the game board.,
Determine the teams.,
Select the starting team.,
Play until a team gets three squares in a row.",How to Play Human Tic Tac Toe1," Choose a level, open playing field for this game. Lay out your hula hoops in a three by three grid, just like a tic tac toe board drawn on paper. The hula hoops should be positioned so that there is little to no space between the hoops.


If you’re playing this game inside on hard floor, use masking tape to create your human tic tac toe board. On cement, you can draw the board with chalk.
Check for holes, dangerous garbage (like broken glass), and other hazards, like roots or rocks, to prevent these from causing an injury while you play.
If you’re playing this game with many people, you might want to set up several game boards. This game works best with one to three players per team.;
, Human tic tac toe can be played one-on-one or with teammates. When playing with teammates, each team should have no more than three members. Separate teams so that there are two teams per board. Teams should stand opposite of each other with the game board in between.


Playing with more than three members per team is possible, but this will slow the game down and might bore younger players., Use a coin toss to determine which team goes first. You could also have teams select a captain and have the captains play rock, paper, scissors to choose the starting team. The starting team will go first as the X’s, the opposing team with follow as the O’s.To add a more physical aspect to this game, have teams race to a location and back again. Award the first move to the team that wins the race.

, Hand each team four bean bags, with each team having a different color so you can tell X’s apart from O’s. Teams should take turns placing bean bags on the game board until one team wins or the game ends in a draw. For teams with more than one member, rotate through members until the game ends.Reset the board by removing the bean bags and play again. You may want to shuffle teams so players don’t get bored playing the same people over and over again.

"
"
Arrange your game board.,
Separate players into teams.,
Set up a start marker.,
Run the tic tac toe relay.,
Shuffle teams and play again, if desired.",How to Play Human Tic Tac Toe2," A flat, wide open space is ideal for this game. If you’re playing outside, use hula hoops to create a three by three grid with the hoops in the shape of a tic tac toe board. If playing indoors, use masking tape to mark out the game board on the floor. Use chalk to draw the board on cement., Each team should have three players. Give each player two bean bags. Teammates should have the same color bean bags, but opposing teams should have different colors bags.

, Set a start marker, like a cone, on opposing sides of the board, with each marker 15 feet (4.6 m) away from the game board. Each teams should line up behind a single start marker.


Feel free to adjust the distance between the start markers and game board. A longer relay may be more suitable for older players, and shorter ones younger children., Have a judge yell “1, 2, 3 – go!” Players might also start on a three count. Once the signal is given, players should run to the board and place their marker in an open square. When that player returns and high-fives the next teammate in line back at the start marker, that teammate can run to place their marker and return to tag the next player, and so on.


Players should continue to run the relay until one team gets three squares in a row or the game ends in a draw., After two games, shuffle players between teams to keep things fresh and exciting. Have players track their wins. After several rounds, have a special Round of Champions between the players who have the most combined wins. The winning team will be the Grand Champions.

"
"
Use players to represent X’s and O’s.,
Add obstacles to your game of human tic tac toe.,
Create a skillshot requirement.",How to Play Human Tic Tac Toe3," For this variation, you’ll need to have four players per team. Select one team as X’s by a coin toss or by having teams play rock, paper, scissors. The team that wins goes first as the X’s.


Teams should alternate back and forth, with X’s taking the first move. Each move, a single player stands on an unoccupied square on the board.
While occupying a square, X’s must do jumping jacks. O’s must do sit ups while occupying their squares.
Players must continue performing their action while occupying a square on the gameboard. The game ends when one team gets three squares in a row or the game ends in a tie.
Feel free to use different exercises for X’s and O’s while they occupy their squares. Basic exercises, like pushups, burpees, flutter kicks, and so on, work well.

, Place starting markers on opposite sides of the board. Each marker should be an equal distance from the game board. Then:


Require players to spin a hula hoop 10 times around their waist on their way to the game board.
Place tires between the starting mark and the game board. Players should step into the centers of the tires on their way to the game board.
Set an obstacle for players to jump over on their way to the game board, like a tall, sturdy box, a hurdle, and so on.
Require players to perform an activity, like jumping rope, playing hopscotch, shooting a basket in a toy hoop, and so on, before they can proceed to the game board.

, Set a marker for each team on opposite sides of the gameboard, with each marker an equal distance away from the game board. Teams alternate turns. Each turn, one player attempts to capture a square for their team by tossing a bean bag from behind the marker into an unoccupied square.


When a player misses a shot or throws a bean bag onto an occupied square, that player forfeits their turn to the opposing team.

With a large enough space and enough hiding spots, you could play with well over 20 players.Get together a group of kids from your neighborhood, from school, or from after school clubs to play this game with you.
Invite kids your age you see playing alone to come play Kick the Can. Say something like, ""Hey, we're going to play a group game called Kick the Can. Would you like to play?"";
, Bottles and cans are the typical choice for this game, but you can use anything that could be safely kicked some distance. Other options include balls, small trash cans, small boxes, plastic cones, a plastic bucket, and so on.


Give your item a few trial kicks. You don't want it to go too far or too short. Choose an object that can be kicked a medium distance.
You may want to put some rocks into your item. Doing this to items like cans, bottles, and boxes can help you adjust the distance an object is kicked., The best play ares will be large, with plenty of hiding places.Playgrounds and parks work great, as do cul-de-sac streets (which are closed off at one end). Clearly agree on the boundaries of your play area with all players.


Natural features, like tree-lines, large rocks, and paths are a great way of clearly outlining the boundaries of your play area.
If one of your boundaries is unclear, use other items, like branches, rocks, hats, cones, and so on to mark it.

, The jail is where players go when they're caught by the seeker. Your jail, much like your playing area, should have clearly defined boundaries. Some common places used for the jail include decks, patios, benches, porches, and so on.If you don't have a clearly defined jail in your play area, make one by arranging branches, stones, cones, and more to form its boundaries.
The jail should be large enough to fit as many players are playing, but not much larger than that.

, Use rock, paper, scissors to select the seeker or use whatever method you prefer. No matter how many players there are, there is only one seeker per game. After that, agree with other players on the time the seeker will count before searching for hiders.The more time you have to hide, the more likely it is hiders will have a better hiding place. Use longer count times for the seeker for longer, more challenging games.
Short count times can add an fast paced aspect to this game. If you and your friends like quick games, choose short count times.

, Alternatively, set up the item you're using in place of the can. Arrange this item in a central location in your playing area. This location should be wide open and difficult to sneak up on.


You may want to locate your can close to your jail. This way, if the can is kicked, the seeker will have to run towards the jail while jailed players are running away., The seeker begins close to where the can/item has been set up. Their eyes should be closed as they count to the number decided beforehand. All other players should find a hiding spot while the seeker is counting.


When the seeker finishes counting, they can search for the other players., For the seeker to catch someone, they have to call out the hider's name and hiding spot. Then the hider and the seeker race back to the can. If the seeker arrives first, the hider is in jail. If the hider gets there first, they must kick the can.There are many variations of Kick the Can. One of the most common has the seeker running to tag players out after calling out their name and location. Hiders should still try to kick the can., After the can is kicked, the hider runs to find a new hiding place while the seeker gets the can and places it back where it was. All jailed players are freed when a hider kicks the can.


Since a hider kicking the can releases jailed players, the seeker should be strategic in guarding the can. Try to keep an eye on it to prevent hiders from sneaking up on it.
Depending on your house rules, sometimes the seeker only needs to set up the can again before searching, other times the seeker counts again before the game continues., The last hider is winner. You might want to set an overall time limit for each round of the game so that the seeker doesn't have to search for too long. Set a 15 or 30 minute timer or use an alarm on your phone.Some versions of the game go until the seeker catches all hiders. In this case, the seeker is considered the winner.

, This can be especially fun if you are playing with a large group of people. However, you might want to make a rule that seekers can't wait around the jail or babysit the can. The number of seekers you add depends on your preference.


Even with fewer than 20 players, 2 seekers can balance the game. This way, seekers can split between offense (seeking) and defense (protecting the can).
If you choose to add seekers to the game, you might also want to increase the number of cans for each additional seeker. For example, a 2 seeker game might have 2 cans., This can add a thrilling pursuit aspect to this game. Instead of having seekers beat hiders to the can, have them tag hiders instead. Tagged players should go, as per usual, to jail., Playing in the dark can be dangerous, so you should make sure your parent or guardian knows and is OK with you doing this beforehand. This version of the game uses no can, as it would be difficult to locate a kicked can in the dark. Instead:


Equip seekers with flashlights. Tag people out by shining the light on them and calling their name.
Release people from jail by having hiders tag jailed players.
Choose a jail in a well lit location, like a porch, so seekers can see potential jailbreaks.

, This variation requires you to split players into two teams. In the middle of a hardtop area, place your can. Draw a large circle around it with a piece of chalk. Have teams stand an equal distance from the can on opposite sides. Then:


Flip a coin to determine which team goes first.
Take turns rolling a soft ball at the can to knock it over. Each team should have a ball.
The first team to knock over the can must run to it and set it up again with only their feet. Only one active player can be in the circle at a time.
The opposing team can freeze players trying to set up the can by hitting them with their ball.
The game continues until the can is set up or all the players on one team are frozen.

Add other twists to the game.","How to Play ""Mother May I"""," Although you can technically play Mother May I with only three people, it will be more fun if you have more.One benefit of Mother May I is that it’s a game that works for the whole family. Young children enjoy it, but grandparents have also been known to participate too!
However, the game is generally recommended for children between the ages of 4 and 9. The game is popular with adults because it teaches children manners.
Mother May I is a game of imagination. You need more than 2 people to play it, though. The game works best with fewer than 10 participants.;
,


The game is sometimes called “Captain May I” with the word mother replaced with the word captain at all times. If the “mother” is a male, you could use the word captain and call the children ""crew members.""
Everyone else, no matter their actual age, receives the designation of the “children” in the game. It can be fun for actual children to get to play the mother and vice versa. As an alternative, you could use the name of the player designated as the person in charge for “mother.”
The goal of the Mother May I game is for the children to reach the mother first on the other side of the room, lawn or field. Whichever child reaches the mother first wins the game and then, in turn, is designated as the mother, and the game starts all over again.

, Alternatively, stand on the opposite sides of a field or in the back or front yard.The mother should be far enough away to make the game interesting but close enough that the children can hear the mother and vice versa. The mother should stand about 10–20 feet (3–6 m) away from the children.The mother should stand facing away from the line of “children” and selects a child either at random or in order. Mother May I can be played either indoors or outdoors.
The game is also a great way to get children interacting with each other and adults, and to get them moving around and outside.

, Each one of the “children” takes turns asking a question of the mother. The question must start with the phrase “Mother may I _____________?”


Each child player must fill in the blank in the sentence with a suggested movement. A child could ask, “Mother, may I take three steps forward?”
If a child forgets to say “mother may I” before the question, the child has to return to the starting line. Some people also make the rule that a certain maneuver (say baby steps or somersaults) can only be used once per round.
The entire point of the game is to ask creative questions. Use your imagination!

, To make the game more exciting, you should mix up the questions that you ask, when you are in the child role.


For example, you could ask to take giant steps forward or baby steps forward. Other steps that can be taken include scissor steps (jumping while crossing and then uncrossing your feet), cartwheels, or bunny steps (hopping).Ask to run forward for a certain number of steps or to walk like a crab. Frog hops involve the child going on on all fours and hopping forward.
Be aware that some grandparents might have physical limitations when it comes to running and kneeling, though.

, The person designated as the “mother” in the game then responds to the child’s question.


The mother must reply “yes, you may” or “no, you may not, but you may take ________ instead.” The mother should fill in the blank with another suggestion. The child must do what the mother says. The goal is to lead the child closer or farther away from the goal.
The mother can alter, but otherwise stick with the child’s suggestion. For example, the child could ask to walk forward 5 giant steps, and the mother could reduce it to 2. The mother could ask the child to run backwards instead of forward. Run until the mother says “stop.”
The game can be played slightly differently, with the mother giving the child a command, such as taking 5 baby steps forward, and the child then must respond “Mother, may I?” to which the mother says yes or no or alters the suggestion.

, Although the game is traditionally designed for individual play, some people turn it into a game of teams.


To do this, divide the children into teams of any number, perhaps into pairs or sets of three. Any number will work, really, although it gets complicated if the teams grow too big.
The team must choose the request for the mother together, such as “Mother, may we take five giant steps forward?”
Feel free to add your own creative twists to the game. You don’t have to play it the way it’s historically done. For example, some people change “Mother” to “Your Majesty” for princess parties.

, When playing as teams, it can be more fun to divide the teams, so everyone on a team doesn’t get to move for each question.


The mother could add conditions to the request to accomplish this, such as, “If you’re wearing red, you may take five giant steps forward.”
The goal of the game remains the same: The children must reach the mother first. In the case of teams, all team members have to reach the mother before the team can win.
The game gets boring if the mother just says yes or no all of the time. Adding conditions makes the game more interesting.

, Don't think you can only play the game the traditional way. Add your own twists and originality to it.


Another fun change to the game is to play music while the children are playing it, and to request or have the children request to use dance moves to reach the mother.
The mother could wear a special hat or other costume item that will make it more fun for the children to play the mother.
Children could disguise their voices to make it harder for the mother to know which child she is responding to."

Write down a summary that explains what your game is about.,
Establish the rules.,
Get input from your friends.,
Assemble any items you need.,
Test your game out.,
Make any adjustments and play again.",How to Make Your Own Game1," Writing down a summary will help you to form the game’s main purpose.


Detail the main action of the game. For example, if it involves some people hiding and some people looking, explain how many people are hiding. Where people are allowed to hide. Who is looking? What happens when the looker finds someone who is hiding?
You want to come up with a central aspect to your game. Does it revolve around you and your friends running around the neighborhood? Can you play it inside? Do you need any equipment?
These are questions you should answer when writing down a summary to better establish your game.;
, Once you know generally what your game is about it’s time to create some rules that will flesh out the details.


Write your rules down below your summary or somewhere that you can easily refer to. Having your rules written down will help you to explain the game and remember everything.
Establish how many people can play. Since you’re creating your own game you may allow as many people who want to play, or you may limit it to a certain number.
Create rules that help to form the structure of the game. Be specific with details. For example, if the game takes place outside, create boundaries. You might say that going inside a house or past a certain house is out of bounds. If your game is inside, establish what players are allowed to touch or interact with. Perhaps the floor is made of lava and anyone who touches it is out.

, Now that you have a summary and some rules locked down it’s time to ask your friends for a second opinion. After all, you’re probably not playing this game alone.


Feedback from your friends will help you to get some good ideas to add to your game. It will also help you get other people to play with you.
Your friends are more likely to play your game if you let your friends add rules and ideas. Letting others help establish your game will make everyone feel like this new and awesome game is a collaboration.

, Gather up anything you need to play the game like balls, flashlights, pillows, etc.


Maybe you can’t play your own version of Ghosts in the Graveyard without flashlights. So make sure you can get all the materials you need. If you realize that you don’t have something for your game, that’s ok. You’re creating this game, so just change the structure or the rules to accommodate what you do have at your disposal.

, Play a quick test round to see how well the game works and if everyone has an easy time understanding it.


You want your game to be fun. But you also want it to be easy to play.
If you’re playing some sort of flashlight tag, hide and seek hybrid game, this test round will give you a good idea of how well people understand the rules. You'll learn how easy or hard it is to play the game in your area. Then you can adjust.
Perhaps you find that with the number of people it’s too hard to find a hiding spot or people aren’t stopping when tagged by the flashlight.
After your test round, make the necessary adjustments. Maybe you decide that the flashlight is only used to help the seeker find other players. But the seeker still has to physically tag a player to get that player out.
Talk with your friends and find out what everyone liked and didn’t like about the test round. Then make adjustments.

, After you’ve gotten input from everyone it’s time to make the changes you’ve discussed. Then, once you’ve all agreed on how the game will work moving forward, go ahead and play it for real.


You may want to do another test round to see how the new version of the game operates. Or, you can just go ahead and play it.
Remember that you’ve made up your own awesome game. So the rules and the way you play it can always change. Listen to your friends and take notes from everyone to make your game the best version for everyone to play and enjoy.

Get a piece of stick (maybe an old broom stick).,
Cut a big piece about 1 and half feet long, and two small pieces about half a foot each.

,
Get two pieces of brick or two rocks that can hold one of the small pieces of wood.

,
Pick 3 to 5 members for the two teams playing against each other.

,
Choose who goes first and then have the first person set his small piece on the two rock or sets of bricks.

,
Now the other team chooses who lobs the other half inch piece (from 20 or 30 feet) towards the piece which is set on the ground on the bricks or two rocks and tries to hit it out of its position.,
The team that is up has only three outs and when the outs are up the teams must switch sides (Meaning the one team comes up to hit the stick and the other team goes out to try to catch the stick).

,
If the first person who set the small piece down does not get his or her piece hit during the lob, he can continue.,
The object of the game is to see who gets 500 points.",How to Play Chako Stick,";
,,,,, If he or she hits it out of its position, the player who set his piece down is out and that team is charged an out.

,, They do this by setting the long piece of stick under the small piece and with some good leverage, flick it out into the field (make sure you are in a wide open area with lots of space when playing this game. If no one catches it, it is 5 points. When it lands on the ground then that same person has one more chance to make points. He or she must use another real small piece of rock or whatever and lever the small piece of wood in maybe at a 45 degree angle using the ground and small rock(hope you figure it out) and then by striking down with the long piece and hitting the small piece in the front tip. While it is in the air hit it towards the field where the other team is and smack it hard (excuse my language). If he or she hits it then and no one catches it is another 50 points and if he or she hits it over everyone it is 100 points.If someone catches it is considered an out. If unable to hit it on the first try it is an out.

, That team wins!

Write down your ideas.,
Pick a game style.,
Sketch out the design of the game.,
Establish the rules.,
Build your game board.,
Play the game.",How to Make Your Own Game2," Write out some ideas of what kind of board game you want to create and play. Write down genres you like such as strategy, trivia, or adventure. With so many types of board games, you'll begin to narrow down your own creation by writing down your ideas. Create a list of your favorite board games for inspiration.
Writing out your ideas will also give you a good idea of the materials you will need later.

, Once you have a bunch of ideas written down, look for ones that are similar and go together. Circle these winning ideas and begin to think about what kind of play style and game board will work best. Try to combine aspects of your favorite existing games. Perhaps you love Risk or Settlers of Catan as well as Monopoly. Or maybe you like something that doesn’t use a dedicated board like Munchkin or Werewolf.
You can create your own game based on existing board games you like and even borrow pieces from other games.

, Once you have an idea in your mind of what kind of board game you want to make and what the setup will look like, it’s time to sketch it out.


Sketch the layout of the game on paper to get a sense of what the actual game will look like.
If your game board is something like Monopoly, then go and fill out the details of the squares on the board. Maybe you have a winding road like in LIFE. Make note of what each square, area, or portion means.

, Now that you know what the game looks like and the general purpose of it, it’s time to lay down some rules so people know how to play.


It’s easiest to keep your rules short and simple. If you create too many long or convoluted rules it will be hard for you to explain the game. It will also be harder for others to pick it up and have fun.
Let the physical design of your game help guide the rules you create. For example, if you’re on a map like in Risk, then establish rules on where people can be on the map, how the turns work, and how movement across the map works.

, With all the details down, now you just have to construct your physical board, cards, and anything else that you need to make your game.


You can make your own materials like a game board with something as simple as cardboard and paper with your design pasted on top. Or, you can go online and find materials or order custom designs by uploading your artwork and rules to a site like thegamecrafter.com Use items from other games. Take the army pieces from Risk to use in combination with the cards from Settlers of Catan.
You can also get custom 3D pieces printed online if you really want to make this game your own and last for years.
Try using note cards if you have a card component in your game. Draw on the note cards if you’re feeling creative or just simply write down what each card does.

, With everything set up and ready to go, it’s time to play your game with your family and friends.


Take your time during the first playthrough. You’ll have to explain the rules and components of your game to your friends and it may take some time to get it all down.
Make notes of what works well and what doesn’t. You’ll probably find that there are parts to your board game that need improvement. That’s ok! This is version one.
After you play through the first time, go back and make the changes you need to keep fleshing out your game.
Then keep playing and enjoy your hard work.

Gather a group of any amount of players.,
Line up at the starting line.,
Start the race by saying, ""We are dizzy ducklings!,
Once everyone is over, get your paper and pen and make a score table made up of 3 vertical columns and horizontal columns for the players.,
Then you go back to the finish line and shout, 'We are dizzy ducklings!,
Now its time to add up the scores!,
After so many rounds, tally up everyone's score.",How to Play Dizzy Dizzy Ducklings1,";
, The starting line can be anywhere you want. Also, remember to mark the finishing line. The track should be about 10 foot (3.0 m) for beginners, but as everyone begins to understand and play the game more, the distance can be increased.

, Dizzy dizzy dee! We are swimming to the sea!"" Then everyone tries to spin to the finish line. If you fall just get back up again!

, Put everyone's name in the 1st vertical column and then in the next column put their rank e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.

, Dizzy dizzy doo! We are coming back to you!' Everyone spins back to the start. Again, in the last column, put everyone's rank from the last run.

, You can make up your own points, but here are some suggestions: 1st place gets 10 points, 2nd places gets 9 points, 3rd place gets 8 points, 4th place gets 7 points, 5th place gets 6 points, etc.

Purchase 1-inch (2.5 cm) PVC pipe, fittings, golf balls and nylon rope.,
Cut all of your PVC pieces to size.,
Fit the pipes together.",How to Make a Ladder Golf Game1," How much PVC pipe you'll need depends on how big you want your ladder to be - see the sample measurements below. You can find 1-inch PVC pipe at a hardware store, as well as nylon rope. Buy 2 elbow fittings, 6 T fittings, and 4 stoppers. Make sure the golf balls you choose are solid all the way through, and buy them at a sporting goods store or big-box store.


Buy PVC cement (optional). You can fit your PVC pipe together without glue, but your ladder will be a lot less stable.;
, Use a hacksaw, a miter saw or a plastic pipe cutter. You can size your ladder however you want, but here's a sample to work from. For this ladder, you'll need 19 feet (5.8 m) of 1-inch PVC pipe.


Cut 6 18-inch (0.45 m) pieces.
Cut 4 12-inch (30.5 cm) pieces.
Cut 3 24-inch (0.61 m) pieces.

, Build the ladder from the base upward. You can use PVC cement as you do this, or you can just rely on the fittings.


Put 3 18-inch (.045 m) pipes into each opening of a T fitting. Repeat with another T fitting and 3 more 18-inch pipes. Hold them so that the ""bottom"" leg of the T is pointing straight up, and put the stoppers on the ends of the pipe parallel to the ground. These will make up your base.
Put T fittings on top of each 18-inch (0.45 m) pipe that's pointing up. Do it such that the ""leg"" of each T is horizontal and pointing toward the other T fitting.
Add a rung. Put one of the 24-inch (0.61 m) pipes between the T fittings you just added.
Put a 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipe into each of the remaining T openings. These should be vertical.
Add another rung. Put another T fitting on top of the 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipes, again so that the legs are vertical and pointing inward. Place another 24-inch (0.61 m) pipe into the T fittings for your second rung.
Put another 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipe into each of the remaining T openings.
Top the 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipes with the elbow fittings.
Add your last rung. In the remaining spots in the elbow fittings, add your last 24-inch (0.61 m) pipe.
If you used PVC cement, make the ladder first and allow the glue to dry while you make the bolos.

Use the sporting equipment you already have to give you ideas.,
Combine your favorite sports.,
Establish rules.,
Gather your friends.,
Test out your game.,
Play your game.",How to Make Your Own Game3," You can easily make up your own sport with sporting equipment you already have at home. Something as simple as a baseball bat and a kickball can be combined to create tons of different games. Draw inspiration from other made up games as well. Think about what the goal of the game is. Is it about accuracy, speed, getting the most points, or being the last person standing?
The equipment you already own can help you narrow down what kind of new sport you create. Maybe you have a basketball hoop and a pair of rollerblades. You can create a sport like basketball but played while rollerblading around.

, You can combine your favorite aspects from your favorite sports to create your own super sporting game.


You can use equipment, terms, positions, and scoring methods from other games to help you create your own.
For example, if you like football and baseball, you can take a bit from each game to craft your own. And feel free to go as far away from the original sports as you can. Maybe you decide to use the football. But you want the three strike rule from baseball. So you decide that a player has to kick the football a certain distance to start the play. The player also has three chances to do it correctly or that player is out until the next round.

, Knowing what kind of equipment you have to use will help you figure out what to do with it, and help you start making up the rules to your sport.


Work with your friends to come up with rules together. Decide how people score points, win, what players have to do to get points or where players have to move, etc. Come up with rules on what happens if a person breaks a rule or fouls. Decide how long the game will be played. Is it a certain time, or to a certain score?
Feel free to use and adapt rules from other sports. Perhaps you like soccer and make a rule that only the goalie can touch the ball with his hands. If you are using a football with that rule, you’re bound to have a fun and funny time playing your sport.

, You can’t play most sports alone so gather up your friends and pick teams. Tell your friends the rules of your sport as the rules currently stand. Explain the game’s dynamics. Then get input.


The best made up games come from a group collaboration. Get your friends to pitch ideas to make the game more enjoyable from everyone. You may find that someone has a really great idea that you didn’t think about.
Pick a name for your sport. Try to come up with something creative and memorable with your friends. It can have something to do with the sport like “Baseball” or “Football” does, or it can be a made up term like “Quidditch”.

, Now that the rules have been laid down and you have everyone present, it’s time to test out your sport.


You may find that not everyone remembers the rules right away or plays it correctly. That’s ok. Part of the fun of making up your own sport is to adapt and change it as you go along.
Take note of any parts that you should change after your first playthrough. Then go ahead and make those adjustments for next time.
Try not to keep score or get really competitive the first time. You’re all learning together so take it slow and make sure that you all understand the mechanics of the game.

, With a revised version of your game ready to go, it’s time to play it again for real.


Gather up your buddies, pick teams and play it for real this time keeping score and trying not to stop if something gets messed up.
You can get as invested as you want and even design uniforms and pick team names if you and your friends play your game often.

This game is for any amount of players, even just 1!,
You may want to time yourself.",How to Play Dizzy Dizzy Ducklings2," No starting line, no finishing line. Just spread out enough so your arms don't hit anyone when you stretch them. Then you are ready to start.

, If so, get a stopwatch and start it as soon as you start to spin. See how long you and your friends can go!

Gather your materials.,
Drill holes in the golf balls.,
String the golf balls onto the nylon cord.,
Tie knots.,
Cut the bola.,
Continue knotting the rope around the golf balls and cutting bolas.,
Burn the ends of the bolas.",How to Make a Ladder Golf Game2," For a standard game of ladder golf, buy 24 solid golf balls (ideally, 12 of one color and 12 of another) and about 28 feet (8.5 m) of thin nylon rope. You'll also need a drill with a 3/8- or 1/2-inch bit (1 to 1.3 cm)

, Place the golf balls in a vise grip, or create one of your own by jamming it between two heavy objects (such as a dresser and a wall). Drill all the way through each golf ball with the 3/8- or 1/2-inch (1 to 1.3 cm) bit in a straight line.

, Once each golf ball has been drilled, string it onto the 28-foot nylon cord. Order them in colored pairs, i.e., 2 pink, 2 orange, 2 orange, 2 pink, etc.

, Tie an overhand knot at one end of the cord, and move a golf ball down to it. Tie another knot on the other side of the golf ball. Measure about 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from that knot, and tie another one. String a second golf ball of the same color down to that knot. Tie a fourth knot on the other side of the second golf ball.

, Cut the nylon rope after the fourth knot. You should have your first bola, with a golf ball on each end and about a foot of nylon rope in between.

, Tie a knot on each side of a golf ball, and leave about a foot of rope between them. Cut off bolas when they're finished.

, Use a match or a lighter to slightly melt the knots at the ends of each bola. This will help keep the knots secure.

"
"
Pick a color.,
Stand at the toss line.,
Throw bolas in groups of three.,
Try to get the bolas to stay on a rung.,
Knock down other bolas.,
Play up to 21.,
Play with a scoring variation (optional).",How to Make a Ladder Golf Game3," Each team should get 12 bolas to throw (if you bought 24 golf balls), and each team should use a different-colored bola.

, This can be as far away as you'd like. For official ladder golf, it's 15 feet (4.6 m).

, That is, Team 1 will throw 3 bolas, then Team 2 will throw 3 bolas.

, The usual ladder golf scoring is as follows, though you can adjust it however you want:


Top rung = 3 points
Middle rung = 2 points
Bottom rung = 1 points

, If you can unseat the other team's bola from a rung, then their points are deducted for that throw.

, The first team to score 21 points without going over wins.

, To make the game move more quickly for younger players, bump up the point value of each rung by 1 point. You could also move the throw line closer to the ladder.

Gather your materials.,
Mix the cement and sand.,
Add in the water.,
Spread and adjust.",How to Make Mud1," You'll need sharp sand (also called concrete sand), Portland cement, and water.How much of each will depend on how much mud you need. Both sharp sand and Portland cement should be readily available at your local hardware supply store.;
, Mix the cement and the sand together until they're well blended. Different people will recommend different ratios for mixing (4:1, 5:1, 6:1, and 7:1), but a ratio of 5 parts sand to 1 part cement is the best starting option.


""Stickier"", stronger mud should be made using the 4:1 ratio, but this is difficult to mix.

, With the dry ingredients thoroughly mixed add in water slowly until it reaches the right consistency. It should be vaguely damp and stick together when you compress it in your hand.


The consistency will be similar to peanut butter.
What type of sand you use and what the environment is like where you live will affect how much water you need to use. Use less if you know that you live in a wet area.

, Spread your mud as needed for your project. Adjust the ratios if you find they don't work for you.

"
"
Gather your ingredients.,
Mix the ingredients.,
Apply the mask to your face.,
Rinse the mask.",How to Make Mud2," You'll need fuller's earth clay, plain yogurt with live cultures, honey and optionally aloe vera and tea tree oil. The clay may need to be bought online, although you should be able to purchase it from a hardware store. The rest should be available at large grocery stores.

, Mix two tablespoons of the clay with 1 tablespoon of yogurt, 1 teaspoon of honey, and either 2-3 drops of tea tree oil or 1 tablespoon aloe vera (depending on if you want these).


The tea tree oil is good for fighting acne, the aloe vera for repairing damaged skin.

, Wash your face first. Then, with the ingredients completely mixed, use a clean brush (like a paint brush or a cheap makeup brush) to apply it to your face. Be careful not to get it in your eyes.

, After allowing the mask to sit on your face for at least half an hour (1-2 hours is best), rinse it off completely.

"
"
Gather your ingredients.,
Add the dye to the water.,
Mix the cornstarch and water.,
Add texture materials.",How to Make Mud3," You'll need cornstarch, water, and food coloring or cocoa powder.

, If you're using food coloring to get the brown, dirt look, use equal amounts of red, blue, and yellow food coloring (2 drops of each should suffice).

, Starting with 1-2 cups of cornstarch, mix in the cocoa powder if this is how you're getting the brown color. With those ingredients mixed, or minus the cocoa if using the food coloring, slowly add in water and mix the two together. Stop adding water when you get the magic consistency, where it's hard when you touch it but melts when you don't.

, If you want, you can add in real dirt for texture or other kitchen materials, like rice flour or baking soda. This will give your play ""mud"" a grittier texture, like real mud.

"
"
Find a place to make the mud.,
Make a trough.,
Use a hose or bucket to wet the dirt area.,
Stir as needed.",How to Make Mud4," The most ideal place is in an open, fertile dirt area without grass. Avoid dirt with stones, twigs, oil leaks, or other debris in it.

, If you want deep mud, first make deep grooves, channels, or holes in the dirt. Make the spaces evenly, but near each other.

, Occasionally, use a stick (or your hand) to stir the dirt-mud around so it'll absorb the water. Keep using your stick to check the mud until it's the desired texture.

, As the mud gets wetter, stir and check it more often. Enjoy!

Play giant jenga.",How to Make a Giant Jenga Set," An electric saw will help you finish this project more quickly, but the sawdust created by this tool can be an eye and lung irritant. Protect your eyes and lungs by wearing safety glasses and a mask while cutting.Electric sanders, too, can launch fine bits of sawdust into the air. Whenever using an electric sander, wear safety glasses and a mask.;
, Use your tape measure and a pencil to mark 10½ in (26.7 cm) segments on the 16 in (40.6 cm) 2x4 boards. Cut the boards into pieces at these marks with a circular saw or hand saw. Be precise; poorly cut pieces will stick out irregularly from your giant Jenga set.Wood may move while you cut it, making it difficult to cut precisely. Use clamps to hold the wood in place while sawing.
Always use dangerous tools, like saw, with caution. Improper usage may cause injury or property damage.
Circular saws are intended for right-handed users. If you are left-handed, be extra careful when using this tool., After being cut, the pieces of your Jenga set will likely be rough where they were cut. Prevent splinters or cuts from wood burrs and jagged pieces of wood by sanding the edges until smooth.


Although it shouldn’t take too long for your to hand sand the edges, you can speed this process up with an electric sander, like an orbital sander., Stack your Jenga tower by aligning three cut pieces flat on a surface, side-by-side, lengthwise. Then stack another three pieces on top of these crosswise. Continue this alternating pattern until all blocks are used.Games can be played without a game platform on sturdy tables, firm and level ground, and most kinds of flooring.
Game platforms are especially useful for playing giant Jenga at outdoor events, where the ground might be too soft or not level enough to play.

, With your pencil and tape measure, outline an 18 in x 18 in (45.7x47.5 cm) square on the plywood sheet. Cut the outlined square free of the sheet with a circular saw or hand saw. Sand the cut edges to take off any roughness.Cutting the plywood base by hand may take a while. Don’t worry too much about small mistakes. Poor cuts can be corrected by sanding down irregularities.

, On your 6 ft (1.8 m) long 2x4 pine board, mark out two 15 in (38.1 cm) segments and two 18 in (45.7 cm) segments. Cut your boards at these marks with your saw. Sand the cut edges smooth., Place the cut plywood sheet flat on a work surface. Arrange one of your 18 in pine boards on its narrow edge so it is even with an outside edge of the plywood. Clamp the board in place. Turn the sheet over carefully, and screw the clamped board to the sheet from the top side of the platform. Repeat this process for all boards.


When all boards are fastened, the underside of the game platform should be outlined in 2x4 pine boards. Same length pieces of pine board occupy opposite sides of the platform., The 2x4 frame under your plywood base should be fairly sturdy, but attaching feet can raise the platform, making it more accessible for taller players. Screw in same size 2x4 pieces of scrap wood at the corners of the bottom of your game platform.


Alternatively, you can buy pre-made feet for your platform at your local hardware store or home center. Fasten these as directed in the package instructions at the corners of the platform., Your game platform may scuff less resilient flooring over the course of a game. Prevent this from happening by adding furniture pads to the bottom of your platform or its feet. In most cases, after adhesive backing is removed, these pads can be pressed into place.Furniture pads can be purchased at your local hardware store or home center. Some pads may need to be attached to the frame or feet with an included fastener.

, Many Jenga sets have colorful pieces. Add character and some fun to your set by painting some or all of the pieces different colors. An acrylic latex paint, which is available at hardware stores, should work well for your giant game pieces.


Choose bright colors to make your set more eye-catching. A neat looking set could attract potential players.
Alternatively, you could apply wood stain to the pieces of your set to create a rich, dignified look.
When the game is set up, only the ends and sides of many pieces will be visible. Be sure to paint or stain these areas so that even when stacked, your designs can be seen., Set up and play giant Jenga at reunions, church gatherings, community events, and so on. When setting up, clear fragile items from the playing area. When the set falls, pieces may tumble into and damage personal items.


Falling pieces may also cause damage to certain kinds of flooring, like wood. In these cases, lay out a large, thick blanket under the platform and playing area.

Preparing for impact is not so much regularly landing, but if something goes wrong, say you are too high, the swing gets crooked, ETC. You will need to prepare for sudden impact. (next step). So when you let go, let one hand off, bring that elbow through the swing. Once that arm lets go & the elbow is almost through, IMMEDIATELY let go with the other hand. Having one hand stay on can be extremely dangerous.

, Keep in mind you only have milliseconds in the air. You need to have a backup plan, quick. Plan before you jump. Take a few really low jumps to get an idea before taking your first real jump. Preparing for impact involves bending your knees A LOT more than usual, and also always having a hand out for balance. Sometimes, if your feet can't handle the shock, you might as well take a fall to your knees. Or, you could land on your feet & skid on the ground, or swiftly run

, Landing can be scary. As long as you have a P4I plan (prepare for impact), you should land safely. Don’t fidget or wiggle/ kick your legs in the air. This could result in an ugly landing. Don’t try to jack knife. Don't grab your ankles in the air. You don't have enough time to do so.

,


You might think you can master it, but you'll be sorry when you have a sprained ankle, or broken arm when you think you can do it. :p

, When you are skilled, with many many, many days of practice, it can even take years of you don't stick with it. Some cool tricks are a 180, 270 or 360 twist when you jump. There’s also unicorn landing. Where you land on one foot then trot like a horse. Try the double-jump too! Land swiftly on the ground, skimming it & then take a quick jump forward.

Take the plastic wrap off of the pole.,
String a rope through the pulley.,
Attach flag hooks to the rope.,
Hang your flag and tie the rope off.",How to Make a Flagpole," For this flagpole, four to about seven feet high is best. Within that range, you are free to choose the exact height. Buy the PVC and either have the store cut it to length or measure and cut it yourself. Use a hacksaw to cut the PVC.;
, You’ll be attaching a cleat, which is what holds the rope in place on the flagpole. Use a tape measure to find the halfway point on the pole and mark it with a marker.

, Buy a rope cleat kit at your local hardware store, a flag store, or online. The kit will provide screws. To make it easier to screw the cleat onto the pole, make holes with a power drill. Use a bit that is slightly smaller in diameter than the cleat screws. If the cleat kit includes a parts list, check the size of the screws. For example, they might be ⅛ inch (3.18mm). Choose a drill bit that is one size smaller than the screws so the screws will still catch the sides of the drilled holes.
You’ll drill holes for two screws. Use the cleat as a guide for how far apart the holes need to be.

, Open the kit and lay the pieces out on the ground. Lay the PVC flat on the ground and fit the cleat into place. Use a screwdriver to screw the rope cleat to the PVC.

, Buy a flagpole truck pulley when you buy the cleat kit. If you don’t know exactly what to buy, ask someone at the store or search on the website where you bought the cleat kit. Use the provided screws to attach the pulley to the flagpole., Get some plastic sheeting, and cut out a piece that is roughly a 3ftx3ft (.9 m) square. Place the non-pulley end of the PVC in the center of the square. Bunch the plastic up around the pole. Secure it with duct tape.You’ll stick the flagpole into a bucket, which you’ll fill with cement. The plastic wrap helps make it so the PVC can be removed from the concrete.
The directed size is an estimate. The height of your bucket will determine how high up the PVC needs to be covered with plastic.
The important part is that you put the hole of the PVC in the center so the hole does not get cement inside it.

, In addition to the plastic wrap, petroleum jelly will help you remove the flagpole from the cement once it hardens. Rub a thin layer of jelly all over the plastic. You don’t need to use an excessive amount, as petroleum jelly is slick with only a little bit., For a small project like this, your best option is to by a bag of dry mix, which has the concrete, stone, and sand all in the same bag. One bag should be more than enough for a single flagpole., Grab a bucket that is not the one you’ll use for the flagpole base. Unless the package directs you differently, add the mix to the bucket and slowly add water, mixing it up as you go.Use a shovel or a hoe to mix the cement. The right consistency is when the cement slowly slides off of the tool.

, If you have someone who can help you with the next steps, ask them to help you now. Grab the bucket you want to use as the flagpole base. Hold the PVC so the plastic-wrapped end is right in the middle of the bucket. It’s best to hold a level against it to make sure it stays perfectly straight up.

, While your partner holds the PVC and the level, pour cement into the base bucket. Make sure to pour it evenly around the pole. You don’t have to fill the bucket all the way to the top, as this will make the base too heavy to move. Fill the bucket at least halfway full with concrete.


Hold the PVC for a few minutes until the top of the cement forms a crust. At this point it will be settled enough that you can let go of the PVC.

, It can take a while for the cement to fully harden, so leave the flagpole somewhere that it won’t be bothered. You can test the hardness of the cement every so often by gently moving the PVC. When it doesn’t move at all, the cement is hardened fully.


Always read the directions for the specific brand of concrete mix you've bought. They will give you an idea about how long the concrete will take to full set.

, Once the cement is hardened, slide the PVC out of the base. The petroleum jelly should keep the pole from staying stuck in the cement. Remove the plastic wrap and discard it in the garbage.


Stick the flagpole back into the hole which formed when the cement hardened.

, Find a length of rope that is the right length for your flagpole. The rope should be about one foot longer than the full length of the PVC flagpole. Loop it through the pulley at the top of the pole and let it hang down.

, Use fasteners designed specifically for flags, or use carabiners or other fasteners. String them onto the rope and tie a knot under them to hold them at that same position on the rope.

, Attach your flag to the fasteners through the eyelets on the end of the flag. Then raise the flag to the top of your pole. Tie the rope around the rope cleat, which is designed to hold the rope in place.

Recognize if the flag is worn, faded or soiled.,
Investigate disposal options.,
Lower the flag slowly.,
Keep the flag from touching the ground.,
Fold the flag properly.",How to Retire a U.S. Flag1," Because it is exposed to the elements on a daily basis, your flag will likely experience some wear over time. If you notice any fraying at the edges, that the colors are not as vibrant, or that it has become stained, it is time to retire your flag and fly a new one.Many flags can be washed or mended if worn. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines when caring for your flag.
There are many online retailers who sell U.S. flags. You can also find them at most large retail stores.;
, Once you have determined that your need to retire your flag, you should begin researching how best to dispose of it. You may want to burn your flag, which is a popular way of retiring and disposing of old flags. However, most flags contain nylon, which releases hazardous gases when burned. If you want to avoid the hazardous gases, you might want to consider cutting up, bury, or recycling your old flag. Find a method that is safe and works for your needs.If you decide to burn your flag, be sure to follow all state and federal burn regulations. Contact your local fire department and discuss how to properly and safely burn your flag.

, When you take your flag down, be sure to lower it slowly. This is considered a sign of respect and will ensure that the flag does not fall to the ground. Quickly pulling the flag down from a pole is considered improper. If your flag is not hanging from a flagpole, simply take it down. There is no need to perform this action slowly in every instance.

, As you take the flag down, it is important that you do not let it touch the ground. Many consider this a sign of disrespect for the flag and what it stands for. If you can, have someone there to help you lower and disconnect the flag so that you can guarantee that it does not touch the ground., Once the flag is lowered, you will want to properly fold it into the recommended triangle fold. It is likely that you will want help folding the flag to ensure that it does not touch the ground. If you are folding the flag as part of a ceremony, you may want to have someone else explain the meaning and symbolism of the folding."

Light a large and intense fire.,
Place the flag on the fire.,
Come to attention or salute.,
State the Pledge of Allegiance.,
Have a period of silent reflection.,
Let the flag burn completely.,
Extinguish the fire and bury the ashes.",How to Retire a U.S. Flag2," At the beginning of the ceremony, you will want to light a fire big enough to completely destroy all of the flags you will be burning. You can use a natural gas burner or light a traditional fire using wood. You may also want to consider setting up some kind of stand to hold the fire and catch the ashes.Before you begin your flag disposal ceremony, you will want to make sure that you have properly folded your flag. You can ensure that it is properly folded by incorporating a flag folding ceremony into your larger disposal ceremony.Make sure that you are following the local fire codes and ordinances.

, Lay the individually folded flags in the fire. Do not let them touch the ground. Avoid stacking the flags on top of each other. If the fire is small, only burn as many flags as you can lay in it without stacking them.Because many modern flags are treated with chemicals that can burn explosively and give off toxic fumes, burning your flag may cause an accident. Be sure to contact your local fire department to ensure that you are meeting all safety codes.
You may want to consider a placing a grate in the flames that will hold the flags. This will keep them from sliding off the fire and onto the ground.

, Depending on style of ceremony you are holding, you may want to ask those in attendance to come to attention or salute as you burn the flags. If you are burning multiple flags, this may be a long process and standing for a long period of time might be difficult for older people. Consider letting everyone sit again after a few moments or when the first flag has burned.If you are leading the ceremony, you might say something like “will those in attendance please rise and honor the flag.”

, As the flag burns, you may also state the Pledge of Allegiance. This is a highly patriotic and symbolic gesture.However, because it references “God,” this might make those who adhere to different religious views feel uncomfortable. Try creating a ceremony that is inclusive and accommodating of the beliefs of the diverse groups that call the United States home.

, A period of silent reflection might be the best option if you are disposing of a flag and want to be respectful of everyone involved. A moment of silence allows the participants the opportunity to reflect on and honor the flag in their own way. This is a more inclusive way of conducting the ceremony.Before you begin the moment of silence, say something like “please join me in a moment of silent reflection.”

, You will want to allow the flag to burn completely in the flames. There should be not remnants of fabric left, only ashes. If you are using a wood fire, you may need to add more wood to keep the flame hot. If it is a gas flame and the flags are not burning properly, you may want to turn up the gas flow.Because of the chemicals they are treated with, different flags will burn at different speeds. Some are treated with flame resistant materials to prevent people from burning the flags in protest. These types of flags may require some lighter fluid to thoroughly burn.

, Once you have fully destroyed all of the flags, you will want to extinguish the fire and collect the ashes. To kill the fire, turn off the fuel supply or let the fire burn out on its own. Once you have collected the ashes, place them in a container and bury them in an appropriate place.The ashes can also be scattered over the grounds of important places, such as military parade grounds or battlefields.

Burn the flag discreetly.,
Cut up the flag.,
Bury the flag.,
Give the flag to a qualified organization.,
Recycle old flags.",How to Retire a U.S. Flag3," Once you have lowered your flag and properly folded it, you will want to find a private place to dispose of the flag. The preferred method of disposal is to burn your flag in a large fire. Make sure that it is big enough to properly destroy the flag, but not so large that it is a safety hazard.Once the flag is destroyed, bury the ashes.


Be sure to check with local burn bans before you dispose of your flag.
Because many modern flags are treated with chemicals that can burn explosively and give off toxic fumes, burning your flag may cause an accident.

, If you are unable or do not wish to burn your flag, you can also cut it into pieces. Once a flag has been cut up, it is no longer an official U.S. flag and can be disposed of in various methods. When cutting up the flag, you will want to ensure that you do not cut into the blue star field. This section should remain whole, but you can cut the rest of the flag as you see fit. Once the flag is properly cut up, you can dispose of it however you want.Use scissors or a knife to cut the flag.
Avoid tearing the flag. This can be considered disrespectful.
The blue star field represents the unity of the U.S. states, and cutting into that section is considered a symbolic attempt to disrupt that unity.
Some may consider this method less ceremonial or disrespectful. Use your discretion, or talk to someone with experience disposing of flags, before you cut up a flag.

, Once a flag is worn, you can fold it up, place it in a box and bury it. As long as you are respectful about how you bury the flag, this is a good alternative to burning. Be sure to place the flag in a box. Letting the soil touch the flag is considered disrespectful, even if you disposing of a flag.This method could also be considered disrespectful or improper.
Considering that flags are coated in various chemicals to preserve them, this might be a less environmentally friendly option. Unlike flags made from natural fibers like cotton that decompose quickly, modern flags are typically made from synthetic materials that breakdown over a much longer period of time.

, Groups like the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Girls Scouts, and the Boy Scouts will take your old flags and properly dispose of them. The old flags are typically burned during disposal ceremonies, which are held at different times throughout the year. If you are unsure about the best method of disposing of your U.S. flag, this may be a good option.The American Legion holds a flag disposal ceremony on Flag Day each year., If you are concerned about limiting your flag’s environmental impact, you might want to consider sending it to a company that specializes in recycling old flags. They will ensure that the flag is disposed of in an environmentally conscious way. The company may also use materials from the old flag to make a new one.Depending on the company, you may be asked to give a donation for the service. However, there are some who recycle the flags for free.

Dispose of a retired flag by burning it.",How to Respect the American Flag," Many people do not understand that this is a legal issue. Specific Federal laws regulate the display, maintenance, and disposal of the flag.


The American flag stands for freedom. Burning the flag is a major sign of disrespect, and is seen as intolerable by many Americans. However, burning damaged flags to retire them in a manner allowed by the United States flag code, as mentioned in a later step, is acceptable.;
, From its origin, believed to have been designed by Francis Hopkinson, a Congressman from New Jersey and patriot, to the present day flag, it has seen the development of this nation through many dark and perilous times, as well as good times.

, The flag is made up of three elements, the red and white stripes, which represent the original thirteen colonies, and the canton or union with white stars on the blue background, numbering fifty, which represents the current fifty states.

, How do you salute it, and when. Military persons in uniform, Boy and Girl Scouts in uniform, and military veterans salute it with a military salute when it is paraded, when the Pledge of Allegiance is said, or when the National Anthem is played. Civilians remove their hat with their right hand and hold it over their left shoulder, or if they are not wearing a hat, they hold their right hand over their heart.

, When flown in the United States, the flag of the United States of America flies higher than other flags, and it is the largest flag of any group it is in. If the flag is flown at night, there needs to be a light to illuminate the flag.


Notice if there has been an Executive Order to fly the flag half-staff, and do so.
At governmental buildings, the flag is flown near the center front in a position of prominence.
On military bases, the Commanding Officer's Headquarters Building will have the highest flagpole.
When the flag is displayed hanging from a wall, the Union (the blue field with stars) is at the upper left side.
When draped on a coffin for a military burial, the Union is at the head of the casket over the left shoulder of the departed.

,, When raising the flag, it is hoisted quickly, as if it were charging an enemy, when lowering, go slowly, as if reluctant to retreat.

, If it does touch the ground, dispose of the flag simply wash it and continue using it., Fold the flag according to the prescribed folding procedures.

,, It is considered disrespectful of the flag to display it when it has become damaged, faded, or otherwise worn.

, The idea is that a flag should not be seen in a trash heap or mixed with garbage. Contact your local fire department or the Boy Scouts of America to have your worn out flag retired in a proper ceremony.

Start with two players.,
Face your opponent as you both put your hands in front of you.,

Take turns between players to tap each others' hands.,
Hide dead hands behind your back.,
Master the basics and then add new rules.,
Make the game more interesting by adding new rules.,
Introduce splits into the game.,
Add the ""game of five."",
Play with more than one person.,
Increase the mathematical difficulty by adding nubs.,
Use leftovers to make the game last longer.",How to Play Chopsticks," You need a minimum of two people to play Chopsticks but there is opportunity later to add more opponents.;
, Each time you start a round of the game you both hold your hands out with one finger extended. Make sure that both you and your partner keep both hands flat and straight out so that both of you can see how many fingers each person has extended throughout the rest of the game.

, You will then take turns going back and forth. On each turn, one player will use one hand to tap one of their opponent's hand. Let's assume you are going first.

, If you tap with one finger then your opponent will add your one finger + their extended fingers and extend the sum of the two.


For example, you tap your opponent's hand. You have one finger and they have two. They then add the fingers and one their tapped hand, they put out three fingers.
On the next turn, your opponent uses their hand of three fingers to tap your hand of one. You now have to hold out four fingers because your one finger plus their three equals four fingers.
Only the tapping hand has the power to change your opponent's hand., The goal is to keep going and adding fingers to your opponent's hand by tapping. When someone's hand reaches five fingers that are extended, that hand is considered ""dead"" and is no longer in play.There are several variations of this rule, but the simple rules of Chopsticks dictate that once a hand has reached five fingers, that hand is useless. Which makes sense because one of background stories behind Chopsticks is that you can hold a chopstick with up to one finger, but an open hand means that you are going to drop your utensil and food as well., Continue playing until one player has lost both of their hands. The goal is to be the last one standing with at least one hand left still alive.

, Like many math and strategy games such as chess, there are a limited amount of plays that are possible before the game becomes predictable. To prevent the same player winning every round and the other player losing, add the other rules to make the game play fair.

, Once you master the basic rules and can add speed, create new challenges. There are several name variations for the rules, but they remain the same even though this game is played internationally.

, When it's your turn, you can tap your own two hands together to redistribute the number of fingers you have extended. For example, if you have one hand with three fingers and one hand with just one finger and you split them, you can put two fingers on each hand.


The goal of this strategy is to prevent one of your hands from reaching five fingers and becoming dead.
Splits don't have to be even, but it's preferable. Some odd number combinations merely means swapping fingers between hands with no strategic bonus. However, if you have a combination such as four fingers and one finger on each hand, you can split that into a hand of three and a hand of five.
A player can ""revive"" a dead hand by splitting. If you have one hand dead and one alive with four fingers, you can split and put two fingers on each hand to bring your dead hand back into the game.
A variation on the splits rule is the ""house rule."" This rule either means that splits are not allowed or that splits are allowed but can't bring a hand back from the dead., A hand must be tapped to equal exactly five fingers. For example, if your opponent has 3 fingers, you can only tap them with a hand with 1 or 2 fingers. You would not be able to tap their hand if yours has 3 or 4 fingers because that would create a sum of more than 5 fingers on the tapped hand.This rule is also known as ""exact play.""
This rule allows for the possibility of stalemate if both players have two hands of four points

, You can have three players, or you could have a whole circle of players. Everyone should stand in a circle and face toward the middle so that everyone's hands are visible. Take turns going clockwise or counterclockwise, and keep in mind that you aren't limited to only tapping the people directly next to you.Adding people will make the game stretch on much longer.
This method requires much more focus to win. With so many people playing, there may be a person with a hand about to reach five fingers who splits their fingers and it goes unnoticed by the group.
Make sure that everyone is following the same set of rules before starting. There is no wrong way to play but make sure everyone is in agreement with rules before starting a round.

, Rather than having fully extended fingers for the whole game, you can used curled fingers or ""nubs."" Nubs are created by splitting an odd number of fingers on one of your turns.Two nubs equal one finger so it takes longer to make a combination or nubs and full fingers equal enough for a dead hand.
Decide if nubs are allowed at the beginning of the game. A desperate player will often add the nubs variant when they are about to lose.
An example for splitting fingers into nubs can look like this: there are two fingers on your left hand and three on your right. If you split them, you can put 2.5 fingers or, two fingers and a nub, on either hand. Nubs are most beneficial for when you have a total uneven amount of fingers.
You must complete someone's nub in order to make it a full finger. To make a dead hand you must have five full fingers, not four full fingers and one nub.

, A hand does not die but instead stays in the game or comes ""back to life"" when a tapped hand exceeds five fingers in a turn. When using leftovers, you can add three and four fingers together to get 7 fingers, which equals a dead hand plus two more.


Sometimes this variation is called ""zombies.""
This rule could make the game could go on forever since you recycle fingers. The only option for a dead hand is that it equals exactly five fingers when tapped."

This is the standard size that is promoted by the American Cornhole Organization (ACO)., Mark this spot with your pencil. This marked spot will be the center of your cornhole., Use a drawing compass to draw a 6-inch diameter hole (3 inch radius). Place the point of the drawing compass on the dot you marked out in the previous step. Spread the compass so that it is 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and draw a circle. The point of the compass should not leave the board.


If you do not have a drawing compass, place a thumbtack over the pencil mark you have made. Place a piece of string under the thumbtack and push the thumbtack down so it holds the string in place. With a ruler, measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the thumbtack, starting at the very center of the thumbtack. Tie a pencil to the string, making sure that the distance between the pencil tip and thumbtack is 3 inches (7.6 cm). Draw your circle.

, Make sure the hole does not go outside the pencil mark. This hole will act as the starting point for your saw.

, Try to cut as close to the penciled circle as possible. Your cut may not be perfect but that is ok because you can clean it up with sandpaper.


You can also cut the hole using a hole saw or a router.

, The handle of a hammer or a thin pipe will work. Run the sandpaper along the interior edges of the hole to smooth your cut out and make it even.

, You will need six 2x4 pieces of wood to make one board. Use a mitre saw or a hand saw to cut the boards. Always use caution when using power tools. Don’t forget to factor in the saw’s blade width.If you are not familiar with using a mitre or hand saw, ask an employee at the lumberyard to cut your wood for you. Make sure you bring the correct measurements to the lumberyard.

, Cut 2 of the 2x4s so that each is 48 inches (121.9 cm) long (these will be the sides of the frame). Cut 2 of the 2x4s so that each is 16 inches (40.6 cm) long (these will be the legs that will be used later).

, Place the 21-inch boards in between the 48-inch boards.

, Use two screws for each corner.Drill your holes with a drill bit that is slightly smaller than your screws. This ensures that your wood won’t split when you drill the screws in, and allows the screws to go into the wood more easily.

, Again, before drilling in your screws, drill holes with a drill bit that is slightly smaller than the screws you will be using.

, Use 4 screws across the top, 4 screws across the bottom, and 2 on each side.,, Estimate where your bolt will pass through by using a ruler. Measure the width of your piece of wood and locate the exact middle. Keep in mind that a 2x4 is not actually 2 inches (5.1 cm) by 4 inches (10.2 cm). Your midway point (middle of the wood) should be close to 1 ¾ inches. (To make things clear, let us say that the middle of the width is 1 3/4 inches.), Make a mark indicating this measurement. From that mark, draw a line going across the width of the wood. Extend your previous mark so that both lines form a ‘t’ and are perpendicular to one another., Draw a half circle with the curve starting on the side of the board, arching up to the top of the board, and then arching back down to the other side of the board.

, Take a piece of scrap wood (use a leftover piece of a cut 2x4) and place it against one of the top corners of your table so it lays flat against the top (ie. it should not run parallel to the side of the frame).

, It should be perpendicular to the piece of scrap wood (ie. it should be parallel to the side of the frame).

, Use a straightedge or ruler and draw the line with a pencil. Find the frame’s middle with a ruler and mark it along the line you have just made. Do not include the plywood board in the measurement, just the 2x4 frame.This intersection will be where the drill bolt goes.

, This will help you guide your screw or bolt into the correct position.

, Make sure it goes through the frame and into the leg. Add the other leg in the same way.

, If it is not 12 inches (30.5 cm), mark where you must cut the legs so that the board is 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the ground.

, Saw the legs at an angle so that they run parallel to the ground. Sand them if your cut is slightly jagged.

, Check the filler’s box for instructions on how long to let it dry. The surface of your cornhole board should be as smooth as possible. If you put too much filler in a crack, it can be sanded down once it is dried., A smooth table will allow bean bags to slide better. Use an electric sander if you have one. If you don’t have one, medium grit sandpaper will work well., You can use a paintbrush or roller. Let the primer dry. The primer will dry white.

, This layer will act as the border if you are following a traditional cornhole design. Let this layer dry.

, The traditional cornhole table has a white border 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide. It also has a 1.5-inch border around the circle. Use painters tape and cover whatever you want to stay white with the tape.

, Make sure to use high-gloss latex paint. This type of paint will leave your board smooth so the bean bags will be able to slide more easily. Let the paint dry. If your paint is too light for your liking, add more layers.


If you decide not to do the traditional paint pattern, get creative! Use painters tape to create shapes that you can paint on or around. Use bright colors and make your cornhole board stand out in a crowd.

, You will need a large piece of duck cloth (you can generally purchase swaths of duck cloth that are 7 inches wide and 56 inches long.) You will also need scissors, a ruler, a sewing machine, fabric glue, a bag of feed corn, and a digital baking scale.


You can also use a needle and thread if you do not have a sewing machine.

, Using your ruler, measure out 7 inches (17.8 cm) at a time to make sure you are accurate. You should make 8 of these squares., Using either a sewing machine or a needle and thread, sew 3 of the sides closed. Keep in mind that you should be sewing 1/2 an inch in from the edge of the squares., Only do this on the sides that you have sewn up. Even though you have sewed these sides, gluing the extra fabric together will make it less likely that your bean bags will leak., Again, flipping your bag inside out makes it less likely that your corn will leak out.

, Place the feed corn onto your digital baking scale and add or remove corn until it weighs 15.5 ounces. Then put the corn into the bag.If you do not have a digital baking scale, 2 cups of feed corn is very close to 15.5 ounces. It may not be exact but it will be close enough., Fold the 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) edges into the bag and hold closed. You can use a pin to hold the edges closed., Try to place your stitches as close to the edge as possible. Doing this will make the bag as evenly sized as possible."

Create the second washer box.",How to Build a Washer Game," Because the game is usually played outdoors, make sure you create a durable box able to withstand the elements as well as the pounding from the game itself. If you will be playing at a specific location, make sure to measure the dimensions to create a suitable board.Know what type of surface you’ll be playing on. Some surfaces, like sand, may need extra design features to increase the durability of your board.;
, Whether you’re creating a simple box for your background or a mobile box with wheels and a graphic design, budget how much time and resources will be needed to create your design., There are a lot of variations to the washer game. Whether your rules require 3 hole boards, one hole boxes, nesting 3 hole boards, octagon boxes, or washer pits, make sure you design your board accordingly., Head to your local hardware store for two 6-ft two-by-fours, two 17-by-17-inch squares of plywood, two 14-by-14-inch squares of carpet (or fake grass) and two 3.5-inch pieces of PVC pipe, each with a 4-inch diameter., Cut each two-by-four to 17 inches in length. Create a 17-by-17-inch square by cutting the ends of each of these four two-by-fours at 45-degree angles with a miter saw or box saw. Ensure that they can fit together to form perfect 90-degree angles in order to give the corners of the box a more finished look. Alternatively, cut two pieces of two-by-four to 14 inches (35.6 cm) and another two to 17 inches (43.2 cm). Place the shorter pieces between the longer ones; this will still give you a 17-by-17-inch square without the hassle of making angled cuts.


You may use plywood, OSB, or any type of wood that suits your budget and playing needs.Be sure to lay the two-by-fours down on their narrow sides, not on the fat sides.

, Cut PVC pipe into two sections of about 3 ½”. You can also use other type of pipe but PVC is best for durability and budget., Flip the carpet face-down and, using a straight edge, trace two diagonal lines connecting the opposite corners. This will mark the center of the square.

, Center it according to the X you drew in the previous step and, using a marker, trace both the inside and the outside of the pipe onto the fabric.

, Using the utility knife, first cut the smaller circle out of the carpet. Try to keep the shape intact and set it aside, as you will need it later. Then, cut the remaining larger circle out of the carpet. Since you will not need this piece later, don’t worry about keeping it intact.

, Make sure the wood screws you use are long enough to pierce both pieces of two-by-four at each corner. Use a power drill to ensure that the ends are firmly locked together., Create the square piece of plywood to fit beneath the square frame. Use the frame to trace the cutting lines directly onto your plywood. Cut the plywood once you have measured the shape.

, Simply flip the nicer side of the frame downwards (if applicable), place the plywood on top, and screw down through the plywood into the two-by-fours. Make sure your screws aren’t too short for the plywood or too long for the two-by-fours., First, place the carpet right-side-up in the box to make sure it fits snugly within the square frame. Then, place the PVC pipe in the center of the carpet; you may have to twist it back and forth a few times as you press it into the hole (or even lift the carpet and insert it from the back) to get it all the way through. Finally, insert the saved circle of carpet into the center of the PVC pipe. Make adjustments as necessary.

, Do this in the same order in which you test-assembled the pieces. Let the glue set for the amount of time recommended on the bottle.


For additional stability, use finishing nails and a punch to nail the carpet to the plywood base.
When applying construction adhesive, be sure to press the the PVC pipe and carpet firmly together.You may also use 1’ L brackets or a 4” toilet flange to firmly set the PVC pipe.

, Whether you add graphic logos or wheels for transportation, your boards are meant to accommodate your game play. Make sure that they are durable.

, Depending on the paint you choose, you may also need to use primer to increase durability and protection.This will help cover screw heads and scratches. You might even want to paint the colors according to the way you plan to distribute points. (See Rules for pointers.)


Alternatively, you could use Polyurethane to help seal and stain the wood.

, Repeat the exact same steps of cutting your materials, assembly, and finish to create a second washer box."

Ready your work area.,
Prepare the wood of the goal board.,
Prime the goal board.,
Paint the goal board.,
Add unique designs to the goal board.",How to Customize Cornhole Boards1," Paint and primer can give off toxic fumes that are dangerous to your health, so you should only paint and prime in areas with good airflow. Remove any unused equipment, tools, and cords, as these can be spattered with paint or become tripping hazards as you work.


Paint on a level, sturdy surface, like a work bench. An outdoor work surface can be made by putting a flat board between two sawhorses on level ground.
For the easiest cleanup and to prevent primer or paint from spreading to unintended surfaces, lay down a drop cloth to completely cover the floor surrounding your work area.;
, Lay your goal board on your work surface. To ensure the best application of primer and paint, a smooth exterior for your goal board will be best. Use a medium grit sandpaper (60 - 100 rating) to remove burrs, splinters, and rough patches in the wood.Sand until the wood is completely even and smooth.After you are finished sanding, take a rag dampened with water and wipe away any dust or sawdust, then allow the wood to dry completely.
To prevent missing spots when sanding, it helps to work methodically. For example, you might work from the front of the board to the back, from top to bottom., When priming, it's best to use many thin coats as opposed to a few thick coats. Mix the primer according to its directions, take a clean paintbrush, and dip the brush in the primer. Wipe excess primer onto the inside lip of its can, then:


Prime the wood from top to bottom, using long, even, overlapping strokes. This will prevent drips from forming and ensure even coverage.
Pay close attention to edges and joints in the board. These spots can often be difficult to prime.
Allow enough drying time between coats. Different brands of primer will have different recommended drying times, so be sure to check your primer's label for this information., Much like primer, many thin layers of paint will yield a better looking and more durable paint job.Mix your paint according to its directions, dip a clean brush into it, wipe excess on the inside lip of the can, and then:


Paint your board from top to bottom. Long, even, overlapping strokes will provide better coverage and prevent drips from forming.
Target edges, cracks, and joints in your board, as these can be easily missed, leaving a gap in your paint.
Wait the recommended time on your paint's label instructions before applying the next coat. Continue in this fashion until it has three to five coats., Using painter's tape or a stencil, you can create original designs on top of your base layer of paint. However, to prevent your tape from pulling paint free of the board, you should allow at least a few days for the paint to harden.Using painters tape, you can cover areas of your board and then repaint it with a different color. When the paint dries, remove the tape gently. Where you have taped, the base color will remain."

Select a safe work area.,
Prepare the wood for lacquering.,
Put on proper safety equipment before lacquering.,
Apply lacquer primer to the goal board.,
Lacquer the goal board.,
Add several coats of lacquer.,
Buff the lacquered surface of your board.",How to Customize Cornhole Boards2," Lacquer, even more so than paint and primer, gives off dangerous fumes that can be deadly in enclosed spaces. Unless you have a designated spray booth, you should spray your lacquer outside.You'll want a sturdy, level surface to work on, and a surrounding area free of unnecessary equipment or tripping hazards.


You can make a temporary work bench on level ground outside your home. Lay a flat board between two sawhorses, and you'll be ready to start lacquering.
You may still want to drape a large drop cloth over the surrounding area to protect accidental lacquer spatter on your house or lawn furniture., Set your goal board on your work surface. For the best results, you should prime your board before painting it. Use medium grit sandpaper (60 - 100 rating) for rough wood, fine grit paper (120 - 220 rating) for relatively smooth wood, and very fine paper (240 - 400) for smooth, unblemished wood.When sanding, use moderate, steady pressure to rub the sandpaper back and forth with the grain of the wood, smoothing blemishes, splinters, and so on.
Sand your goal board until it is completely smooth and even. Then, wipe away sawdust with a water dampened rag.
You can speed the sanding process considerably by using an automated sander, like an orbital sander. Be sure to wear a dust mask and protective eye wear when using automated sanders., At this point, you'll need to allow a few minutes for the wood to dry following its damp wipe down. This is the perfect opportunity to check and put on your safety gear for lacquering. You'll need:


Dust maskSafety googles
Gloves, Depending on the kind of lacquer primer you bought, there are several methods by which you might apply it. Many kinds can be brushed onto your board to improve the quality of your lacquer. Always follow your lacquer primer directions, but generally:


Mix the lacquer primer with a clean paint stirrer. Then dip a clean brush into the lacquer and wipe excess primer off onto the inner lip of its can.
Apply the lacquer in thin layers with long, even, overlapping strokes. Prime from the top to the bottom, and target cracks and joints, which can be difficult to prime.
Wait the required time between coats, indicated in the label instructions of your primer, then apply another coat in the same fashion. Apply three to five coats total., Depending on the kind of lacquer you have purchased, your method of application will vary. Many lacquers, however, use a spray applicators. Always follow your lacquer instructions, but for spray applicator lacquers, generally:


Shake the can for 5 to 10 minutes. Hold it so the spray nozzle is 10 - 18"" (25.4 - 45.7 cm) from the surface you are going to lacquer.
Press the spray button down to emit the spray lacquer. Apply it in short, smooth, horizontal strokes.
It may take some trial and error before you achieve the correct spray distance. Dimpling in the finish is cause by excess distance. Streaking occurs when you apply lacquer too close to the wood., The wait time between coats of lacquer will be different depending on the lacquer you have used. Follow your lacquer's label instructions for best results. When your lacquer is ready for another coat:Sand the entire lacquered surface of your board lightly with very fine (240 - 400 rating) sandpaper.
Wipe dust free of your board with a clean rag or tack cloth. Pay special attention to edges and joints, where fine dust may have built up.
Apply a second layer of lacquer in the same fashion as previously described. Repeat this process until your lacquer has at least three to five coats.

, After your final layer of lacquer has dried, it's time for you to bring out its shine. You can do this by lightly buffing it with a 0000 rated piece of steel wool. Then wipe the surfaces of your board with a clean, dry cloth, and use a suitable wax to really make it sparkle."
"
Avoid deforming the top surface of the board.,
Attach handles for easier board transportation.,
Ornament the sides of your goal board.,
String lights on the sides of your goal board.",How to Customize Cornhole Boards3," For official games, the top of your goal board must be smooth and even. Both teams using the same equipment prevents one team from having an unfair advantage over another.For example, if you decorated the surface of your board with glitter, the glitter might increase the friction on its surface, making it easier to land a bean bag on the board's surface and score points.

, Official Cornhole boards are 2 by 4 feet (0.61 by 1.22 m). This can be awkward to carry, even with two people. By installing handles on either side of your board, it'll be a cinch to move around.


Measure and mark the exact midpoint on the flat face of both sides of your board with a small piece of painter's tape.
Position handles to center on the tape. Check their levelness with a level before fastening, then attach each to the sides of your goal board with screws and drill.

, Although the top surface of your board can't be monkeyed with, you can add some creative flourishes to its sides. Ribbons, rhinestones, sequins, or other eye catching embellishments may even distract your opponents from victory.


Attach fabric and similar material with tacks and small nails. Attach less flexible ornaments, like rhinestones, with glue.

, This is a great way to keep your Cornhole game going late into the evening. With a string of lights hanging on the sides of your goal board, players will be able to find them easily, though mis-thrown bean bags might prove a challenge.You can use U-shaped tacks and a hammer to fasten your lights to the sides of your board.
In many cases, like when tailgating or playing in the backyard, you may not have an electrical outlet available. For this reason, you may want a portable power supply for your lights.

Start planning out your obstacle course.,
Consider legal concerns.,
Think about instructions.,
Include obstacles that test agility.,
Create jumping obstacles.,
Build a balancing obstacle for your course.,
Include teamwork in your obstacles.,
Create obstacles that test strength.,
Consider inflatable obstacles.,
Gather materials.,
Place them according to plan.",How to Build an Obstacle Course," Before you can begin planning the details of your obstacle course you will need to find a good location to build it in. The obstacles you can later include may be dictated by the location you choose, depending largely on the amount of space available and the terrain itself. Look around for the best space available to you for your obstacle course.


Hills might be obstacles themselves and can add difficulty to your course.
Flat areas are a great location if you plan on building obstacles yourself that need to be level.
Bodies of water can be used as a fun swimming obstacle or something to jump over.
Make sure your space has enough room for any obstacles you want to include.
Check that the area is free from any hazards such as stones, hard surfaces, or anything else that could cause harm.;
, Not all obstacle courses are created the same. You will need to build your course while keeping the participants in mind. Think about the age and physical fitness levels of those who will be using the course. Try to build a safe and challenging course based on this information.


Children's obstacle courses should be simple and safe, avoiding any hard, large, or dangerous obstacles.
Obstacle courses for adults can be more intensive and include more dangerous obstacles like swimming through a deep body of water.

, Once you know where you are going to build your course and who is going to use it you can begin to plan your course. These details will allow you to think about which obstacles you might want to include, the level of difficulty, and safety issues in mind as you plan your course.


Think about which obstacles would fit certain areas of your space better.
Consider how the obstacles will work sequentially.
Make sure obstacles are far enough apart so that they won't interfere with one another.

, If your obstacle course is being planned for any kind of fund-raising, public, or other community event you will need to plan and secure certain legal requirements. Building a simple obstacle course for your friends and family on the other hand will not require such steps. Make sure that your obstacle course is legally protected if need be before proceeding.


Simple backyard obstacle courses won't need any legal protection.
Larger, public, and for profit courses will need legal protection and other legal requirements.
Legal requirements will vary greatly depending on location and event. Talk with a lawyer to learn more.

, Part of an obstacle course is having rules. If participants don't understand how to proceed when tackling an obstacle they may do so in an unfair or unsafe way. Think about some of the basic types of obstacles and how you might instruct participants when they encounter them.Having instructions can help prevent injury and make a fair obstacle course.
Include specific instructions on how an obstacle is to be completed.
For example, participants must go through a tunnel and not over it.

, A common element of an obstacle course is to feature obstacles that test a persons agility. These obstacles will require a person to move quickly and accurately to successfully move past it. Create a well rounded course by including obstacles that test agility. Running around a series of cones, like a skier slaloming, can be a good test of agility.
Try tying small threads with bells attached to them just off the ground. Participants have to step around them without ringing the bells.Hanging hula-hoops from a branch can create an obstacle that needs to be hopped or stepped through.

, Many obstacle courses contain obstacles that require the participants to leap over or around. Including jumping obstacles can be a great way to make your obstacle course a fun challenge. Review some of the following ideas to get you started when thinking about your jumping obstacles:Try setting some targets, such as a hula hoop, on the ground to have people jump towards.
Consider a section of the course that has to be done on a pogo stick or bounce ball.
Create a high jump obstacle by placing something soft in the path like a hay bale.
Doing a series of frog jumps can be a good test of jumping abilities.

, Balancing obstacles will test the fine movements of participants as they attempt the obstacle. These obstacles are generally slower paced, requiring graceful and thoughtful motions from those undertaking the obstacle course.A simple straight board can make a good balance beam.
You can require people to stand on one leg for a certain amount of time.
Participants might be required to balance a ball on their head for a few seconds.

, Although many obstacle courses are competitions between individuals, you may want to include obstacles that require teamwork. Including teamwork can be a great way to get your participants working together to overcome the obstacle course.


Partners might have to throw and catch a ball a certain number of times.
The three legged race is a good obstacle that requires team work.
Having a “human wheelbarrow” section of the course can be a good way to include teamwork.

, Beyond challenging participants agility, speed, and balance your obstacles should also test strength. Many strength based obstacles will require that some amount of weight be moved or lifted either over a distance or a certain number of times.You might have a section where people have to do a certain amount of push-ups before continuing.
Placing a simple pull up bar or arm hang bar can test upper body strength.
Running while carrying something heavy can be a test of full body strength.
Crawling can engage the entire body.

, A safe and easy option for creating an obstacle course is to make use of inflatable obstacles. Since these obstacles are inflatable they pose a low risk of injury and can add an appealing and lighthearted feeling to your obstacle course. Check your local businesses and services to see if any nearby vendors offer inflatable obstacles either for sale or rent.


Most inflatable obstacles are designed with children in mind.
Inflatable obstacles are easy to place, requiring little to no assembly.

, After you have your obstacles and their arrangement planned out you will need to acquire the materials that will be used to create the obstacles. The materials you need will vary greatly depending on what you have planned for your course. Look over some of the following ideas to get you started:


Hula hoops can make great markers for jumping or agility obstacles.
A simple board can make a quick balancing beam.
Hay bales or couch cushions can make a fun jumping obstacle.
Small sport cones can outline the obstacle course or be obstacles themselves.

, Having assembled your obstacles you can begin to place them according to your obstacle course layout plan. Place the obstacles where you planed them and evaluate their position before opening up our course to others.


You might find that a planned location for an obstacle doesn't work well. Don't be afraid to make changes.
Try doing the obstacle course yourself once you've built it to evaluate how well it works.
Once you've built and tested your course it's time to open it up to others.

, It is best to keep the treasure's location stored in your brain only).

, Stop just before you reach the water table. Remember, usually throughout the summer, the water table is lower than winter or times of regular precipitation; so if you bury your treasure too low, it could be susceptible to water damage as the water table rises.

, Most people use a chest, but burlap sacks and tarps have been used with minimal success.

, Make sure the hole is big enough to fit your chest.

, Make sure to pack the dirt or soil as you are filling the hole. Any loose soil is a dead giveaway to treasure hunters.

, Also, the tree can be a helpful landmark.

Place the frames in the craters.








,
Put a stake into each pit.,
Cover the bottom of the pit with landscape cloth (optional).,
Fill in the pit.,
Build a backboard (optional).,
Mark the foul lines (optional).",How to Build a Horseshoe Pit," Here's what you need to build two regulations-size horseshoe pits that will face each other (if you only want to build one pit, halve the materials):









Two 6-foot-long treated wood 2x6s (38mm x 140mm), cut in half
Two 8-foot-long treated wood 2x6s (38mm x 140mm), cut in half
Six 3-foot-long treated wood 2x6s, and four 2-foot-long 2x2s (optional, for 2 backboards)
Several bags of sand (enough to fill two 36x48 inch boxes at least 3-4 inches deep)
Two 3-foot-long steel posts (about 1-inch diameter)
16-24 Exterior (deck) screws (2.5 inches long, approx.)
Landscape cloth or similar, to cover bottom of pits (optional)
Concrete (optional)
Something to mark the pit dimensions on the ground with, such as flour, lime, spray paint, etc. (optional)
Tools: Saw, electric drill with screwdriver, sledgehammer, measuring tape, shovel;
, If you're building one pit, place it so that you'll have plenty of room to stand back and throw. (National Horseshoe Pitchers Association rules say that the foul line should be 27 feet or 37 feet away from the stake, but just decide on a distance you're comfortable with.) If you're building two pits, from the back of one pitching area to the back of the other, you'll need 48 feet (14.6 m) of length (but this includes 2 feet of clear space behind each box). The width will be 6 feet (1.8 m).








, Take two of the 36"" boards and two of the 48"" ones, and make a rectangle. Screw the pieces of wood together at the corners with the deck screws to make one frame. Repeat to make a second frame, overlapping ends in the same direction so that the two frames have the same dimensions.








, Their fronts should be 36 feet (11.0 m) apart, and a short edge should be facing the front.








, so you will know where to dig. Lift the boxes and set them aside.








, The grass is going to get ruined in the pit area anyway, so dig a few inches or more down into the ground in a rectangle shape, so that the frame top sits a tiny bit lower than the grass. A somewhat bowl-shaped hole will make it easier to keep the sand in place later.








,, The 1-inch diameter stake in each pit should be 36 inches (91.4 cm) from the ""front"" of each frame (assuming the front faces the other frame).









NHPA rules dictate that 14 to 15 inches (35.6 to 38.1 cm) of the stake should be exposed above the ground, and that the stake should be tilted forward by a a few inches. If you were to make a triangle out of the ground, the stake, and a ruler, the stake should hit the ruler at 12 inches (30.5 cm).
You can hammer the stakes into the ground, or you can pour a concrete base around the bottoms and bury them. The second way takes more time, but it will result in a more stable stake.

, You don't have to do this step, but it will keep sand from ""sinking"" into the dirt below.








, You can use sand, dirt, or blue clay (which you'd have to keep wet). Sand and clay are generally considered better for horseshoes, because the metal won't skip or slide as much.








, A backboard behind your stake will stop your horseshoes from going way beyond where you intended, as well as helping to keep some of the dirt, sand or clay inside the pit. Build one by joining the three 3-foot-long 2x6 boards, and attach the 2-foot-long 2x2 boards to the back. Bury the legs of the backboard.








, Using whatever you used to mark where the frames would go, you can also mark foul lines.

Draw a hopscotch design on the ground.,
Throw a flat stone or similar object (small beanbag, shell, button, plastic toy) to land on square one.,
Hop through the squares, skipping the one you have your marker on.,
Pick up the marker on your way back.,
Pass the marker on to the next person.",How to Play Hopscotch1," Chalk is the best drawing medium on asphalt, patio stones or concrete. The squares should be large enough to fit one foot and to make sure that a stone thrown into the square will not bounce out too easily. While there are variants on drawing the design, a common schoolyard design is shown here.









It is common to designate the ""10"" section shown here as a rest or stop area. This is where the player can take a moment to turn around and/or regain their balance. Sometimes a more creative name, like ""Heaven"" is given to the space.;
, It has to land inside the square without touching the border or bouncing out. If you don't get it within the lines, you lose your turn and pass the stone to the next person. If you do get it, however, go on to the next step.









Hopscotch can be played with just one person. If that's your case, make up the rules as you see fit!

, Each square gets one foot. Which foot you start with is up to you. You can't have more than one foot on the ground at a time, unless there are two number squares right next to each other. In that case, you can put down both feet simultaneously (one in each square). Always keep your feet inside the appropriate square(s); if you step on a line, hop on the wrong square, or step out of the square, you lose your turn.








, When you get to the last number, turn around (remaining on one foot) and hop your way back in reverse order. While you're on the square right before the one with your marker, lean down (probably on one foot still!) and pick it up. Then, skip over that square and finish up.








, If you completed the course with your marker on square one (and without losing your turn), then throw your marker onto square two on your next turn. Your goal is to complete the course with the marker on each square. The first person to do this wins the game!

These are the official measurements for professional men's Kabaddi — if you're just playing casually with friends, your play area doesn't need to be exactly this size. However, it should be flat, open, and roughly rectangular.
For women's Kabaddi, the court size is slightly smaller — 12 meters (39.4 ft) wide x 8 meters (26.2 ft) long.;
, The following are the official court markings as specified for professional Kabaddi; again, if you're playing casually with friends, your markings don't need to be exact.



Boundary lines: The lines at the edge of the 13 meter x 10 meter court.

Play area lines: These lines mark a 13 meter x 8 meter rectangular area inside the court — one meter of space separates each side from the 10 meter boundary lines above.

Mid line: This line divides the court into two 6.5 meters (21.3 ft) x 8 meter halves. Each team's ""territory"" is the play area on its side of the mid line.

Baulk lines: These lines run parallel to the mid line and are 3.75 meters (12.3 ft) from it on either side.

Bonus lines: These lines run parallel to the baulk lines and are 1 meter (3.3 ft) from them on the side opposite the mid line.

, Traditionally, four players from each team take each side of the field, leaving each team with three players held in reserve. However, some variations of Kabaddi call for all seven players to take the field at once.

,


Any sort of random method for determining which team goes first is fair game — you can also try rolling for the highest dice roll, guessing a number that a non-biased referee is thinking of, etc.

,


In Kabaddi, teams take turns sending players (called ""raiders"") across the mid line to the other team's side of the court. The raider tries to tag members of the other team and run back to his side — each player he touches equals one point for his team if he makes it back safely.


However, the raider must start repeatedly yelling ""Kabaddi"" before he crosses the mid line and cannot stop repeating this word until he crosses back over to his team's side. If he stops yelling or takes a breath on the opponent's side of the court, even momentarily, he must return to his own side of the court, scoring no points. In this case, one point is awarded to the defending team for a successful play.
Each member of a team must raid in sequence — if a team member raids out of order, the opposing team gets one point.

,


If your team is being raided, you and the other three players in play are ""anti-raiders"" or ""stoppers."" Your goal is to keep the raider from tagging you and crossing back over the midline. You can do this either by running away from him until he runs out of breath or physically restraining him by tackling or grabbing him.
Note that a raider may not be grabbed or held by his clothes, hair, or any part of his body other than his limbs and torso.

,


The two teams alternate between raiding and defending for two halves of twenty minutes each (with a five minute break between halves.)
After halftime, the two teams switch sides of the court.
The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!

, In Kabaddi, players can be temporarily sent ""out"" of play for a variety of reasons. If this happens, they may not be replaced by players in reserve — substitutions are only made for players who are not out. Below are a list of circumstances in which a player may be sent out.


If the raider tags any defending players and makes it back to his side, the players he tagged are out.
If a raider is captured and cannot pass back over the midline before he runs out of breath, he is out.
If any player (raiding or defending) steps outside the boundary lines, he is out (unless he was deliberately pulled or shoved, in which case, the offending player is out.)
If a team has three unproductive raids in a row, the third raider is out. An unproductive raid occurs when a raider cannot score any points (or loses points) during a raid. However, if a raider can cross the baulk line and return to his side of the court, the raid counts as a successful one even if he doesn't tag anyone.
If a defending team member enters the raider's side of the court before his team is officially given the chance to raid, he is out.

, Whenever your team gets a member of the opponent team out, you have a chance to bring back (or ""revive"") someone on your team who has previously been ruled out. This is true for both raiding and defending teams.


Players are revived in the order they were gotten out — bringing back players out of order results in a point for the other team.

, If you can get the entire other team out at once for any combination of reasons and none of their players are eligible for revival, your team scores a ""Lona"" (two extra points for that play.)


When this happens, the entire opposing team is revived.

, If your team is defending with less than three players and you still manage to prevent the raider from getting back to his side of the court, you score an additional ""super catch"" point.


This point is on top of the point you get for getting the raider out, so you get two points in total for the play.

, Most penalties in Kabaddi result in one point being awarded to the opposing team. Below is a list of offenses that can earn the opposing team points.


If a raider says anything besides the pre-approved ""Kabbadi"" chant while he is raiding, the raid is over and the defending team gets a point plus the chance to raid (but the raider is not out.)
If the raider starts his chant late (in other words, after he crosses the mid line), the raid is over and the defending team gets a point plus the chance to raid (but, again, the raider is not out.)
If a raider goes out of order, the defending team gets a point and the raid is over.
If more than one raider enter the opponent's court at once, the raid is over and the defending team gets a point.
If any defenders enter the raider's side of the court before it is their turn to raid, each defender that does so earns a point for the other team.
If, after a Lona, the wiped-out team doesn't return its revived players back to the field within ten seconds, the opposing team earns one point.
If the raider's teammates attempt to help him by calling out warnings or advice, the defending team gets a point.
If players deliberately get out in order to force a Lona and revive their team members, the opposing team scores an extra point for each offending player that was on the field in addition to the two Lona points.

Partner up.",How to Avoid Detection in a Game of Spotlight," Here are some common rules to playing Spotlight, if you don't already know how to play or would like a fair, classic set to use.


Spotlight is played with a group of people in large, dark environments.
One (or more in a large group) player is designated as the 'seeker'. The seeker is given a torch/flash-light and loudly counts a number of seconds (thirty is a good number). During that count, the rest of the players must run and hide.
When the seeker is finished counting, they search for the rest of the players using the light of their torch. They can tag a player 'out' of the game by shining the light on them and declaring the player's name (if the group is too large and the players unfamiliar with each other, it is common for declaring a player 'spotted' as sufficient, rather than calling their name)
The game is over when the seeker has tagged 'out' all hiding players. Spotlight can be played so that tagged 'out' players can also become 'seekers', albeit without torches. This rule should be used if more than ten people are playing, because otherwise each round may go for a very long time while the lone seeker searches for the last hiding players.
When the game or round is over, the first person to be tagged becomes the seeker for a new round.;
, Hiding places can be effective or ineffective dependent on lots of different factors! It isn't always about whether or not it's hard for you to be seen.

, If there is tall grass, rocky terrain, a stream, spiderwebs, mud or any other obstacle between the seeker's position and your hiding spot, they might not even bother to examine your location and move on (especially if they think you are lazy and couldn't be bothered either!). Take care that you don't go outside the boundaries.

, This is especially important if you intend to change spots or circle around a large object, such as a stout tree trunk.


Grass, sand and dirt are ideal.
Asphalt/concrete/tarmac, stone and metallic surfaces are great. (Just make sure you haven't got gravel or wet sand stuck to your shoes, as it will crunch)
Watch out for thick snow and gravel, which will squeak and crunch respectively.
Walking in a stream will cause splashing and will probably cause you to trip and fall.

, Right next to water, in your or your friend's car, even inside a bin! The more surprising and ridiculous your hiding place is, the less your 'seeker' may consider searching it.

, Two people make twice as much noise and movement, and they may get you both out.

, Pick a spot in which you can stand behind a branch, or a wide tree trunk. If the ground undulates or has hills, use them to your advantage. Also, use levels - People usually forget to look upwards, so trees and climbable structures make excellent hiding spots. Also, it is possible to hide below the 'seeker' under benches, cars, branches and in depressions in the ground. Just take care that you can see so that people don't tread on you!

, If you are really committed, you can arrive in the daytime before playing to stake out the area. Search for spots that would be difficult to find without light. If you plan on climbing trees, it is best that you practice first in daylight so that you can find handholds and routes up. Also, it is best that if you fall at all it is during the day. At night, if you fall and are rendered unable to move or even call out by your injury, it may be difficult for your friends to find you. Additionally, it is frighteningly difficult to safely land from a fall when you can't see what you are landing on.

, It can be amazing what people will fail to see if they are not expecting to see it there, and often remaining stationary can keep you hidden even under a full beam from ten or fifteen meters away. But don't take too long to decide. Count to five and go with what your instinct tells you.

, You should minimise the time spent out in the open, especially if you don't know where the 'seeker' is.

, The noise usually carries far less than you might expect, especially if it is a windy night, so you might as well cross the distance as quickly as you like.

, It helps if you have warmed up and stretched. Some people's knees can crack or creak if they haven't bent them in a while, so you can crouch until they crack before the game to prevent the sound from being made while sneaking.


Crouch a little and lower your posture.
Take care where you place your feet. With each step, touch the ground with your heel first, and roll your foot forward. This will make your steps quieter.
Don't be afraid to crawl on your hands and feet if the ground is soft, because if you fear you will be seen you can flatten yourself against the ground to reduce your visibility from a distance.
You can toss a stone or stick into a branch or hard object distant from you to create a small diversion before moving, but you have to be careful that the 'seeker' doesn't notice that it was thrown.

, A clever trick that works best when there are many players tagged out and multiple 'seekers' is to confidently stride out of cover and walk past a seeker. If you are a good liar, you might even ask them ""Have you found James yet?"" or say ""This round is going on forever."" You can also walk out of cover and blend with a group of people already tagged out to avoid detection. This is occasionally successful and even if you are called out, you will usually be praised for your stunningly bold and creative play.

, Being friendly to other players can be very important to winning in Spotlight. If you are unfriendly, protest when it is your turn to be the 'seeker' or snitch on other players by telling the seeker where they are hiding, you will be disadvantaged in that:


Other players may tell the 'seeker' where you are hiding out of spite.
Other players won't team up with you to perform misdirecting or cooperative techniques.
You will be distracted by your feelings about other players and will make mistakes.
You will not have fun playing Spotlight.

, Cooperative tricks can be performed if groups hide in the same place.


If one of you is tagged you can jump out, feign irritation and move along, prompting the 'seeker' to leave without catching your friend. In this way having multiple people in the same spot can prolong the time they are hidden. This can be very effective if you can hide lots of people in a place like a tree, because the 'seeker' will not expect four or five people to be hiding in the same location)
If you are a rough-and-tumble, adventurous group of roguish scamps and not above a little foul play, you can all jump out from behind the tree, rock, trench or bush you are hiding behind and simultaneously throw sand into the 'seeker's' eyes. This will make it hard for them to identify more than one or two of you as you all run away and find new cover.

, You and a mate can help each other by hiding at opposite ends of the space and making a loud and distinctively human noise whenever the other is close to being discovered by the 'seeker'. The 'seeker' will usually immediately turn and investigate the noise. Alternatively you can create misdirection by creating a noise distant from your location by throwing pebbles, or if you live in Australia, gum/honkey nuts at metal or plastic signs or playground equipment. Be careful that if you do this you won't hit someone close to the target of your throw.


You and a friend could swap jumpers or jackets, or wear the same clothes, to confuse the 'seeker' and cause them to call out the wrong names.

Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side closest to the flagpole.,
Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side furthest from the flagpole.,
Ensure the thick white line is on the top left, if hung vertically.,
Fly the flag upside down for a distress signal.",How to Know if a Union Jack Has Been Hung Upside Down1," The white stripes on the Union Jack are not all the same size. The wider white stripes on the side closest to the flagpole should sit on top of the diagonal red stripes.The white stripes represent Scotland’s Saint Andrew’s Cross while the red ones represent Ireland’s Saint Patrick’s Cross.A good mnemonic device to use is ""wide white top."";
, On the side furthest from the flagpole, the white stripes that run diagonally should be thinner on the top of the red stripe, and thicker below the red stripe. This applies to both white stripes on the side furthest from the flagpole.


Saint Andrew's Cross was on the flag first and takes precedence over Saint Patrick's cross., When hanging your flag vertically, the thick white stripe should be on the top of all the other stripes on the top left hand side of your flag. The top edge of the flag should become the left edge of the flag when hanging it vertically.This practice is similar to hanging the American flag, but varies in other countries like Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Slovenia, where they have different designs for flags hung vertically., Flying the Union Jack upside down is a coded distress signal, and should only be used as such. In the UK, flying the flag upside down may be considered an insult, even if it was an honest mistake. "
"
Show respect and dignity for all Australian flags.,
Fly the flag.,
Raise the flag quickly and lower it ceremoniously.During the raising and lowering of the Australian National flag, everyone present must be silent and face the flag.",How to Fly the Australian Flag," The Australian National flag takes precedence in positioning over all other flags or ensigns. On Australian soil, the Australian National flag takes precedence over other national flags.;
, The following must be observed when flying the Australian National flag:


Raise it no earlier than first light
Lower it no later than duskIf you wish to fly the Australian National flag by night, it must be lighted.

, This also applies to when the flag is carried in a parade. Those in uniform are obliged to salute the flag."
"
Assume the pole is on the left if it’s a graphic flag.,
Drape the top left of the flag over the top left of the shoulder, when draping it on a coffin.,
Wear the flag backwards when it's on the right shoulder of a uniform.",How to Know if a Union Jack Has Been Hung Upside Down2," When drawing the flag or putting up a graphic of the flag with no pole, assume the pole is on the left side of the flag. This means that the thick white stripes should lay over the red stripes on the left side of the flag.

, When draping the flag over a coffin for a funeral service, make sure that the top left of the Union Jack be laid over the top left corner of the coffin. This is the traditional way to drape the flag for military funerals.


Before cremating or burying the body, the flag should be removed and folded.It is improper to use the flag as drapage for seat covers or tablecloths, or as a cover for boxes, barriers, or art during an unveiling ceremony., If your patch of the flag is on the left shoulder, you should wear the flag as it would normally look. However, on the right shoulder, the flag should be flipped backwards.


This is similar to American Military Uniforms which require the flag to be reverse."
"
Choose the shape for your flag.,
Choose a simple design.,
Use two to three colors.",How to Design a Flag1," Most flags are either rectangular or square. Your flag doesn't have to be rectangular, but you should stick to simple shapes that are easy to see from a distance. For example, Nepal’s flag is made of two overlapping triangles., Some of the most common flag designs are bicolors, tricolors, and quarters, or use stripes, panels, and borders. The flag can also be a solid color with a unique symbol in the center. Alternatively, you can place a rectangle in the upper left hand corner called a canton (like on the American flag) that includes a symbol.


You could design an asymmetrical flag, like the flag for Norway, where the cross is slightly off center.

, As a general rule, you should only use two to three colors in your flag design. If you use more they can be hard to distinguish. The most common colors found on flags are black, blue, green, red, white, and yellow. You can use light and dark colors to create contrast.You do not need to stick to the most popular colors. Instead, choose a color that symbolizes the place or organization your flag represents.

"
"
Using the pencil, draw an x on the piece of paper.,
Draw a second x, this time making the center a little less than an inch ABOVE the center of the paper.

,
Trace with the blue marker, erasing the inside lines around the center.

,
Draw thirteen stars inside the x, using the pencil once again.,
Color in the x with the blue marker, but remember, do not color in the stars, simply trace around them.

,
Outside of the x, fill in the rest of the white paper red.

,
This is how the finished flag will look like.

",How to Draw a Confederate Flag," Make the center of the x a little less than an inch below the center of the paper.;
,,, These will be left colorless.

,,,"
"
Decide what you want your flag to represent.,
Choose colors that have meaning.,
Add an image.",How to Design a Flag2," When you are designing a flag it is very important that you choose colors and images that symbolize the organization or place your flag represents. For instance, you may be designing a flag for a micronation, fictional land, club, organization, or charity. Keep this in mind when you are adding symbolism to your flag.


For example, if you are creating a flag for a fishing club, you may want to use a fishing rod, boat, or fish as a symbol. The color blue could also be used to represent water.

, When you are selecting which colors to include on your flag, make sure the colors have some sort of symbolic meaning. For example, if your location is near water, you may want to include blue in your flag to symbolize the water. Consider some of the meanings associated with popular flag colors:Black: determination, ethnic heritage, bravery, and/or defeating one's enemies.
Blue: freedom, vigilance, perseverance, loyalty, justice, prosperity, peace, patriotism, water.
Green: the Earth, agriculture, luck, and/or fertility.
Red: courage, communism, revolution, hardiness, blood, and/or valor.
White: peace, purity, snow, and/or innocence.
Yellow: the sun, wealth, and/or justice.
Pink-: Feminism
Gray: selflessness

, Images and symbols can be used to help distinguish your flag from others, and will communicate the purpose or meaning behind the flag. The image of an eagle could symbolize freedom or power, a star could stand for divinity or honor, and a circle could represent the sun.The Japanese flag, for instance, has a plain white background with a red circle in the middle. This represents the sun, which is an important symbol in Japanese culture.

"
"
Don’t include lettering on a flag.,
Decide on a design that is easy to draw.,
Use a flag design app.",How to Design a Flag3," Lettering is not necessary on a flag. The colours and symbols on the flag should be enough to identify what the flag is representing. Lettering is also difficult to read from a distance and will look backwards if viewed from the opposite side.Flags are often hung up high and can flap in the breeze. As a result, lettering of any kind will be difficult to read.

, The best flag designs are those that are easy to draw. Do not include a complex seal or emblem on your flag. This will make it difficult to reproduce. Flag designs should be simple enough for a child to draw from memory., If you have been tasked with designing a flag, but don’t know where to start, you can try using a flag design app to give you ideas for different basic designs and symbols. Search online for a flag design app."

Find out which size of flag you will be building a flag display case (fdc) for.,
Measure the folded flag.,
Decide on the type of wood you will be using.,
To cut the wood, and seeing that the flag is triangular in shape, cut the angles on a 45 degree.,
Measure off the longest portion of the angled 6' board (that's your long point of that particular angle, the other is the short point of that particular angle.),
Your objective now is to turn that piece around 180 degrees, and cut the short point again in order to make it a long point.,
Tack the frame together or use a strap to hold it in position.

,
Measure the size of glass you will need.,
Take the piece or pieces and with the table saw in operation, slowly guide the piece along the guide.,
Use small trim nails (1 1/4) long and nail frame together, with glass inserted into the cut grooves you just made (set nails with punch and color putty when done).,
Take the frame and place it on some 1/4"" ply (or oak paneling) and trace the outside of your frame.

,
Cut this out for the backing of your display case.,
You can drill about 8 pilot holes through the 1/4"" ply into the wood frame.,
Insert your burial flag.

,
Insert your screws.

",How to Build a Flag Display Case," 3x5, 4x6, 5x9 (burial).;
,


You will need the bottom (horizontal) measurement along with the two diagonal measurements. Also, get the thickness of the folded flag.

For this example we will use the 5x9 burial--

bottom msmt: 24""
diagonal msmt: 16-3/4""
thickness: 2-3/4""





, Hardwoods are a better choice for this project. This is for reasons of visual appeal and longevity. For this example, we will use oak.


A 1x4 piece of oak actually measures 3 1/2"" in width, which is fine.

Buy an 8 foot (2.4 m) length (for beginners, in case there are mistakes).



, You can do this with a circular saw or a chop saw (mitre saw). Chop saws give a much better cut.


The bottom measurement of the flag is 24"", so the inside measurement of the 45 degree cuts must be at least 24"". I recommend cutting the length of 1/4. (little play room for glass and flag).
You should have approx. 6 feet (1.8 m) of board left. As you know, wood has a grain pattern. What follows now will give your case more of a professional look.

,


Your angled measurements are 16 3/4"", short point to short point. However, you will be cutting it 3"" longer than that (for mistakes), so lets just cut our side pieces 20"" long. short to short.
Measure off the 6' board from long point 20"". Using a speed square or framing square, make a mark and cut your piece. (set this piece aside)
The longer remaining piece should have a short point.

,


Once you do this, your two 45 degree angles at the top of the display case will fit and the grain will match. it will look continuous. (Match up all the angled pieces until you find that grain match).
When you place the bottom piece up to the angled side pieces to form the triangle, you will notice that the side pieces are too long. Just pencil mark the bottom where it hangs over the bottom piece. That now is going to be cut at a 45 degree. Make sure you cut the 45 degree angle the correct way, your end product should be a short to short angled piece. If it helps; when you are marking the piece to be cut, also mark the side of the board so you know for sure, which way the wood should be cut.

,,


We can measure the glass in two ways:

The exact size, minus 1/8th inch. (if there is going to be a wooden corner cover over the glass and attach it to the frame.) or
We can measure the glass 1/4"" larger if we are going to insert it into the frame.

Buy an 8' piece of wooden corner board (for outside corners of walls) it is 3/4"" long on each side of the 45 degree angle. Cut this to fit the outside of the triangular frame you just made. You can insert the glass from the back side after the glass is inserted, then you can cut and place 3 pieces of 1/4"" x 1/4"" moulding on the inside to hold the glass in place.
Inset glass involves using a table saw. If you have one or can use one, this is what you do.




You set your guide that's on the table saw to 1/4"" from the inside of the saw blade to the guide itself.
Set the depth of the blade to 1/8th inch.

If you know at the beginning that you will be insetting the glass, then cut the entire 8' length of board at one time. It's very difficult to cut small pieces like this and have it turn out correctly.

If you have never used a table saw, ask someone that has to preform this next step.





, making sure not too force the cut. be gentle. its wise to use a forked stick to push the wood through its cutting process.


There are jigs out there that can be purchased for just this job. Call a do-it-yourself place. they can help you.
Once you have your cuts made, you are ready to nail it together.

,


This is much easier done if you have a brad gun. Also place the frame so the glass is face down, so it doesn't break if it falls out during this process.

,, (stain edges with proper color. For oak, you can use minwax-colonial maple or early American.)

, (on the back side) for screws.

Create a triangular fold at the corner of the flag.,
Fold the triangle inward along the entire length of the flag.,
Note the appearance of the folded flag.",How to Fold a Flag1," Get the help of another person to hold and fold the flag. Both people should hold the flag waist-high so that flat face of the flag is parallel to the ground.

Both people should hold the flag at the width ends (sides) rather than the length ends (top and bottom).
The person holding the flag nearest the field of stars will remain still during the entire flag folding process. The individual holding the flag at the fully striped end will do the folding.;
, Bring the bottom edge up so that it meets the top edge. Hold the edges by firmly holding down the top and bottom corners.

The lower half of the striped section will be folded lengthwise over the field of stars.

, The new bottom edge should be folded up to meet the new top edge, bringing the field of stars to the outside.

The flag should now be folded in lengthwise quarters.
The most recent open edge should be along the top and the most recent folded edge should be along the bottom.

, Bring the bottom corner of the flag on the striped edge up so that it meets with the top edge of the flag.

This should form a triangle of cloth with the striped running perpendicular to the stripes on the rest of the flag. The sides of the triangle should be evenly aligned to the sides of the flag, and there should be no overlapping material.

, Fold the triangular tip into the rest of the flag so that it creates a flat edge again.

Build a fire.,
Lower and fold the flag.,
Carefully place the folded flag on top of the fire.,
Take a moment to respect the flag.,
Say the Pledge of Allegiance.,
Make sure the fire is completely put out.,
Consider more elaborate ceremonial options.",How to Dispose of a Damaged American Flag1," Build a medium-size campfire or bonfire in a safe location, away from any buildings or trees. If you can, use a well-maintained fire pit or a dedicated fire area. Clear away any leaves, garbage or other debris. As well as posing a safety hazard, an area littered with these things isn't befitting the dignity of the flag.


Wait for the fire to reach a strong but steady burn. The fire should be strong enough to incinerate the entire flag, but not so intense that it may blow partially burnt flag pieces out of the fire.
Avoid disposing of the flag on particularly windy days. If the flag blows away while it's burning, it can pose a serious fire hazard.
Check local burning ordinances in your area. Some jurisdictions prohibit constructing fires without first obtaining permission from the local government. Visit the Environmental Protection Agency website for more information.;
, Flags that are worn, tattered, or soiled beyond repair should be respectfully retired. If the flag is currently flying, slowly lower it with respect and remove it from its pole. Fold the flag into its traditional triangle fold. If you're unsure how to properly fold a flag, consult our guide or visit the Veterans of Foreign Wars websitefor instructions.


Always handle the flag with care and respect. Don't place it on the ground or put anything on top of it as you carry it to the fire.

, Place the flag in the center of the flames, taking care not to burn yourself. If the fire is too hot for you to be able to place the flag directly into the fire, wait for it to die down - don't toss the flag into the fire from a distance. Watch the flag - make sure that it is burned safely and completely. Incompletely burning the flag before disposing of it is considered undignified. Don't place the flag into the fire without folding it first. Besides being disrespectful, a loose, billowy flag can easy float or blow away.

, As the flag burns, observe it with reverence. You can even show your respect for the flag in your words or actions - you may salute the flag or observe a moment of silence. Whatever you choose to do, be sure to remain respectful and reverent as the flag as it is retired. Never chat, make jokes, or divert your attention (for instance, to a cell phone) as the flag burns.


Official government flag retirements are accompanied by an elaborate ceremony where the flag is formally presented, recognized, and destroyed. If you're at home, you may want to give a short speech before or after burning the flag. If you do, focus on the symbolism of the flag - what does it represent to you? Does it make you feel sad to retire it? Why are you sad to see it go?

, As the flag is destroyed, take a moment to honor it with the Pledge of Allegiance. Receiving the Pledge of Allegiance is a noble, fitting final duty for your flag. The flag is more than a piece of fabric - it represents liberty and justice and it commemorates the sacrifices made by brave men and women to uphold these ideals. Show your commitment to the flag and the ideals it represents by swearing yourself to it with the Pledge of Allegiance.


The words of the Pledge of Allegiance are: ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""


, When no flag material remains, you may put the fire out. Alternatively, you may allow the fire to gradually and safely burn out on its own (if you do this, don't leave the fire unattended as it burns out.) Exercise proper fire safety protocols when putting a fire out. If you have built a campfire, completely douse the coals with water.


Don't bury hot coals when other people are around, especially if they're barefoot (for instance, as they may be at a public beach) - you can cause serious burns.

, The steps above detail a simplified DIY process for disposing of an American flag. They're ideal if, for instance, you want to retire a flag you've been flying at home. However, if you have access to trained members of a color guard and are comfortable leading formal ceremonies and/or issuing commands to the color guard, you may choose to conduct a formal flag retirement ceremony similar to the one performed by the Boys and Girl Scouts. See How to Retire a U.S. Flag for more information.


These formal ceremonies are also a good choice if you have a large number of flags to retire, as they use just one flag to represent all of the flags being retired that day. When retiring flags en masse, it's often very impractical to give each individual flag its own retirement ceremony.

"
"
Bury and/or shred the flag.,
Consider recycling synthetic flags.,
Give the flag to a qualified organization.",How to Dispose of a Damaged American Flag2," If, for some reason, you cannot burn a flag, you may choose to bury it. Contrary to popular belief, burning is not the only way that a flag can be disposed of. The United States Flag code dictates that burning is only the preferred method of disposal - as long you retire the flag with respect and dignity, an alternate method is acceptable. To bury the flag, begin by finding a dignified wooden box - it should be of good quality and construction, as this box will serve as the flag's vessel as it is interred in the ground. Fold the flag respectfully and place it in the box. Bury the flag in the earth. You may choose to mark the burial location of the flag with a small, respectful wooden or stone marker.


Before burying the flag, you may also shred the flag. Shredding an American flag may at first seem violent or undignified. However, if burning the flag isn't possible, the US Army's Heraldry institute recommends shredding as an acceptable disposal method, provided it is done with reverence.Use scissors to slowly and methodically separate the thirteen stripes, leaving the blue star-spangled field intact. After the flag is completely cut into pieces, place it in a respectful receptacle and bury it OR ceremoniously burn the pieces one by one, starting with the stripes and ending with the blue field.
You may even consider giving a short ""funeral"" for the flag. Give a short, reverent speech on the importance of the flag as it sits in its ""coffin."" Stand at attention as the flag is lowered into the ground. Observe a moment of silence as the flag is buried.

, When the Flag Code was written, almost all flags were made of cloth or other natural fabrics. Today, however, many flags are made from nylon, polyester, or other artificial materials. These modern materials, when burnt, can produce toxic fumes which are harmful to the environment (and any bystanders). Private organizations and non-profits have been formed to recycle vinyl flags - contact a group like American Flag Recyclingfor more information.


Among organizations that provide criteria for properly disposing of American flags, opinions vary as to whether it's disrespectful to recycle the flag. The Boy Scouts of America advocates for recycling synthetic flags,while the American Legion recommends against it.Search for arguments on both sides of the question, then make your own decision - does recycling an American flag seem disrespectful to you?


, Certain United States government organizations offer services to dispose of the flag with proper ceremony at your request for no charge. The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Boy Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts of America and the US Military provide this service. If you don't have access to any of these organizations, you may find success by contacting your city hall or local government.

Keep the flag visible.,
Only fly the flag during suitable weather.,
Raise and lower the flag respectfully.,
Arrange the flag appropriately in relation to other flags.,
Give the flag a prominent position.,
Fly the flag at half-mast (half-staff) for solemn occasions.,
Avoid flying or handling the flag dishonorably.,
Never desecrate the flag.",How to Display the U.S. Flag," Traditionally, the flag was displayed in public only from sunrise to sunset. However, the flag may be displayed at all times if it’s illuminated during darkness. If you're not flying the flag on a traditional flagpole, your precise concerns may vary - when in doubt, simply ensure that the entire flag is visible and that it is free to billow without obstruction.


When displayed from a staff projecting from a building, the union (the starred blue canton) should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half staff. When suspended from a rope extending from the building on a pole, the flag should be hoisted out, union first from the building.
When the U.S. flag is displayed other than from a staff, it should be displayed flat, so that its folds fall free. When displayed over a street, place the union so it faces north or east, depending upon the direction of the street.
When flying the flag from a vehicle, attach it to the antenna or clamp the flagstaff to the right fender (or window).;
, Generally, it's discouraged to display the flag during inclement weather like rain, snow and wind storms. However, it is acceptable to fly special-designated ""all-weather"" flags during rough weather.Your primary goal should be to avoid aging or wearing the flag more quickly than is necessary - knowingly subjecting a flag to conditions that will damage it is disrespectful. The more durable your flag's construction, the wider range of weather conditions it is suited for.

, The U.S. flag code states that the flag should be ""hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously."" In everyday English, this means that you should raise the flag quickly (without rushing) and lower the flag slowly (without dawdling.) The flag is raised quickly so as to give the impression that the flag is eager to get to the top of the pole and represent the nation. It's lowered slowly to give the impression that it's reluctant to leave its post.


The flag, when flown at half staff, has a special procedure for its raising and lowering. When being raised, the flag should be first hoisted to the peak for a moment and then lowered to half staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day.

, When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they must be flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time of peace. But when the U.S. flag is displayed with other flags (states, localities or pennants of societies), the following conventions apply:


When displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, the U.S. flag should be on its own right (so that when you look at the flags, you see the U.S. flag on the left), and the U.S. flag's staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag.
Place the U.S. flag at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of states, localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.
When other flags are flown from the same halyard, the U.S. flag should always be at the peak. Other flags are flown below in this order: POW/MIA flag, other nation's flag, state flag, then civil flags of companies, schools, etc.
When other flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first and lowered last. No flag may fly above or to the right (which is typically the audience's left) of the U.S. flag.

, The flag should be given a position of importance, even if it's not the the primary center of attention at a given event. Though flag-flying accommodations will vary based on the location of the event, try to avoid displaying the flag in such a way that it appears to be an afterthought. For instance, if you're hosting a charity dinner for Veteran's Day, it's much more respectful to display the flag prominently from a pole in the front yard than to pin it over a doorway or window. The Flag Code dictates a wide range of rules for respectfully displaying the flag during special occasions or ceremonies:


The U.S. flag should be displayed prominently at the ceremony of unveiling a statue or monument, but should never be used as the covering for the statue or monument.
When the flag is displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, it should hold the position of superior prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at the clergy’s or speaker’s right facing the audience, next to the church flag. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the speaker or to the right of the audience.
If the flag is displayed flat against the wall on a speaker’s platform, the flag should be placed above and behind the speaker with the blue field of the flag in the upper left-hand corner as the audience faces the flag.
During military funerals, use the flag to cover the casket, but make sure that it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.
When the flag is carried in a procession with other flags, should be either on the marching right (the flag’s own right) or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of that line.
Never display the U.S. flag from a float except from a staff, or so suspended that its folds fall free as though staffed.

, On days that are marked by tragic loss, mourning, or solemn remembrance of past events, flags shouldn't be flown at the top of flag poles. Instead, the flag should be flown halfway up the pole as a sign of sadness and respect - this is called flying a flag at ""half-mast"" or ""half-staff."" In the event of a national tragedy or the death of a prominent member of the government, the president may issue an executive order mandating that government buildings fly their flags at half mast - on these days, you should fly your own flag in the same way. You might also consider flying your flag at half-mast on the following dates:


Memorial Day (until noon.)
Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day (December 7)
Patriot Day (September 11)

, The flag should never be used or displayed in a way that makes it seem unimportant. When accompanied by other flags, it should never be flown in a way that shows subservience to the other flags. Above all, treat the flag as the revered symbol of liberty that it is. When handling a U.S. flag, never:


Dip it for any person or thing, even though state flags, regimental colors and other flags may be dipped as a mark of honor. (See Tips = Salute)
Display it with the union down, except as a signal of distress.
Let the flag touch anything beneath it: ground, floor, water, merchandise.
Fasten or display it in a way that will permit it to be damaged or soiled.
Place or write anything on the flag, including letters, insignia, or designs of any kind.
Use it for holding anything.
Use it as wearing apparel, bedding or drapery.
Use it on a costume or athletic uniform (however, a flag patch may be attached to the uniform of patriotic organizations, military personnel, police officers and firefighters).
Use the flag for advertising or promotion purposes or print it on paper napkins, boxes or anything else intended for temporary use and discard.
Use it for decoration of any kind. Use bunting of red, white and blue stripes instead.
Use it for advertising.

, Damaging or destroying the flag through intentional burning, ripping, trampling, staining, or mutilation is supremely disrespectful. Though amendments to the U.S. Constitution dealing with flag desecration have been proposed many times, none has ever passed both houses of Congress. This does not mean that it's OK to desecrate the flag. Don't defile the American flag as an act of protest or satire - you may find the actions and policies of the U.S. government to be immoral, but the flag itself, as a symbol of the values of liberty and justice upon which the nation was founded, is never deserving of disrespect, even if you think the nation hasn't lived up to these values.


Though an individual's right to free speech is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, flag desecration is widely (and deservedly) reviled in the U.S. and is usually subject to punishment by state governments.
The U.S. Flag Code does not advocate any sorts of penalties for flag-related misconduct. That decision is left to the States (and, in the case of the District of Columbia, to the Federal Government.) Almost every state has a law or ordinance that prohibits defacing the flag through burning, trampling, or mutilation. Usually, this crime is defined as a misdemeanor and is punished with a fine, short jail time, community service, etc.However, in Illinois and Kansas, flag desecration can be ruled as a felony. Other states like Vermont, Oklahoma, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Arkansas have especially harsh penalties (jail time of a year or more,) though the enforcement of these laws varies. In Montana, flag desecration is technically punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Finally, two states, Wyoming and Alaska, have effectively no laws against flag desecration. Wyoming does have a clause in its flag code discouraging desecration of the state and national flags, but no legal penalties exist."

Ask for help when you feel overwhelmed.,
Find a support group.,
Consider seeing a therapist.,
Take good care of yourself.",How to Cope As Caregiver to a Stroke Patient1," Being a caregiver is stressful, so it is important to keep your stress levels under control. Some signs that you may be overly stressed from your caregiving responsibilities include:Often feeling tired, fatigued, overwhelmed, worried, irritable, angry, or sad.
Not getting enough sleep.
Losing or gaining weight without trying.
Not feeling interested in doing things you used to enjoy.
Feeling achy or in pain much of the time.
Taking drugs (illegal or prescription) or drinking to feel better.;
, Reaching out for help when you have too much on your plate is an essential coping strategy for caregivers. If you feel overwhelmed, be sure to tell a friend or family member and ask for help.


Try saying something like, “I am having a hard time getting everything done today. Can you please some and help me for an hour or two?”
You might even consider making a list of your daily tasks so that you can easily delegate things to people who offer to help you.For example, you might include items on the list such as “make dinner,” “take out the trash,” “do the dishes,” “give Sue a bath,” and “tidy up the bathroom.” List as many of your daily or weekly to-do items as you can think of on the list so that people who want to help you can easily pick something to do to help you out.

, Talking to other people who understand what you are experiencing can help you to cope with your situation. Look for a stroke survivor caregiver group or a general caregiver group in your area. Connecting with other caregivers will give you a chance to share your experiences and hear about the experiences of other people.You may also learn about different coping techniques people have tried and gain insight for your own situation based on what has worked for other people.
Ask your doctor for information on caregiver support groups in your area.

Take six sheets of paper.,
Roll two sheets of paper into tubes.,
Tape the tubes together to make a long tube.,
Take the other four sheets of paper and make a rectangle.,
Tape the rectangle on to the long tube.,
Decorate your flag.",How to Make a Flag1," You can use plain white paper (or card if you prefer) which you can later decorate with your flag's colors using crayons, pencils, markers or paint. Alternatively, you can use paper that's the same color as the base color of your flag. For example, if you were making a British flag, you could use blue paper, or if you're making a Canadian flag, you could use red paper.;
, This will form the flagpole. Make sure to roll the sheets of paper tightly, using sticky tape to secure. If you don't want to use paper, you can use a thin wooden stick as your flagpole.








, Take the two rolled sheets of paper and slot the ends into each other to make one long tube. Secure with some sticky tape.








, Lay the four sheets of paper out flat on the table and align them so that they form a rectangle. Use paper masking tape (which you can later color over) to stick the four sheets of paper together. Tape on both sides of the paper for extra strength.

, Use regular sticky tape to attach the paper rectangle to the tube. Make sure that it's attached securely so it won't fall apart when you wave it.








, Now you can decorate your flag with the colors of whatever country or team colors you like. Use your favorite coloring materials or paints, add stickers or glitter, or write slogans on one or both sides of your flag. You can also cut shapes, such as stars or moons out from extra pieces of colored paper and glue these to your flag.

Recognize that your adoptive parent(s) do love you.,
Talk to someone about your feelings.,
Give yourself time.",How to Cope with Being Adopted1," They wouldn't have gone through the difficult adoption process if they didn't think you were worth it. Family is not defined by birth, but by love and shared experiences.;
, You may want to open up to your adoptive parent(s), a mentor (e.g. a beloved teacher, relative, or clergy member), or a friend. They can help you let it all out and process the shock.


Initially you may experience a number of intense or confusing feelings. This depends on the person. There is no right or wrong way to feel.

, It's normal to feel many different ways, whether you're grateful, confused, or angry. Negative feelings are natural, and they are not forever. Many adults who were adopted as children have made peace with it.

Remind yourself that behavioral changes are due to the stroke.,
Grieve the loss of the previous relationship you had with the patient.,
Communicate in an explicit way.,
Savor the positive moments.",How to Cope As Caregiver to a Stroke Patient2," People who have strokes often undergo significant personality changes as a result. Witnessing this behavior can be distressing, but it is important to keep in mind that this behavior is due to the stroke. It is not within the person’s control or within your control.For example, if your patient says or does something out of character for him or herself, then try telling yourself something like, “That is the stroke talking.”

, Part of the emotional weight that you bear as a caregiver is a longing for the relationship you once had with the person. Whether the person is your spouse, parent, sibling, or friend, it is important to grieve the loss of the relationship that you once had so that you can move forward with your life.Try writing a goodbye letter to the person to help you express your feelings about the loss. In the letter, you can talk about what you loved about the relationship and acknowledge that the relationship has changed as a result of the stroke.
Allow yourself to cry, get angry, and feel the pain of your loss as well. Fighting against your feelings will not make them go away. Write about your feelings or talk to someone about them.

, Communicating with your patient can sometimes be a challenge, especially if he or she has trouble remembering things or understanding concepts that were once familiar to him or her. To help reduce confusion for your patient and make communicating less frustrating for you, try to be as explicit as possible. This may take some practice, but you can do little things like:Using proper names for people, places, and things to prevent confusion. For example, instead of saying, “We’re going to see the doctor,” say, “We are going to see your neurologist, Dr. Jones, at 1pm today.”
Providing frequent reminders. For example, you can provide reminders every hour leading up to something and then provide reminders closer to the event as well. Try saying things like, “We will be leaving in one hour,” “Your sister Margaret is coming over in 30 minutes,” and “Tomorrow is your granddaughter Ashley’s birthday.”
Answering questions. Your patient may ask lots of questions out of confusion or frustration, so try to be patient and answer them as best you can to help your patient feel more at ease.

, When someone is suffering from the effects of a stroke, his or her health may deteriorate and this can cut down on the positive interactions that you have together. Therefore, make sure that you savor the moments when your patient is in good spirits or when he or she is having a good day.Use your patient’s good days as opportunities to talk with him or her, reflect on happy memories, and build your bond. For example, you might ask questions about your patient’s childhood, remind him or her of a happy day in your relationship, or even just let the patient guide the conversation and be willing to listen to him or her talk for a while.

Focus on providing basic care.,
Encourage healthy habits.,
Modify your patient’s environment for safety and convenience.,
Look into other resources that might make life easier.",How to Cope As Caregiver to a Stroke Patient3," It is common for caregivers to want to set goals for their patients, but setting unrealistic goals for your patient may lead to disappointment. Instead, try to set goals to meet your patient’s basic care needs, such as keeping your patient clean, comfortable, and well-fed.Avoid setting unrealistic goals for your patient. For example, you might want to work on language skills for two hours every day with your patient, but with all of your other responsibilities, this might not be realistic.

, Your patient may feel better and be in better spirits if you encourage him or her to practice more healthy habits. This can also reduce the chances of your patient having another stroke. Try to encourage healthy habits, such as:Eating healthy foods.

Not smoking.
Getting regular exercise.
Getting adequate rest.

, Making some modifications to the environment can also help to ease your workload. Any modifications that you can make to provide a safer environment for your patient can make your life easier.Look into things like putting a hand rail in next to the toilet, getting child locks for cupboards with dangerous chemicals inside of them, or getting a hospital bed with electronic controls for your patient to sleep in.

, Your patient may qualify for certain services or resources that can improve his or her life. Requesting these services can also ease your burden as well and make caring for the person a little easier. These may include:Visits from a home health aide or nurse to provide baths and other personal care.
Meal delivery services, such as Meals on Wheels.
Rides from a local transportation service to make getting to doctor’s appointments easier.

Anticipate abuse from your patient.,
Warn the patient that you will not put up with abuse.,
Talk to other family members.,
Discuss the patient’s behavior with his or her physician.",How to Cope As Caregiver to a Stroke Patient4," You may experience physical or emotional abuse in your time as a caregiver. This is because many people who experience a stroke have personality changes that can cause them to become abusive to those closest to them.Abuse may include physical actions such as hitting, biting, or scratching. It may also include emotional abuse, such as calling you names, yelling at you, or making unreasonable demands of you.
Remember that this behavior has nothing to do with you or anything you are doing. You cannot change it by changing your behavior. However, you can use some strategies to stop the abuse, get support, and get help for the patient.

, If you experience abuse from your patient warn him or her that you will not put up with it. For example, if your patient begins to yell at you for something trivial, then let him or her know that if the yelling does not stop that you will walk away.Try saying something like, “I don’t deserve to treated like this and if you do not stop then I will leave the room.” If the patient does not stop, then walk away. Go to another room or go outside for five minutes or more if necessary. Do not return until the patient has calmed down.
If the patient starts yelling again or abusing you in another way, walk away again. Keep doing this to show the patient that you are serious and that you refuse to put up with his or her abuse.

, If the abuse continues despite walking away when the patient is yelling at you, then talk to the patient’s other family members about it. Let them know what has been happening and what you have done to try to stop it. Request their help with the situation.Bringing in other family members may help because some stroke survivors will target their caregiver and be more reasonable around other people. Therefore, you might request that another family member helps you when you are providing care to the patient to serve as a buffer from the abuse.
Another family member might also be willing to provide care for the patient part of the time to take some of the pressure off of you and give you some relief from the abuse.

, If the abuse continues despite bringing in other family members, then enlist the help of your family physician. Tell him or her what has been happening and what you have done to try to stop the abuse. Your patient’s physician may recommend a psychiatric consultation for the patient to determine if he or she is suffering from a mental health condition as a result of the stroke.Your patient may need to undergo therapy sessions and/or take medication to help control a mental health condition, such as depression or bipolar disorder.

Get a piece of nylon or cotton fabric.,
Find other pieces of fabric in the colors you need for your flag.,
Choose a flag handle.,
Make a pocket for the flag handle.,
Decorate your flag.,
Secure the flag.",How to Make a Flag2," Choose a piece of fabric in the base color of the flag you wish to make. If you're making an American flag, for example, you can stick with plain white. To make a large flag, try to use a piece of fabric measuring 5 foot (1.5 m) by 3 foot (0.9 m). If you want a smaller flag, a smaller piece of fabric (or even a pillowcase) will do.

, It doesn't matter what type of fabric these pieces are, they can be nylon or cotton like the flag, or they can be felt, silk, polyester, velour - whatever you can find around the house! Pieces of old clothing, or old tablecloths are perfect for this.

, For a DIY flag, the flag handle can be made from whatever you choose - it could be a tree branch or an old broom pole - as long as it's strong enough and long enough to hold your flag.

, Before you can attach your flag to its handle, you will need to make a pocket for the handle to slip into. To do this, spread your flag out on the table and lay the handle along the shorter, vertical edge of the material, on the right hand side.









Fold the edge of the material loosely over the handle and pin the material in place.
Remove the handle, then you can use a sewing machine or some fabric glue to secure the material in place.
Sew or glue the top of the pocket together, so the handle cannot slip through. This will allow the flag to sit on top of the handle.

, Now comes the fun part! Use markers, rulers and stencils to draw patterns on the colored fabrics, which you can cut out with a sharp scissors. Once all the pieces are cut out, you can glue them into position on your flag, using fabric glue.









If you are making an American flag, for example, you would need to cut a small rectangle from a piece of blue fabric, seven long stripes of equal width from some red fabric, and a collection of five-pointed stars from a piece of white fabric.
If you want to spell something, such as ""Go Team!"", you can draw bubble letters and cut them from a piece of white, black or colored fabric.

, Once you have finished decorating, you can slip the flag handle into the pocket you created earlier. If it feels loose, you can secure it with a little glue or a couple of small stitches to hold the bottom of the flag in place. Now you can wave it to your heart's content!

Gather some patterned fabric or scrapbook paper.,
Cut out the flags.,
Attach the flags to the string.,
Hang the flag banner.",How to Make a Flag3," The beauty of this flag banner is that it's so easy to make, so you can use whatever material you like. Just try to choose a variety of pretty patterns and bright colors to really make your flag banner pop! Having around five different types of flag is a good base to work from.

, Before you start cutting, you will need to decide how big you want each triangular flag to be - remember that they should be isosceles triangles with two long sides and a shorter base.









Once you have decided on your measurements, cut out a template flag and use it to cut out the rest of the triangles - how many you need will depend on how long you want the banner to be.
If you want to add a little something extra to your flag banner, try cutting out the triangles with a pinking shears. This will give them a zig-zagged edge instead of a straight one!

, How you do this will depend on whether you used paper or fabric for your flags. If you used paper, you can punch 3 to 4 holes at the top of each flag and simply thread a piece of string, ribbon or twine through the holes to hang the flags. If you used fabric, you can either sew the top edge of each flag around a piece of twine or ribbon (which is time consuming) or you can use a bead of fabric glue to attach the string, for an easier option.








, Hang your flag banner by tying the ends of the string to nails in the wall, or use a thumbtack to secure. Flag banners look great draped in front of the fireplace, as a festive addition to an outdoor party or barbecue, or as a cute decoration for classrooms and children's bedrooms.

Don’t wait until a crisis.,
Approach the subject with care.,
State your concerns clearly and with love.,
Ask questions.,
Discuss the consequences of denial.",How to Convince a Reluctant Relative to Visit a Doctor1," The worst thing you can do is try to convince them to see a doctor when their health is in dire jeopardy. If you do this, the decision may be made hastily and may not include your relative’s best interests. Instead, start having the conversation early on.For example, a teenage relative becomes pregnant, but doesn’t trust that the doctor will respect her privacy. She may fear they will tell her partner or her parents about the pregnancy. You might want to start asking her about her prenatal care plan as soon as possible so that the baby can get proper care that the mother feels comfortable with.
Similarly, try to get your aging parents regular checkups before a problem arises. That way, you will understand their wishes and be able to follow appropriate measures in the event of a serious health scare.;
, Don’t back them into a corner. Cornering your loved one may make them even more resistant to help. Have an easy-going conversation with no pressure. Choose a time when you are both relaxed and able to talk without distractions. Bring the subject up casually.

For example, you might say, “Mom, when was the last time you saw a doctor?” or “Jody had to leave early to take his dad to the clinic. It made me remember that you haven’t gone in a while.”

, If your loved one isn’t open to a casual suggestion, you will need to approach the discussion head-on. Be clear and direct about your concerns, especially if their health is in a critical state.

You might say, “Mom, I can tell that your arthritis is getting worse. You didn’t even get out of bed yesterday. I love you and I am worried. I would feel so much better if you saw a doctor.”
Keep in mind that you may have to repeat this step several times before your loved one truly starts to consider your suggestions.

, If your loved one continues to show reluctance about seeing a doctor, you may want to probe them for more information. Figuring out where the root of their hesitation is can help you come up with a viable solution.

You might ask, “Do you not like your doctor?” or “Are you worried about something in particular?” You might also take a more straight-forward path by asking “Why don’t you want to see the doctor?”, In some cases, people may avoid seeing a doctor because they are not yet ready to accept the realities of a situation. Maybe a loved one in remission for cancer starts losing weight or re-experiencing symptoms. Perhaps an aging parent keeps forgetting things. These people may be reluctant to see the doctor because the outcome is more than they can face at the moment.In such situations, you must make your loved one consider the consequences if they don’t take actions. For instance, the cancer may return at full force if they don’t start treatment right away. Or, a parent with memory loss may carelessly hurt themselves or get lost.

Read about adoption.,
Recognize that your birth parent(s) probably did love you.,
Recognize that being adopted means you were very, very wanted: by your adoptive parent(s).,
Consider asking about your birth parent(s).,
Ask your adoptive parent(s) to tell you the story of your adoption.",How to Cope with Being Adopted2," Websites and books are available about the adoption process, and you can read the stories of people who were adopted.

, There was nothing deficient about you then, and there is nothing deficient about you now. Giving you up for adoption might have been the best thing they could have done for you.


Maybe your mother was a busy college student who didn't have time to give a baby the love and care you deserved without dropping out of school. So she gave you a better life with a different loving family.
Or your birth family was broken and dangerous for a child, so your parents decided you deserved a better chance at a safe family life.
Or you were left with a disabled father who didn't feel he could properly care for you, so he wanted you to be with a family that could.

, The adoption process is not fast or easy. You were so lovable and wanted that they felt it was worth it.

, Some people want to know, and others don't care much. If you want to know, explain how you feel. If you're worried about your adoptive parent(s)' feelings, reassure them that you still consider them your real parents.


Ask your adoptive parent(s) what they know. They may or may not have met your birth parent(s), or have records on file. At minimum, adoption agencies will have wanted your parents' medical history so that you would know if various illnesses run in your family.
Ask the adoption agency, but don't get your hopes up. Many agencies have privacy policies that will not give you information about your parent(s)' without their consent.

, You can hear for yourself the reasons why you were wanted, and everything they went through for the end goal of holding you in their arms.

Consider whether you want to tell people.,
Think about how much you love your adoptive family, and how much you are loved.,
Recognize the ways in which you take after your adoptive family.,
Look through scrapbooks of your family memories.",How to Cope with Being Adopted3," Adoption doesn't have to be a big deal, and you may or may not want to mention it to your friends.


If you want to tell a few close people, explain to them whether it's a big deal to you, and whether you want everyone to know or not.
If you want to tell someone but don't know how then try and tell them somewhere else or in a different way. Try and tell them through a letter, text message or an e-mail. If that doesn't work then you could try and ask them for a day out and tell them that you have a really big secret that is for their ears only and that they aren't to tell anyone.

, Your knowledge regarding them may have changed, but their love for you is still the same.

, Personality is part genetic and part environmental. Perhaps you learned your father's patience, or your mother's passion for science. Maybe your older sister's hard work in school inspired you in your devotion to the arts. They are still part of you.

, These are still part of you. Even if you aren't genetically related to your adoptive family, the love and memories are real.

Find an ally.,
Let them choose the doctor.,
Offer to get a checkup, too.,
Know your limits.",How to Convince a Reluctant Relative to Visit a Doctor2," Oftentimes, family members are more open to listening to outsiders than their own relatives. A respected family friend or community leader may be able to bring up the topic in a way that your relative is receptive to. Pinpoint who in your loved one’s life they hold in high esteem. Then, ask this person to assist in your cause., Gender differences, cultural barriers, and even educational gaps may affect a person’s decision not to see a doctor. If this is the case with your loved one, try to work with them in choosing a healthcare provider that aligns with their beliefs and makes them more comfortable.For example, your relative may prefer a practitioner of traditional medicine to a Western-style physician. If your loved one is a female, she may prefer to be seen by a female physician.
Work with them to conduct research and find a credentialed provider who can address your loved one’s needs while easing their distress, too.

, Your relative may feel less distress if you join them at the doctor’s visit as a patient, too. This may release them from the pressure that they alone have a problem. Make it causal and relaxed, like you both simply need to get a yearly examination. Your loved one may be more inclined to see the doctor with this approach.For example, you might say, “Dad, I was thinking we could schedule our checkups together this year. I know that going with you will make me far less nervous than going on my own. Does that sound okay to you?”
Making it like they are going to support you rather than the other way around may remove the pressure, also.

, Despite your best attempt, your loved one is ultimately the deciding factor in their medical treatment. Unless they are at risk of harming themselves or someone else, you can’t actually force the issue. Be honest with yourself in recognizing that there is only so much you can do.If your loved one refuses to see a doctor, you might try mailing their physician a letter stating your concerns and hope that they call your relative in for an appointment.
Or, you might mention a problem to a doctor that they are willing to go to, such as privately telling a cardiologist about any memory problems you've noticed with the hope that they'll pass the info along to the primary care physician.

Use positive language.,
Reinforce their strengths instead of focusing on shortcomings.,
Schedule it for a suitable time of day.,
Plan exciting activities afterwards.",How to Convince a Reluctant Relative to Visit a Doctor3," Sometimes, the way you describe doctor’s visits can make a world of difference in someone’s stress levels. Speaking in worried tones and using negative language can make your loved one stress out about the visit. Rather than conveying anxiety, try to send the message that seeing a doctor is an asset to their health., Going to the doctor is a drag when each time everyone is bringing up problems. Try to pose your explanations in a positive light by focusing on strengths rather than weaknesses.For example, don’t say, “Mom, you got lost the other day and I’m worried.” Say, “Mom, we want to talk to the doctor to find out how we can help you stay in good health so you can continue to care for yourself. He can offer us suggestions so maybe you can keep living on your own.”

, It may seem overly simple, but your loved one may have developed a negative perception of the doctor due to the window of time when they generally see one. Ask your family member when they would like to schedule their appointment and try your best to accommodate their request.For example, some older people function better early in the morning as opposed to late afternoons. They may feel more positive about the visit if it’s scheduled during this time., You can also shift the perception around a doctor visit by making the day more exciting. Going to the doctor may seem like a drag, but you can make it fun and more rewarding when you schedule pleasurable activities around it.For example, you might suggest that you join your relative at the doctor and follow up with a shopping trip and a nice lunch at their favorite café.

Question your reasons for making contact.,
Weigh possible negative consequences.,
Get the advice of your parents, if possible.",How to Contact Half Siblings Who Do Not Know About You1," Reuniting with long lost relatives can be an emotional experience—one in which you can’t predict the outcome. Before you make contact, it’s important to clarify your rationale for wanting to connect.Do you simply want them to know that you exist? Are you suffering from a terminal illness and seeking closure? Do you lack other family or a solid support system? Has a parent or grandparent recently passed away, prompting this sudden interest? Think long and hard about why you want to do this beforehand.
Always keep in the forefront of your mind that this has all been hidden for quite a while, and the door might not be open!;
, It’s also a good idea to anticipate how you expect them to react. Of course, you don’t know them, but perhaps recounting the details of why you were separated in the first place can help you determine how a possible reunion would play out.For example, if you were the secret love-child of married man, your introduction to half-siblings might lead to everyone finding out about an instance of infidelity.
If your half-siblings are from a wealthy background, they might distrust your motives, assuming you want something from them.
In addition, if your half-siblings are young and your biological parent is still married, it may be very upsetting for them to learn that their parent’s marriage consisted of this betrayal.

, If either of your parents is alive or in your life, talking to them may assist with your decision-making. They may not approve of your desire to connect with your half-siblings, or they may have some insights about your relatives that haven’t been previously shared.


Choose a time when everyone is feeling relaxed, present, and free of distractions and approach the subject. Bring up the topic by saying, “Mom/Dad, I have been thinking about my half-siblings a lot lately. As I grow older, I really have a desire to get to know them. What do you think about that?""Be prepared for the possibility that your own parent also might not want to open it up.

"
"
Ask your parents for assistance.,
Find a liaison.,
Message them on social media.,
Send an email.",How to Contact Half Siblings Who Do Not Know About You2," In addition to seeing what your parent's opinion might be about the contact, you might also request their help in making a connection. Talk to the parent with whom you and your half-siblings are both related. Ask your mom or dad if they are willing to assist you in reaching out to your siblings.


You might say, ""I'd really like to get to know my half-siblings. Will you help me find them and/or make contact?""

, If you live in the same town or region as your half-siblings or have mutual acquaintances, it might help to have an ally helping you make contact. Reach out to a relative or family friend to act as liaison.


This person can cushion the blow once your half-siblings receive news of a sibling they never knew about. What’s more, this person can also serve as a source of support for you if the response isn’t what you hoped.Ask this person to contact your half-siblings on your behalf. You might say, “Could you please reach out to Harry and Beth for me? If they are interested, I’d love to talk to them. Here’s my number…”

, Social media has made the world so much smaller. People who currently live across the globe from one another are accessible with the click of a cursor. If you are able to find your half-siblings on Facebook, you may be able to send a friend request, asking them to connect with you.Keep your initial contact brief. You might say, “Hi, I’m from the Bay area, too! I think we might know some of the same people.”

, If you can locate full names of your half-siblings, you might be able to find a personal or work email account listed for them. In some cases, people often have their email addresses connected to their social media profiles. You might find this information there.


An email is a more formal way to reach out to your half-siblings. Because you can type a longer message without seeming like a weirdo, you will have a greater opportunity to introduce yourself and explain the circumstances of your relationship with them.
In your note, be sensitive to their reaction since they do not know you exist. Keep your words positive and enthusiastic, but avoid assuming they will want to have a relationship with you.""I know this may come as a surprise to you, but we have the same father. I've known this for many years. However, I was recently diagnosed with cancer and it gave me the desire to know you."" Briefly explaining the connection and your reasons for reaching out may be a good start.

Decide if you should be persistent or give up.,
Feel your feelings, but don’t take rejection personally.,
Talk to a counselor.",How to Contact Half Siblings Who Do Not Know About You3," There’s a thin line between showing your interest and intruding. It’s important to navigate this process with tact to avoid causing any undue emotional stress to your half-siblings or yourself. If your initial contact is met with silence, should you keep trying or throw in the towel?


It may be smart to make several attempts just in case previous messages or emails were lost or went to a spam folder. However, if you don’t receive a reply after a few tries, this might be a sign that your half-siblings aren’t interested in meeting you.
Even if they do seem interested initially, there’s still a possibility that the connection could fall flat. Try not to read too much into their interest early on to prevent feeling overly disappointment when they suddenly stop returning messages or calls., You made a brave decision to reach out to your half-siblings who don’t know you. You had no idea how you would be received, but you still took the initiative. It’s perfectly acceptable to feel angry, hurt, or disappointed. However, don’t allow these feelings to make you think any less of yourself.Keep in mind that your half-siblings don’t actually know you. Therefore, their rejection is likely related to their own fear or surprise of your existence than any concerns about who you are as a person.
If you have loved ones that value your presence in their lives, cherish their relationships. And, tell yourself, “It’s their loss.”
Keep in mind that even if they are not ready for contact now, they might be ready for contact down the road. Make sure that they have your contact information and that they know the door is still open if they want to contact you later on.

, Despite understanding that the rejection wasn’t personal, you still might be deeply affected by it. Seeing a professional during this time can help you come to terms with this loss and move on with your life.


Perhaps you are an only child who just learned that you had siblings, and you’d hoped for a joyous first meeting that led to deep and lasting bonds. Or, perhaps you’ve just suffered the loss of a parent and needed someone to mourn with. Consult with a professional counselor who can help you sort through your feelings and cope with the rejection."

They can help set the table by placing the napkins at each setting or they can take items to the table like the bread/rolls. ketchup. salad dressing (plastic bottles). Have older children set the table or help with peeling vegetables, stirring or mixing or getting the beverages., This is a great time to ask how everyone's day was? Discuss world affairs or at least your local news. Never force anyone to participate in the conversation, when they see how everyone is sharing their day they will eventually join in.,

If you really want to push the envelope you can spring a little dessert on them. At the same table. You can even offer them a healthy dessert like a bowl of fresh berries and yogurt. Or after dinner you can suggest a movie and start popping the popcorn.

Start the conversation.,
Help them find out their interests.,
Make them realize you have grown up.,
Spend time with them doing things they like.,
Be consistently supportive.",How to Convince Parents to Find Time for Themselves," The very first and basic step is you need to initiate talking about the matter. Keep it light. You have to bring that comfort level so that they feel like they can open up to you. This comes through sharing and asking them about what is happening in their life. Slowly you need to encourage them to include some activity. By regularly asking them about how and what they're doing, you can encourage them to find activities that keep themselves busy, which will keep them active as well as mentally or physically fit and more over they’ll start enjoying their life and leisure time.;
, You might already have a head start here. Your mum might have told you how she likes to try new recipes or she wishes she knew how to take better photographs, or your dad may enjoy hanging out with his friends or playing chess. Help them find what they want to do. Ask them about where their interests lie and if necessary, make suggestions. Encourage your mom to join a book group or a cooking class. Ask if your dad wants to join a club or start writing articles or a novel. By encouraging them in whatever endeavors interest them, you can help release them from the idea that their whole life revolves around you.

, Parents are sometimes scared of finding time for themselves or doing anything for themselves because they think it might distract them from being parents. You need to assure them that now you are grown enough to look after yourself, it’s time for them to focus on themselves. You need to convince them that you are grown up! This won’t happen by simply saying to them, “Ma/Papa, I am grown up now. I can look after myself.” No! Truly convincing them requires you to handle your responsibilities and demonstrate your independence through your actions.


Not only can you show responsibility for yourself, but you can also show them that you're ready and eager to help them out, too. Taking your parents to their appointments, helping them around the house, or doing other favors and errands for them can help. Taking care of their needs and most importantly finding time for them is key, too; call them regularly to ask how their day was or what are they planning to do this weekend will make a big difference. Bottom line is you have to make them realize you can take care of yourself, so now they should spend their time on themselves.

, If they like doing something, get involved in it with them. If your dad likes playing pool, go and play with him. If your mum likes playing games on her phone, sit along with her and watch her play. If she likes cooking, ask her to teach you a new recipe, or suggest a new recipe to her. By showing your enthusiasm for what they're doing, you can subtly push them to stay engaged with those activities. And the fact that you are taking interest in what they are doing will keep them motivated; everyone likes to feel appreciated and supported for the things they want to do.

, No plan will succeed unless it’s been put to practice consistently. On a regular basis, talk about their interests and activities and motivate them to keep on finding time for themselves. Regularly suggest new ideas they can try if they lose interest in the hobbies they've been pursuing so far.

Let yourself grieve.,
Try not to take it personally.,
Practice acceptance.",How to Cope when a Long Lost Sibling Refuses to Meet You1," Being rejected by a sibling is a particularly painful experience. You likely envisioned that your long-lost sibling would be excited to meet you and that you would develop a loving relationship. Because of this, their refusal to meet with you hurts deeply. Along with disappointment, you will likely feel other emotions like sadness and anger. It is important that you allow yourself to express these emotions and take some time to grieve.For example, it is important that you take the time to cry and express your sorrow over your sibling's rejection. If you need to, take time off from work in order to express and process your emotions.
For some people, rejection might cause or exacerbate conditions such as depression or anxiety. Do not feel afraid to reach out to other loved ones, friends, or a mental health professional for help during this time.;
, The first assumption that many people make when facing rejection is that it is their fault. You will likely feel that your long-lost sibling’s refusal to meet with you is somehow your fault. However, it is important to remember that meeting a long-lost relative, particularly a sibling, will be emotionally difficult for everyone involved. Keep in mind that your sibling is not necessarily rejecting you. They are more likely having a difficult time with the idea that they have a long-lost sibling.Depending on the circumstances of your separation, there may be other factors that are preventing your long-lost sibling from connecting with you.

, Unlike other aspects of our lives, there is little that we as individuals can do to change the feelings and emotions of others. If your sibling does not want to meet with you, there is little that you can do about that. Therefore, it is important that you learn to accept and come to peace with your sibling’s decision.This is not something that you will come to overnight. It will take time and a lot of work before you are able to come to peace with your sibling’s refusal.

Release expectations prior to the conversation.,
Express love and concern.,
Avoid blame or guilt-tripping.,
State things in a calm and assertive fashion.,
Offer to help them get treatment.,
Seek help for your family member.,
Get law enforcement involved under certain circumstances.,
Cut ties from the family member if your health and well-being is threatened.,
Keep your medication in a safe space.,
Care for yourself.",How to Confront Family About Stealing Your Medication," Oftentimes, addiction is the culprit if someone is stealing your medication. Your family member may have an addiction to prescription pain medication. If this is the case, spend some time learning about addiction. This will help you foster empathy and best address the situation.Read about addiction online. There are many resources you can use, such as Narcotics Anonymous, that provide information about what addiction is. Try to remember addiction is a medical condition and your family member cannot help being drawn to the substance.
If you're currently seeing a therapist, you could try asking your therapist for more information about addiction and talk over confronting the family member with them.
Remember, while addiction is one possible reason your family member took your medication, it is not the only explanation. A family member may also be stealing to sell the drugs for money. If you find your family member does not display symptoms of addiction, look for another explanation.
You may even want to connect with a local rehabilitation center to talk with a drug counselor about your situation and get some advice about how best to proceed.;
, You do not need to write out what you're going to say word for word. However, it can be helpful to have a rough idea of what you want to express going into the conversation.Jot down your feelings for a few minutes. Pull out a few phrases that best convey your feelings and concerns. You can have these in the back of your mind going into the conversation.
You do not need to write down an entire script for yourself. In fact, doing so can make the conversation worse. You may sound disconnected when speaking to your family member, which is not something you want during a hard conversation.

, It's vital you talk to your family member at the right time. A poorly planned confrontation can give your family member a chance to evade or escape the conversation.As this is a sensitive subject, choose a place that's private. You can try confronting the family member when they're at your house, for example, or go to their place to talk.
Make sure there are no external constraints. You do not want to begin the conversation only to have your family member run to work. Choose a time when they're not distracted and will be more receptive to your words.

, You do not know how your family member will react. Trying to predict as much can affect how you approach the conversation. If you, for example, expect a bad reaction, you may come into the conversation angry or overly confrontational. Try to approach the conversation without any particular expectation about what will occur.Remember, no matter how well you know someone, you can never entirely predict their reactions. This is especially true with difficult issues.
There is no way to predict the future or someone's behavior. Therefore, go into the conversation reminding yourself you do not know what is going to occur.

, With addiction, you need to approach the topic from a place of love. You want your family member to feel supported, not alienated, by you. Ultimately, your goal should be to get them the help they need so they do not steal from you again.You are probably angry and hurt by your family member. It is okay to express this, as your family member needs to know their addiction hurts others. However, remember your family member likely feels guilt and shame on their own end. Come at it from a place of love.
For example, do not say, ""I'm furious that you took my medication."" Instead, say something like, ""I love and care about you. I'm angry you took my medication, but I'm also concerned by the behavior. I'm worried you have an addiction.""

, Blame-oriented language can make the person feel guilty. While your family member should take responsibility for treating their addiction, a physical addiction itself is largely beyond someone's control. You do not want to say things that sound like you're blaming the person. This will only increase negative feelings and make your loved one less likely to seek help.It can be helpful to use ""I""-statements here, as they are designed to reduce blame. They start with ""I feel..."", after which you immediately state your feelings. From there, you state the actions that led to those feelings, and explain why you feel the way you do.
For example, ""I feel hurt that you took my medication without asking because it's a huge betrayal of my trust.""

, Getting angry in these situations, no matter how emotionally taxing they are, will make things worse. Remember, you want to help your family member confront their addiction and get help. It's best to remain calm to achieve this.Addicts may try to confuse you or deflect blame. They may even deny wrongdoing at first. Be calm and continue to state your case.
For example, your family member says, ""Maybe you took more than you intended and didn't realize."" Respond with something like, ""Please do not lie to me. We need to talk this over.""

, You want to end the conversation on a note that allows you both to move forward. Talk to your family member about seeking treatment for addiction. This is vital if your family member has been stealing medication.End the conversation with something like, ""I think we should get you treatment so this does not happen again. I love and care about you and I just don't want you getting hurt.""
Remember to keep your expectations in check. Your loved one might not be willing to make a change right away. They might need some time to think and want to return to the conversation later.

, The first step to moving forward is making sure your family member gets the treatment they need to overcome their addiction. Explore your options here. It's probably a good idea to enlist the help of other family members.There are many different options regarding treatment. Some treatments have patients stay in a facility, while other treatments only have out patient care.
You can go to a local hospital or drug rehabilitation facility about possible treatment.
The treatment you choose depends on the severity of the addiction and what you and your family can afford.

, Unfortunately, a confrontation may not always work. The problem may continue, despite your efforts to help, and in these scenarios you may need the help of law enforcement.If your family member starts to commit bigger crimes, such as picking up prescriptions for you or using your credit card to buy drugs, you should report them to the authorities. You do not want your credit and identity damaged by someone else.
Also, if you feel like you, your loved one, or anyone else is in danger at any time, then do not hesitate to call emergency services or to call your local police.
While it is always painful to get law enforcement involved with a loved one, this may be the wake up call your family member needs.

, You need your medication for your physical health and well-being. If your family member is continuing to take your medication after the confrontation, your health and safety is at risk. You should cut ties with the family member at this point. This can be painful, but you need to prioritize your health., As you need your medication for health reasons, do your part to make sure it does not get stolen again. Find a safe and secure place to keep the medication away from the family member who stole it.


Keep your medication somewhere with a lock that's difficult to reach. You could, for example, keep your medication in a safe over a cabinet. Just make sure the medication is accessible to you at all times.When choosing a secure spot for your medication, read the instruction labels that come with it. Some medication cannot be stored at certain temperatures, for example, or needs to be out of direct sunlight.
You may also want to lock up any valuables that your loved one might try to sell for money to buy drugs.

, It's never easy to confront a family member about such a painful topic. In the aftermath of the confrontation, prioritize self-care.Do things to take your mind off the situation, like reading a book or watching a movie. Make time for any hobbies you enjoy.
Spend time with kind and supportive friends and family members.
Consider looking for a support group, like Al-Anon, to help you out.

However, the only healthy way to deal with your emotions is by addressing them.Exercise can significantly improve your mood and help you fight off depression., One of the first steps that you can take when dealing with negative emotions is to write them down.

Putting your feelings on paper can help you better process things.You might consider writing a letter to your long-lost sibling that expresses how you feel. However, if you feel like sending the letter, think about it for at least a week before mailing it.

, When dealing with your sibling’s rejection, turn to your friends and family for support. Talk with them about how you feel. A good friend will listen to you and help you better understand the situation.Talking with shared family members of the long-lost sibling may be more complicated, especially if they have a relationship with the sibling. Feel out these situations and determine who will be a good confidant.
When discussing your feelings with family or friends, avoid blaming yourself. Try not to dwell on negative thoughts about yourself or the sibling who rejected you. Use facts to understand the rejection. Allow time for positive talk during these sessions, as such positive interactions will give you natural emotional pain relief.

, Talking with other people who have experienced a similar type of rejection may help you make sense of your sibling’s rejection. Look for organizations and groups in your area that bring together people who have been shunned or rejected by their family members. You can also go online and join a chat group for people who are in situations similar to yours.Joining a support group will allow you to share your feelings with people who can relate to your situation and help you feel less alone. Expressing your feelings to both yourself and others can help clarify the event. It may help give you a deeper understanding of why your sibling did not want to meet.

, If you are struggling with the rejection, a counselor or therapist may be able to help you process your emotions. They will talk with you about the rejection and any associated feelings.

Talk to your long-lost sibling.,
Give the sibling space.,
Offer your support.,
Know when to quit.",How to Cope when a Long Lost Sibling Refuses to Meet You3," If you are still in communication with the long-lost sibling, you should ask them about why they refused to meet with you. Getting a full picture of why they refused to meet with you will help you emotionally process things and decide what to do next. It is important that you address any extenuating circumstances that might prevent them from wanting to meet with you.


Although a phone call would be ideal for this conversation, you should utilize whatever mode of communication feels the most comfortable.
You might ask them things like “Why won’t you meet with me?” or “What is getting in the way of us meeting in person?”

, It is important that you give the sibling the distance that they ask for. Continuing to contact your long-lost sibling after they have refused to meet you will likely only strengthen their desire to avoid you. If your sibling asks you to back off, you should honor their request and give them some space., If you are interested in leaving open the option of reconnecting in the future, you might offer your sibling your continued emotional support. Although your sibling has expressed their desire not to meet with you, let them know that you are still there for them. Express to them that, if they need anything or want to reconnect in the future, that you would be available.You might say something like “I love you and I’ll be here if you need me” or “If you ever want to talk, you can call me.”
However, try to set healthy boundaries. For example, avoid financially supporting a long-lost sibling who refuses to meet with you in person. You do not want to enter into a situation where someone is exploiting you for your resources.

, If your long-lost sibling shows no indication of wanting you in their life, you should know when to walk away. It can be extremely difficult to end a relationship, particularly with a family member. However, distancing yourself from a painful relationship, in the end, may help you feel better. If your long-lost sibling absolutely refuses to have a relationship with you, it is important that you know when to step back.You might say something like “I can’t handle your rejection anymore” or “It hurts me too much to not be close to you.”

, You will not be an effective arguer if you don't understand how the change with effect your life. Having someone move in to your home is a big transition that could drastically change the way you live. Consider the following:


If you need your parent to move due to their health, it will be you (and more importantly, your spouse) that have to take care of Mom or Dad. This may be a change your spouse is unwilling to deal with.
Your spouse may feel that your parent will try to dominate your relationship or take over your home.
Your spouse may be resentful at the loss of privacy and freedom that may come with a parent moving in.

, Don't go into this discussion without any forethought. Make sure you absolutely need your parents to move in. Write down your main arguments and think about what your partner might say in response to that. To help you out, here are some reasons you may want your parent to move in:


You need to take care of Mom or Dad because of their health.
They lost their home or job, and need support.
They are becoming old enough to be unable to take care of themselves.
They are in an area where they don't have any friends or family, and need to be close to familiar people.

, Before you even begin the discussion, is it actually possible for Mom or Dad to move in? Sit down and do some serious planning, including travel (if they are currently far away), move-in costs, monthly costs, lifestyle changes, sleeping and living arrangements, and the effect it can have on your professional and home life. If you cannot comfortably fit your parent into your life, you will have trouble convincing your spouse they should come to stay. Also consider whether the stay will be long or short term; if it is short term, work out a plan to get your parent back on his or her feet.

, Speak to your partner plainly about what you want to do. Tell them your reasons for having your parent move in. Don't rely on purely emotional arguments; have facts to back you up. Also don't expect the issue to be settled with one talk. The process may take days, weeks, or months.

, If you were adopted, research the relevant laws governing your adoption records. You might be able to access an original birth certificate, for example, in order to obtain your father’s name., These registries allow parents and adopted children interested in making a connection to post their information. The registries can then facilitate making contact.Be cautious, however, about expanding your search to social media in general.Make sure to maintain privacy settings on your accounts so that you can pace the amount of information you disclose if you find your father., Finding out where he worked or the names and addresses of his parents, for example, might be the first steps in finding current information about your father.

, If you choose to hire a professional, make sure that they are properly certified by a relevant oversight body.Volunteer searchers offer a more limited range of services, but may be able to help you collect valuable information., The decision to seek contact can be motivated by many things, from wanting to learn family medical history to desiring a relationship.If your father is the one initiating contact, remember that the decision rests with you, not with him or with your other relatives or friends. You may choose to hold on to his contact information for as long as you want in order to be ready for the encounter.

, You may want to read accounts written by other people who have reunited with an absent or unknown birth father. Support groups for adopted people may be helpful. You can also talk to your friends and relatives about your decision, though you should recognize that they may have their own feelings about the process as well.Recognize that your father might not want to meet you, at least right away. Before you initiate contact, think about what it will be like if he refuses contact. Make a plan to reach out to specific people, such as supportive friends or a social worker, if this happens.
Your father might react with surprise, fear, joy, or, most likely, a combination of emotions. Parents often carry significant guilt or even trauma related to children they’ve never met.Recognize that your father’s reactions are likely to evolve. Make sure that you can talk about your own feelings about his reactions with someone you trust.

, What do you expect your father to be like, and how will you handle it if he is very different?


It’s more healthy to focus on getting answers to basic questions or filling in gaps in your knowledge about yourself than to dream about finding a perfect father., In your early communication, you might choose not to share your full name, for example, or details about where you live and work. Although he’s your father, he’s also a stranger. He may also be reticent about sharing personal details right away.Try not to start an intense emotional relationship right away. A slow start has been shown to lead to better, more stable long-term outcomes.You might choose to start by exchanging e-mails, messages, or letters before you meet. This can provide a slower, more measured method of beginning to get to know your father.

, Two hours is a good length for an initial meeting.Choose a neutral, relatively quiet location, such as a park bench or a calm café during daylight hours, where the two of you can speak to one another easily and express emotion.It’s up to you whether to meet with your father alone or ask someone else to come along. Some state and national governments offer an intermediary service, so that you have have a social worker present to mediate your first meeting., This meeting is a chance for you to get answers to questions about your own identity. You might want to plan to ask some questions about your father’s life or about your paternal family.


For example, you might say: “I seem be the only one in my family who loves math. Do you like math, too? Did I get that from your side of the family?”
Make sure to ask any health-related questions that are important for you. This is a good opportunity to find out about any genetic risks you may carry for things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.
Notice what you share. It’s normal to spend time at this first meeting noticing physical similarities between you and your father., An initial meeting is likely to be very emotional. You may be surprised by what you feel, and so may he. You both need time to reflect on the meeting and think over what you would like to do next.


If your father wants to think about the future, you might suggest something small but concrete. For example, you could set up a time to get a cup of coffee and talk again in a few weeks.

, Make sure that the people who love you know about your meeting with your father. Plan what you will do immediately after the meeting and for the rest of the day. For example, you might plan to call one friend and have dinner with another. Don’t plan to return immediately to work or school.If you are seeing a therapist or counselor, or working with a social worker, schedule a meeting or telephone call to debrief.

, If your first meeting was disappointing, it can still be worthwhile to maintain contact. Keep trying to get to know one another. There is no set script for reunions, and it can be a very challenging experience for both fathers and children.

, A good first meeting can lead to euphoria and a sense of immediate, intense connection. This sense of connection will not last, at least at this level of intensity. You or your father may need to pull back and reassess as the reality of who you are sinks in.Be ready to take a “time out” to sort through conflicting, confusing feelings and adjust the relationship. This is a normal part of the reunion process.

, You may need to take the lead in establishing those limits, because parents often bring greater expectations to reunions than children do.For example, if you have children of your own, you might wait until you have gotten to know your father better before you introduce them to him.
Be clear about what kinds of contact are welcome, and what kinds aren’t. Perhaps you would like him to call before stopping by, even if you happen to live close by to each other. Or perhaps you would rather have a scheduled telephone call instead of a more casual relationship in which it’s ok to call or text anytime.

, Any relationship needs time and space to evolve and deepen.If you and your father are both interested in staying connected, look for ways to spend low-key time together. You could schedule a monthly lunch or telephone call, for example, or attend sports or music events occasionally together.

, Perhaps your values or lifestyles are too different, or perhaps he is not capable of maintaining a healthy relationship with you.

, Continue to maintain the good family relationships that you already have. The people who raised you might appreciate reassurance that, although you are meeting your father, you still value their unique place in your life.

Consider the child’s age.,
Look at the language used by the toy.,
Determine what activity you want your child to do.,
Consider your child's interests.,
Consult product reviews.,
Ask for advice from others.,
Look into product warranties.,
Decide if you want a toy connected to your smartphone.",How to Choose Educational Tech Toys for Your Kids1," Not all educational tech toys are appropriate for all ages. This means you should think about the child’s age as you choose one. Most toys have suggested ages on the package, which can help you choose the right product for the right age.


Though the child may be able to use a toy designed for an older kid, think about the toy parts. Many toys aimed at older ages come with small parts that pose a choking risk for younger children.
For example, some electronic devices have pointers attached to them to use on the screen. These may not be appropriate for smaller children since they may cause injury.;
, Small parts are not the only consideration when looking at the age range for a toy. Also consider the kinds of language used in the toy. Toys made for younger children will use easier vocabulary and have simpler concepts than those made for older children.


This will keep your child from getting frustrated when dealing with the toys as well as prevent the educational content from going over the child's head.

, The educational toys available for children are diverse. You just have to decide what you want your child to learn. Skills learned from toys range from learning basic math and spelling skills to foreign languages to even computer programming.You can try multiple kinds of toys that focus on different things so your child has the ability to learn different skills.

, Take your child's interests into account when picking out a toy for them. Choose a specific toy that correspond to activities or subjects that your child likes that will also help them learn a skill you want them to learn. This will help keep them interested in learning and even help them retain more information.


For example, if you child likes music, buy them a foreign language toy that incorporates music or songs into it to keep them interested. This may be a video playing toy with music videos or a book that teaches the languages through digital content or accompanying music discs.

, A good way to decide the best toy for your child is to look at product reviews. These can be found in parenting or tech magazines, on online parenting or educational blogs, from online distributor websites, or from other supplier websites. These can help you decide between similar toys or if a toy is right for your child's specific needs.


For example, you may have two robot toys that you can't decide between. Online reviews can tell how the robots are in practice with children, what features are best on each toy, and how well the robots teach the advertised information.

, Another way to find the best educational tech toy is to ask others in you or your child's life. If your child is learning specific things in school, ask your child's teacher for some guidance on which toys to buy or what subjects you may want help your child learn. You can also ask your friends and relatives which educational toys have worked well for their children or that they think might be good for your child.


This will help you identify better options by pinpointing areas where your child can use extra help.
The opinion on toys from your friends and family are more personalized and relevant to your child than generic product reviews from outside sources.

, Educational tech toys are built with a child in mind, but even the sturdiest toy can break. Many of these toys are not expensive, either. However, many more expensive tech toys come with warranties to protect the product in case of an accident.For example, some kid’s tech toys come with one to two year warranties where they will replace the item with no questions asked. This means that if your child throws the device across the room, you may be able to get it replaced.
Check the box or research the product online before purchasing if a warranty is something you think you will need.

, Many educational toys connect to smartphones to operate or for additional activities. There are even educational games and apps you can add to your smartphone to make it an educational toy. When you choose a toy, decide if smartphone capabilities is something that you want.For example, you can get robots that can be controlled by smartphones or music-making toys that can be hooked to the phone. Many other educational toys have features where you can get additional games, activities, or apps on your phone to enhance the experience of the smartphone.

Give Up Perfectionism.,
Break the ""Don't Feel"" Rule.,
Give up Blame.,
Commit to your self improvement.",How to Break the Top 3 Rules of Family Shame," Whether it was your father pushing you to score every touchdown or a smothering mother pushing you to get straight A's in everything so you could become a doctor, you had be the ""perfect"" child. No room for error. Having these kinds of unrealistic expectations placed upon you damaged your sense of self-worth and gave you a sense of worthlessness. Breaking this rule will actually be fun. All you have to do is screw up and learn to feel OK about it. Don't comb every hair perfectly in place. Flub something every once in a while (ideally, something that won't endanger anyone else). Leave a few ""I's"" undotted and a few ""T's"" uncrossed. The world won't end because you let your hair down, and you'll feel better for it.;
, Your family may have operated as if only certain feelings were ok. For instance, it was never okay to feel depressed or angry. Boys weren't allowed to cry and girls had to smile all the time. If you're going to live a happy and healthy life, you have to feel all your emotions. The way to break this rule is to give yourself permission to feel pain and loss. Don't cover up your pain with a smile. Cry. Scream. Let it out. That's how you find healing.

, Did you ever feel like you were walking on eggshells in your family? No matter how good you tried to be, something was always your fault. Whether it was the fact your dad left the family or your mom didn't have enough money to make ends meet, it was always your fault somehow. Do you find yourself blaming yourself or others? Do you still let your family blame you? If so, now is a good time to stop the blame game. Stop blaming yourself for things you have no control over. Stop blaming others for things they had no control over. If you find yourself judging yourself harshly for something you did, yell ""STOP"" in your mind. It's a good way to interrupt the flow of your thoughts. Focus on the good you did or something positive that can come out of the situation.

, Commit to your own self improvement. Stay focused on your healing. Your goal is to find happiness and breaking the rules of family shame is the way to begin. You'll be glad you did.

Don't criticize their body or lifestyle.,
Avoid the assumption that ""fat"" and ""unhealthy"" are synonymous.,
Find fun ways to get activity together.,
Buy healthy foods that everyone likes.,
Be fair.,
Encourage their self esteem.,
Doll up a female relative a little.,
Show them that you love them.",How to Care for an Obese Relative," Shame is harmful to mental health, and may make them afraid of being judged. It will also harm your relationship and make them distrust you.;
, This attitude is hurtful to heavy people who work very hard on maintaining good health, ignores the existence of unhealthy thin people, and can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy for obese people who are self-conscious. It may be best not to mention weight at all.

, Some obese people are afraid of exercise, because they might be mocked or pushed too hard. Get outdoors together, let them set the pace, and make exercise a social activity rather than a self-loathing workout.


Go for walks together
Play backyard sports (football, volleyball, soccer, etc.)
Visit nature trails and hike
Play in a pool or lake

, Go to the grocery store with your obese loved one and ask them to pick out their favorite fruits and veggies. Talk to them about what they like to eat, and what their favorite health foods are. Mention what health foods you like, and what other family members like too.


Integrate health food into desserts: strawberries with whipped cream and chocolate syrup, raspberries and vanilla ice cream, bananas with nutella, etc.

, Your relative will notice if you always give them a tiny dish of nonfat ice cream while you let their thinner loved ones eat whatever they please. Make any health projects a family initiative, so that no one feels singled out.

, Many obese people struggle with body image issues and poor self confidence. Compliment their resilience, their compassion, or their skill at the piano. Encourage them to see themselves as talented, worthwhile individuals.

, Society places an enormous value upon how beautiful a woman is, so if she is obese, she may feel ugly and unwanted. You can help her by pointing out cute clothes in her size, playing with her hair (if she's okay with it), and telling her she looks gorgeous.


Avoid the term ""slimming"" when giving fashion advice. Tell yourself that the goal isn't to make her look skinny, which is impossible, but to make her look fabulous, which is definitely possible.

, You are their family, not their personal trainer. Your caring and affection is what they need most.

Look for any behavioral changes.,
Ask questions about any behavior you observe.,
Talk with friends and other family members.,
Speak with a professional.",How to Care for an Aging Loved One1," As your loved one ages, you may notice some normal changes such as taking longer to complete some tasks or being forgetful. However, some changes may be harmful to your relative's safety. Your loved one may need help if you notice any of the following problems as they may be signs of dementia, depression, or other medical problems:Unopened or unpaid mail and bills
Poor personal hygiene
Odors (e.g. spoiled food, dirty home, piled up trash, etc.) in their home
Signs of safety risks (e.g. burned pots, smoke stains)
Signs that medications are not being taken or not taken properly
Missed appointments
Getting lost in places they know well
Noticeable change in weight (gain or loss)
Difficulty walking, standing up, or sitting down
Extreme thirst
Excessive tiredness
Isolation and spending more time alone
Burns or injury marks
Any uncharacteristic behavior;
, Your loved one may express concerns or problems to you. If the problems are not brought to you, you can start the conversation by asking some questions. When you ask the question, listen to your loved one's response. Ask your loved one for a proposed solution to the problem. By including your loved one in the decision making, you will not be threatening their independence.If you notice that the laundry basket is overflowing, you may say, ""It looks like you are a little backed up on your laundry? Do you need any help?""
Ask questions to get to the root of the problem. Do not assume that you know the reason for the behavior.
Unless the problem is an immediate threat to your loved one's safety, do not immediately try to jump in and fix it. Try to have a few conversations first.

, If you are noticing some changes, other family members are probably noticing them as well. Talking to other people can also provide multiple perspectives and solutions.This is especially important if you do not see your loved one regularly or you live in a different city.
It is helpful to talk to people who know your family member and people who do not. An outside person can offer an objective opinion because they do not have any emotional ties to your loved one.

, After speaking with your loved one, family, and friends, you still may need help making some decisions. Speak with a primary care physician, gerontologist, or a senior care specialist. They can offer professional insight and help you come up with solutions. Remember that you do not have to make these decisions alone.Be prepared to answer questions about your loved one's cognitive functioning (e.g. memory and decision making skills) and Activities of Daily Living/ADLs (e.g. eating, using the bathroom, getting dressed, bathing, etc.)
Remember that you do not have to make these decisions alone. Get support and input from multiple sources before you take action.

Identify the areas that need support.,
Determine who can provide support in each area.,
Organize important documents.,
Adjust the plan as needed.",How to Care for an Aging Loved One2," Your loved one may be fine in one area, but have difficulty in another area. Make a list of the specific areas that need attention. Most of the needs will fall into 5 major categories.Housekeeping- laundry, shopping (e.g. groceries, toiletries, household items), yard work and cleaning
Meal preparation
Healthcare
Activities of Daily Living
Social needs - transportation and interaction with other people

, Once you have made a list of the areas that need attention, write down who will be responsible for each area. Will it be you, a friend, family member, home health professional, or a community organization? If you are relying on a friend or family member, make sure you get a specific commitment from the person and the services they have agreed to help with.


Support will likely come from multiple sources. For example, you may come clean the house once a week, and another relative may grocery shop and prepare some quick meals.
To find local community resources in your area, call 411 and say the specified business you're looking for.You can also ask their primary care physician for referrals to services in your area.
Depending on the situation, the elderly can sometimes qualify for home services such as physical therapy or nursing visits.

, Ask your loved one if they have organized their important documents and medical information. If they have not, encourage them to do so and offer your help. If they have already organized their documents, take a look to see if everything is complete. Important documents include:Health insurance and/or Medicare card
Social Security card
Birth certificate
List of health conditions, medications, and allergies
End-of-life care, will, living will, and power of attorney
Insurance policies (e.g. life insurance, long-term care insurance, etc.)
Financial information (tax documents, financial advisor, accountant, bank information, etc.)
Name and contact information for physicians and pharmacies

, Your loved one's needs will change over time due to many different factors. Your loved one may have a health crisis that requires acute care. There may be changes in you or your loved one's financial status. You may experience changes that affect your availability as well.You may want to evaluate your plan at regular intervals (e.g. 3 months, 6 months, etc.). See what is working and what is not working.
Do not forget to include your family members, care givers, and loved one in these evaluations.
Make planned and unplanned visits to your loved one's residence to get a picture of how everything is going.

"
"
Help your loved one stay in their home.,
Look into retirement communities.,
Think about a nursing home.,
Move your loved one into your home.",How to Care for an Aging Loved One3," Your loved one most likely wants to stay in their home if possible. Staying in their home maintains their independence and gives them a sense of familiarity. It will also make aging more comfortable. Options that can help your loved one stay at home include home care services, meal and transportation services, respite care, and adult day cares.Adult day care centers function the same way as child day care centers. Your loved one would go to the center a few times a week and have access to variety of planned activities. This is also a good way for your loved one to make friends and have an active social life.
Respite care is temporary relief for a full-time caregiver. A worker comes to give the caregiver a break. Respite care can last for a few hours or even a few weeks., Retirement community options include assisted living communities, adult congregate communities, rental retirement communities, subsidized housing, and continuing care communities. Communities can accommodate independent seniors and those that need some assistance. The type of community you choose will depend on your loved one's needs and your financial situation.Adult congregate and assisted living faculties are for more independent seniors.
When researching a community be sure to understand the cost, the services offered, and the requirements for residents.

, A nursing home is best if your loved one is unable to live on their own and no family member is able to care for them. Nursing homes can be either skilled nursing facilities or intermediate care facilities. A skilled nursing facility offers 24 hour care while intermediate facilities offer similar services but not 24 hours a day.


Most nursing homes will offer both levels of care.
Medicare does not pay for nursing home care, but Medicaid may be an option if your loved one meets the requirements. Long-term care insurance must be purchased privately to cover costs.

, If you have the time and resources, you may want to move your loved one into your home. Becoming a caregiver will affect everyone that lives in your home so be sure to discuss this with them. Will you continue to work or will you quit your job to care full-time?


Being a caregiver is extremely stressful and difficult. Do not neglect yourself if you assume this role. It is important for you to eat well, get rest, and take breaks from your duties.Consider using other resources to help lighten your load. You may take your loved one to adult day care a few times a week or use respite care when you need a break.

"
"
Express your feelings.,
Respect your loved one's wishes.,
Use positive language to describe care.,
Be straightforward.",How to Care for an Aging Loved One4," It can be difficult to discuss these type of issues. It is important that you speak honestly about your feelings. Let your loved one know that you want to support them and help them with any problems they are having.Be realistic about how much time and energy you can commit and the other responsibilities you have.
If you are overwhelmed or are having difficulty speaking to your loved one, consider speaking with a a counselor to help you work through your feelings.

, Your loved one has likely been living independently and wants to maintain control. It is important that you honor your loved one's wishes even if you do not agree with them.

Be patient with your loved one and think about how you would want to be treated if you were in their position.

Suggest small changes so that it is easier for your loved one to adjust.
Try to focus on the big, important issues and do not get caught up in the little details.If your loved one's desires are not realistic or feasible, you may need to make some decisions without them. For example, if your loved one insists on driving but has been in multiple car accidents, you may need to take their keys away until you make other transportation arrangements.

, If you are care plan includes community resources and home health care providers, frame these resources in a positive light so your loved one is more receptive. Call a home health care provider a ""friend."" If you are sending your loved one to an adult day care center, tell your loved one that they are going to volunteer or help at the center. You could also refer to the center as a club or social organization.Remind your loved on that accepting help now will help them remain independent for as long as possible.

, While it is important to be considerate of your loved one's feelings, avoid sugar coating the situation. Be honest and present the negative information as well. If it will be difficult for your loved one to stay in their house or perform daily activities without help, let them know.

Remind your loved one know that they are not going through these changes alone and that you are speaking from a place of genuine care and concern.

"
Practice what you preach.,
Emphasize health and wellness.,
Nurture their self-esteem.,
Help them cultivate their interests.",How to Build a Positive Home for Your Kids1," Children take on a great deal of the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors demonstrated by their parents. Therefore, it’s incredibly essential that your presence in their lives reflects that of a positive role model. The popular saying “Do as I say not as I do” simply won’t cut it here. If you smoke, drink, use swear words, or demonstrate prejudiced viewpoints, there’s a good chance your children will, too. Instead of telling them what to do, try showing them with your own behavior.


Be mindful of your behavior around your children. If you tell them not to lie, then you should also be honest in your words. If you want them to minimize time on technology, then you should also limit your usage. Eliminate the potential for back-talk like “But, you do it!” and try your best to practice what you preach.;
, In a similar vein, be sure to encourage good nutrition and health practices for your whole family. As much as your budget allows, select fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, lean sources of protein, whole grains, and low-fats. Make sure your children get adequate exercise by going on walks around the neighborhood or playing sports in the park.

Get them to bed at a decent hour so that they can get at least 9 hours of sleep each night.

Be sure that you are taking strides to support your own health and wellness, too. Avoid drugs and alcohol or other forms of unhealthy coping. Manage your own stress by practicing regular self-care.

, Another way you can use your home environment to build good character and well-being in your children is by supporting their confidence and self-esteem. Children with positive self-esteem have more resilience, feel accepted, and have positive views about themselves.


Build an “I can” attitude in your children by giving them opportunities to develop new skills like dressing themselves or riding a bike. Show them how to do it and then give them the chance to try on their own. Then, offer genuine praise for their effort.Promote their self-esteem also by encouraging a healthy body image. Voice a zero-tolerance for teasing about weight or food in your household. Change your own language if you often make self-deprecating comments about your body. And, remove negative media sources that reinforce unrealistic body sizes and shapes., When children feel supported by their parents to build competencies, the sky is the limit. Notice what your child is passionate about and find ways to help them develop those passions.Your child’s interests may run the gamut of academics, music, sports, or collections. Get them involved in extra-curricular activities that allow them to grow their skills and meet other children who share the same interests.
Take it even further by making sure that you show involvement and interest in their passions. For example, if you have a child that is on the debate team, you might help them practice at home as a family. Then, the family might all attend events together to show support.

"
"
Stress the importance of family bonding.,
Schedule some one-on-one time.,
Encourage your children to express themselves.,
Practice active listening.",How to Build a Positive Home for Your Kids2," One of the most important investments you can offer your children is quality time together as a family. Family time presents an opportunity to monitor your children’s interests and strengths in a relaxed environment. It also gives you an opportunity to enhance your connection with one another and enforce family values.There are a multitude of ways for you to get the family together. Share mealtimes several mornings or nights each week. Create a family hobby such as playing basketball or going for bike rides. Attend church or other community events. Go shopping. Make sure everyone attends important events for the children like sports games, recitals, and spelling bees.

, Although time together is beneficial, so is time spent with your children separately. It can be challenging to dedicate attention to each individual child when you’re all together. So, allotting a bit of time each week to each of your children is yet another beneficial strategy for building a positive home.


When you spend one-on-one time with your children you can find out what’s happening in their lives, what their unique abilities and interests are, and offer them affection and encouragement in a way that best suits their personality.How you spend quality time will depend on each child. For example, a shy child might simply enjoy watching a movie with you while sitting side-by-side. Meanwhile, a more gregarious child might want to go on a shopping trip and tell you all about their latest adventures with friends. Select appropriate activities that work for you and your child.

, Family time spent together or individually is also an ideal time to talk with your children. Make an effort to reach out and ask about their experiences at school, with friends, and in other environments.


It can be hard to know how to talk to your children as an adult.Let them lead you. Pay attention to what each of your children are interested in or receptive to and use those topics as openings. For example, if you have a daughter who is on the swim team, you might go swimming with her and ask her to give you some pointers. Then, you might ask, “What do you enjoy most about swimming, and why?
Another way to encourage open discussion between you and your children is to have regular family meetings. Set a time each week or every other week where everyone comes together and shares some details about what’s new with them or any challenges their facing. Then, discuss any problems proactively as a family. This helps your children feel comfortable bringing problems—big or little—to you when they encounter them.

, No matter how busy you are, when your kids are talking, don’t tune out. This sends the message that what they’re saying doesn’t matter. Listening requires being active in not just hearing the words, but also understanding the thoughts and feelings behind the message.Use active listening principles when your children are talking, such as making occasional eye contact, demonstrating open body language (e.g. uncrossed arms and legs), and nodding or making appropriate facial expressions.
When they are done, ask appropriate questions like “How did that make you feel?” or “Are you worried about that?” to further the conversation and show you were listening.

"Set up your home web server on a port other than port 80.,
In your router's configuration, forward the port your server is running on to the IP of the machine it is running on.,

Stick to a relatively predictable routine.,
Set clear household rules.,
Be consistent with discipline.,
Assign age-appropriate chores.",How to Build a Positive Home for Your Kids3," Building a positive home for your child depends on consistency and predictability. Children require set times to wake, sleep, eat, and do other activities to feel safe and secure. Having erratic schedules can lead to cranky, confused children that act out. Research shows that even though kids may hate bedtime, it’s good for helping them regulate emotion, fight impulses, and manage time.Help your child learn self-discipline by creating a predictable schedule for activities like waking up, eating breakfast, eating snack after school, attending extracurricular practice, doing homework, completing chores, and preparing for bed.

, Limit-setting is another necessary aspect of establishing structure in your home environment. Creating a set of rules to follow in your household lets your children understand the parameters of behavior—what’s off-limits and what’s acceptable.This builds a foundation for other environments your child may enter, such as daycare, relative’s homes, or school.


Sit down with your partner, if you have one, and devise a set of rules that are clear and easy to understand. Post the rules somewhere they can be seen regularly like on a memo board or clipped to a magnet on the fridge.
Your rules might include, for instance, ""No running through the house,"" ""No jumping on furniture,"" ""No telling lies,"" and ""No hitting or teasing your siblings.""

, Once you have established ground rules and shared them with your children, be sure to follow through with any consequences for rule-breaking. Consequences should also be clear to your children on the outset.For example, if you have a rule that everyone needs to remove all their belongings from the living room by bedtime, a consequence may be to take anything that’s left behind for a period of time or require that they complete a chore in order to retrieve the items.
Make sure you follow through on consequences every time as failing to do so presents an opportunity for a power struggle between you and your child., It’s beneficial that children are allowed to contribute to the household in whatever way they can. This helps them develop a strong work ethic, recognize how they can positively contribute to their environment, and appreciate cleanliness and organization. It can be helpful to create a chore chart to place in your kitchen or other common area that clearly states each child’s responsibilities."

Knowing their interests will help you choose toys they’ll enjoy playing with. If you’re not sure, bring them along to the store with you or ask them what they like.;
, Preschoolers are growing individuals and they’re starting to learn how to be creative. Choose toys that will give them an outlet for their newfound creativity.There are a variety of toys out there that can help with this stage of development:


Crayons and markers.
Play dough.
Construction paper.
Child-safe scissors.
Finger paints.
Books.

, Preschoolers love to make-believe, and it’s a great way for them to develop important skills for later in life.Buy clothes for dress-up to encourage playing pretend, or consider other toys that foster imagination and fantasy:


Child-sized furniture.
Play-kitchen set.
Puppets.
Dolls.
Toy cars.
Construction sets.
Building blocks.

, Preschoolers are at an age where their bodies are growing rapidly, so choose toys that facilitate muscle development.Any toy that gets preschoolers to move around and use their bodies is great for this, so there are a variety of toys to choose from:

Tricycles.
Balls for throwing and catching.
Wagons.
Tunnels and climbers.
Plastic bowling set.
Children’s toolkit.

, Not all preschoolers are alike. Some struggle with counting while others need help learning how to share. Buy toys that will meet the individual needs of the preschooler (or preschoolers) you’re shopping for.If the preschooler you’re shopping for needs help learning how to cooperate with others, buy toys that require two or more people to play, like games or a ball for catch.
Books, games, and art supplies can help foster a positive attitude towards learning in preschoolers who are struggling in the classroom.

, This will save you the hassle of having to return toys that are defective or boring. Online reviews are a great way to check if a toy is safe, and you can watch video reviews to find out exactly how a toy works., Safe toys are labeled non-toxic, they don’t have parts that could pinch a preschooler’s fingers, and overall they are well-made. Toys are also labeled by age appropriateness, so check to make sure whoever you’re buying a toy for is old enough to play with it before you make a purchase., You don’t have to go to a toy store to buy great preschool toys. Shop for toys online for more options and make sure to compare prices so you save on your purchase.

, Brick-and-mortar toy stores offer a wide selection of toys for preschoolers, and you'll be able to bring them home or to the classroom immediately.

Shop at large toy retailers if you're looking for popular brand-name toys or if you have a specific game you're looking for. You'll have an easier time finding it there then if you were to visit a smaller toy store.
Buy toys from a small local toy store to find toys that are unique and to support a local business.

, New toys may pose health and safety risks for young children. Monitor them as they play with their new toys so you’re better equipped to catch any safety issues that arise., Just because the toys you bought were designed for a preschooler doesn’t mean you won’t also get enjoyment from playing with them with whoever you bought them for. Playing with preschoolers is a great way for you to bond, and because most of their toys are learning-based, you’ll be helping them develop a positive attitude toward learning., Toys, especially plastic ones, can get dirty quickly, so check them frequently and clean them when necessary. Some toys are dishwasher safe, while you might need to use dish soap and water for others., Preschoolers can be wild and adventurous, and broken toys come with the territory. Fix them if you can or toss them in the trash and invest in some new toys. Broken or worn toys can pose a safety risk, so it’s important to check preschool toys regularly."

Discuss your feelings with your spouse.,
Agree on a “no electronics” time.,
Set household rules around electronics.,
Discuss the importance of unplugging.,
Suggest an outdoor outing with no electronics.,
Play games as a family.,
Engage the family in conversation.",How to Bond with Family Distracted by Their Electronics1," Before you start imposing rules on your family, it is a good idea to sit down and talk to your spouse about how you feel. This will give you a chance to come to an agreement on what is and is not acceptable electronic use.


Share your ideas about how to encourage your family members to unplug, but listen to your spouse’s ideas as well.
Try making a list of what you want to happen regarding electronics in your household.;
, One way to encourage bonding in the family is to set a “no electronics” time once a day. You may speak to your family members and ask them to help you choose a time where you all put your electronics away and spend time together. Perhaps the “no electronics” time is set for the hour after dinner so you can all talk and hang out at the table together. Or maybe you all agree on a “no electronics” time on a Saturday morning for one hour so you can do a family activity together without distractions.You may all agree on a rule where you can only pick up your electronics in the event of an emergency. Otherwise, the “no electronics” time should be free of any phone calls, texting, or surfing on the web.

, To make bonding with the family easier, you can set household rules around the use of electronics at home. You may make a rule where electronics are not allowed during any family meals, such as breakfast and dinner. For the duration of meal, everyone has to agree not to check their phones or take any calls.Another rule could be not allowing electronics when eating out or when on a family outing. You may tell the family that they should leave their electronics at home or in the car when eating out. You may also encourage family to put their electronics away when you all go on a family outing together.

, Talk to the family about how unplugging can help you all bond in a more meaningful way. You may have a family meeting where you address the use of electronics and discuss why it is important to unplug and spend some quality time together. Allow everyone to speak at the family meeting and share their perspective. As a family, you may all come up with some rules and guidelines around using electronics so you can all feel you are connecting in a real way.For example, you may say to the family, “I’ve noticed that we all seem distracted by electronics. I want us to feel we are spending quality time together and I want to bond with you all in a meaningful way. Can we talk about our use of electronics and ways to bond more as a family?”

, You can encourage your family to unplug and spend quality time together by heading outside, preferably to an area with no cellphone or internet reception. You may plan a hiking trip where you camp and hit the trails together without the use of electronics. Or you may do a day trip where you hike in a large park in the city and attempt to focus more on nature than your cellphones.Get the family involved in planning the trip so they feel invested and included. You may have a family meeting where you discuss the logistics of the trip and the no electronics rule for the outing. Give each family member a job or role in the planning of the trip so everyone feels included.

, Another way to encourage your family to unplug is to play games as a family that do not involve electronics. This could be board games, word games, or a simple game of hide and seek. Try to play a family game with no electronics at least once a week so you can all spend quality time together and have fun.Designate one ""Game Night"" a week where you play a different board game as a family. You may also plan family hang outs on the weekend where you run around together and play outside, rather than staying indoors on your electronics.

, Connect with the family through in person conversation, rather than simply texting, calling, or using social media. Try to engage your family members in conversation at the dinner table or in the morning before they head out for the day.When you engage the family in conversation, keep it casual and open. You may say, “What’s your plan for the day?” or “What’s in store for today?”
Listen to the person speak in an interested and engaged way. Maintain eye contact with them and nod to show them you are listening. Then, ask follow up questions to indicate you are paying attention to what they have to say. For example, you may say, “Why are you worried about that test?” or “What are you looking forward to the most at school today?”

Ask your family members to put their electronics away for a period of time.,
Suggest an electronics free meal.,
Start a conversation with a family member.",How to Bond with Family Distracted by Their Electronics2," If you struggle to connect with extended family members who are really into their electronics, you may ask them politely to put them away for a period of time. Perhaps you have a niece who always seems connected to her phone. Or maybe you have a cousin who has a laser beam focus on his tablet. You may go up to the family member and ask them if they could perhaps put the electronics away for a few minutes so you can all bond as a family.


For example, you may say, ""Would you mind putting your phone away for a little so we can chat?"" or ""Do you think you could put your tablet away for a few minutes so we can all hang out?""
Try placing a basket by your front door for people to leave their cellphones in when they enter your home, similar to asking guests to take off their shoes when they enter your home.

, To carve out some quality time with extended family, you may suggest that everyone in the house have an electronics free meal. You may have a basket set up at the front door where everyone can put their electronics and unplug for the hour long meal. Or you may suggest that everyone turn their electronics off during dinner so you can enjoy a meal together without any distractions.


Try to get everyone at the meal to agree to an electronics free time so your extended family do not feel singled out. Having everyone participate can make the meal less stressful and make bonding easier for all.

, To draw an extended family member away from their electronics, you may try starting a casual conversation with them. Chatting with the family member in an engaging way can help them put down their phone and connect with you.


You may ask the family member questions about school, their job, or any other activities that they do on a regular basis. Talk to the family member about their hobbies or interests and ask follow up questions so you appear engaged by what they have to say.
You may ask, ""Have you finished that painting you started last month?"" or ""How have you been doing at your new job?""

Make a family music playlist.,
Play computer games together.,
Share information through electronics.,
Play games that incorporate cellphones.",How to Bond with Family Distracted by Their Electronics3," If your family seems to have a hard time letting go of their electronics, you may have to consider ways to integrate technology into your activities. One way is to collaborate with your family on a playlist using a smartphone or a computer. Create the playlist together, adding songs you think your family may enjoy. You can then listen to the playlist when you are traveling as a family or when you are spending time together.Having a family playlist can be a fun way to share your musical tastes with your family and bond in a fun way. You can also keep adding to the playlist, making it a common point of discussion in the family on a day to day basis.

, Another option is to play games on the computer or through a computer program together as a family. This way, you can all still bond and spend time together, and not have to give up the use of electronics completely. You may all choose a computer game you can play in teams for a game night. Or you may take turns playing an interactive computer game as a fun way to hang out on the weekend as a family.


You may try switching up the types of games you play as a family on a weekly basis. For example, one night may be computer games and the following night may be board games or an outing outdoors. Having a variety of games can keep your family engaged in spending time together.

, Share information with your family through texting, video chat, and social media. Send your family interesting articles online or interesting videos so you can all discuss them later at dinner. Keep in touch through texting so your family is connected on a regular basis. Doing this can allow your family to use electronics in a healthy, productive way.You may try to encourage family to communicate through electronics and in person. This way, there is a healthy balance in how you connect with each other. For example, you may send a family member a link to an interesting online article. Then, you may all discuss the article later at the dinner table to connect in person and bond over a shared issue.

, Another way to integrate electronics into your family time is to play games that require family members to use their phones to play. There are trivia games and other party games that you can play using your cellphones as controllers. Check out the games that are available for your game console or computer.


One option is the Jackbox Party Pack which includes trivia, drawing games, and fill in the blank games."

Stay neat and organized.,
Dress well and take good care of your body.,
Stay on top of your responsibilities.,
Acknowledge your mistakes.,
Keep your promises.",How to Be the Angel Child in Your Family1," Parents love to see clean rooms, organized closets, and floors that don't have piles of things on them. Do a little bit of cleaning each day so it is never overwhelming.


Try setting aside a time to do five minutes of cleaning, such as after supper each evening.;
, Find your own personal style: cute, preppy, girly, boyish, serious, or whimsical. Whatever your style, your clothes should be neat. Brush your hair and teeth, stay clean, and eat fruits and vegetables. This will help you look and feel like an angel child.


If you can't do everything by yourself yet, that's okay. Ask a parent, sibling, or another caregiver for help.

, Do your homework as soon as you come home, which will please your parents and give you the rest of the day free. Put effort into your schoolwork, and get the best grades you can.


Remember that in the long run, effort is more important than doing a perfect job. Even if you can't get above-average or average grades, an admirable work ethic will pay off. Your parents will be proud of you for doing your best.
If you need help, ask for it! This won't bother your parents—it shows them that you care.
Get plenty of sleep, eat well, and spend time outdoors. This shows your parents that they taught you well.

, Blaming other people is immature (and parents can usually tell when you're doing it). Instead, go to your parents and say, ""It was my fault. I messed up, and I'm sorry."" Even if they're unhappy about your mistake, they'll be proud of you for owning up to it. But don't backanswer, they can surely get angry and would always point out your mistakes the next time. So, control yourself and stay calm even in the time of worst situations.

, If you offered to help, do what you said you'd do. Parents appreciate reliability, and they'll trust you when it comes to the important things.


If you aren't sure whether you can do something, don't promise to do it. Instead, say ""I think I can,"" or ""I'll try.""
If for any reason you can't keep a promise, say so right away! Explain what's going on, apologize, and talk with the person about what to do next.

Focus on what you love about your family.,
Be kind to your siblings.,
Show your parent(s) that you care.,
Avoid arguing with your family members.,
Stay out of it if your siblings get in trouble.,
Do spontaneous favors for family members.,
Practice kindness.,
Don't worry too much about the way other people see you.",How to Be the Angel Child in Your Family2," What makes your family special? What do you love about each family member? Think about that appreciation, and try to show it every day in one way or another.

, Play with your younger siblings, and offer to keep them out of your parents' hair when your parents are busy. Hang out with your older siblings, and leave them alone if they say they're busy.


Don't pick fights with your siblings, and if your siblings pick fights with you, don't retaliate. Ignore them, and if they're in your way, ask nicely for them to stop. Your parents won't blame you if they can see that you're trying hard to be a noncombatant.

, Express your gratitude through hugs and saying ""thank you"" when they do things for you. Do what they ask you to do without talking back, and only contradict them if you feel that it's important.

, If you're involved in a disagreement, don't lose your cool. Stay sweet, and genuinely listen to the other person. Understand what they're saying, and try to work something out so everyone can be happy.


Always voice your opinions respectfully. For example, if you do not feel responsible enough to do the dishes, speak about it but offer to help in a different way. For example, you could say: ""Dad, I don't think I'm old enough to wash the dishes. I'm worried that I would drop them, and I don't think I'm strong enough to scrub everything away. But if you want me to have more responsibilities, maybe I could do a different chore, like vacuuming."" Write a letter if it is difficult for you to express your feelings.
If you feel yourself getting angry, take a break instead of shouting or saying mean things. It's okay to say, ""I'm really upset right now, and I need to go cool off."" Return to the argument once you feel calmer.

, You are not competing with them, and it's not very angelic to be happy when something bad happens to your sibling. Give them some privacy or pretend not to hear if they are being scolded.


When it's over, you could do something nice for your sibling like hugging them, sharing a cookie, or drawing them a picture to cheer them up. This can help them feel better. They might also want to be left alone, which is okay.

, Try offering to watch younger siblings, giving gifts and crafts, cleaning up, or baking (if you're old enough). People will love the generosity.

, Forgive people easily, accept their quirks, and cultivate good relationships. Your parents will love to see you being so kind.Forgiveness and kindness are the best forms of love.

, You can control your behavior, but you can't control the way they think. That's not your fault. Remember to relax, have fun, and enjoy your childhood!

Volunteer in places where the whole family can participate.,
Set aside time to contribute to charitable efforts regularly.,
Work collectively to donate your skills.",How to Become a Charitable Family1," If you're in a family with young kids, find ways to include them in volunteer activities that they may be interested in. Focus on events that allow participation from everyone.Kids may want to help other kids in need. Consider volunteering with groups that help families and children in need. For example, start a toy drive for kids around the holidays. Or, consider volunteering at a local community center to help other kids.
Volunteer in ways that promote awareness such as charity walks or runs. Have the kids help at the charity events, or just participate in them by running or walking.
Find activities where kids can be hands-on. For example, if it's a Meals on Wheels program, bring the children on the food delivery route to help give out the meals. Have them interact with homebound adults from different backgrounds so they understand different ways of life.;
, Make volunteering a part of your family routine, rather than something you only do around the holidays. By making your volunteer activities consistent, you help to teach your family to be charitable on a regular basis. Consider picking a charitable cause through a local non-profit, school, or place of worship. Identify activities that can help make a direct impact, as it will help to motivate your family to continue volunteering.
Work together as a family to make a commitment to a charitable organization on a weekly or monthly basis.
Depending on the cause that interests you, connect with a volunteer coordinator affiliated with the event or program. Ask about how to make volunteering a weekly or monthly activity. Set a schedule that allows for the children to participate, such as activities on weekends or evenings.

, Utilize your family's unique skills or talents to give back. Whether your teenage son has been singing for years, your spouse knows how to do home repair, or you have a knack for teaching grammar, make a difference as a family by using those skills.


For example, if one of you has home repair skills, there are many charities that could benefit from your family's support, such as Habitat for Humanity (http://www.habitat.org/) or Rebuilding Together (http://togetherwetransform.org/).
There are many programs for children and adults that focus on literacy, education, and community-building. Reach out to your local schools or non-profits to find programs that may interest you.
Let's say your family has an artistic side. Maybe you all can sing and dance, or maybe you all make handicrafts. Your family could offer performances at charity events for difference causes. You could perform at nursing facilities or assisted living communities. Or, you could hand out your handicrafts to those in a hospital.

Agree together on a budget for donating money.,
Donate clothes or gently used items.,
Demonstrate as a family how to share things.",How to Become a Charitable Family2," Many charities rely on monetary funds to remain in operation. Without support from you and others, many non-profits and faith-based programs would not exist.During family meals or other family time, gather input from each family member about what they can do to contribute money. While children may not have money to donate, they can contribute possibly by tracking money that has been set aside for charities. Consider creating a ""donation"" jar of your own at home where anyone can contribute.
Whether your family is making a small contribution or a large one, help to show your children that donating funds makes your community stronger. Talk collectively about different charities of interest and why they are important.

, This is a hands-on way to get everyone involved in the donation process. Instead of throwing away out-of-fashion clothes, or boxes of unused items from the garage, work together as a family to recycle and reuse those items.Identify used clothing or items that could be donated. Talk about the pros and cons of giving it away at this time. Go together as a family to donation centers such as Goodwill or the Salvation Army.
Learn about other local charity thrift stores. Explore these thrift stores as a family to see the value of donating items, as well as reusing them.

, Sharing is fundamental part of being charitable and caring. This can be as simple as bringing a sick neighbor a home-cooked meal or letting a friend in need borrow your car. But oftentimes the act of sharing starts in your own family.Being charitable starts with sharing your resources with your siblings, parents, spouses, and relatives. Be willing to give as much as you take.
Discuss the differences between sharing and getting taken advantage of. Talk as a family about how sharing involves mutual respect, in which the borrower will reciprocate the generosity by giving back in other ways. For example, a neighbor borrows your set of tools, and in return they invite your family to dinner as a thank you.

"
"
Discuss the values of giving.,
Focus on being charitable in your daily lives.,
Build empathy as a family by respecting others.",How to Become a Charitable Family3," Have open conversations on a regular basis about what giving back means on a local and global level. Consider discussing current events in your community or in the news as a starting point.Children and teens are more likely to give back and see the importance of philanthropy if you spend more time talking about those things around the dinner table.
Work together to find causes make everyone feel better as a family. Some family members may have certain interests in protecting wildlife while others may be interested in supporting the arts. Talk about what each cause does as a family, and work towards understanding each person's perspective on the cause.

, You may get caught up in your busy lives. You may forget that being charitable is about what you do each day. Being charitable isn't just something you do on Saturdays when you help out at the soup kitchen. It's every day.Learn from each other about the basics of helping others. Share a seat with someone on the ride to work or school. Share your lunch with a classmate or co-worker. Open the door for others.
Be thoughtful each day. At the end of a long day, talk as a family about one thing that each person is grateful for. Gratitude helps to foster a charitable family.

, Maybe one of your family members is more compassionate and focused on charitable causes. Learn by their example on how to be generous and respect others.No matter whether you're volunteering at a charity event or in line at the grocery store check-out, watch how people are kind, patient, and understanding of each other. Focus on the good behavior that you see, rather than the negative.
Practice showing kindness to all people. Avoid making it seem like some people are more worthy than others of your time and attention. Learn as a family how to respect people equally. Talk about the importance of honoring each person's dignity and worth as a human being.

Practice active and engaged listening.,
Paraphrase or summarize what the speaker said.,
Read their body language and nonverbal cues.,
Acknowledge others’ emotions without rushing to solve their problems.,
Notice how your own experience impacts your ability to listen.",How to Balance Others' Feelings with Your Own1," One of the most powerful ways to tune into what others are feeling is by actively listening. This skill helps you hear their message along with observing their body language and emotional expression. All of these elements should be considered in order to bring awareness about what others may be feeling.


Demonstrate active listening by orienting towards the speaker, relaxing your arms and legs at your sides, making occasional eye contact, and letting them finish their message before responding.;
, A great way to show you're listening and can recognize others' feelings is by summing up their message or restating it in different way. You look for key words and phrases that represent the speaker's intended message and restate them. This helps affirm the speaker, and provides them with an opportunity to clarify, if necessary.For instance, you are listening to your partner complain about their parents. They say, ""My mom never listens. She just tells me what she wants me to do without ever asking for my input. It's like I'm not even living my own life.""
You might paraphrase by saying, ""It sounds like your mom doesn't seem to respect your opinion, or even ask for it. You don't know what to do about it. Am I right?""

, Sometimes, people clue you into what they may be feeling by holding their bodies a certain way, by making facial expressions, or by using gestures. You need to pay attention to these aspects of communication in order to fully decipher others' feelings.For example, if your friend has their arms crossed and a scowl on their face, they may be angry or frustrated. If their shoulders are slumped and their eyes watery, they may be sad.

, Empathetic people often jump in to help—sometimes, without being asked. This results in others’ emotions overpowering your own. Unless you are solicited, just listen. Don’t feel the need to “rescue” the other person.


You can demonstrate that you heard what they said by validating their emotional experience. Say something along the lines of “Sounds like you feel…”For instance, your best friend tells you, “I’m freaking out. I have so much to do and so little time!” You might reflect the emotional experience by saying, “Sounds like you are a bit overwhelmed. Your new job seems very demanding.”

, To listen effectively, you need to be aware of your own perceptions and how they color what you hear. Mindful self-awareness helps you separate your own experiences, feelings, beliefs, and biases from what others are saying."

Never assume consent.,
Set boundaries before playing the dominatrix.,
Keep the lines of communication open throughout the experience.,
Determine a safe-word/gesture and a caution-word/gesture.,
Always have safety shears at arm’s reach.,
Keep water on hand.,
Take a class.",How to Be a Dominatrix1," Consent must be freely given. A person who is intoxicated or unconscious cannot consent. It’s best to check in from time to time to make sure. Of course, with BDSM it can be trickier to ensure consent, which is why it is important to set boundaries beforehand., Talk to your partner about what’s off-limits, and what could be off-limits, depending on a number of factors, including pain, pressure, and psychological discomfort.Using a “want/will/won’t” list can be helpful in determining how you and your sub’s desires align. A “want/will/won’t” list basically lists what you want, what you will do if asked, and what you won’t do.Creating a “contract” can be a fun way to list wants, wills and won’ts. Though aren’t legally enforceable, they can begin a scene with the sub and set limits and boundaries within the fantasy itself., It is important to watch the body language of your partner. While it is often common in BDSM to play the role of ‘victim,’ you can usually tell the difference between BDSM play and a withdrawal of consent, especially if they are gagged. Look in their eyes, check to see if their body stiffens, or if they turn away. This is a sign they might not be enjoying the play. If any of this will be part of your play, establish this beforehand., To ensure consent throughout the play, determine both a safe-word and a safe-gesture, as well as a caution-word and a caution-gesture. The caution word/gesture will indicate that they are not sure or something might be wrong, whereas the safe-word would indicate a definite withdrawal of consent. Here are some tips for safe-words and caution-words.Examples of safe-words and caution-words can be “stop” and “slow,” or “red” and “yellow.”
The gesture will depend on a number of things, including what body parts they can move, whether you can see their face, among other things. However, simple safe- and caution-gestures include blinking and nodding or shaking one’s head.

, Sometimes ropes become knotted or move to more dangerous places during play. This is why it is essential to have safety shears on hand if you are using rope play. Even if you never end up using them, they should help your partner relax and be in the moment, rather than worrying about possible asphyxiation., As with any strenuous exercise, staying hydrated is important. This is especially important if you or the sub is wearing heavy clothing or accessories (like leather).Water can also become part of the play, as you can tease your partner with the water before relinquishing the control of the water., Taking a class is a great way to familiarize yourself with all the intricacies of being a dominatrix. Because so many BDSM toys have the potential to do actual harm, taking a class on rope safety or being a dominatrix can help delineate safe practices when in the dungeon. Check to see if you local sex-shop offers a course. Just make sure it’s sex-positive and emphasizes safety and consent."

Keep a positive attitude.,
Engage in activities that you enjoy.,
Focus on enjoying your experiences.,
Enjoy the company of your friends.",How to Avoid People You Don't Want to Talk To1," Sometimes you may not want to talk to certain people because you feel uncomfortable in your surroundings. Take a deep breath and tell yourself that you are an enjoyable person to be around. Remind yourself that you are entitled to your boundaries and it’s ok to voice your feelings to feel comfortable.

Focus on what you want and what will make you happy. Then, try and find people that have a similar attitude as you. Instead of trying to avoid people, which is a negative, focus on surrounding yourself with people like you who make you feel comfortable.
Your thoughts contribute to your mood, and even your actions. Smile and take a moment to tell yourself that you are where you are meant to be.
Having a positive attitude will help you to attract other positive people.;
, You won’t always like, or want to talk to everyone everywhere, but doing activities you enjoy is more likely to surround you with people you are comfortable engaging with.


If you’re in school, join a group or club that interests you. Whether you’re introverted or extroverted, there are plenty of extracurriculars for every type of person. From theatre, to the track team, you can find an activity and a group of people that are like you.
Not only will doing something you like give you confidence and let you get to know people like you, but it will give you a way to stay busy and avoid situations and people you’d rather not be around.

, Instead of worrying about other people, and how someone may react to you, focus on enjoying yourself. Know that if someone is being mean to you, or trying to make you feel bad, that it’s always not your problem.


Oftentimes people will take out frustration on someone else due to personal insecurities.
Putting your energy into enjoying what you are doing can make it easier to avoid someone. You won’t have time to deal with someone who isn’t helping your experience.

, Whether you’re in a social setting, at school, or at work, surrounding yourself with people you get along with is a great way feel more comfortable.


If you are often in a situation where you are near rude people or people you don’t want to talk to, enlist your friends to come to your defense.
Tell your friends about the person(s) that bother you. Explain why in a calm manner and ask your friends to provide a barrier if this person approaches you.

Pause before making decisions.,
Express your feelings and needs clearly.,
Learn to say “no.” It can be hard to balance your feelings with others’ if you say ""yes"" to requests that don’t benefit you.,
Learn the art of compromise.,
Limit interactions with toxic people.",How to Balance Others' Feelings with Your Own2," If you’re overloaded by your own or someone else’s emotional experience, it’s best to delay any decision- making. Take a moment to reorient yourself before acting.


When you’re caught up in an emotional reaction, it’s easy to say things you later regret or act impulsively. Ask for a break. Go outside and get some fresh air. Get a drink of water. Return when you’ve gotten your emotions back in check., You may often find yourself annoyed because others don't seem to respect your feelings, but you may not have conveyed them clearly. When you learn to clearly say what you are thinking, feeling, or wanting in a certain situation, you can avoid misunderstandings.A great route to effectively stating your feelings is with ""I"" statements. This helps you convey your own experience without making the other person upset or defensive.
You might say, ""I feel ignored. I really need you to listen to me right now. I need your support."" This is far better than, ""You are a terrible listener."" or ""You are always ignoring me!"", You need to know when to say “no” and have the courage and discipline to do it. This simple strategy is a hallmark in emotional self-regulation.For example, your mom suggests you drive down for the weekend to attend the family picnic. But, you have a major essay to finish for a college course. It’s completely expected that you would feel guilty, but that guilt (or, your mom’s shaming you) shouldn’t force you to give in. The smartest response would be to say, “I’m sorry, Mom. I’d like to come, but I haven’t gotten started on my paper due on Tuesday. I can’t.”

, One of the most important ways you can meet your own needs and others' is through compromise. This allows your own thoughts and feelings to be considered while also honoring those of others'. Compromise involves weighing the importance of a situation and coming to a mutual agreement.You can weigh the importance of a situation by asking yourself how significant it is in the scheme of things. Will you care about this in a week, a month, or a year? If not, you might honor the other person's feelings or needs and set yours aside for the time being.
If you both care equally about the issue at hand, you'll have to find common ground. For instance, you and your friend both want to see a movie, but can't agree on a choice. You might ask a third party to select one or you might decide to watch whichever one starts next when you arrive at the theater.

, No matter how hard you try, some people may naturally overtake your own feelings, causing you to act according to their whims. Perform a well-being check when you depart from others. Notice whether you are tense, angry, or bruised from the encounter. When someone raises a red flag within your own emotional experience, make the commitment to reduce the time you spend with that person."

Practice mindfulness.,
Learn to identify and label your emotions with a body scan.,
Schedule daily me-time.,
Begin a yoga practice.,
Unplug often to prevent emotional overload.,
Journal.",How to Balance Others' Feelings with Your Own3," Mindfulness is the practice of bringing your attention to the present moment, helping you notice your physical and emotional sensations. This is particularly helpful in order to recognize your own and others’ feelings.To be effective, you’ll want to start your practice when you are not overwhelmed by strong emotions. Begin by setting aside just 5 minutes to sit and breathe. Focus completely on your breath. When your attention wanders, don’t pass judgment. Simply re-focus on your breath.
You can enhance your emotional well-being by incorporating mindfulness into your daily life. For example, stopping at a red light, hearing a telephone ring, or even purposely setting an hourly bell or alarm, can help you remember to pause and engage in mindfulness for a few minutes., Mindfulness helps you slow down to become more in tuned with your emotional experience. A body scan meditation helps you dig deeper, to recognize the way you experience these feelings in your physical body.To do a body scan, you’ll start from either the top of your head or the bottom of your feet. Work your way up through each body part, assessing what each part feels like. Is it relaxed, tense, numb, etc.? If you notice tension or discomfort, imagine breathing in relaxation and letting the discomfort melt away. Engage in deep breathing throughout the exercise.

, You need time to decompress from your own emotional experience and release any emotional contagion that you absorb from the world around you. A great way to perform self-care is by carving out time each day to do something you enjoy.During this time, you might listen to music, read a book, go for a run, take a bath, or cook yourself a nourishing meal.

, You may think of yoga as a form of physical exercise, but this ages-old practice can also help with emotional self-regulation. Yoga promotes mind-body awareness and can help you relieve conditions such as anxiety and depression.Sign up for a yoga class in your area. Or, view yoga videos on YouTube to start your practice.

, If you are constantly plugged into the news, social media, and television shows, it can be hard to tell which emotions are yours and which have been absorbed from various media sources. Regular unplugging can offer a release from this ambush of emotional energy.Dedicate 30 minutes or an hour each day to unplugging. Go outdoors, take a nap, or simply sit and enjoy the silence.

, If you are having problems balancing your own feelings with those of others, journaling may help. See it as an outlet for you to pour out any thoughts and emotions that are inside of you. As you develop your practice, you may start to see trends in your entries that explain why you are feeling or behaving a certain way."

Choose an impact toy.,
Consider using a tickling implement.,
Use pinchers or nipple clamps.,
Use anal plugs and dildos.",How to Be a Dominatrix2," An impact toy is used to hit the body, usually the buttocks, in BDSM play. Impact toys can include whips, canes, and paddles. The type will depend on your partner’s comfort level. There’s a whole range of products in this line from the traditional Indiana Jones-style whip to soft paddles., While people may not immediately consider tickling to be aligned with BDSM play, a tickler can be used similarly to a paddle, but imparting ticklish discomfort rather than direct pain. It can also be used to tease your partner when you slide it across erogenous zones like the neck or nipples., Pinchers can be used to impart pain or pressure on the skin. Typically they are used on the nipples. For beginners, it’s best to set a ten-minute limit, as they cut off circulation to the nipple., Plugs and dildos are great for all kinds of sexual play, but can be especially fun in BDSM play. When buying a dildo or plug make sure they are non-toxic, and that you have lube that is safe to use with them. You can use water-based lube with all toys and condoms. Oil based lubes are no good if you’re using condoms or if your using any latex, rubber or PVC toys. Silicone lube can’t be used with silicone toys.Vibrating dildos or plugs can add extra energy to your Dominatrix play.

Choose a rope that is right for you.,
Play safely with rope.,
Add cuffs to the play.,
Choose a gag that fits your partner.,
Use a leash.",How to Be a Dominatrix3," There are a broad range of color and materials available for bondage play. From nylon to silk, you can have varying levels of comfort, security, etc., with the varying types of rope. If you are unsure what type you want or need, talk to your local sex-shop., Rope can be a dangerous tool in BDSM, as it can, if used improperly, cause nerve damage, asphyxiation, or even death. For instance, never press the rope against the front of your partner’s throat. Some things to consider when using rope play:When someone is bound, you should never leave them by themselves.
Avoid positions that make breathing difficult.
Make sure the ropes are comfortable and allow for circulation. There should be at least a finger’s-width of room between the rope and your partner’s skin.

, There are cuffs for the wrists, legs, and even genitalia. They are a quicker way of restraining your partner than rope and can be safer depending on the type. They come in a lot of varieties from soft-velcro to locking metal handcuffs. Again, check with your partner to determine what type to use., There are a few different types of gags out there, and you should talk to your partner about the best fit for them. A ball gag can create an intense sense of vulnerability as it can impede breathing somewhat and stretches the jaw in a way the body isn’t used to. A bit gag is friendlier on the jaw and breathing. With any gag you choose, you should establish a safe-gesture or signal, so your partner can let you know they feel unsafe.Don’t keep the gag on for longer than twenty minutes, especially if someone is new to gag play.

, A leash can be fun for the sense of control it offers to the dominatrix and the sense of being controlled it gives to the sub. In order to use a leash safely, don’t pull on it sharply. Make sure the collar is fitted properly, leaving two fingers’ width of room between the collar and the skin."

Choose clothing for your sub.,
Add furniture to your dungeon.,
Choose music for your fantasy.",How to Be a Dominatrix4," Whether you’re imagining the eighteenth-century aristocratic sex dungeons of the Marquis de Sade or a futuristic sex lair, a theme can enliven the fantasy. While you may not want to change your entire bedroom for the theme, you can have props that help create the sense of fantasy you’re envisioning., This can include leather or brocade, a mask, a cloak, or really any thing that adds a sense of power or mystery to your play. You can work your outfit into your theme for the room or fantasy. You can choose an eighteenth-century vampire look or a steampunk goth look. It all depends on your fantasy and your identity as a dom., This can be part of the play, or you can decide together what your sub will wear during play. This can include hoods, straight jackets, and even chastity belts. Just make sure your sub is comfortable with the clothing and accessories before embarking on dominatrix play.Try a blindfold. Keeping your partner in suspense is a tool you can use as a dominatrix. They will not see what is coming next. You can choose a soft silk blindfold or a leather one depending on your style. There are plenty of options available., Sex furniture or particularly BDSM furniture can add an element of intrigue to your power plays as a dominatrix. From sex swings to cages, there all kinds of furniture for you to use in your dungeon or bedroom. You can use the furniture to tweak or enhance your theme., Whether Bach’s creepy Toccata in D Minor or something from Mozart the Rock Opera suits your fancy, you can add a layer of sensuality, power, or creepiness through the use of music. Music can enhance emotions and sensuality as you enact your fantasy. Avoid music that distracts, though."

Besides giving them permission to speak after they have had to be silent can be a way to evoke pleasure on both sides., When you tell them what to say, you can do it in character (if you're acting out a fantasy), or even use words you've previously discussed. Either way the control can be helpful in building intensity. For instance, you can say, ""Tell me I'm your queen"" or ""Tell me exactly what you want."", This is often seen as traditional in a domme/sub relationship, but it can be definitely add to the power dynamic. Telling your partner to kiss you or touch you can create new understandings of both your sexualities. For instance, you can say, ""Kiss me on the lips."" Just make sure you're not asking them to do something you know they wouldn't be comfortable with. If they use the safe word, stop the action or relinquish your request. That doesn't mean all play has to stop, just that you need to change tactics. Try offering up an alternative to your partner instead. You can say, ""If you don't want to kiss me on my lips, will you offer up a kiss on the cheek as an alternative?"", Role play can be a creative and fun way to increase the tension of a scene. For instance you can play any role that has a power dynamic, such as queen and subject, boss and assistant, or anything else you can think of. Adding costumes can make the fantasy more real for you and your partner., Sometimes, dominatrix will institute punishments for infractions on the part of the sub. These should be discussed thoroughly before a session, especially if you're new to BDSM. Ideally the punishments should really be fun for the sub. For instance you could use any of the impact toys as a way to punish your sub, or you can implement silence or an apology. In any case, it should not go beyond the sub's comfort zone."

Let go of the need to control the outcome.,
Stay calm and positive.,
Figure out your feelings.,
Figure out why you dislike this person.,
Put yourself in your friend’s shoes.",How to Avoid Losing a Friend to Someone You Hate1," We all wish we could have control over people in our lives sometimes! This is, however, impossible. You can’t stop your friend from making other friends. You can’t control who your friend hangs out with.


Practice mindful meditation. To get better at letting go and accepting whatever happens, try learning to meditate. Mindfulness meditation has a lot of proven benefits, but for your purposes, it can help you be comfortable with uncomfortable feelings.Letting go of the desire to control other people is a lifelong process. Everyone feels this way! Being aware of this feeling can help you manage it.;
, Try your best to have a good attitude in a tough situation. The only thing you can control is your reaction.


Look at this situation as a learning opportunity and a chance for growth.Look for the bright side. Maybe your friend spending more time with this new person means you have more time to pursue your own interests. Maybe your friend finally has a buddy to watch horror movies with them, which is good, since you hate horror movies!
Just as you can’t control other people’s actions, they cannot control yours. Think of what a powerful message staying calm, peaceful, and positive sends to your friends and peers.

, Knowing what you are feeling can help you figure out what to do next. For example, if you are confused about why your friend is hanging out with this person, you can have a conversation. If you are angry, maybe you want to take a few days to calm down before addressing it.



Keep a journal. A journal is a safe, private place where you can let all your frustration and crazy feelings out. Writing things down helps you make sense of what you are feeling and can bring some clarity to the situation.Talk to someone. Talk to an adult you trust about what you are feeling. Almost everyone has experienced friendship drama growing up and can understand what you are feeling. Talking to someone helps you feel supported and not alone.Just be careful talking to other friends if you are worried what you are saying could get back to your friend and the other person.
Knowing what you are feeling also helps you take care of yourself.Are you stressed out about your friendship problems? You can exercise to help reduce stress. Are you sad? Have a good cry with someone you trust.

, Have they done something to you in the past? Have you noticed bullying behavior? Or are you simply jealous of a new person spending so much time with one of your favorite people? Knowing why you do not like the person may help you decide what to do next.

, Imagine the roles are reversed and you have met a really fun, interesting new friend. But your old friend doesn’t like your new one, and is worried about losing you. How does that make you feel, and what would you do about it?


This helps you develop empathy for your friend. Empathy means being able to understand the feelings of another. It helps strengthen relationships and increases cooperation."
"
Treat everyone with civility.,
Draw your own boundaries.,
Ignore this person.",How to Avoid People You Don't Want to Talk To2," If you encounter someone you don’t want to talk to because this person is rude, or you two have a history, remember to stay polite. Being courteous and not letting someone’s attitude toward you goad you into retaliating is an effective way to keep any conversation short.

You won’t always be able to completely avoid someone you don’t want to talk to. However, you can minimize your interactions with this person by keeping a polite poker face.
Pause, and take a deep breath. Focus on yourself. Your goal is to end this interaction as quickly as possible.
Politely excuse yourself from the conversation. Instead of acting similarly to this other person. Remain calm and say that you have to meet a friend or have an appointment. Then you can leave the situation.

, You don’t always have to express what your boundaries are to someone you wish to avoid, but you should know what you are willing to tolerate. Stand your ground and stick to it.These can be both mental and physical boundaries. You have a right to your personal space and it’s ok to be clear about what that space means to you.
Whether you’re dealing with a co-worker, schoolmate, or ex, be clear about how and when you are willing to interact with this person. Though it may be difficult, don’t be afraid to be blunt.
If someone has a history of invading your personal space, the next time you have an encounter, simply tell this person to give you more space physically. You can also be upfront at the beginning of conversation that you only have a certain amount of time to talk. Additionally, you can inform someone that you prefer to communicate via email or text.

, Chances are that you are not the only person who wishes to avoid a certain person. Pay attention to how others deal with someone you wish to avoid. If you’ve tried more upfront methods that haven’t worked, simply ignore this person. Ask other people how to best deal with ignoring this person.

Sometimes you have a relationship with someone that just isn’t going to work out. This person can be someone you were in a relationship with, or even a coworker. If you have made attempts to create distance that have not worked out, simply ignore this person.
Ignoring someone isn’t always the easiest, especially if this person is insistent, but over time, not giving in can prove effective.
Ignoring someone doesn’t mean ridiculing a person or making mean face or gesture. It simply means you act as if this person isn’t around you. Don’t pretend this person isn’t there in an immature way, however. Sometimes ignoring someone means you have to be the bigger person and excuse yourself from an gathering or area.

"
"
Avoid situations where you might interact with this person.,
Ask for help.,
Cut ties with this person.",How to Avoid People You Don't Want to Talk To3," Sometimes you have to make changes to avoid someone you don’t want to talk to. If you know this person is going to be at a party or gathering, don’t go.


Unless you’re in a situation where you can’t excuse yourself like school or work, you may have to choose not to attend a function to avoid someone.
Tell a close friend that you aren’t going to be attending the event. Be honest with your friend as to why, but don’t be rude.
If you are somewhere and you see someone you want to avoid talking to or interacting with, see if you can move elsewhere. If you’re at a party or bar, you may be able to go to another area and avoid running into this person.

, If you really don’t want to interact with someone but are having a hard time avoiding this person, ask people for help. You can get help from your friends, parents, your boss, or a counselor.


If you find that you can’t avoid this person because you have class or work with this individual, consider talking to someone who can help like your boss or a counselor.
Calmly explain why you can’t be around this person. Perhaps this individual makes it hard for you to complete your work because you are uncomfortable. Maybe you can’t focus in class because this person won’t leave you alone. Tell an authority figure why you need to be removed from situations where you interact with this person.

, If you are able to, be upfront and end the relationship. If you have an ex that you don’t want to see or talk to anymore, or someone that might be in your larger friend group, you can simply cut ties with this person.

Establish your boundaries once and don’t apologize. Your health and peace of mind are the most important. Though it may be hard, tell this person that you won’t engage in any sort of contact anymore.
Stick to your convictions. Some people may not easily leave you alone. But if you’ve stated your intentions, your job is done. Don’t engage anymore.
It’s ok to outright say that you don’t want to talk to or see this person again. Sometimes if you are blunt and a little harsh, people will finally get the message. You may feel mean at first, but try and remember, this is better for your personal health.

Avoid thinking of a one night stand as a way to get a relationship.,
Tell them you’re not looking for anything serious.,

Keep things light and superficial.,
Don’t stay the night.,

Don’t friend them on social media.,
Don’t hook up with them again.,

Think about the mismatched aspects of that person.,
Look for a more meaningful relationship.",How to Avoid Falling for a One Night Stand," Sometimes people have the mistaken idea that one night stands are a great way to find a relationship, but this is rarely the case. Instead, use a one night stand as a way to satisfy your need for sex, and as a way to have fun and enjoy yourself.Think about whether you want a relationship or you just want a bit of fun. If in reality, you want a relationship, then try looking for that instead. You might get lucky and have a one night stand that leads to more, but if you don’t, you’ll end up feeling confused and regretful.;
, It may feel a little awkward, but telling the other person up front that you don’t want a relationship with anyone at the moment will make sure you are both on the same page. This will also eliminate any awkwardness later.Keep it light and casual. Before you head home with your lover you can simply say, “I just want to be up front so that we’re both on the same page. I want to go home with you, but I don’t want this to go any further than tonight. Is that alright with you?”
This can also help you avoid wishful thinking. If you have said this to the other person, and they have reciprocated that they also don’t want anything you won’t be left wondering if they wanted something more.

, If you find yourself having feelings that you don’t want to have, try reminding yourself that you had a one night stand just because it was something fun that you wanted to do, not because you wanted to meet your next boyfriend or girlfriend.


Try to be grateful that you met a nice person to have a fun experience with, and leave it at that.

, Is it because you’re just in the mood for sex, or is there another, deeper reason? Maybe you’re feeling slightly insecure, and you think a one night stand will make you feel valuable. They key to a one night stand is having it clear in your head that it is just something you want to do for fun.


If it’s because you want to feel needed or desired, you may end up feeling bad later on. If this is your reason, then it may be a good idea to skip the one night stand. Instead, do something that makes you feel good about yourself. Treat yourself to a facial or go to the gym. Getting validation from another person may feel nice for a minute, but the only person who can truly make you feel good about yourself is you.

, When it comes to a one night stand, it’s best to keep things light and somewhat superficial to decrease the chances that you will fall in love. Avoid focusing too much on the person’s personality, values, interests, etc. Instead, try to find someone who you find physically attractive, but don’t worry too much about his or her personality.Try sticking to non-serious topics when you are talking with the person. Flirt, talk about the drinks, the music, the moment, or the events of the evening. Try to avoid getting into deep discussions, such as about the person’s values, passions, and other intimate topics.
You might even try searching out someone who you have little in common with or who has a personality that you don’t really enjoy. Think of a time when you’ve thought to yourself that you found someone physically attractive, but had no interest in pursuing that person because you didn’t like their personality. This may be the type of person you can have a one night stand with and not have to worry about falling for them.

, If you end up at their place, leave once you’ve had your fun. Staying the night might create a false sense of intimacy because you’re sleeping and maybe even cuddling with the other person. When you leave, you don’t need to seem cold or uncaring. Just explain that you’ve got a big day tomorrow, and you don’t want to be rushed for time in the morning.Keep in mind that this doesn’t mean you have to get up and run for the door as soon as the fun is over. You can hang out for a bit if it feels comfortable to do so. Don’t, however, hang around for hours.
If they are staying at your place it can be a bit more complicated. You could casually mention that you have a really early meeting to get to, and they may take the hint. If they don’t take the hint, be polite and let them stay if they want to.

, If you do end up staying the night, for whatever reason, don’t hang around in the morning. Minimizing the amount of time you have to get to know each other will keep you from developing feelings for them.Don’t be rude about it. If they ask you to stay for awhile, make up an excuse. Say that you have plans and you need to get going so you’re not late. Say, “Thank you for a nice time,” and leave.
If you think you will end up staying the night (e.g. because it is already really late), then consider casually mentioning that you’ve got a lot going on the next day. Do this during the evening, that way the other person won’t be expecting you to hang around.

, If you want to avoid falling for a one night stand, the easiest thing you can do is resist the temptation to exchange contact information. Don’t give them your number, and don’t ask for theirs.You should also avoid looking them up on social media. If they look you up, deny their friend requests. It may sound harsh, but limiting contact will make it easy to avoid falling for them.
If the other person gives you their number without asking, throw the paper away at the first chance. This will help you avoid seeming rude, but will also eliminate your ability to contact them.
If they do send you a friend request and you don’t want to deny the request without any explanation, you can also just send them a quick message saying something like, “Thanks for the request! I had a great time with you, but I don’t really want to take things any further than that. I wish you all the best!”

, If you don’t think you’ll be able to avoid developing feelings for the other person, and you don’t want to deal with the aftermath of those feelings, consider skipping the experience altogether.


This is not to say there is something wrong with having one, but if it leaves you feeling sad then maybe it isn’t worth it.

, If you haven’t already looked them up on social media then resist the temptation to do so. If you have already done so, then delete them. Having access to their social media will only make you miserable.Similarly, if you have any other contact information of theirs, delete it. This will make it impossible to contact them to see if there is any interest from their side.

, If you choose not to get rid of their contact information, or if they contact you for another hookup, say no! It may seem like a good idea at the time, but it will only drag you further down the rabbit hole.


Be aware that you will probably try to rationalize with yourself about why it is a good idea to hook up again. For example, if they call you up and ask you to come over, you might say to yourself, “Well, hooking up with them again might help me get it out of my system” or “Hooking up again will remind me that I didn’t think they were that great anyway.” It is very unlikely that either of those things will end up being true.

, Use your one night stand as a learning experience. Perhaps from your one night stand, you have learned that it isn’t so easy for you to have casual sex without letting feelings get involved. Now you know that it isn’t something you take lightly, and that is OK too.Try to think of it as a learning experience. For example, you had a fun time with an attractive person, or you got to experiment sexually. You have to deal with the repercussions of that night, but that doesn’t mean it has to become a bad memory.

, When you have feelings for someone, especially early on, it is easy to dismiss the aspects of that person that don’t mesh well with who you are. Since your goal is to get over that person, try to focus on the differences in your personalities, lifestyles, interests, etc. Hopefully, this will help you realize that a relationship would not work out.


For example, maybe that person was a really bad fit in terms of personality, lifestyle, or in other areas, such as being a really shy person while you are someone who likes to get out and socialize.
Try to be as honest with yourself as possible when you think about the ways that you and this person are mismatched.

, Many people recommend giving yourself time to heal after a breakup, but in this case, you didn’t break up with someone so there is no reason why you can’t look for a more emotionally committed relationship. This will help you realize that the one night stand was great, but it doesn’t necessarily equal love.You can try online dating if you aren’t sure how to meet other people looking for relationships.
Ask friends if they know of anyone they could set you up.
Try doing something that you enjoy, which also gives you an opportunity to meet other people. For example, volunteer for a cause you care about. If you are religious, become a member of a church. This will help you find people that you share values with.

,
Look at whether you may be attempting to control your partner's life.",How to Avoid Codependent Relationships," In order for a relationship to be healthy you have to be healthy yourself. Get into counseling; find a friend who can help you grow~someone you trust to tell you the truth. Although they might be tougher to hear from, a non-friend works well here.;
, This is unconditional love. You have to know this kind of love before you can give it away! If you both are doing this the relationship will grow. This means spending the time you give your partner with your partner, enjoying and appreciating the relationship as it is. This does not mean centering your life around your relationship, neglecting your job, your friends, your hobbies and your own needs. Give what you can give freely without sacrifice or resentment and take care of yourself without expecting your partner to take care of you. If you don't take care of yourself, you'll get run down to the point you can't take care of your partner or anyone else.

, When you feel hurt and want to get angry, you have to be willing to look for the cause of the behavior that hurt you and address the cause. This is like counting to ten, waiting to speak before you act. If you need to get angry you can always do it later. But when you get at the cause of the behavior you can help the person understand what happened and tell them you got hurt. Now you are building the relationship and not doing damage to it.

, Make them clear to your partner including the negotiable gray areas that are part of any healthy relationship. Respect your partner's boundaries. When you're hurt or angry, stop and reflect on why you're hurt or angry. Identify whether the issue is that you want to cross your partner's boundaries or whether it's your partner invading yours. If you want something unreasonable, like crossing their boundaries, understanding that can help you let go of that desire. If you want something reasonable, like holding your own boundaries, then stand up for yourself assertively.

, Just don't call names or label them. Don't say ""You're lazy."" Focus on your own feelings, needs and points. ""I feel as if I have to do all the housecleaning"" is not insulting. ""You lazy slob, you never do anything around the house"" is insulting. If you behave this way consistently, you can establish the pattern.

, ""I'm mad because you don't do enough housecleaning to please me"" is a translation of the lazy slob insult above into information terms. Accepting that the insults just mean ""I'm angry and frustrated"" is vital. They are not true as such, they are a slanted description of a situation your partner perceives as real. It may not even be true, if so then communicating without insults could help resolve that conflict. If you clean more efficiently than your partner and finish the same tasks in half the time, it may look like you're doing less even though you're accomplishing more. Conversely, if your partner's better at cleaning, your results may disappoint your partner even though you put in the same amount of time and effort. Discussing these issues without blaming or insulting is ""problem solving mode"" and an important element of any healthy relationship.

, When both partners are comfortable and happy with the same method of conflict resolution, they tend to be happier together no matter what others think of it. Some couples insult each other constantly in a lighthearted way because neither takes those insults seriously - and know that if the insults stop, the issue is a serious one. Find your comfort zone and your partner's and explore different ways of handling conflicts till you find what works for you.

, Become aware of the types of mind games addicts play. If you did not grow up in a home with an addict or alcoholic, it's easy to be blind sided by the games addicts play. Read about addiction and find checklists online to examine the hurtful behaviors within your relationship, both yours and your partner's. Sometimes healthy behavior can hurt a lot when a relationship is changing, but that hurt is necessary to grow past it. Whoever tries to break the pattern will be seen as acting hurtfully or selfishly.

,, If the final decisions on things always go your way, that's a sign of codependence. There's give and take in a healthy relationship. If your partner never does anything without consulting you, that's a danger sign and something to work on.

Find some new interests to share with your friend.,
Continue to be there for your friend.",How to Avoid Losing a Friend to Someone You Hate2," If you're worried or unhappy about your friendship, the best way to air your concerns and then deal with them is by talking about them with your friend.Talk to them when the two of you are alone, and you are calm, in control of your emotions, and able to name what you are feeling.Indicate why you are worried, and give them a few examples of times when you felt that you were losing them to the new person. You could say, “It really upset me when you and Emily went shopping last week. I didn’t understand why I wasn’t invited. We used to go shopping together all the time.”
Give your friend a chance to respond. Listen to their feelings and thoughts about your friendship, and trust what they are saying. A good friend will reassure you and want you to feel better about this; however, you should be prepared to hear what you might not want to: that your friend is going to continue this other friendship.
Avoid questioning loyalty or friendship. Make sure you express that you love and trust your friend. Try saying, “You’ve been such a great friend to me. I know things are a bit different now, but I still love you and value our friendship.”

, As much as you might not like it, your friend is their own person and can be friends with whomever they wish — even people you don't like. It's okay if you struggle with this — acceptance can be hard — but remember that you don't have control over other people's actions. They are making decisions based on their lives and what makes them happy, and what makes them happy might be different from what makes you happy.


Acceptance is a decision that you make — you can choose to fight against things over which you have no control, essentially running yourself into a brick wall, or you can choose to accept your friend made the decision they thought was best for them., It’s okay to have some distance from someone. Do not smother your friend or be clingy. This will push them away.


If you know your friend is out with the person you don’t like, resist the urge to text constantly.
If your friend tells you what they did with the new friend, resist the urge the find out all the details. Rather than saying, “What did you guys talk about?” you could say, “I’m really glad you had a great time!”

, Join the same clubs and activities. This will allow you to spend more time together as well as give you tons of new things to talk about. And if you can engage with your friend in many different contexts, you will find that your friendship becomes more stimulating and exciting overall.

, Be there for the good times as well as the bad. You might be angry that your friendship has changed, but you can still be involved supportive.Go places together, do fun things, have parties and sleepovers, and hang out at each other’s houses.
Provide a listening ear on a bad day.

Hang out with your friend’s new friend.,
Rise above the drama.,
Make new friends.",How to Avoid Losing a Friend to Someone You Hate3," If the only reason you don’t like this is that you are jealous of the new friendship, it is worth hanging out with them (alone and/or with your friend) and giving them a chance. You may find out that they are a great person!


If you have tried to get to know this person and you just don’t get along well, back off. In that case, it is best to distance yourself from your friend when the two of them hang out together, and find time for just you and your friend instead.
Remember that true friends like you for who you are. You shouldn’t have to change or act a certain way in order to get in their good graces.Make sure you are still polite to the new person. You never know, the two of you may like each other someday!If you feel that the new person is bullying you or your friend, make sure you talk to an adult.

, Don’t gossip about your friend or the new person, in person or online. You will make things worse.


Always assume what you say about someone will get back to them.
If other people ask you why you’re not hanging out with your friend as much, you could smile and say, “We’re just doing different things right now.” Don’t feel like you need to go into detail.

, It isn’t healthy to depend on one friend for everything, after all. Start hanging out with some other nice people and see if you make some good connections!


Get involved in some new activities. It’s a great way to meet new people while enjoying a common interest. Find activities that you would never do with your friend. For example, if your friend isn’t a big artist, but you love to paint, sign up for an art class and meet some like-minded artist friends.
Volunteer with an organization you believe in. It makes you feel good about yourself to give back to others.You will also have a chance to connect with new people who share your same values.
Keep busy. You may get so busy with new friends and activities that you may stop being worried if your friend is spending time with the other person!

Loving yourself and knowing how amazing you are is one of the most attractive things you can do. When you love yourself, it is more likely that others will follow suit. To practice yourself confidence:


Focus on your positive traits. These should include both physical traits and parts of your personality that you love. Focusing on the positive, rather than on the negative, can help you to feel more comfortable in your own skin.
Remind yourself of how awesome you are. Consider your accomplishments and the amazing things that you have done in your lifetime.
Consider how you can improve the things that you don’t like as much about yourself. If you don’t like the color of your hair, consider dyeing it. If you don’t like that you become easily stressed, practice relaxation techniques. However, always bear in mind that you should be making these improvements for yourself—not to attract someone else.;
, Once you feel confident about yourself both inside and out, you can then begin to focus on attracting a man’s attention. Begin with your outfit. You should wear something that you feel comfortable in, but that also makes you feel beautiful, or even sexy. However, don’t try to catch a guy’s eye by wearing a dress with a neckline that reaches down to your belly button; instead, wear an outfit that compliments your personality and—most importantly—makes you feel fabulous.


Show of your neck and shoulders if possible. Many men consider a woman’s neck and shoulders to be very alluring and attractive parts of her body. Instead of wearing a dress that hardly covers your breasts try wearing a halter top dress and a loose updo to give your man a peek at your neck.
Don’t forget to pick out some great shoes. Again, wearing a pair of shoes that you feel comfortable in (meaning you can walk in them) is key—if you are tottering around on sky-high heels, you may come across as looking like you’ve had one too many drinks.

, Once you have selected a jaw-dropping outfit, it’s time to do your makeup and hair. There is no need to pile on the makeup, but if you feel like you look great with a bunch of eyeliner and mascara making your eyes pop, then go for it! Again, do what will make you feel the most confident and sexy—when you feel confident, you will certainly catch men’s attentions.


Choosing a hairstyle can be tricky. It is important to keep your face shape in mind, as well as the texture of your hair. To learn more about choosing a hairstyle, click here.


, When you smell good, a man will notice. When you smell bad, a man will also notice. Because of this, make sure to rub on some deodorant and give yourself a spritz of your favorite perfume. Using perfume can actually enhance your natural pheromones, making you more attractive to the opposite sex. Some scents that are considered to work well when catching a man’s attention are:


Rose.
Sandalwood.
Jasmine.

, Wearing a necklace that will draw his attention to your neck can help to hook a man’s attention. Many men consider a woman’s neck to be a feminine and captivating part of her body, so show off your elegant neckline by wearing a necklace that flatters your looks.

, Flashing a smile riddled with parsley may not be the best way to attract a man’s attention, so be sure to check that you have no chunks of things in your teeth before you start flashing a man your pearly whites. Once you are done with your lunch, chew a gum to remove the obvious stains on your teeth.

, When you spot the man whose attention you would like to attract, begin making subtle eye contact with him. However, do not stare—unless you are really good at pulling off a seductive stare, you may come across as creepy rather than flirtatious. Instead:


Let your eyes linger on your man. Wait until he catches you looking at him, hold eye contact for a second, and then look away. If you are feeling extra adventurous, you could even flash him a smile while holding eye contact (if you can flash a one second smile).

, Once you have made eye contact a couple of times, the next time you lock eyes, move your eyebrows up for a half a second, before dropping them quickly and looking away. This will send the message that you have noticed him noticing you.


Doing this may cause him to think that he may have met you before. This may prompt him to come over and say hello.

, After you have made eye contact with your man on several occasions, feel free to give him a smile. Smiling makes you seem approachable and open, which is how you want to appear if you want him to come over and talk to you.

, If you have a killer pair of legs, don’t be afraid to show them off. Instead, draw a man’s attention by changing your seated position every couple of minutes. This movement may help to catch his eye.


Crossing and uncrossing your legs can be seen as a flirtatious action. However, don’t make this movement too much, or you may look like you’re anxious or spazzing out.

, Some men find it easier to approach a woman if she is in a small group of friends. Take advantage of this and grab yourself some wing-women then hit the town with these ladies. When your guy approaches you, your wing-women will know to talk to you, then take off.


Wing-women are your friends that know you are trying to attract a guy’s attention and they will do anything in their power to make you look fantastic.
If you are in a large group of friends, try to pair off with a smaller group of friends every so often to give your man a chance to approach you confidently.

, When he comes over to talk to you, or you approach him, be confident in yourself. Don’t try to pretend to be someone else; you are already amazing enough as it is. If you start out the conversation pretending to be someone else, but realize you want to see this guy again, it will be much harder to set the record straight later on, so just be yourself from the start.


Honesty is a great policy, particularly if you are planning on seeing this man again. If he asks you to introduce yourself, be straightforward but NEVER try to brag too much about yourself even though it may mean being ""confident"" in any kind of manner.

, Don’t be afraid to get a little witty. Intelligence is attractive to most men. Part of being yourself is not making yourself look stupid just to get a man’s attention. Be confident in your intellect.


Discuss things you are interested in or know a lot about to show that you are not afraid to be smart.

, Whether you make him laugh, or he makes you laugh, feel free to crack a smile and give in to the giggles. Laughing can be charming, and having a sense of humor will definitely catch, and keep a man’s attention.


Don’t force yourself to laugh at the guy’s jokes just to make him feel good. However, don’t be rude if you don’t think he’s funny—consider changing the topic instead.
If the guy you are talking to doesn't seem to like to laugh, or seems turned off by your ability to laugh easily, he may not be the guy you want to catch the attention of.

, Passion is a very attractive quality to all men. Talking about things that you are interested in can show off some great parts about yourself: your intellect, your thoughts, and your loves.


However, do not dwell on a topic where you do all the talking for too long. If you continue to talk about your horseback riding career for 45 minutes, you may begin to lose his interest, or potentially sound conceited.

, While discussing your passions and interests is very important, listening to what your man is saying is equally as important. Showing that you are interested and actually engaging in conversation with him will make him want to keep his attention on you.


Look him in the eyes when he is telling a story, and laugh at his jokes (if you think they are funny). Ask questions that show you are paying attention to what he is saying.

, While talking with your man, break the ‘touch barrier’ by placing your hand on his arm when you laugh, or brushing your knee against his if you are seated. Breaking this invisible barrier by establishing physical contact may help to keep his attention solely on you. Other ways to break the touch barrier include. But please, don't make it too obvious till he notices that you are doing it on purpose:


Brushing his hand with your own when you pass him something.
Brushing his arm with yours when you are walking side by side.

, When you fidget or hold your hands in front of you, you can give off the vibe that you are using your hands and arms as a barrier. To eliminate this perceived barrier, set aside whatever you’re holding, be it a drink, purse, or cell phone, and use your hands to animate a story you’re telling.

Evaluate the causes for your talkativeness.,
Notice if people seem to get annoyed or zone-out when you talk.,
Avoid making the conversation all about you.,
Think before you speak.,
Accept that moments of silence are okay.",How to Avoid Being Talkative1," You may love to talk about yourself, and not even realize that it's bothering people. You may have a nervous need to fill silence because it feels awkward for you. You may feel the need to talk because you're jittery and feel like you've got to let out what you want to say.Be aware of what may be the causes for your talkativeness.
Assess if there are certain situations or people that cause you to be more talkative. Maybe you’re excited about something or someone? Or maybe you’re nervous?
When you look at the situations where you’re more talkative, you can begin to control your behavior better.
Try keeping a journal for a few weeks to help identify patterns of behavior and potential triggers.;
, Do you notice yourself talking and talking and talking? Maybe you end up apologizing for your behavior after the fact. Think about the instances when your talkativeness is getting in the way of others. For a while, you will need to prompt yourself to be aware of these things every time you go into a conversation. Over time, this will become something you notice naturally. Be aware that you should stop talking (or at least move on to a different topic) when:the person is not paying attention or talking to someone else.
the person seems bored or uninterested.
the person is distracted, such as looking at their phone, tablet, or computer.
the person is working.
you're talking too fast, and they can't seem to focus on what you're saying.

, While talking about yourself may be fun and interesting for you, that’s not always the case for other people. Avoid relating every situation back to you and your life. Find ways to connect what you’re talking about to the other person in the conversation.A conversation is a two-way street. Learn to slow down and give space for other people to talk.
Think about a recent time that you were too talkative. What was the topic about? Did the situation seem to only focus on you and your interests?
Be more interested in what others say and do. You may come off as selfish or self-centered if most of your conversations are dominated by you and your interests. The best way to do this is to ask questions!

, You may feel like you need to say whatever comes to mind. Take a step back and process what you want to say. Don’t rush to get your words out before you realize what you’re saying. This is particularly true in public or group settings.


Sometime when you speak first, and think later, you realize you said too much or said something that shouldn’t have been said.
Give yourself time to process your thoughts. It shows maturity and patience.
If you find yourself offending or irritating people with what you say, or your constant chattering, remember to listen to your brain and think about your words. Don’t let your restless energy take over and speak for you.

, Silence can be a beautiful thing. It can help to clear our mind and quiet our thoughts. It doesn’t have to be awkward or uncomfortable all the time. Give yourself a break and let the uncomfortable silence turn to patience.Mindless chatter to fill silence may make you feel more at ease, but it could be irritating to others. Don’t feel like you need to fill dead space. Those moments might simply be a sign to stop talking or to move on to a topic that interests everyone, not just you. Have a few polite ways prepared to exit a conversation when it comes to its natural end.
Many people are fine with moments of silence, particularly as they age. See moments of silence as ways to process thoughts and feelings more clearly. If you are constantly talking, you’re not able to truly listen to what you’re feeling in that moment.

For example, you can change your ex’s name in your address book to “DO NOT ANSWER” to remind you what you must do. Some phones or services will also allow you to block a particular number entirely., If you must talk to your ex, keep the communication brief but friendly. Never flirt, however tempting it may seem. If you start to repeat old arguments or bad patterns, end the conversation immediately: say, “I’m sorry, this conversation isn’t going well. I need to end it.”, Working together closely in class, being assigned to the same project, or getting put at the same work table could derail your effort to avoid your ex. You may need to ask others at school or work for help to avoid these situations.


For example, you might explain to a teacher that you would prefer not to do a group project with your ex. Or, you could ask your guidance counselor for help in arranging your schedule so that you are not in class with your ex.

, If you don’t run into your ex, you won’t accidentally start speaking with him. And you won’t see him flirting with someone else, either.


If you are in school together, use your knowledge of his schedule to avoid crossing paths in the hallway or by the lockers.
Avoid visiting his workplace. For example, if he works for a café, get your hot drinks somewhere else now.
Don’t go to his favorite hangouts or to his events. If your ex plays basketball, don’t go to those games. If he always took you bowling, don’t go bowling for a while.

, Don’t keep socializing with your ex just because you have mutual friends.Respect that your friends might want to remain friends with both of you. While it can be tempting to try to convince everyone to side with you, it’s not healthy.
It may be helpful to talk through different scenarios with your friends. For example, you might say: “I don’t feel comfortable continuing our movie nights as a small group right now. But, if you throw a big party, it’s ok to invite both of us.”
Recognize that your needs will change over time. Keep your friends up to date: if it’s ok to invite you both to a dinner party now, say so.
Leave his friends to him. Just as you need the support of your friends and family as you navigate the break-up, so does your ex. Let your ex rely on his own network of friends and family.

, Stalking is defined as a pattern of unwanted attention or behavior directed at you that would make a reasonable person fearful.

You get to set your own boundaries with an ex, even if you feel guilty about ending the relationship.


Decide on what boundaries make you feel most able to enjoy your own life. Remember that you don’t owe your ex your time and attention. Naming your own boundaries, to yourself and your friends, is the first step. Pay attention to feelings of resentment or discomfort. They are often a sign that you feel your boundaries are being violated or that you haven’t set boundaries that truly make you comfortable.Be direct about what your boundaries all. Don’t be afraid to sound like a broken record if you need to. Tell your ex: “I’m not ready to be friends. If and when I am ready, I will let you know.”

For example, your parents might be able to screen calls or other ways that your ex tries to contact you.Don’t tolerate friends who won’t respect your decision to end contact with your ex. If your friends try to use the situation to stir up drama, they are not real friends.

, You have the right not to be forced into unwanted contact with an abusive or stalking ex. At school, you might want to start by speaking with a guidance counselor; at work, with Human Resources or a trusted supervisor.

, If you have been in abusive relationship, your ex might promise that he won’t abuse you any more if you get back together. This is part of the cycle of abuse. While your ex might be able to change in time, if he does a lot of work and gets a lot of professional help, you need to be out of the relationship now., If your ex absolutely won’t leave you alone, in spite of anything you or others say, you might need to get a restraining order. This is a legal document that states the limits on the contact your ex may make with you., While it’s possible to be friends with someone you used to date, you need time to recover from the break-up before that’s possible.Friendships between exes are often less satisfactory, in the long run, than friendships between people who never dated.Mark a date on a calendar to solidify for yourself how long it really is. If you had a reasonably healthy relationship, you might be able to say to your ex: “I hope that we can interact as friends in the future. But for now, I need a certain amount of time to work on my own healing. That means I won’t accept your calls or talk to you until this date at the soonest.”

, You need to develop a new sense of yourself that is not based in your old relationship. Rather than focusing on her, focus on your friends and your family relationships, your studies, your work, and your hobbies.

Tell her you can’t be around her.,
Walk away from her.,
Move out.,
Plan outings without her.",How to Avoid a Girl Who Doesn't Love You Back1," You should start by letting her know that your relationship is too damaging to you for it to continue. Clearly tell her that you can’t be around her anymore.


Face-to-face contact is best. However, if you have to, you can call, text, or email.
Say something like “I know you don’t share my feelings, so I think it's best we don’t hang out anymore.”
Make sure to be polite and caring. Your goal should be to minimize contact with her, not to hurt her feelings.;
, If you run into her after letting her know you don’t want to be around her anymore, you need to walk away from her. Remember, though, it is better to subtly pass her by than to look as if you’re running away from her.


This works best after you’ve already let her know that you can’t be around her anymore. Otherwise, she’ll wonder what’s going on and won’t understand.
If you run into her by coincidence, you may want to politely acknowledge her before walking away. For instance, wave at her, smile, and keep walking.
Avoid being rude or blurting out things like “I can’t see you anymore” in front of other people., If you live together, you should move out. By living with her, you’ll have to confront her daily. This will likely hurt you and cause unneeded stress in your life.


If you live in the same room, you should probably arrange to stay at a friend’s house until you can get your living situation sorted out.
If you have different rooms in the same apartment, plan not to renew your lease. In addition, try to locate someone to sublet your room.
Remember, even though you’re having personal problems, you are still obligated to pay rent to your landlord. Whatever you decide to do, you need to make sure your contractual obligations are fulfilled – this may include giving your landlord a 30-day notice that you are vacating.
It is important to move out, as continuing to live together will hamper both of your abilities to move on., By minimizing contact, you’ll be able to limit the damage the relationship can do to you. To do this, make sure you plan your social outings so you won’t have to hang out with her.


Avoid socializing at places you know she frequents. For example, if she hangs out at a specific coffee house, stay away from it.
Hangout with friends from another social circle.
Inform your friends that you don’t want to be around her. This way, they can be conscious of the social activities they plan that involve you."

What did you say or do that might have upset him?
If you cannot determine what made him angry with you, you will have to ask him. You cannot sincerely apologize for something that you did not know was wrong or upsetting.;
, You could have done any number of things to upset your guy friend. An important step in giving a sincere apology is admitting to yourself that you made a mistake.


It can be a challenge to do this, because many people do not like admitting that they are wrong or that they did something wrong. However, this is a key component to giving a genuine apology and repairing your friendship.

, Presumably, you know your guy friend pretty well. Another key aspect of apologizing to him involves knowing why this particular issue upset him.


Did you offend his values or beliefs?
Did you hurt his feelings?
Did you lie to him?
Did you offend his family or another close friend?
Did you physically hurt him?

, Generally speaking, in-person apologies are much preferred. However, if an in-person apology is not possible, the next best options are writing a personal letter or giving him a phone call.


Most people strongly recommend against sending an apology in a text message, because it seems insincere. You are sending the message to your friend that you do not have or do not want to take the time to apologize in person and that you do not value his friendship.

, If you chose to apologize in-person, ask your guy friend if he will meet up with you to talk the next day. Otherwise, plan to write him a letter or wait a day before calling him.


It is best to give both of you time to calm down and take a step back from the situation. In some cases, apologizing immediately comes off as insincere  and selfish. However, you want to avoid waiting too long, because that will cause resentment to build.In the meantime, prepare your apology to your guy friend.

, It is important to go into the apology prepared with what you will say. Typically, boys and men do not appreciate a lot “fluff;” rather, it is better to get right to the point.


“I need to apologize for what I did.”
“I'm sorry for what I said the other day.”
“I owe you an apology for the way I acted.”
“I want to apologize to you about how I treated you.”

, Often, these simply come across as excuses for your behavior.If you really feel the need to give a reason for your actions, it is best to stick to reasons that put the blame on you. For example, “I said those mean things about you because I felt pressured to fit in with that crowd.” Avoid saying statements like, “Well, I know I shouldn't have said those things, but you brought it on yourself.”

, However, when you are apologizing, it is best to accept responsibility for your actions.


“I recognize that I was in the wrong.”
“I know that what I did was rude, and you didn't deserve to be treated like that.”
“I'm aware that I made a mistake.”
“I made a mistake, and I fully accept that truth.”

, When you hurt a friend's feelings or somehow upset him, sometimes he loses trust in you. One way to rebuild that trust is to show him that you value the friendship and want to repair it.


“I'll buy you a replacement, since I ruined yours.”
“I don't like that they tried to make me bully someone to be friends with them, so I'm going to stay away from them. I already have great friends, like you.”
“I'll apologize to your family, as well. That was a really horrible thing of me to say.”
“I will always be honest with you from now on. Your friendship means a lot to me.”

, Once you have drafted everything you want to say to him in your apology, carry it out.


Follow through with meeting him in person to apologize, or be sure to give him a call. If you chose to write him a letter, then leave it somewhere he will find it or mail it to him.
Remember to not make excuses while you talk with him.
Remain calm while giving your apology. Crying will likely make him feel guilty, when you are the one at fault, and getting angry will turn the conversation into an argument.
Allow him to interrupt if he becomes upset or wants to say something, and do not react negatively if you do not like what he says. This shows him that you are serious and respect his friendship., In some cases, he might not be willing to accept your apology. It is important to accept this yourself.


Do not get mad at him, and do not yell at him. It is his right to accept or reject your apology, and if you really offended or hurt him, he might not want to do that.
If your mistake has cost you your friendship, you need to take responsibility for that.
Avoid begging for his forgiveness or asking him what you can do to make it up to him. Rather, take the initiative to regain his trust by doing those things on your own.

, In your apology, you likely told him a way that you will make it up to him. Show him you were serious by following through with those promises.


Do whatever it takes to make it up to him without complaint. Complaining about it will only negate your apology and possibly put the guilt or blame on him.
It is, quite possibly, even more important to follow through if he rejected your apology, because this is a big way that you will try to regain his trust.

, Once the apology and the disagreement are over, it is best to let the whole situation fall into the past.


Do not bring it up over and over again, regardless of whether he accepted or rejected your apology. If he accepted it, then bringing it up will likely become annoying and cause a new issue. If he rejected it, then bothering him about it frequently will likely only push him further away.

Ask questions and show interest in others.,
Encourage others to talk rather than filling up the conversation.,
Listen instead of interrupting others.,
Learn to rephrase or ""echo"" what they've said.",How to Avoid Being Talkative2," Instead of making the conversation about you, stop and ask questions to show your interest in what others have to say. To avoid being too talkative, it’s important to learn effective listening skills. A conversation isn’t just about you; it’s about all the people involved. If you’re talking about your day, or something that you do, ask the other person about their day or what they’ve been doing. Give them a few minutes to speak.
Keep engaged in what they’re saying. It’s rude to turn your attention, such as to other people or your phone. If the roles were reversed, you’d probably be irritated if they weren’t paying attention.
Ask questions about them. Get to know them better. Consider saying things about their family, interests, hobbies, favorite movies, sports, music, or other topics that can help you to know the person. See if you can remember one thing you learned about them that you can refer to next time you talk to them. This will keep you from talking about yourself and let them know you were interested in what they shared.

, Let’s say you’re the more talkative person in a group. You might want to talk more if others are quiet. Instead of filling the dead air with your words, encourage others to speak.


Understand that some people can be shy, or feel less of a need to talk. And that’s okay.
Make them feel accepted, and show an interest in what they have to say. Say things like, “What do you think about this?” or “I’d love to hear what you think.”
If you’re in a group where people don’t know one another, or feel comfortable yet with each other, it may take more effort to get others engaged, but this can be ultimately rewarding.
The more that you keep others interested and engaged by learning about them, the more likely they won’t see your talkativeness as annoying.

, Being interrupted when talking is a common reason why people feel irritated by other talkative people. Allow the other people time to speak, and to say what they want to say. Sometimes, they may talk slower than you. Patience is a key part of good listening skills. Wait three to five seconds after a person stops talking before you jump into the conversation. This is to make sure that they have finished what they wanted to say.
If you have a thought or opinion that comes to mind when someone else is talking, avoid interrupting them when they are mid-sentence. Briefly apologize if you catch yourself doing this. Let them know this is something you're working on. Find spaces or breaks in what they are saying before you add your comment.

, One important part of good listening skills is demonstrating that you were not only paying attention to what someone was saying, but that you understood what they were say. By rephrasing or “echoing” what someone said, you are asking for clarification, more information, or a deeper understanding.This rephrasing or repeating back what someone said shows that you are truly listening, and want to focus on the person. For example, if someone is talking about being anxious when planning to visit some relatives for the holidays, you could say, ""So it sounds like you're worried about what it will be like when you see your relatives?""
It allows the opportunity for great understanding if there is miscommunication or confusion about what was stated. This can help when you’re not sure what someone said or why they said it.

Find support from trusted friends and family about your talkativeness.,
Be willing to adapt your communication style.,
Understand the various causes of excessive talkativeness.,
Get feedback from a counselor if your talkativeness is hurting your work or social life.",How to Avoid Being Talkative3," Be open to listening to what others have to say about your talkativeness. They may have some helpful insight about ways to stop being so talkative. Ask them to prompt you if they catch you interrupting people or talking too much. Having people hold you accountable will help you reach your goal faster.


Consider asking a trusted friend or family member if they have faced the same challenges as you with being overly talkative. They may be able to explain what has helped them, or what they’ve been through.
Listen to their suggestions about ways to change your habits.

, While it may seem hard at first to change the way you talk or interact with others, it’s important that you find ways to communicate that adapt and change to fit your audience.


Know your audience. Is it a large group? Just one person? Someone who’s quiet or someone else who’s really talkative? Is it a classroom setting? At work? Or just hanging out with friends?
Each situation may merit a change in your way of communicating. Be attuned to what others are saying or doing. If everyone else is quiet, then think about ways to be quiet. If it’s a social gathering, find ways to engage others in the conversation.

, Some talkativeness comes from personality differences, such as being very extroverted. Other times it could be a symptom of a medical or mental health condition. Most commonly, being overly talkative is a nervous or stress-related habit that can be controlled.


Watch out for any concerns that your excessive talkativeness may be pressured, rapid, and seemingly uncontrollable. Maybe it feels like you can't stop, and the pace of speech seems inappropriately urgent. If this is your situation, talk with a mental health or medical professional for an evaluation. There may be medication or therapy that can help. Evaluate if you constantly crave to be with others, or get your energy from talking with other people. You may be strongly extroverted, and thus might come off as bothersome to others if you are constantly restless and want to talk with people.
Be aware that sometimes anxiety and stress can lead to heightened or rapid talking. Find ways to notice what you're doing, and refocus your mind on how to stay calm, focused, and relaxed in that moment. Practicing mindfulness techniques and meditation may help.

, If you feel like people are treating you differently, or making you feel unwelcome due to your talkative behavior, consider talking with a counselor about how to cope.Find a counselor at your school, through an Employee Assistance Program, or in the community. Ask them about how to help with communication skills.
Discuss how to establish boundaries of communication, and how to respect others’ communication styles. A counselor can give you an unbiased and non-judgmental opinion on the situation.

Think about where you’ll be in 1, 5, or 10 years. Does she really figure into your life plans?
Consider other girls you know and may be interested in dating. That should give you motivation to try to avoid her., Without confidence, you’ll likely get involved with people who aren’t good for you. There are several things you can do to build your confidence:


Ask prior romantic partners about your positive attributes.
Avoid scrutinizing yourself and focusing on your negative qualities.
Tell yourself that you are an awesome person and should be valued and loved., The easiest way to avoid a girl that doesn't love you is to look around for those that may truly value you. By getting out into the world and meeting a lot of people, you’ll set yourself up for positive and healthy relationships. Try to truly take in the compliments you receive from others, and try to build those positive relationships.


Look for people who share your interests.
Don’t view one or two dates as a commitment. Play the field a little and try to date a lot of people. The more people you meet, the more likely you are to find someone that will share your feelings.
Get to know people in your friend group."

Give yourself time to relax.If you need to make an apology to a girl, then you are probably dealing with some pain as well.,
Understand why she is upset.,
Be sincere with your apology.",How to Apologize to a Girl1," No matter why you are apologizing, remember that the goal is to make up with the girl and improve your relationship.At its core, an apology is an emotional concession that can have great returns if properly and sincerely delivered.


It has been found consistently in studies that men have a far more difficult time of apologizing than women. If you count yourself among those who find difficulty in apologizing, approaching the act as a purely practical manoeuvre (at least at first) can help you get over that first hump.;
, If you recognize that you're not feeling good at the moment, you should see first things first and give yourself time to heal. Depending on how bad the situation is, this could mean minutes, hours or days.


Don't let yourself put the apology off too long, however. Being silent long enough will be interpreted as a non-apology; that you aren't sorry and don't want to have anything to do with her. Again, interpretation of what is considered 'too long' will depend on the severity of the situation, and the strength of the relationship., Apologizing without meaning it or knowing why can make things worse than if you simply kept your mouth shut. If you rush into an apology, the woman will detect you're not being honest. Before you apologize, it's important you take a moment to stop and reflect. Why is she upset? Are the possibly other factors that are playing into her mood? How serious is the problem?Put yourself in the woman's shoes for a moment. While you should be considering the way she is feeling, you should also imagine the way your actions have been interpreted by her in turn. If your apology is because of a certain thing that happened, try playing it out in your head. From there, regardless of who is to blame, you should have a better grasp why she is upset.
Keep in mind that empathizing with why she is upset is distinct from necessarily admitting guilt. Even if you don't think you have done anything wrong per se, a healthy relationship involves recognizing where the other person is coming from. Even if you think at first her reasons for feeling this way are unjustified or even irrational, it's important to recognize that the pain is real., If the problem in question is severe enough, a woman will be analyzing your delivery for any possible signs of fakeness. The best way to ensure your apology is received as you want it is to make sure you actually mean it. If you think you'll need to grit your teeth as you apologize, it's a good idea to hold off and reflect upon the apology some more, or do without one altogether. You may be very angry for the same reasons as the girl. This will make it hard to open yourself up to her. If this is the case, give yourself some more time to relax and breathe.

Explain your feelings with ""I""-statements.,
Be matter of fact.,
Give her a chance to talk.,
Remain calm.,
Stay in the present.,
Be willing to compromise.",How to Ask Your Girlfriend to Stop Talking to a Guy1," As this is a delicate situation, phrasing things using ""I""-statements can help reduce tension as you place the focus on your feelings. Begin with ""I feel..."" and state your feeling. Then, explain the behavior that led to that feeling and why you feel the way you do.Don't come into the situation and say something like, ""It's hurtful that you're so flirtatious with your ex and it makes me insecure."" This can sound hostile.
Instead, calmly rephrase the above sentiment using an ""I""-statement. For example, say, ""I feel insecure when you're very touchy and affectionate with your ex because it makes me feel like the two of you still have feelings for each other."";
, After explaining your feelings, be direct and matter of fact about what you want.Remember, there is no guarantee she will be receptive. It's probably better to ask her to lessen contact or tone down interactions than demand she not talk to him at all.


Say something like, ""I would feel more comfortable if the two of you didn't talk as much, or if you toned down some of the physical affection.""

, Asking your girlfriend to change her relationship with someone is a very sensitive topic. It's important your girlfriend has a chance to share how she feels. After making your case, let her respond without interrupting her.Give non-verbal cues to show you're listening, such as maintaining eye contact and nodding on occasion.
It can also help to paraphrase what she's said to make sure you understand. For example, say, ""So, you feel like the relationship is still important because the two of you were friends before you dated. Is that what you're saying?""

, Yelling, making accusations, calling names, and being otherwise hostile is not going to help the situation. It can be hard to stay calm during a confrontation, but take some deep breaths. Remember, you're trying to improve your relationship and not start a fight., You're talking about a situation that is occurring right now. You are not discussing the past or other issues, so do not bring these things up. This is likely to make your girlfriend feel judged and get defensive., It's very unlikely your girlfriend will flat out agree to stop talking to someone. Therefore, you need to be willing to compromise. Find a solution where you both get what you want to some degree.For example, you could agree to let your girlfriend stay friends with her ex. She could agree to set firmer boundaries and be less physically affectionate with him.

Handle rejection gracefully.",How to Ask a Guy to Be Your Boyfriend," The decision to commit can be a tricky one. Whether or not you are ready for a committed, steady relationship can be determined by a number of factors. Every case is different, and you might have certain expectations for a relationship.Ask yourself:


How do I feel about him? Do I feel excited when we are together? Do I miss him when he is gone?
Can I handle the time commitment of a serious relationship right now? What type of relationship do I want?Have we fought before? If so, how well did we handle it?Does he respect me? Are there any red flags I am concerned about? Am I uncertain about his character? Do I trust him?How do I feel about monogamy? Do I want an exclusive relationship with one person? If so, am I willing to be monogamous with this man? If not, are both parties open to a polyamorous relationship?
Am I doing this because he makes me happy? Or are other people pressuring me to have a boyfriend?;
, Asking your guy to be your boyfriend too soon can scare him off if the feeling isn’t mutual, but waiting too long can create confusion and hurt feelings. Since all relationships are different, there’s no specific amount of time you should wait before asking. Trust your instinct. If the timing feels right, it might just be.


If you have just met the guy, you might want to go on a few dates before you ask him to be your boyfriend. You may not want to commit to someone you just met.
Many people ask a partner to become steady or exclusive after about six dates or one month.Some people wait until they have dated for three months to have the talk.
If you have a long distance relationship, you may want to establish this talk sooner rather than later. This will help both parties understand what is expected even when you are far apart., You should have some indication about how the guy feels about you. The only way to be absolutely certain about his feelings is to ask him, but you can look for certain signs that might signal his feelings.


If a man refers to future plans, it might be a sign that he is planning on sticking around with you.If he brags about you to people, especially to his friends, it might show that he is proud to be around you.If he sends you texts asking how you are throughout the day, it may mean that he is thinking often about you.If you see each other several times a week and hang out every weekend, it may be a sign that he is becoming more invested in you., While you’re hoping he agrees to be your boyfriend, keep in mind that he might say no. Your guy may not be ready for a serious relationship with you, or perhaps he doesn’t like using titles or labels to describe your relationship. Think about how you will respond to a rejection.


If you want a serious relationship with someone who will commit to you, you may have to part ways with this guy if he says no. This will allow you to find someone who wants a serious relationship as well.
If you are content with your relationship, you might decide to maintain your current status until he’s ready to become your boyfriend.
If you have deep feelings for this guy, you might have to decide whether or not you want to hang out with him afterwards. You might decide to just stay friends, or you might decide to cut off contact until you can get over him.

, It will be easier for you if you know when you are going to ask the question. You can practice the conversation ahead of time, or you can identify the right moment to bring the issue up. There is no one right time to ask a guy to be your boyfriend. Judge your personal circumstances carefully.


Some people plan a special date and hold this conversation at the end of a date. Others find that this conversation comes most naturally when they are hanging out together alone. Either way, choose a good day ahead of time.
Do not ask at a time when the guy will be stressed, upset, or busy. He may be taken aback by the question, and this could affect his answer.If you are feeling nervous, anxious, or jittery, you can practice what you will say ahead of time. In a mirror, try starting the conversation and asking the question., It might be tempting to text or message a guy to ask him, but these questions are best dealt with in person. Talking in person allows you to explore different options for your relationship. If there are any questions or concerns the guy has, you can deal with them together.If you’re in a long distance relationship, it may not be easy to meet up in person. If you can have this conversation during a visit, you might want to wait until the end before asking, in case you receive a negative answer. If you cannot ask in person, calling him is the next best option.

, There is no one right place to have the relationship talk, but it should be a place where you can both express your feelings and discuss your future together. Consider what is right for you and the guy.


You should probably have this talk while you two are alone. You might broach the question during a walk on the beach, at the park, or in one of your homes.
If there a place that is special to both of you—such as the site of your first date or a favorite monument--, you might choose to have the talk there to make it memorable.
Make sure that the guy is not distracted. Do not ask him during a movie, while you are out with friends, or when he is working.
If you ask him while you are in the car or eating at a restaurant, he may feel trapped. Have the conversation in a place where you are both comfortable., While hanging out on your planned day, you should focus on staying relaxed. Wait until a good moment to introduce the topic. Wait for a moment that feels “right” or “special.” If you are having difficulty with this, you can follow some basic guidelines.


If he compliments you, you might compliment him back, starting a conversation on what you enjoy about each other. This is a natural segue into the relationship talk.
If there a period of silence, you might bring up the issue. Say how happy you are in the moment, and see if the conversation comes up.
At the end of your date or hang out, you can say, “Hey, before you go, I wanted to talk to you about something.”

, If getting around to calling him your “boyfriend” isn’t too high a priority, consider waiting to see if your guy mentions it first. This also helps you feel out whether your guy is comfortable with using titles or labels to define your relationship. This might be a good option if you are uncertain about your feelings or if you think that he is uncertain about the relationship.


Do not wait around forever for a guy to bring up the question. Set a date for yourself before you ask him. For example, you might give him a month before asking him yourself.

, Tell the guy what you like about him. This flattery will relax him, and it will make the relationship question much easier to broach. A compliment about his humor, intelligence, or kindness is a good way to signal how you think about him.You might say, “You know, you are so funny. I’ve never met a guy like you before.”
Another good compliment is, “You are very thoughtful. I’m so touched by your gestures.”
If he smiles, thanks you, or compliments you back, it may be a positive sign that he feels similarly about you.

, Once you have started on a positive note, it may be easy to start explaining your feelings for him. If you received a positive reaction from your compliment, you might want to delve deeper into your feelings. Explain to him how you feel about him. You might explain that you have enjoyed your time together so far or that you are starting to develop feelings.


You might say, “I’ve had such a good time with you so far. You’re a really unique person, and I've been thinking a lot about our relationship.”
You should probably avoid telling him that you love him at this point. He may become scared or worried that the relationship is moving too quickly. Instead, you might say that you are “developing feelings” or that you “really like” him.

, It is best to ask him directly about whether or not he is ready to be your boyfriend. Depending on the situation, you can approach this question in a number of different ways.


You can ask him directly by saying, “Do you want to make this official? Do you want to become my boyfriend?”
If you’re uncertain about the status of your relationship, you can ask, “Where do you see this relationship going?”
If either of you are dating multiple people, you can ask, “Do you want to start seeing each other exclusively?”
If you want to understand how he sees you, you might say, “I want to know what to tell other people when they ask what our relationship is. Would you say you’re my boyfriend?”

, You both might have different ideas of what a steady relationship means. Perhaps he’s ready to date you exclusively but not ready to meet your family. Maybe he wants to have sex but you want to wait. When you have the talk, you both should clearly state what you expect out of the situation.You might begin this conversation by asking him, “What does being a boyfriend mean to you?”
Answer truthfully if he asks you about what you expect in a relationship. For example, you might say, ""I expect a guy to be faithful and to be honest with me. I'm not ready for marriage yet, but I do want to explore the possibility of a more serious relationship.""

, The guy might be feeling pressured or uncomfortable by the question. If he appears anxious, uncomfortable, or hesitant, you might want to give him a day or two to think over his answer. While it may seem as though he trying not to commit, he may just need time to consider whether or not he’s ready for it.You can say, “If you need time to think about it, that’s fine. Give it some time before you make your decision.”
If he asks for space, give him space. You can ask, “How long do you think you need to figure this out?” Try not to bring up the question again until that time has passed.
If he does not give you a time frame, you can ask again after a few days. Say, “Hey, I just wanted to know if you’ve given any thought to our relationship. Have you decided where we stand?”
Do not obsessively text, call, or message him about this issue. If he did not give you a straight answer right away, you might text him once after you asked the question and again in a day or two. Give him some space if he needs it to decide.

, If he states that he does not want to be your boyfriend, try to remain positive. Try to smile, and let him know that you understand. He may be content with continuing a casual relationship, or he may want to end things there. Consider your own feelings before proceeding.


If he wants to end things, respect his choice. Thank him for your time together, but state that you understand. You might say, “I’m sorry to hear that, but I had fun with you. Good luck in the future.”
If he wants to continue a casual relationship but you want to end things, you might say, “I think it would best if we stopped seeing each other then.” If he asks why, simply state, “It seems that we want different things.”
He might state that he wants to stay friends with you. Do not agree unless you are willing to be just friends. If you feel as though this would be difficult, be honest. Say, “I’m not sure that will work out for me. You’re a great guy, but I think I will need some space.”
Some men may “ghost” you or stop contacting you. It is natural to feel upset about this, but it does not mean that he necessarily dislikes you. He may only feel awkward about the situation."

Confirm your pregnancy.,
Reflect on how you feel.,
Consider your options.,
Plan what you want to say.,
Set up a time to meet.,
Speak clearly.,
Be ready for a range of reactions.,
Manage your stress.,
Make a decision.,
Consult a doctor.",How to Announce Pregnancy to a One Night Stand," Before you feel the need to discuss it with anybody, you should confirm that you are pregnant. There is no need to have this conversation until you know for sure. If you have missed a period, and/or are experiencing other symptoms, go ahead and take a pregnancy test.


Some pregnancy tests can be taken up to five days prior to your missed period, but these are not as accurate.
For best results, wait until you have missed your period, then take an over-the-counter test.
You can also see your doctor to take a urine or blood test.;
, Becoming pregnant after a one night stand might come as a shock. As this news begins to sink in, spend a little time processing this information and seeing how you feel. You may experience a range of emotions as you consider how to proceed. Spend some time journaling and/or talking to a close friend in order to sort out what you are feeling. There is no need to tell the person who’ve slept with right away., You have at least one decision to make. You need to decide whether or not you will proceed with the pregnancy. If you do choose to proceed, you will need to decide how involved you would like the other parent to be. Ultimately, this is your decision. You may want their feedback or not. Whatever the case, you should decide (at least tentatively) how you feel before speaking to him.Some of your options include:


Having an abortion. 
Seeking an adoption. 
Keeping the baby and including the father. 
Keeping the baby on your own. 

, Anytime you are faced with an important conversation, it can be helpful to spend some time planning and practicing what you want to say. Take out some paper and a pen and write down everything you need to communicate. Keep your communication direct and to the point, and include all relevant info. Then practice speaking these words out loud.Some things you might say, include:


”I missed my period and I am pregnant.”
”I have already taken a pregnancy test and I’m sure.”
”I already know what I want to do,” or “I’m not really sure what I want to do,” or “I think I know what I should do, but I wanted your input.”
”I am positive that you are the father,” or “I’m pretty sure that you are the father.”
”I thought it was important for you to know.”

, Tell him that you need to talk to him and that you’d like to do it in person. You might suggest going for a walk (some place public) or for a coffee (some place quiet). If he asks why, tell him that you are in company and can't talk at the moment. If he agrees, arrange a suitable venue and time.Be aware that he may think you are calling him to follow up on the night you spent together. The reception you receive may be cold if that's not what he wants.
If he refuses to meet up in person, you may need to tell him over the phone.

, When you meet with him, speak your words loud and clear, so that you do not need to repeat yourself. After some brief small talk, go ahead and cut to the chase. It can be helpful to bring a note card with what you plan to say printed on it. This way, you will not get nervous and forget what you have planned.You can just come right out and say, “I’m pregnant and I thought that you should know.”

, Remember, you have had a little bit of time to process this information, and this will likely catch him off-guard. He might be confused, angry, or in denial. He might immediately offer his support. He may exhibit numerous reactions/emotions at the same time. Try to give him a moment to process the information. His first reaction might not indicate how he truly feels.If he is angry, explain that you can talk at a later date, or simply walk away. He might contact you after he has calmed down. 
If he is kind and understanding, you may choose to discuss your options and feelings with him. 
Ultimately, what you do is your decision.  

, Depending on numerous factor, this might be a stressful process. Regardless of whether or not you plan to proceed with the pregnancy, your health is in a sensitive state. You need to take care of yourself. After you speak with him, take some time and space to process your thoughts and manage your stress.Do some self-care activities, like getting a massage, taking a bath, journaling, or treating yourself to a snack.
Talk to someone, like a friend or a therapist.
Get plenty of rest.

, After you’ve spoken to him and done some reflecting, you might be ready to make a decision. Maybe you’ve known all along what you wanted to do, or perhaps you haven’t been sure. Think about the realities of having a child and whether or not you have the desire and/or means to do so. Additionally, consider your personal beliefs and emotions.In general, you have four options to choose from. You may:


Choose to terminate the pregnancy.
Choose to put the child up for adoption.
Choose to continue with the pregnancy and co-parent with the father.
Choose to continue with the pregnancy and raise the child on your own.

, Once you know how you plan to proceed, consult with a doctor. Whether you are continuing with the pregnancy or not, a doctor can provide you with valuable resources and advice. Make an appointment with an OBGYN for a consultation, and take it from there."

Reflect on the history of the relationship.,
Determine if the relationship is abusive.,
Look for ulterior motives.,
Observe if she returns your affection.,
Engage in an honest conversation.",How to Avoid a Girl Who Doesn't Love You Back3," Your first step in figuring out if a girl doesn’t love you is to think about the relationship itself. By reviewing the history of your relationship, you’ll get a good idea of its problems and strengths, and be better positioned to walk away from it.


Was the relationship ever different? For example, was there a time you thought the girl loved you?
Make a list of the things you thought you shared. Reflect to see if these were more things you wanted to share, or things you actually connected over.
Have you ever been romantically involved with her? If you’re not and never have been, she might view the relationship differently than you do., After reflecting on the history of the relationship, you should think about whether it is somehow abusive. Some questions to ask yourself include:


Does she verbally or physically abuse you?
Does she consistently make you feel bad about yourself?
Does she accept affection and compliments but never return them? Did she take advantage of your interest or affection?, Reflect a little on whether the girl in question has ulterior motives for being with you, being around you, or interacting with you. Once you think about this, you’ll have a better idea of whether she really doesn’t share your feelings. Consider if:


You hang out in a friend group that is very popular (and she does not).
She asks, or even expects, you to buy things for her.
You have a friend she is really into., Spend some time watching your interactions with her and determining if she doesn’t return your affections. If she doesn’t, you’re likely in an unhealthy relationship of some sort.


Watch to see if she hugs back when you hug her.
Ask yourself whether she enjoys physical contact with you. For example, does she like holding hands with you? Does she ever initiate any physical contact?
Listen to see how she responds when you tell her you love her. For example, does she respond “I love you, too” or does she remain silent or even say something like “thanks.”, The best way to find out how she feels about you is to engage her in a truthful conversation about both of your feelings. Without an honest conversation, you won't know for sure how she feels.


Ask her to talk about your relationship.
Make your feelings clear.
Inquire about her feelings.
Tell her not to spare your feelings. While it may hurt a little at first,

"
Find out if she is in a relationship.,
Consider if she is in a different social circle.,
Think about whether she is trying to avoid relationships.",How to Avoid a Girl Who Doesn't Love You Back4," If she is in a relationship, she may be uninterested in you or unable to express her feelings about you. Either way, you'll likely wind up being disappointed.


Her mentioning her significant other should be a good sign that she is not interested in a relationship with you., If you find yourself having romantic feelings for someone from a vastly different social circle, you may run into problems. This is especially true if the girl in question is considered dramatically cooler or hipper.


If you are in a different social circle, you may have trouble getting one-on-one contact time. As a result, you may be unable to communicate that you'd like a romantic relationship.
Consult your friends as to whether the girl in question is ""out of your league."" Think seriously about your feelings if they tell you that the girl is too cool or too attractive for you.
It is okay to try to pursue someone from outside your social circle. Just make sure you are open to unspoken cues she might send that suggest she is not interested in you. In addition, if she explicitly tells you that she is uninterested, you should back off., You might find yourself having feelings for someone who for some reason isn't interested in getting into a relationship. If she's avoiding relationships for the time being, you may need to back off for now, but not necessarily for forever. Reflect on whether:


She recently got out of a relationship that left her hurt or sad.
She is focused on academics or her career.
She has a lot going on in her life which leaves little time for romantic relationships."
"
Wait for the right time to apologize.The art of apologizing has partly to do with the right timing.,
Approach her solemnly.,
Tell her you're sorry.,
Express empathy.,
Allow her a chance to respond.,
Hug her.A verbal apology is often best accompanied by some sort of physical affirmation.,
Take steps to prevent future incidents.",How to Apologize to a Girl2," You would never want someone to apologize to you if you were in the middle of watching a movie, much less cramming the night before a big exam. Rather, you should bide your time (within reason, mind you) and wait for an opportunity where the girl is free and relatively relaxed.


Again, you won't want to wait too long before going in for your apology. If you wait too long, it may be considered by the girl as a conscious decision on your part not to apologize.

, The way you approach a girl to apologize in person will have a big influence on whether or not the apology is accepted. Approach her quietly and calmly. Don't let yourself be distracted by anything else; your apology should have your whole attention. As you approach, make sure to make steady eye contact. Don't smile too much or act too loosely; you want to tell her with your body language that you acknowledge the seriousness of the situation.


The question of approach is easier if you are apologizing over a text message or the phone, though you should keep in mind that an apology will only be at its most effective and affirmative if it's done in person.
If you're not in a position where you'll be able to run into her easily, ask her to meet up. Keep your invitation simple and to the point, but give her reason to believe the reason you're meeting is to give you a chance to apologize. If she's too angry at the moment, give her some time; hopefully she'll come around and give you an opportunity to fess up.

, Before you go into anything else, you should let her know from the start that you're sorry. If you try to explain why you're sorry before she actually knows you're apologizing, she may interpret it as an invitation to argue. Once you've approached her, take no time to let her know you're sorry. Any explaining can wait until after you've made the basic point. Being straightforward sounds easy on paper, but when there are emotions flaring up from both sides, it can be hard to see it through all the way. Don't let yourself get too worked up over it; if need be, remind yourself that this is a step in a process towards reclaiming your connection.


Your apology need not be elaborate; in fact, it's probably best that you keep it in as simple terms as possible. No need to be poetic or calculated here; just say ""I'm sorry."" The more complicated you get, the higher chance there will be that the apology will be misconstrued as something else.

, Something as simple as ""I'm sorry"" will go a farther ways than you think, but it won't be enough for the more serious things. Once you've opened up the conversation like that, it's time to go into greater details as to why you are sorry and how you understand the way she's feeling. If it develops into a more balanced conversation and the blame wasn't one-sided, you might take the opportunity to express some of your own feelings as part of the healing process, but only once you know the apology's been accepted.For example, as a general template, you might say: ""I'm really sorry for what I did. I was being really selfish at the time, and the way I see it's affected you has made me realize just how bad it was. I know I can't undo what happened, but I want you to know that I wish I could take it back, and I won't let it happen again.""

, Petty grievances probably aren't worth fussing over too much but more serious issues will probably beget a response to your apology. Once you've laid your cards all on the table, it may come time for her to tell you how she feels. Look her in the eyes, remain calm whatever you do, and process everything she says. Even if what she says makes you angry, try to empathize with her; she may still be feeling angry from what happened, and this may colour the way she reacts towards you in a less-than-pleasant manner., Regardless of the specific type of relationship you're in, a hug is almost always appropriate. Hugging at the end of your apology will give the woman a physical show of how you feel, and her acceptance of your hug will offer some closure to the both of you.

, An apology is just words if it isn't taken to heart. If you are apologizing for something you did, work on preventing it in the future. Doing things to fix the problem at hand has two benefits; first, it will practically reduce the chances of the situation happening again, and second, she will see you putting your apology into tangible actions. If you make a habit of rinsing yourself of apologies once you make them, you'll have a much harder time getting your apologies accepted in the future.For instance, if you are apologizing for being late all the time, set your alarm ten minutes earlier than you usually do. This will make your actions more prompt, thus reducing the risk of being late again. Letting the girl know the steps you've taken will prove to her that your apology was sincere."
"
Write an apology letter.,
Make amends through positive action.,
Make a donation in her name.A more formal way of apologizing to a woman could take the shape of a donation in their name.",How to Apologize to a Girl3," Handwritten apologies are the best non-verbal way to apologize. The length and tone of your message will depend largely on the severity and cause of the message. Forgetting a birthday is a far different matter than abuse or infidelity, for example. What is important, however, is that you write from the heart. Do away with the pretence of formal letter writing; write what you're feeling, and let the girl know you are sorry within the first two sentences.


Including a heart at the bottom denotes warmth and may be appropriate if you're in a romantic relationship with the girl.
Writing it by hand is important in this case. An apology letter is nothing if it isn't backed by a personal touch and vulnerability. It's much easier to mask emotions over a computer. However, for small matters a quick email or instant message can work as well.

, If you've done something to hurt the girl's feelings, doing something to make her feel good in consequence is a good way to make up for past faults.The way you go about making up to her is as potentially diverse and unique as the relationship itself. If you can think of some things the girl is interested in, you should think of those as potential opportunities to set things right. If you can't think of anything specific, there are few women out there who don't appreciate having back massages or dinner being made for them. It doesn't need to be anything too elaborate; a simple gesture can say a lot about the way someone is feeling.

, Although this probably only suits less severe or personal issues, an apology can in fact have greater weight when a dollar sign is attached to it. Of course, giving someone money would make it feel like a dirty bribe, so making a donation to a charity will carry the good intention without any of the foul undertones.


Donations, however small, should be accompanied with a specific statement why you're making it. Explain to the girl that you're making this donation as a way to affect positive change in the world from your apology, giving the fight you had an altruistic benefit for the world. Charity helps the world and is near-impossible to argue with.

Is your girlfriend really going to be receptive to you asking her to not talk to a guy simply because you're insecure? Probably not.
If jealousy is the main culprit, it's better to have a conversation about why you're feeling jealous and how the two of you can cope as a couple.

, In any difficult conversation, empathy is key to successfully talking things out. Before you talk to your girlfriend, sit down and put yourself in her shoes. Try to imagine where she's coming from.For example, maybe she talks to an ex-boyfriend and the two often seem flirtatious with each other. While this behavior may feel hurtful to you, perhaps your girlfriend sees it differently.
Think about how your girlfriend may see this situation. Is she generally affectionate with other friends, regardless of gender? If so, this may simply be how she acts with everyone. She may not see the relationship as a problem.

, Take a piece of paper and a pen or pencil. Jot down your thoughts and feelings on the situation. Then, read over the words you wrote down and think about how you could verbally express them. As it's often hard to express yourself during a stressful conversation, having some idea of what to say can help.You should not write down what you want to say word for word. It's important to leave some room for flexibility. However, having a rough idea of how you'll phrase things can help.

, If you go into a conversation with specific expectations, you may become frustrated or angry if things unfold differently. You cannot tell the future and you don't know how your girlfriend will react. Releasing expectations can help you go into the situation willing to listen and accept your girlfriend's reactions."

Take responsibility for your feelings.,
Remember your good qualities.,
Assess your jealousy.,
Manage your emotions in a healthier fashion.,
Develop interests outside your relationship.",How to Ask Your Girlfriend to Stop Talking to a Guy3," Unjustified jealousy is your problem and not your girlfriend's. If your girlfriend is not cheating on you or violating your boundaries, you're the one who needs to work on your jealousy. Own up to the fact you're being jealous and do not place the blame on external factors., Jealousy often stems from low self esteem. When you're feeling jealous, remember the good things about yourself. Jot down a list of your best qualities to bring yourself up.It can also help to remind yourself why your girlfriend wants to be with you. Does she say she loves your sense of humor or your kind personality? Keep this in mind, as it can curb feelings of jealousy.

, Jealous people are often chronically insecure. They also may have issues from their past contributing to jealousy. Did you struggle to make attachments to caregivers early in life? Have you been cheated on before?If there are major issues contributing to your jealousy, see a therapist to sort them out.

, Making demands of your girlfriend is not the best means to deal with your jealousy. When you feel jealous, find healthier ways to regulate your emotions.When your thoughts start to get out of control, ground yourself in the present with mindfulness. Tune into your senses and notice the pattern of your breathing.
Try other stress reduction techniques as well. Journal, exercise, or watch a movie to get your mind off your thoughts.

, If your relationship is the only thing you have going for you, you're more likely to obsess over it. Build up relationships with friends and family members. Take up a hobby or join a club. This way, you'll have more to focus on than your girlfriend's relationship with other men."

Approach the animal slowly.,
Remember to move very slowly.,
If the animal has finished sniffing you or doesn't look afraid of you, very slowly try to pat the animal.,
Try to pat the animal a bit more.,
Keep up the soothing interactions over time.,
Put some food out for the animal.",How to Soothe Animals1," Speak very softly or avoid saying anything. Remember never to grin at a scared animal, as they will think that you are threatening them. If the animal is wild or doesn't trust humans, try to crouch down, making yourself look smaller.;
, If you are trying to pat it, let the animal look at your hand and maybe sniff it a little. Do not move your hand while the animal is sniffing you, or it might get scared.

, This might not work, but the one key to making it more successful is to avoid going fast.

, Talk to it very softly so it knows what you sound like.

, If the animal keeps coming around your house or a certain place, treat it like this the first couple times you see it, at least until it is even less scared of you, or will even walk towards you a little.


Remember to always move slowly and talk quietly, but if it is starting to trust you more you can speak a little louder, without overwhelming it.

, This tells it that you want it around.


Don't do this unless you want to keep the animal. Always remember that if you feed a pet, it will always come back.

Brush the cat as needed.,
Bathe the cat on a regular basis.,
Clean out the ears.,
Trim the cat's nails.,
Brush the cat's teeth.",How to Take Care of an American Wirehair Cat1," The benefit of this type of coat is that it generally doesn't mat. Brushing it too much can actually be a problem because the action can be destructive to the coat. Try brushing the cat just when the cat is shedding more, such as during seasonal changes., This particular type of cat often gets a greasiness to its coat, due to the type of hair it has. Therefore, it's a good idea to bathe the cat regularly. Bathe it when you start noticing the coat is getting greasy, as often as twice a month.Make sure to use a cat-specific shampoo when bathing your cat, as it is better for its fur. You can also try wearing the cat out by playing with it before bath time to help it feel more calm.
Bathing the cat will also help with the sensitive skin that some Wirehairs are prone to., Bath time is also a good time to clean out your cat's ears. That doesn't mean spraying water in them. Rather, use cotton balls or swabs to gently swab the inside of their ears.If necessary, you can use an ear-cleaning mixture meant for cats, which you can buy. Ask your vet for a suggestion as to what kind., Like any cat, this cat will need its nails trimmed. Start with the cat in your lap with its head facing outward. Gently grasp a paw, and press on one of the pads. The nail should extend so you can trim it. Look for the pink quick on the inside of the nail, and avoid cutting it, as it's painful for the cat. Cut the nails about twice a month.It can help to get your cat accustomed to the sound of the clippers first. Try using them on spaghetti near the cat, so they can hear what it sounds like.
Some cats do better if you try to clip the nails while they are already relaxed or sleepy. If they're sleeping nearby, you may be able to clip a few nails, especially if you have a sound sleeper.
Some cats will not let you trim all their claws at once. Do a few at a time if you need to.

, All cats need their teeth brushed regularly, but few pet owners actually do it. The key is to get your cat used to the idea first. Start by just working with your cat's gums. Lift up the lip several times a day, and use your finger, a cotton swab, or some gauze to rub the cat's gums. This step is to get your cat accustomed to the action; it doesn't actually clean them. Once your cat is okay with that, you can move on to brushing.Use a vet-approved toothbrush and toothpaste. Cat toothpaste comes in flavors your cat will like.
Let the cat try the toothpaste, then gently rub it into the teeth on both sides with the toothbrush, getting the teeth all the way back. You may need to brush your cat's teeth in parts, as your cat may decide it's had enough in the middle.

Understand what ""healthy"" or ""organic"" food really is.,
Find stores that stock healthy organic pet food.,
Supplement the animal's diet properly.",How to Shop for Organic Pet Food," It's not substituting tofu or soybean for main ingredients, as is the common misconception. Good wholefood is something that remains true to its source. Pick up any food bag and flip it around, read the ingredients. If there are more than six ingredients listed, then you know that you need to keep looking. Six ingredients or less is what you're aiming for.
, There are brick and mortar stores that offers good food for pets. In the United States, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods Market are two such examples. (They're not much more expensive than any other food store either.) Some of this food can be ordered through online stores as well.

Fruitables is an excellent snack food for dogs. They offer salmon, chicken, bison and bacon jerky that is very healthy.
Science Diet, available through pet stores that stock pet food, and most veterinarian offices, is also a good source for both cats and dogs.

, Many people have been taught to never feed a dog or cat something that isn't made just for them. However, dry or canned food simply does not have all of the vitamins, minerals and fiber that a pet needs on a regular basis, especially if they're young and growing. The Collie Club of America published in their books that a puppy's diet can be supplemented with a cup of ground beef to augment their growth.This advice is not limited just to the collie breed. Ground beef, chicken, and ham without any seasonings is perfectly healthy for your pet and is not detrimental to their diet whatsoever."

Get the person who the animal feels most comfortable with.,
If the animal really trusts you, don't crouch or approach very slowly.,
Let your pet know that you like them.,
When you get close enough, reach out and let your pet sniff you or look at your hand.

,
Build up to petting.",How to Soothe Animals2," Since the animal is yours or in your home, it should be very easy to calm it.


If you are the person who the animal is most comfortable with, you might have an idea what what your pet likes; being talked to, being pet, it all depends.
Alter these steps to suit what your pet enjoys. Remember to talk quietly, using the animal's name as often as you can, but don't be like: ""Cocoa,  that's a good girl"", ""Cocoa, Cocoa, I love you Cocoa, do you love me Cocoa?""
Use it a bit to let the animal recognize you. Don't drown it with its own name.

, It's good to walk slower then you usually do, but habituated animals are less scared of humans. You can go very slowly or squat if you want to be on the safe side, or if your pet is defending itself, e.g. growling, barking, etc.

, When you are trying to soothe them, include praise, like ""That's a good boy!"" or, if you tell your pet this, ""I love you, kitty.""

,, When they aren't sniffing you anymore, slowly attempt to pat the animal.

Feed it the right amount of calories.,
Choose healthy food.,
Talk to your vet about heartworm and flea prevention.,
Watch for heart disease.",How to Take Care of an American Wirehair Cat2," Like any cat, the American Wirehair can become obese if you are not careful.An indoor cat should only have 20 calories per pound per day to maintain its weight. So if your cat weighs 8 pounds, it needs 160 calories per day to maintain that weight.If your cat needs to lose weight, feed it 40 fewer calories per day.
Don't forget to factor in treats, if you feed them to your cat. They make up part of your cat's caloric intake., Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their main nutrition comes from meat. For that reason, choose a cat food that has fish, meat, or meat byproducts at the top of the ingredient list.As a rule of thumb, adults should have food that is at least 25 to 30 percent protein and 20 percent fat.When picking a food, look for the seal of approval from the Association of the American Food Control Officials (AAFCO), which certifies that the food is nutritionally complete for your cat.
""Meat byproducts"" may sound nefarious, but they can actually be quite nutritious for a cat, as long as they're coming from a reputable company. That is, this ingredient usually includes things like organs and fatty tissue, which are perfectly fine for your animal to eat. It also can contain bone, but if your food is approved by AAFCO, it can't contain fur, hide, or feet.
Pick foods by ages. That is, a kitten should eat kitten food, while a senior adult cat should eat food for elderly cats.

, Heartworms and fleas can lead to further health problems if left unchecked. Preventing them altogether is the best option. While you can purchase many preventative heartworm and flea medications over the counter, it's still a good idea to consult with your vet about the best drug and dosage for your cat.Also, make sure you talk to your vet about regular vaccinations for your cat.

, The American Wirehair is a fairly healthy cat, though it can develop a few problems. One of the most common health problems with this breed is a type of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart wall.The most common symptoms of this disease include tiredness, fast breathing, and breathing with the mouth open. However, many cats do not present any symptoms at first. Therefore, it's a good idea to take your cat in for regular checkups at least once a year.
If you suspect your cat may have a problem, have the cat checked by a vet.

Give the cat ways to entertain itself.,
Engage the cat when it asks.,
Provide enough exercise.",How to Take Care of an American Wirehair Cat3," The American Wirehair is fairly self-sufficient. That is, the cat doesn't need you to entertain it all day every day. Nonetheless, provide it with plenty of cat toys so that it can find ways to entertain itself when you're not around.This cat will also enjoy bird watching. Leaving the curtains open so the cat can see out is a good idea., This cat may not need constant entertainment, but it will often ask when it does want to play. If the cat brings you a toy, like a mouse, try engaging the cat in play.You could also bring out a toy on a stick/string to play with from time to time, as these cats enjoy chasing lures., To help your cat maintain a healthy weight, provide it with enough ways to exercise. For instance, you could put the litter box on a different floor from the food and water. That way, the cat needs to climb the stairs to use one or the other.You could also try using a harness and leash on your cat. Get your cat used to wearing the harness around the house, and then take it outside on a leash. The first couple of times, just hang out in the yard with your cat. After a few times, you can try going on a walk with it.

Begin socializing your pet when they are very young.,
Take your pet to locations frequented by a variety of different people on a daily basis.,
Introduce your pet to new environments whenever possible.,
Place your pet in a pet carrier on a regular basis.,
Reward your pet when they are socializing with new people or behaving appropriately in new places.,
Involve friends who are strangers to your pet in the socializing process.,
Display a calm demeanor when introducing your pet to new people and situations.",How to Socialize Your Pet for The Holidays," Your pet can best retain information and become trained for socializing when they are between 3 and 12 weeks old. If you have an older or adopted pet, you can still attempt to socialize them, however, the degree of success may vary.;
, Your pet will quickly become accustomed to all types of people with consistent exposure on a regular basis. For example, take your pet to public locations such as parks, strip malls, or pet stores several times per week.


Choose public locations and venues that will allow your pet to see both men and women genders, young children, and people with different ethnic backgrounds and nationalities. For example, take your pet to a children's park so they can become more social with young children.

, Your pet can still become socialized when they experience new sights and smells, even if they are not socializing with people. For example, if your pet is accustomed to quiet environments, take them to a busy park, or walk with them on a busy street.

, Introducing your pet to its carrier can help them become used to certain situations that require the use of a pet carrier; such as traveling, or taking your pet to the veterinarian.


Leave the door of the pet carrier open throughout the day so your pet can become accustomed to the carrier, or place treats inside the carrier to show your pet that the carrier is not a form of punishment.

, Rewarding your pet with treats and praise will teach your pet that their behavior is encouraged and positive.

, When people other than yourself interact with your pet in positive ways, your pet will learn that new interactions can be friendly, instead of threatening. For example, instruct your friend to throw toys or treats so your pet can fetch them.


Instruct your friends to squat, or sit down in front of your pet when they meet for the first time. Your pet will view this position as a passive and relaxed stance, which can help your pet feel less threatened and more positive about meeting new people.

, Abrupt or nervous manners can startle your pet, or cause them to feel threatened. For example, exhibit a common behavior, such as checking your cell phone, when your pet is encountering a new situation that may cause them to feel shy or nervous.

Think about why you want a pet.,
Think about what kind of pet you want.,

Consider your options.,
Enjoy your new best friend.",How to Select a Pet," Is it because you are lonely and want some company? Is it because you love animals? Or is it another reason? You want to make sure you don't want an animal for the wrong reasons.;
, What is your favorite animal? Do you like birdwatching? Then a parakeet or cockatiel may be the right pet for you. Do you enjoy cats? Do you want a low-maintenance pet?

, If you have never had a pet before, you might have allergies. It would be an awful disappointment if you discovered you were allergic after you bonded with your new pet. Talk with your doctor about getting tested for pet allergies.

, Once you have decided what pet you want, another difficult decision is where to obtain your pet. If you are getting a fish, reptile, or amphibian, the best choice is a well-maintained store or breeder. You can also obtain these kind of pets online, but that probably isn't the best idea, as you would not know where they came from. If you are getting a cat or dog, the best place to obtain one would be an animal shelter or a breeder. When you adopt a cat or dog from a shelter, you are saving that animal's life.

, Congratulations, you have just made an important decision! Enjoy your new pet.

Make your pet’s good behavior desirable.,
Make your pet's bad behavior undesirable.,
Learn why your pet is demonstrating bad behavior.",How to Reprimand a Pet1," A good way to discourage bad behavior is to reward good behavior—a principle known as ‘positive reinforcement.’ Animals generally tend to repeat behaviors for which they get rewarded,so the use of positive reinforcement teaches your pet to demonstrate good and desirable behavior.


There are several ways to make good behavior desirable to your pet, such as verbally praising him, giving him treats, and rewarding him with extra playtime.Positive reinforcement is most effective when administered immediately after the good behavior.Immediate reward will help your pet make an association between behavior and reward.
Positive reinforcement also works when used hand-in-hand with making bad behavior undesirable.
Positive reinforcement avoids the use physical punishment. By emphasizing and rewarding good behavior, a pet who learns what to do through positive reinforcement is usually happier, more resilient, more confident, and better behaved than a pet who is physically punished.;
, If your pet realizes that certain behaviors have undesirable consequences for him, then he will likely stop doing that behavior.Examples of undesirable consequences include inattention and deterrent devices.


Species-specific punishment, such as hissing at a cat, can make bad behavior less desirable without physically punishing or yelling at your pet.Not showing affection towards your pet as he is performing the bad behavior is another way to make the behavior undesirable., Trying to correct your pet’s bad behavior without knowing why it is happening in the first place can be ineffective and may actually end up causing more harm than good. The root of the bad behavior may be improper human handling (e.g., bad training, lack of human handling, mistreatment) or medical (e.g., hormonal imbalance).Conditions such as kidney disease or bladder incontinence can cause your dog or cat to demonstrate inappropriate urination.
The bad behavior may also be rooted in inadequate socialization at an early age—your pet may not have learned the ‘checks and balances’ of his behavior.
If you suspect that the bad behavior goes deeper than simple misbehaving, consider taking your pet to your veterinarian for a thorough medical workup.

"
"
Bathe and brush the dog before the show.,
Trim the nails.,
Do some research on the breed's desirable characteristics.",How to Prepare Animals for a Show1," There are special ""brightening"" shampoos for dogs with light or white fur, and conditioners to make their fur shine.;
, Judges don't like to hear a lot of clicking as you walk on the floor.

, Judges look for the dog that is the best example of its breed. If your dog is not a pure breed, general appearance and personality are what count.

"
"
Do not physically punish your pet.,
Do not yell at your pet.,
Do not reprimand your pet after the fact.,
Avoid inconsistency when reprimanding bad behavior.,
Do not reprimand fear-based behavior.,
Do not reprimand stereotypes.,
Do not rub your dog or cat’s face in his urine and feces.",How to Reprimand a Pet2," This cannot be emphasized enough! Physical punishment has few benefits, if any, and many negative consequences. For example, your pet may become fearful and wary of you. Depending on your pet’s temperament, he may actually become more aggressive if you physically punish him.The bad behavior may also become worse.Examples of physical punishment including hitting, whipping, choking, and using devices that choke.Physical punishment can injure your pet.Physical punishment can also quickly escalate to animal abuse.Although physical punishment is rarely warranted, it may be appropriate for horses who are especially dangerous and aggressive.Physical punishment may also be warranted in situations in which the animal may other injure himself, you, or others., This is crucial to maintaining a good relationship with your pet when he misbehaves. Whichever type of pet you have, yelling at him is not an effective method of reprimanding him for bad behavior. Your pet will likely become fearful and wary of you, and may even hide from you if he can.Rather than yell him, you could let him know that he has misbehaved by saying ‘no’ in an authoritative voice.

, Reprimanding your pet after he has done something wrong is ineffective because he will not know why you are reprimanding him. This can cause your pet to become confused and maybe even fearful of you, both of which can hurt the relationship you have with him.It is recommended to issue your reprimand immediately —within 1 to 2 seconds of the bad behavior.For example, if you come home one day and notice that your cat has scratched up your furniture or your dog has chewed up your shoes, it is too late to reprimand him at that point.

, If you do not reprimand your pet each time that he does the bad behavior, he will likely not understand that the behavior is bad. For example, if you do not give your cat a time out each time that he plays roughly, he will not associate his behavior with an undesirable consequence, and may keep on doing it.


It is very important that you reprimand bad behavior 100% of the time that it happens.Another way to be consistent is to use the same cue or action each time you reprimand the behavior., Some pets may demonstrate behavior because they are afraid of a certain situation, and not because of willful misbehavior. Reprimanding fear-based behavior will not only make your pet’s fear worse, but may cause him to become increasingly aggressive.If your pet has fear-based bad behavior, you should promptly remove him from the situation that makes him fearful.If possible, prevent repeated exposures to the fearful situation.If preventing the fearful situation is not possible, you can gradually re-expose your pet to the situation to decrease his fear and lessen his fear-based behavior.Your veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist can provide helpful guidance on how to do this.

, Stereotypies are abnormal behaviors that can develop when an animal is an abnormal environment.Stereotypies are often repetitive and typically do not perform any function.An example of a stereotype is cribbing—when a horse bites down an inanimate and stationary object and sucks in air.It can be difficult to stop your pet from engaging in stereotypes. It is best to seek the expertise of your veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist to correct the stereotypical behavior.

, Your dog or cat will not learn anything from you rubbing his face in his urine and feces. This is not an effective method of reprimand. Your pet may end up fearing you and might even hide from you when he has to go to the bathroom.Your dog or cat may also end up thinking that you’re the one with bad behavior."
"
Create an undesirable consequence for your dog’s bad behavior.,
Make your cat’s bad behavior undesirable.,
Use body language to discourage your bird’s bad behavior.,
Make your horse’s bad behavior undesirable.",How to Reprimand a Pet3," Just like cats, dogs will also do things that they shouldn’t. Upside-down mousetraps and deterrent devices are very effective at discouraging a dog’s bad behavior (e.g., getting into a trashcan).Withholding a treat when a good behavior is not performed is another undesirable consequence, and is especially useful when training your dog.


Meeting bad behavior with inattention is another good way of making your dog’s bad behavior undesirable.Keep in mind that inattention will not always be a practical way to handle bad behavior, especially if that behavior results in physical injury.

, Your cat can certainly cause your love to wear thin if he is scratching up your furniture or attacking you. Rather than reprimanding him with harsh words or physical punishment, you can try other ways to make his bad behavior undesirable. For example, if your cat is scratching your sofa, you can make your sofa undesirable by placing orange peels by the sofa (cats don’t like the citrus smell) or putting double-sided tape on it.


If your cat is attacking you by playing too roughly, you can give him a time out. By not giving him attention, he will realize that his behavior is not rewarding, and will learn not to play roughly with you.
If your cat likes to jump up on countertops or tables, you can place an upside-down mousetrap on the surface that will flip upward when he steps on it. This will be upsetting enough to get your cat to stop this bad behavior, but will not injure him., If your bird tends to bite, you can communicate through your body language that this behavior is unacceptable. For example, if your bird bites you when he is perched on your arm, you can rotate your arm to throw him slightly off balance. Creating unbalance without causing him to fall will be just enough to let him know that he should not bite you.If he is perched on your hand, you can unexpectedly and slightly drop your hand to throw him off balance., Discouraging your horse’s bad behavior can involve the use of direct (your hand) or indirect (your lead rope) pressure. For example, if your horse makes a habit of invading your personal space, you could use a lead rope or your hand to apply pressure to his body—the pressure will not hurt him, but will make him uncomfortable enough to step back.


Due to a horse’s size, the risk of serious physical injury can be far greater with a horse’s bad behavior than a dog or cat’s bad behavior. If the bad behavior poses a physical danger, consider contacting your equine veterinarian or equine veterinary behaviorist for guidance on addressing dangerous bad behavior.

Use a small pen to get the animal used to you, talk to it and get it to eat from your hand. Once you have gained its trust and feels comfortable enough to let you give it a scratch along the back (which may take from a few days to several weeks), then it's time to put a halter on.
Put the halter on and tie to a sturdy fence or post that it can't break. Brush it, talk to it, and be calm around it. Keep doing this until it stands calmly whenever it is haltered and tied.
Lead it around, using a stick to keep it in line. Make sure you are always ahead of it, not it ahead of you, otherwise if you let that happen, you will have a problem animal.

You will also need to practice with a show halter, not just a rope halter, since the animal will act differently with a show halter on.


Practice, a little at a time, to get it to pose. Do only a few seconds at first, then increase the time, because the pose will be quite uncomfortable for it. By the end of the training session the animal should be well-trained and able to pose for 15 to 20 minutes.

Take good care of yourself.",How to Stay out of Trouble," Joining a sports team, whether it's a team at your school or in your community, is a great way to stay out of trouble. Whether you're playing soccer, basketball, or baseball, team sports are a great way to meet interesting, athletic, and driven people and to find something to do other than get into trouble. You don't have to be the next LeBron to join a sports team and start making some meaningful connections with people.


You can even focus on becoming a leader on the team so you can use even more of your energy that way.
Joining a sports team will also provide you with weekly exercise, which can help you calm down and will keep you from using your energy the wrong way.;
, If sports aren't your thing, you can always join a club, whether it's through regular school, your church, or another community organization. You can join an art club, chess club, French club, cooking club, debating club, or really all sorts of clubs that can help you focus on something you care about that doesn't have to do with annoying your teachers or not doing your homework.


You can join a few clubs at first to get a feel of what would appeal to you the most.

, Volunteering is another great way to stay out of trouble and to put things in perspective. You may not be as tempted to cause a ruckus in school or in your neighborhood after you spend some time with people who are truly in need. If you're too young to do it on your own, go with a parent to a volunteering event, whether you're helping people learn to read, cleaning up a local park, or working in a soup kitchen. Find something that is meaningful to you and commit to it at least once a week.


Though your schedule doesn't have to be absolutely jam packed for you to stay out of trouble, doing a few things that matter to you each week can help you focus on what's important.

, You don't have to get straight As to stay out of trouble -- but it certainly won't hurt you. Being an active student means showing up on time, not skipping class, raising your hand when you have questions, and doing the work in advance so you can participate. If you focus on being a good student, then you can stop thinking about ways to annoy your teachers or your parents.


Find a few subjects that you really care about and work on knowing as much as you can about them. You don't have to find absolutely everything interesting, but picking at least one or two subjects that mean something to you can make a difference.
Set goals for improving your grades. You don't have to get perfect scores on every test, but you can aim to go from a B to a B+ average in Math, for example.

, Reading can help you improve your vocabulary and comprehension skills, become more knowledgeable and intelligent, and to see the world in a whole new way. What's more, if you're reading, then you're not getting into trouble. Getting truly immersed in a story or stories can help you forget the hours passing by and to be transported to a whole new world -- a world where you're just an observer. Starting by reading for just 20 minutes before bedtime every night can help you develop an addicting lifelong habit.


Read a variety of books, from science fiction to fantasy, to see what genres you like the most.

, Getting creative is another great way to stay out of trouble. You can write a play and perform it with your friends, write a story, draw something, make a ceramic pot, decorate your room as if it were a rainforest, and accomplish a number of other creative tasks. Using your mind to create something completely new and original is a great use of your energy and will keep you from getting creative when it comes to following the rules.


You can even sign up for an art class after school, or ask your art teacher if she has any extra projects in store for you.

, You may have gotten into trouble in the past because you didn't follow your instincts. If your instincts are telling you that something is a bad idea, or that some person is not worth hanging out with, then you should trust them and stay away. Don't be afraid to trust your gut if it's telling you to run 100 miles (160 km) in the other direction. If you have a sense that something is wrong, even if you can't pinpoint why, then chances are, you're right.


In general, if a friend suggests that you do something and you have to question it even once, then it's time to back off.

, As long as your family is a place where you feel safe and loved, you should spend as much time as you can with the members of your family so that you are surrounded by positive influences. Sure, it may not feel cool to have movie night with mom and dad or to help your kid sister with her science project, but your family will always be there for you, and it's important to build a healthy bond with your family members as much as you can.


When you're hanging out with your family, you won't have a chance to get in trouble, will you? It's really true that idle hands make the devil's work, and the more time you spend with your family, the less time you'll be spending looking for and getting into trouble.
Make a weekly routine for yourself. Have family nights every weekend, time for doing chores during the week, and time for helping out your siblings at least once or twice a week.

, The people who may be getting you in trouble may be your very best friends. If that's the case, then it's time to find some new best friends. Sure, that may not be what you wanted to hear, but if you really want to stay out of trouble, then you can't hang out with the same people who got you into detention. Sure, if you and all of your friends have decided to stay out of trouble together, that's another thing, but how often does that happen? It's time to slowly back away from the people who are causing you to harm your own reputation as kindly and as politely as possible.


You may think that you can decide to stay on track while staying friends with people who are always getting into trouble, but unfortunately, you'll still be associated with them, and will be much more likely to get in trouble for something they did, even if you were innocent. Nobody said this was fair.

, If you're friends with people who are good students, have meaningful goals, and live positive lives, then you're very likely to have them rub off on you. If you're only friends with negative troublemakers, then you're much more likely to be one. Though it may be hard to immediately find new friends who are doing great in school, look around your classes or your neighborhood and see if you can find people who seem nice, friendly, and willing to take in a straggler. Soon, you'll see that you're staying out of trouble by doing fun things with new, like-minded people.


You can find these friends in clubs or sports teams or by participating in a variety of other activities.

, Another great way to stay out of trouble is to develop a strong bond with your teachers, or at least some of them. This doesn't mean you have to suck up to them or try to be their best friend, but it does mean that you should be a good student, show up to class on time, come in for extra help, and ask useful questions during class to show that you care. If you're off to a rough start with some of your teachers, know that you can win them over with enough hard work and effort, even if it does take time.


Being on your teacher's good sides is an excellent way to stay out of trouble. If they like you, they will be less likely to punish you or to find fault with you.

, Having a role model that you really look up to can help you succeed and to make the right decisions. Your role model can be your mom or dad, an older sibling, a teacher at school, a family friend in the neighborhood, a club or church leader, a grandparent, or really anyone who inspires you to do well in life. You can come to this person for advice on how to not only stay out of trouble, but on how to do something meaningful with your life.


A role model that you can come to regularly can end up being one of the biggest and most long-lasting influences on your life. It's important to find a person who is living a life that you admire. This doesn't mean that your role model has to be perfect -- if he made mistakes along the way and learned from them, then even better.

, One way to avoid any kind of conflict is to not gossip, whether you're gossiping about your teachers, your classmates, your friends in the neighborhood, or even your cousins. Gossiping about other people only sends bad vibes, and this will inevitably get back to people in the end. You should focus on saying positive things about people, even if nobody else is feeling very positive, if you want to stay out of trouble.


If you're saying bad stuff about people, it's more likely than not that it will eventually get back to them. And if it does, you may be in for some big trouble. Be careful on social media, too; you may trust people but later it come around and get you.

, One of the reasons you may be getting in trouble is because you find the need to defend or explain yourself to people who just aren't willing to listen. If you and a kid in your gym class or down the street just don't get along, then stay away. Resist the urge to set the record straight, tell people why they're acting poorly, or just to stick your head somewhere where it doesn't belong. Instead, get as much distance between you and volatile or annoying people as possible, and you'll be much more likely to stay out of trouble.


Reasoning with people who don't want to hear it is guaranteed to get you nowhere, fast. It's a waste of both time and energy.

, Obviously, if you're the kind of kid who always gets into fights, then this is easier said than done. But if you really want to stay out of trouble, then you have to know how to walk away from a fight. If someone is trying to provoke you, calling you names, or just getting all up in your face, learn to take deep breaths, walk away, and keep your cool. Pouncing on those people, getting hurt, and getting sent to the principal's office or to your room is just no fun, so the next time the opportunity to fight presents itself, remind yourself that, even if it may feel good to punch someone for a few seconds, long term, it'll only do you harm.


Literally just walk away. If someone is coming at you, put your hands up and leave. This does not make you a coward -- it makes you smart.

, You won't be best friends with all of your teachers, no matter how hard you try, and there will always be a teacher or two that you just don't get along with. Even if you really disagree with everything your teacher is saying, you should just be polite, try to do the best you can, and avoid any arguments that may arise. If your teachers asks you to do something, do it (unless it's completely unreasonable). This is not the time to look tough or to say what's really on your mind.


When you're in school, it's time to be well-behaved and to get on with your studies. When you become an adult and start your own career path, you can begin to question authority and the world around you a bit more openly, but in the beginning, you have to play the game.

, Being kind and polite can go a long way in helping you stay out of trouble. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" and be polite to everyone, from a random neighbor who passes by you every morning to the crossing guard. Developing a habit of good manners and good social skills will help you throughout your life, and it's a great way to keep yourself out of trouble. If you're rude or mean to people, you'll develop a reputation of being a bad seed, and no one will be in your court when you are called into question.


This means be nice to your family members, too. Don't think that they know you too well for you to really be polite around them.

, You may not think that getting enough rest, eating three healthy meals, and getting some form of exercise every day has anything to with staying out of trouble, but you're wrong. Taking care of your body means you're taking care of your mind, and if your body and mind are in good shape, you're less likely to act out or get in trouble; for example, if you're hungry or exhausted from staying up all night playing video games, you're much more likely to say something rude to an adult without meaning to.

Also, if you're focusing on your own well-being, then you won't have time to cause trouble!

Hide the treats.,
Hide 'n Seek.,
Chase the sheet!,
The moving red dot game.",How to Play With a Pet1," If you have a well-trained and obedient dog, you could try to make him/her sit and then hide some treats around in the room where you are.

Birds really appreciate paper.,
Birds like feathers.",How to Play With a Pet3," They like to shred it, and can spend hours with a piece of paper, making it into a thousand small pieces!

Let your pet crawl into your pockets!,
Make an obstacle course.,
Under the cover!",How to Play With a Pet4," Don't close the pocket though. Let the pocket be open and only do this if your clothes isn't tight at all.

, You can use treats to navigate the mouse/rat through your homemade obstacle course! Place the treats with about 5–7 centimeter (2.0–2.8 in) of distance.

, Place your pet under a piece of cloth or something similar, and watch him/her trying to find out! Do not use a heavy cover, though, and if you see your pet doesn't like it, or is taking too long to find out, then stop the play, before the pet gets mad or ill.

Place random objects on the floor!,
Peek a Boo.",How to Play With a Pet5," This includes small tunnels that your rabbit can go through, some newspaper for your rabbit to shred, some balls to play with and some treats.

, Take a piece of cloth and hold it over your rabbit. Then take off the cloth and make a noise (""Boo!"" Or ""Whee!"") and see if your rabbit enjoys it. Some rabbits get mad, and some just find it weird!

This means no more insulting yourself when you look in the mirror, setting harsh dieting rules, or beating yourself up when you make a mistake. If it would be mean to treat a friend that way, then stop treating yourself that way.;
, Don't worry about trends or fashion ""rules""—choose clothes that make you look good and feel confident and comfortable. It's usually good to wear something you can move around in.


You don't need to wear makeup. If you decide to try it, start small and work your way up as desired.
Wear clothes that make you feel happy. Whether you love lace, rainbows, overalls, or poofy skirts, you should choose clothes that work for you.
Skimpy outfits can move around when you wear them, and it's no fun to be constantly monitoring your neckline or hem. Err on the side of modesty so that you can have fun without worrying about whether your clothes are in place.

, Treat it with respect, and look after your health. Work fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fruits into your diet. Get plenty of sleep and relaxation. Find ways to make exercise fun, like dancing, swimming, walks with loved ones, and backyard sports.


Focus less on what your body looks like, and more on what it can do.
Drinking, smoking, and drugs are very bad for you! Avoiding or quitting them will help you feel more energetic, positive, and alert.
Try to go to bed and wake up at around the same time each day. This will help your body get into a good rhythm. Ask your parents to remind you to go to bed if it helps.

, Your free time is precious, so use it for what matters most to you. Engage in your favorite hobbies, read good books, and hang out with people you love. To shake things up, make a list of all the things you'd like to try someday. Then start trying them.


TV is great for relaxing, but too much TV can leave you drained and tired. Balance your free time to include hobbies, family, and friends.

, Just as you're growing physically and emotionally, you're also growing intellectually. Try reading books from different genres, from classics to science fiction. Try hobbies from arts and sciences. What is fun to you?


Look for articles online about topics that you enjoy.

, The media can have discouraging messages, such as hypersexuality, mean behavior, and rude and incorrect stereotypes. This is not healthy. Surround yourself with media that celebrates your values, and the type of person you want to be.


Look for media that supports your self-esteem, especially in fighting negative stereotypes. A girl who loves robots could watch TV with women in STEM, a girl who uses a wheelchair could read books about people with disabilities, and plus-size girls can look at pictures of stunning women of the same size. Remind yourself that people like you exist and have worth.

, Even the kindest, most cheerful people have bad days sometimes. It's okay to feel sad, get a bad grade on a test, or lose your cool every once in a while. Being good does not mean you have to be perfect, and people will understand that.


If you feel down, try talking to someone about how you feel. You'll feel better, and they'll be glad they could help.
If you make a big mistake, talk about it. Apologize to anyone you hurt, and ask how you can make up for it. The mistake is less important than how you handle it.

, Maybe this means talking to a loved one who inspires you, going to a religious or volunteering group, reading a book that exemplifies your values, or even re-reading this article. When you feel lost or uncertain, it can remind you of your purpose and the way you want to live your life.

, They have more life experience than you do, so they may be wiser than you realize. Ask them for advice, and value the things they tell you (even if you don't always agree). Think about how many good things they have done for you. Chances are, you'll never able to stop counting.


Parents aren't perfect, and sometimes they give bad advice and make bad decisions. Hear them out, and then explain your point of view as calmly as you can. Work together to figure out a good approach.

, When you see your parents or siblings looking like they need help (struggling with packages, doing chores, etc.) say ""Is there anything I can do to help you?"" Open doors for them, help carry things... little things can make a big difference.

, The next time you see your parents or older siblings doing chores, try asking them to show you how. The two of you can do it together. You'll practice and help out at home, and then you'll be good at it when you're an independent adult. Learn how to cook, do laundry, do housework, and other basic tasks. Help out your parents and anyone you see who could use a hand.


Try yard work like mowing your lawn, taking care of the plants, and weeding.
Try your hand at basic engineering tasks, such as auto repair, changing a flat tire, and fixing a leaky tap. Girls are better at engineering than most people realize!
Some parents are willing to set up an allowance in exchange for chores, or pay you for doing chores (e.g. $10 for mowing the lawn).

, Clean your room and any messes that you make around the house. If you see messes that are not yours, you can still help clean them up. Sweep, vacuum, put away clutter and dirty clothes, and clean things like windows and mirrors.


Cleaning up other people's messes is nice, and optional. Don't feel obligated if you don't have the energy.

, Look for the things that you have in common, and have fun together. Speak politely to them (even when they annoy you!), and respect their boundaries—they'll probably do the same to you in return.


Let them have space when they need it.
If you can't handle your siblings right now, then don't. Say that you need some quiet time, and retreat to a quiet space. Your siblings should respect that, and if they don't, ask an adult for help.

, Be respectful, kind, and helpful to everyone at school. This will make people like and respect you more.

, Study for all tests and quizzes, because they all count. Turn in your homework on time and pay attention in class. Participate in class for even more points towards your grade.


Teachers love it when you raise your hand in class, whether it's to give an answer or ask a question. If you give a wrong answer, it's okay.

, Do your homework promptly every night and do the best job that you can on it. This will give you better grades, and it will also help you become more disciplined and responsible.

, Cramming for three hours straight isn't good for your health, and you won't learn as much. Start working early to make it easy on yourself. Then you can take lots of study breaks and feel less pressured.


Don't stay up late studying before a test. You need your brain to be fresh and alert, so get plenty of sleep in order to prepare.

, Look at the teacher, face front, and focus on note-taking and listening.


Don't chat, text, pass notes, or use your phone in class. These are disrespectful to your teacher and your peers who are trying to learn.
If you have a disability that causes you to fidget or appear inattentive to non-disabled people, let your teacher know. Find ways to accommodate your needs so you can focus.

, Learn to ask politely for help if you are struggling in your classes. Most people love to give advice and be helpful, and your teachers want to see you succeed. Explain that you're struggling and ask for help. Their advice can help you, and they'll respect you more for it.

, Remember the platinum rule: treat others the way they would like to be treated. This means being respectful and considerate.


As a general rule, don't say something behind someone's back that you wouldn't feel comfortable saying in their presence.

, It's normal to have wants and needs, so be assertive and ask for things. Use ""I"" statements like ""I would like..."", ""I think..."", or ""When you ____, I...""


Being passive might feel kinder, but it isn't. Hinting or beating around the bush will only confuse or frustrate people.

, Listening and validating people's feelings are tremendously useful skills. This means treating them like what they say and how they feel is important (even if you don't agree with them). People will feel much better and start opening up to you if you do this.

, Whether it's small like holding a door for someone, or big like creating a picture book for your little brother, random acts of kindness are a great way to be and feel good. Look for opportunities to make people smile.

, If you think your friend's shirt is awesome, let him know. If your sister made a really cool science project, tell her how much you like it. Even a random compliment from a stranger can brighten someone's day.


Sometimes it's a bad time—for example, you wouldn't stand up in the middle of a concert and shout ""I love your singing!"" You can wait until a good moment (e.g. after the concert), or tell other people about your thought. People always feel happy when they learn you've been saying good things about them behind their back.

, Everybody has positive traits, so look for them in each new person you meet. Treat them with the assumption that they are well-meaning and intelligent in their own way. They may just rise to meet your expectations.


Keep doing this, and you will be a ray of sunshine that inspires others to be their best.
A few people are mean and rude no matter what you do. Keep a safe distance from these people, and continue being positive. It may rub off on them, or it may not.

, It can be tempting to write people off as ""weird,"" ""stupid,"" or ""stuck up."" Don't. Everyone has a story, and is struggling in a way that you might not notice. Treat everyone like they are good at heart.


Be respectful to everyone, including the people you don't like. They may warm up to you.

, Courtesy will show others that you are considerate and mature. Use the phrases ""please"", ""thank you"", and ""may I"". Let other people go first. Get a book on everyday etiquette, or ask someone who appears to be particularly knowledgeable on it.

, People may say things that don't make sense to you—but they probably have a good reason. Instead of giving up or getting mad at them, ask questions. This works in a variety of perplexing situations, from a person who is acting strange to someone who is being mean.


""That's interesting. Why would you say/ask/do that?""
""I don't understand. Could you explain it?""
""I'm surprised that an educated and considerate person like you would stereotype transgender people like that."" (Compliments can defuse rude behavior.)


, Nobody can truly ""win"" an argument. Calm yourself down, or excuse yourself if you don't think you can handle it calmly. You can always continue the discussion later when you have a cooler head.


""I need to take a break.""
""I don't know how to respond to that.""
""I'm so upset, I don't know how to handle this. I'm going to take some quiet time.""

, You won't get along perfectly with everyone, and that's okay. Spend your time and energy on the people who build you up and make you feel good. They can help you feel happy and remind you of the person you want to be.


You're allowed not to be best friends with everyone. If you feel upset when you're around someone, be polite to them, and focus your attention elsewhere.

, A good girl doesn't rush into romance, and makes sure that she is ready before trying something new. Communicate with your partner, and talk about kissing and intimate touching before you do them.


Learn how to say no. An ""I don't want to,"" ""Not tonight,"" ""I'm not ready for that,"" or just plain ""no"" makes it clear to your partner how you feel.
Learn to recognize danger signals. Some people are disrespectful: they push your boundaries, laugh off your discomfort or worries, or trash-talk other people. Steer clear of them.

, When someone does something kind for you, let them know you're grateful with a simple smile or ""Thanks!"" Give them a hug or some kind words sometimes, so they know how much you care.

Be respectful and honest with any romantic advances.,
Talk about how long you'll be alone together.",How to Act at a Girl's House1," This is an especially good thing to do if you feel awkward or unsure what to do when you first arrive. Keep an eye out for decorations, old pictures, and music or book collections -- all excellent conversation starters and places to stop and chat.;
, More often than not, she'll have some specific things she might want to show you or favorite activities around the house. If she invites you over, remember to be a good guest and let her be a good host. If things are shy or awkward, you can, of course, suggest things to do. But try and step back and let her take the lead, respecting her and her house, before blurting out the things you want to do.


Don't worry if there is some shy awkwardness early on -- this is normal! It will pass.

, Just because you're a guest doesn't mean you have to let her do all of the work. If she's got some chores to do, offer to lend a hand instead of flipping on the TV and zoning out until she's done. Think of it this way -- the faster chores are done, the sooner you can hang out.


Want to really impress her? Don't ask to help, just start pitching in -- tackling the dishes while she mops, grabbing clean towels, changing the laundry when it beeps, etc.

, Never assume that it is ""no big deal"" just because you might leave the toilet seat up at your house, don't use a coaster, or leave books out on the counter when you're done with them. Assume her level of cleanliness, not yours. The best approach is to return things to their condition when you arrived, allowing her to dictate what things are important and what things she doesn't mind you exploring or tampering with.


You don't have to act like you're in a museum! Just be courteous and don't leave a mess behind you.
Make sure you're not creating more work than when you started. If you don't know where the dishes go, don't just start sticking them places to get them out of the way.

, Just because a woman invites you over is not an invitation into her bed. This fact may seem obvious, but it can be confusing if you're visiting for the first time and are unsure what she wants to do. The best advice is to move slowly, escalating romance one step at a time (cuddling, kissing, making out, etc.) instead of just assuming you'll be going all the way once you walk in the door.


Like any other situation, you should always ask for consent before moving on romantically or sexually., If her parents or siblings are expected to walk through the door, make sure you both know in advance. Talk about whether the are okay with you being there, as well as the appropriate behavior when they arrive. You should know, for example, if her parents don't want you together in her room.

Understand that there's no one way to ""be a teen"" and no set-in-stone way to enjoy your teenager years.,

Do things that make others happy.",How to Enjoy Being a Teenager," Everyone is different, especially in their teenage years. There's really no ""way"" to enjoy being a teenager except for the ""way"" you make on your own! Some teens prefer to spend their teenage years with friends, while others prefer to study and work; some prefer to be quiet wallflowers, while others are loud and don't care if they stand out. Saying that there's any one way to enjoy your teenage years is wrong—this article is only a guideline and doesn't need to be followed to the letter!


What is enjoyable for you may not be for someone else, and that is OK. Some things are commonly enjoyed by teens, but not by all. Turning 13 does not mean suddenly you wake up and everything has changed.;
, Being a teenager is not necessarily any easier or more difficult than any other life stage. Although adolescence is a time of great change, this does not necessarily mean it will be the most difficult time of your life. If you get wound up with concerns that this new life stage will be fraught with ever-present drama, the truth is that this is just another stage of your life which you will get through as much as you did toddlerhood long ago.


Remember the media presents teenagers inaccurately. Teens and their lives are often very narrowly portrayed on TV, movies, and literature. Be careful on basing your assumptions on what it is like to be an adolescent based on the Disney channel, MTV, or ""High School Musical"", as well as some of the older shows such as ""The Brady Bunch"" or ""Father's Knows Best.""These are typically fictional stories that while may dramatize aspects of secondary education, may not be your reality. Likewise, be careful of comparing yourself or others to actors in teenage dramas. Often these actors are in their 20s, sometimes even 30s, atypically model-like, spectacularly talented, and otherwise not necessarily be like your reality. The homemade videos on YouTube that feature actual teenagers are far more realistic and accurate than the movies and TV. Many teen movies, especially the older ones, have become nostalgia films for adults (e.g. ""The Breakfast Club"") and many shows on Disney and Nickelodeon are designed for children.

, There are 6 years between 13 and 19, and there are a lot of differences between them. Middle school is different than high school, which is different than beginning the adult work world, college, or trade school. The awkward, lanky 13 year old may be a confident military-bound individual at 18.

, For lots of people, the teenage years are full of worries—stop paying so much attention to them! Many worries are based on what other people think (e.g., ""What if they don't like me after this?"" or ""What if my mom gets mad that I don't study medicine like she wants?""), rather than what you think. Go ahead and do what you want to do, without factoring in the opinion of others; dye your hair a wacky color, wear what's comfortable and not what's trendy, call your crush, choose your own path in life, and don't worry about what others think of your choices! At the end of the day, it's your life, so live it the way you want to.


Of course, there are some limits to this. You may want to speak your mind, for example, and it's okay to have your opinions, but you don't want to offend people or start an argument in an inappropriate place. Some social rules, such as not hitting annoying people, are important to follow. Learn when it's important to listen to social rules, and not what you think.

, When you were younger, people always told you to find hobbies, and chances are, you have at least a few basic interests that you can engage in. Use these to your advantage. Can you pick something you want to practice and dedicate more time towards (e.g., playing an instrument), or delve into a subcategory of your interest (for example, moving from simple writing to writing poetry or literature)? Don't be afraid to try new things. It's never too late to check out a new interest, and, who knows, maybe you'll even find your life passion by doing so!


Consider ""balancing"" your interests so that you have a wide variety. For example, if your biggest hobby is computer programming, maybe try a more art-oriented hobby like painting, or learn a language. Just because you're a ""tech nerd"" or an ""art geek"" doesn't mean your interests have to stick firmly in that area. It's boring to have interests that are only in one area.
Explore your style and your interests. Now is the time to experiment; don't feel the need to stick to just one niche. From fashion to hobbies to music and movies, you can explore all kinds of possible interests. Don't feel bound by tradition or labels: if you like to dress like someone who likes rock music, and you really love country music, that's fine. Do what you enjoy.

, Even if you think you're not prejudiced, sometimes negative thoughts about groups of people can root in your mind. Buried prejudices against religious groups, racial groups, LGBT groups, and so on, can taint your ability to see the world clearly; let go of these. Nobody is exactly like a stereotype, and seeing groups of people as ""just like those other ones"" inhibits knowing people for who they truly are.


On a smaller scale, stop thinking badly about people you've had bad experiences with. Unless this person has caused you physical and/or mental harm, they're probably not as bad as you think they are. And if all you know about this person comes from outside sources and not the person themselves, you don't even know if those rumors are true! You don't have to be BFFs with them, but be civil and respectful to them; maybe even try being friendly. They might surprise you and be much different than your image of them!

, Yes, school can be very hard work, but in your teenage years, it matters more than ever. What you accomplish in your teen years may determine in large part your opportunities in your adult life. Dedicate some time to studying and do your best to do well in middle school and high school. Aim to get things done as soon as possible instead of procrastinating. Learn how to prioritize, whether it's with school, work, or any extracurricular activities you may be involved in. Boost your studying skills (and even make it fun!). It may not seem enjoyable, but it's helpful later on in life, and some teens—not only the nerds—do find it enjoyable!


You don't have to be an all-A's student that's taking only Honors or AP-level classes, but you should at least do your best to pass the classes you're in. Avoid slacking off, as this hurts your grades.
Don't rush on your homework because you want to hang out with friends—work on it to learn new things. A largely forgotten fact is that school is meant for learning, not trapping you in a classroom for a few hours each day.

, Your teenage years are hectic, ever-changing, and chances are, your interests will constantly shift and change. Nothing about yourself is set in stone, even at the end of your teenage years. You will continue to grow and develop as a person as long as you're alive. There's no need to figure yourself out and decide what you are at your age. Anyone who tells you that you need to figure out what college you're going to or what you plan for the future is wrong. Even if you think you've decided on what you're going to do, don't be surprised if your plans change—you never know where life is going to take you.

, Some teens have trouble with social interaction, with the reasons behind it varying. Since social interaction is necessary in order to succeed, it's important to learn how to cope with shyness and social anxiety. Consider working with a friend or a family member of close age to develop your social skills. It may not replace new social exchanges, but it's good practice.


Autistic teens and other disabilities/mental illnesses such as ADHD or social anxiety disorder, may have notable difficulty with social interaction. If you're an autistic teen, try learning how to develop better social skills, read other people's body language, and understand figurative language and sarcasm—it's important to learn how to interact in a neurotypical world. If you have ADHD or related disorder, you can learn to not interrupt others, dominate the conversation, focus on the other person or task at hand, etc.

, Every day, you'll likely see people you don't know, whether it be in school or out in public. It may seem funny to make fun of those that you don't know, but it's rude, and word will get back to them eventually. Later in life, you'll have to work with people you don't know; it's best to be polite towards strangers. If you can manage it, be friendly as well. It's appreciated by those around you, even if you don't see it.


If somebody you don't know has a clumsy moment that makes others laugh at them, such as dropping their books everywhere, don't laugh, and instead help them pick them up if you have the time. It's a nice thing to do, and they will likely appreciate it, even though they may not show it.

, You don't need to be at the top of the social food chain and know everybody at school, but you should at least try to have a few loyal friends throughout your teenage years. Friendships are a good place to build your social skills, and building stable relationships with others can help you determine what you want in friendships and romantic relationships you may pursue. And most importantly of all, life is simply easier and brighter with friends. Make sure your friends make you feel good about yourself and don't get you in trouble—you want to enjoy your teen years, not spend them miserable because of your ""friends""!


Find friends who make you feel good and inspire you to be your best.
Hang out with friends you really like, and worry less about maintaining relationships with people who don't improve your life. Friends come and go, and you may have different types and numbers of friends. That's okay. How many friends you have isn't important; it's the quality of the friends you do have that matters, as cliché as that sounds!
If you struggle to find friends, try looking in areas where people are similar to you. Are you LGBT, for example? See if there's a teen LGBT group in your city, or if your school has a GSA that you could join. If you prefer writing over socializing, see if you can find writer's groups. If you're autistic, try seeking out other autistic people to befriend.
Try going on social media if you can't find friends face-to-face. However, be very careful with this. Online friendships develop much differently than face-to-face friendships, and many people online are not who they say they are—you never know what goes on behind the screen. Sometimes it may not be even an actual human you are talking to. Exercise caution when making friends online, and never agree to meet up with somebody in private. Avoid giving out personal information to people you meet online unless you are sure that they can be trusted. It is best to meet people in real life first before meeting them on the internet.

, Some—but not all—teens are interested in romantic relationships, and may want to find a partner. If you get into a relationship, take it slowly and communicate with your partner well. This leads to the healthiest relationships in the long run. You don't need to be tethered to your partner, either. Make sure the relationship allows the both of you to have your own friends and interests. You don't need to rush into anything before you're ready.


If your relationship ends, it's not the end of the world. You may be tempted to swear off of dating forever, especially if you were badly hurt, but keep an open mind. People grow and change. A relationship that would have worked six months ago may turn out to be extremely destructive now. And remember, few couples stay together during or after high school, whether it's because of long distance or other factors.
Be wary of abusive relationships. If you feel like you have to constantly walk on eggshells around your partner to try and avoid them getting angry at you or hitting you, or if you can't talk to anybody else without your partner accusing you of cheating, these are huge red flags that the relationship is unhealthy and that you need to get out of it! The same applies for toxic friendships.

, Family members—especially parents—probably worry about you during your teenage years. Many teenagers become sullen, withdrawn, and stop valuing family as much as they used to. Try to avoid this. Family is one of the most important connections in your life—it's the building blocks for all relationships you develop, whether they're friendships, romantic relationships, or a family that you choose to have later on in life. And plus, you see them every day—why not make it nice to spend time with them?


You don't have to be best friends with everyone in your family, but be kind to them and spend time with them once in a while; play a video game with your sister, help your brother with his writing, offer to go on a walk with your mom, or play a board game with your dad. Don't just stay in your room all day and only see your family at meals.
Improve your relationship with your siblings. It's fine to argue and bicker with siblings here and there, but remember that your sibling relationship is usually one of the longest in your life. Siblings can be great allies, mentors, and friends, not just now, but also when you're old and grey.
Watch out for abusive family members. Your family can be some of the closest friends you have, but they can also negatively impact your life. If your parents constantly make you feel down, they may be emotionally abusing you. If your brother constantly hits you, that's a sign of physical abuse. Usually, talking things out with a close friend or confronting your abuser can lessen the hurt, but know when to report child abuse.
Keep close to your extended family, such as your cousins, too; make an effort to spend time with them when you can. You probably don't see your extended family often, so take advantage of the time you do have to hang out with them!

, You may not be interested in volunteering or attaining a job—that's okay. Helping out others is only a recommendation. However, many volunteers report that their work makes them feel good; some volunteer work can even help with self-development. Consider the benefits and drawbacks of volunteer work or jobs, and use this to decide whether you'll help others out.

, You don't have to get a job when you're a teenager—and when you're under a certain age, it's nearly impossible to find one—but that doesn't mean that you're unable to help out! Consider volunteering, doing odd jobs for others, or helping someone to learn something they don't know. This can do wonders to help other people! It will be helpful for future employment after college to have a job or volunteer so you can have valuable work experience.

.

Volunteering doesn't have to happen outside of the home. If you have an internet connection, you can volunteer online—for example, editing wikiHow articles about your favorite subjects.

, Are you interested in animals? Volunteer at an animal shelter or collect supplies for your local non-profit shelter. Are you good with people? Find a job or volunteer work that's oriented around talking to others. Can you design complex web pages with minimal effort? Offer to help others learn web design. Take your talents and interests and find something you can do based around those. It can be a great help to volunteer or work, and have fun at the same time!

, If one of your talents is that you're an all-A's scholar, see if there's a program at your school that allows you to tutor struggling students. If not, try asking families that have younger kids or advertising a tutoring service—you may get some great opportunities!


It's okay to turn down a tutoring offer. If you can't tutor the neighbor's son because he's too loud and disruptive, or if you aren't good at a subject that somebody needs help with, it's okay to politely say, ""I'm sorry, I can't do that job"" or ""I don't think your child and I work together very well"".
You can either choose to get paid for tutoring or do it for free. If you do choose to make it a job, however, don't overcharge. Few people will hire you if you charge ten dollars an hour!

, Some organizations will host activities to donate to certain causes—for example, walks to support cancer research collect money and donate it to groups that do cancer research. Other activities seek to spread awareness of illnesses, or acceptance of disabled people. Consider participating in these.


Be sure you know what group the activity is supporting. Some groups are well known for being surrounded by controversy. Do careful research on an organization before participating in any of their events. You don't want to support something that causes more harm than good.

, You don't need to participate in giant volunteer organizations to make a difference. Consider doing basic things to help people have a brighter day—compliment your classmate's poem, tell someone they look fantastic, help somebody pick up their things if they drop them, hold the door open for others who are struggling to carry things, and so forth. Something that seems little to you can turn someone else's entire day around. Get out there, and help to make the world a better place by making others' lives more enjoyable!

Make sure the doctors you need are covered under the plan.,
Look at what health conditions the provider covers.,
Consider what procedures the provider covers.,
Compare the PPO plan with other kinds of coverage (HMOs, for example).,
Ask questions.",How to Choose a PPO1," While PPOs typically have more extensive networks than HMOs, it is important to see if any of your preferred providers are not on the list. With some doctors that you see only once a year, you may be willing to switch. But with a doctor or therapist you see regularly, you may want them to be in-network, as that can save you a lot of money.Typically you should ask the provider and look up the information through your insurance's online service (assuming it provides one). However, you may need to navigate certain hurdles after the initial questions if your doctor is part of multiple medical groups, if the doctor but not the clinic is covered, or if the doctor accepts different insurance at different practices.You can find out if your doctor is in-network if you look up the doctor on your insurance website. You can also ask the doctor's office.;
, Some plans don’t cover hearing aids or hearing loss, for instance, while others do. In any case, if you have particular needs, you should take a look at what each plan covers. It could save you a lot of money in the long run.You should consider whether your provider covers prescriptions, testing supplies, or other potential medical products specific to your conditions.

, Just as with conditions, what procedures a plan includes is vitally important. Some PPOs don’t cover tonsillectomies, for instance. While you may not know what you might need in the future, talk with a doctor to determine your potential need for a particular procedure and consider the PPO’s plan., There are several advantages to having a PPO plan, such as being able to choose your own doctor without having to go through your primary provider. In terms of in-network coverage, PPOs tend to have more options than HMOs. Knowing how PPOs compare both with each other and with other kinds of plans will help you make the best decision for you and your family. Other types of plans besides PPOs are described below:An HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) is a provider plan that has more limited options than a PPO. It also is more focused on prevention and may require you to live in a particular area to be eligible.
An EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization) is a plan where you are only covered if you go to in-network doctors. Emergencies are excepted.
A POS (Point of Service) is a plan where you may pay less for in-network doctors for care, but it requires a referral to go to a specialist, whereas PPOs do not.

, Before deciding on a plan, you'll want to talk to the insurance provider. Some of these questions would include what the plans cover (""Does the plan cover newborn care?"" or ""Does it cover prescription drugs?""), how much it costs (""What is the premium? What's the out-of-pocket maximum?""), and what doctors and hospitals it covers, (""Is my gynecologist, Dr. Smith, covered?"")."

Talk to her about any important family information before you arrive.,
Offer to help do the dishes and aid with small tasks.,
Keep physical contact PG rated, but don't feel like you must avoid it completely.,
Be yourself instead of trying to be a ""perfect"" partner.,
Embrace the culture and atmosphere of her family with an open mind.",How to Act at a Girl's House2," You don't need an encyclopedia on the family, but you should know if there are any topics to avoid around the dinner table. Be inquisitive -- what do her parents do? what hobbies do they enjoy? are there any special circumstances to be aware of? Showing you care enough to ask questions will make everyone's experience much smoother.


Does she know any common ground you might have with her family or places where you might naturally find conversation?
Is there anything you can bring as a small ""thank you"" gift? While a bottle of wine is the classic choice, it won't go over well if they don't drink or you're a minor.

, Even if they refuse, it is the thought that counts. To be a truly considerate guest, just start helping clear the table once dinner is over, taking the initiative and showing your respect. While you aren't there to become a temporary handyman, just asking if you can lend a hand will go a long way., It will look a little strange if you're suddenly distant with your girl. While you don't want to be lewd, holding her hand occasionally or putting an arm around her is a simple, sweet way to show your affection.


Check in with her if you think her family would frown on any physical contact. If you're in doubt, let her initiate anything and just follow her lead., You're going to be nervous or stressed, and that is okay. But don't convince yourself that you need to shape your behavior to become a ""perfect"" partner -- they don't exist. Mind your manners, introduce yourself with a smile and firm handshake, and then be yourself. Imagine you're meeting a professor or teacher for the first time, or a new business contact, instead of your potential in-laws.


Tell stories about yourself, be honest about your goals and hopes, and don't be afraid to crack a low-key joke or two if it feels right. Stop second-guessing every action and just be yourself., If a new food is put in front of you, try it with a smile. When the family has a moment of prayer, bow your head respectfully, even if you don't share their faith. Your overriding principle is to just ""go with the flow."" You are being welcomed into their family, so accept that invitation with open arms.


The more you learn about a girl's family, the more you also learn about her.
This doesn't mean you need to lie or change your personal beliefs in order to fit in. It simply means trying to listen and learn instead of making things about you."

Help out with general house chores and maintenance.,
Defer to her preferences when tending the house.,
Discuss a fair way to split any expenses, such as food, early on.,
Establish ground rules about any specific living quirks or desires.,
Talk openly and honestly about any romantic expectations.,
Treat her house with respect, not like your personal property.",How to Act at a Girl's House3," If you're going to be a good house guest, you need to help out around the house. Most importantly, don't wait for her to ask you to do something if you notice it needs to be done. Staying with someone requires both sides to work together to keep the space happy and livable. Some chores to look out for include:


Watering plants
Doing dishes
Washing sheets, blankets, and towels
Tending to pets
Vacuuming.

, There are going to be some things that she likes a particular way, even if they don't make sense to you. Maybe her spice rack is particularly organized for easy cooking, or she likes the towels folded particularly. Everyone, including you, has little quirks and preferences for your living conditions -- so be sure to respect hers. Being considerate is not so much about the spice rack or the towels. It is about understanding her personal space and preferences.


She likely has her things in very particular orders and places -- be respectful and ask questions when storing your own stuff.
You may have ways of doing things you may think are ""better"" or ""more logical,"" but remember that this isn't your house. At the end of the day, her preferences for her stuff take priority., If you're staying at her house, you should be willing to help cover at least some of the expenses, particularly food. While she may have it covered, she may also want to split rent or utilities, depending on how long you'll be staying. Don't just assume that ""everything's good."" Make a point to ask her about finances before unsaid arguments become a problem.


Talking about money is never fun, but it is essential to preserve a strong, healthy relationship.

, Maybe she needs a little quiet time when she gets home from work. Perhaps you both really like to shower before leaving, but need to work out a way that you both have enough time. The best way to handle these situations is to talk about them as they come up -- finding compromise early on instead of waiting until one of you is upset. Common things to cover include:


Who does what chores or house maintenance tasks?
Etiquette for inviting other people over for visits/dinner/hanging out/etc.
Your usual routines, including sleep schedules, and how to be respectful of them., Talking about romance may be the least romantic thing you can do, but it is absolutely necessary. Whether you're sharing a bed with a partner or just friends living together, sit down and talk about physical intimacy together early on.


If you're a couple, think about how often you'd like to be together and promise each other to be honest about your mood and feelings. If one of you says no, remind each other that is a firm no, not something to be negotiated.
If you're just friends, talk about when and how it is acceptable to bring someone home with you, and the etiquette about dating and the house.

, Staying with someone for a long time, whether you're dating them or not, tends to lead to some relaxed ""rules"" and ideas. But just because you get comfortable in the house doesn't mean it is suddenly yours -- all of your basic manners still apply. Clean up any of your messes, put things back where they belong, and respect her rules and preferences and you should be more than okay. How to act at a girl's house is about being a considerate, kind person -- it's not rocket science.


Keep in mind that you're in her house, meaning your footprint is going to impact her directly. If, for example, you know that she pays the water bill, don't take 30-minute showers.

Brush your pet's hair regularly.,
Keep the brushing positive.",How to Maintain a Pet's Hair1," Consider the length of the fur. If the animal has relatively long fur then you will have to brush their fur more often. A pet owner should brush their pets regularly because it helps get rid of knots and dirt. It also helps spread natural oils through the fur that help the fur keep a healthy shine.;
, The sessions should be a positive interaction between owner and pet. You can give your pet treats before, during, or after to make brushing seem like a reward. If your pet has knots brush carefully so brushing is not associated with pain.

Do the math.,
Consider copays and deductibles, as well as the premiums.,
Consider enrolling in a health savings account (HSA).,
Consider cost versus potential benefits.,
Consider in-network and out-of-network costs when choosing a plan.",How to Choose a PPO2," While the premiums are higher and there is usually a deductible, you have a broader range of choices for providers with PPOs than with HMOs. However, if you need to see an out-of-network provider, your costs will be lower with a PPO than with an HMO. Consider also whether the higher premium fits in with your budget in regards to how much you're getting in return and whether you’ll save money. Different PPOs will have different rates and different deductibles.For instance if a PPO has a higher deductible (e.g., $1000) and premium (e.g., $200/mo) than an HMO (e.g.,$500 and $100/mo respectively), but your specialist is covered under the PPO and not the HMO, you may save money by going with the PPO. If your specialist's bill is $5000, for instance, then you would pay $5000 under the HMO, because the provider is out of network. With the PPO, you would pay the deductible of $1000, thereby saving you $4000.

, There are different levels of PPOs with different benefits. Generally the higher the premium, the lower the copays and deductibles. Again, though, you need to determine whether in your yearly budget it is worthwhile to pick a higher premium plan.For instance if one plan has a low copay ($10-20) but a higher deductible (more than $2000), it may be better for a healthy person than a plan with a higher copay ($40) and a lower deductible (less than $2000), which might be better for a person who knows they may need surgeries or other expensive care., An HSA is a good way to help you cover the costs not covered by your PPO. It allows you to save money specifically for medical expenses. Besides, enrolling often has many benefits through the insurance company, including discounted rates.In order to sign up for an HSA, you need to have a High Deductible Insurance Plan (HDIP), which can be a PPO.Your employer may offer the HSA, or you may be able to go through your bank or credit union., While PPOs often are more flexible than other plans, consider the flexibility of each PPO. The premiums are also usually higher than other plans. By looking at the specific plans you will have a better sense of whether what they offer is worth it.While PPOs may provide more flexibility (more doctors in-network), they may come with a higher deductible, a higher out-of-pocket maximum, and a higher premium than other plans. Be sure to look closely at these figures, and if you are receiving a lot of expensive care, weigh the deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, co-pays, and premiums before deciding on a PPO., Different PPOs cover different doctors, procedures, etc. You’ll need to know what each plan offers, and whether it is worth your while given your current health plan to enroll in any particular PPO. One of the advantages of a PPO is that it often covers a percentage of out-of-network providers, where a lot of other plans don't cover out-of-network providers at all. If you know you'll need a lot of flexibility for your healthcare (you have a rare or dangerous condition), you may want to look to see what percentage of out-of-network coverage is provided. For instance some plans may only cover 50% of out-of-network services, while covering 80% of in-network."

Watch your stress levels.",How to Check Your Health by Poop or Stool Colors," These could both potentially be a sign of something going wrong in your digestive system. Both black and bright red stool could be an indicator of bleeding somewhere in the intestines, or from something more minor like hemorrhoids.Bleeding from the small intestines usually produces melena, or black, tarry stools. Bleeding that originates in lower gastrointestinal tract (such as bleeding from hemorrhoids) usually results in bright red blood.
There are other minor factors like diet and medications that could color stools black and red, but if you are concerned, it’s always best to talk to your healthcare provider.;
, Bile contributes to the coloring of stool, so this lack of color could actually indicate the absence of bile. This could mean there’s something blocking a bile duct, which could potentially be an indicator for a serious medical problem. If you ever notice white or light colored stools, make sure you talk to your doctor right away.White stools to usually result from steatorrhea (excretions of fat) which can may indicate pancreatic issues.

, While stool colors can range from browns to yellows to greens and still be considered “normal” and healthy, a medium brown color is the most common in healthy stool. It should be about the same color as a chocolate bar.Stool turns brown through a complicated process in the digestive tract. Basically, the color comes from the protein hemoglobin being broken down to create bilirubin in the liver.

, Food coloring, leafy vegetables, and even beets can tint stool different colors. This is normal. For example, eating leafy green veggies like kale or spinach could give your stool a green color, and eating beets could potentially turn stool a reddish color. This shouldn’t be cause for alarm, especially if you’ve recently eaten these foods.Only rarely is red stool a serious indicator of an issue in the intestine. Even bright red stool could simply be caused by bleeding from minor and common conditions like hemorrhoids.

, If you notice your stool is yellow in color (steatorrhea), this could be a sign of a lack of fat absorption in your digestive track. There are many things that could cause problems with absorbing fats, so if this yellow stool persists for more than two days, give your doctor a call.Yellow stool that is also especially smelly or greasy could also be a sign of a problem with or allergy to gluten. Your doctor can confirm whether or not this is the cause., Many medications, from vitamin supplements to anti-diarrheal medications to prescription medications, can cause changes in stool color. These color changes are normal when associated with the use of those medications, so make sure to read the warning or side effects label on anything you take on a regular basis.Iron supplements could potentially turn your stool green or black, while bismuth subsalicylate (the anti-diarrheal found in Pepto Bismol) can also turn stool black.

, In the first few days after birth, it’s completely normal for some black stool to show up in your baby’s diaper. This will pass within 2-4 days, after the baby has gotten all of the meconium out of its body. It will likely transition into an earthy green color after that, and it will stay a mushy consistency.Your baby’s poop while breastfeeding will likely be mushy, and either a green or yellow color. This is normal.
Formula-fed babies will probably have mushy stool that is more brown than babies that are breastfed, but this is perfectly normal as well.

, Even though these colorations could be caused by dietary changes or medications, these colors could also be indicators of blood in the intestinal tract. If you have blood in your stool, or are actively bleeding when you have a bowel movement, seek medical attention as soon as possible.If your stool is bright red or black and you recently ingested anti-diarrheal medications, food with red dye in it, or started a new medication, make an appointment with your doctor to make sure the change in your stool color isn’t indicating anything more serious. Your doctor will run various tests on your stool like a fecal occult blood test to determine the cause.

, Most of the time, changes in stool color can be explained by treatable conditions, or simply by dietary causes. It’s unlikely that a change in your stool color is cause for a trip to the emergency room, or even for any panic.Always check for recent changes in your diet or side effects of medications if your stool color changes suddenly.

, Regardless of the cause, if you are concerned about your stool or changes in your digestion, your safest and most effective method of treatment should be to seek advice from your doctor. A doctor will be able to identify for certain if there is anything to worry about, or if what you’re dealing with is normal.Even if it might feel embarrassing or make you feel anxious to talk about your bowel movements, it’s important to bring them up with your doctor if you are concerned. It’s always better to play it safe and get a medical opinion.

, If the change in color is associated with abdominal pain or sudden diarrhea, for example, it could be a sign of something more than just a dietary change. If your stool color change is associated with any other sudden symptoms, see your doctor.


Black or red diarrhea, for example, could be a sign of a serious condition and should be addressed immediately., By keeping yourself well hydrated, you can help the process of digestion happen smoothly and easily. Water can help soften stool and help you avoid issues like constipation. It can also help you absorb certain nutrients more efficiently from the food you take in.Try keeping a water bottle with you at all times. Refill it whenever you finish it, and try to drink around 1 to 2 liters (0.3 to 0.5 US gal) of fluids every day., A healthy diet isn’t just defined by what you eat, but also by how often and how quickly you eat it. In order to make sure your digestion takes place as smoothly as possible, try to eat slowly. Don’t rush and eat too quickly. This can potentially cause stomach upset. Try to eat smaller meals throughout the day rather than overeating in one sitting.Naturally, what you eat does matter! Try foods with high fiber content, like fruits and vegetables. Try to make half of your plate vegetables at every meal. Also, try your best to lower or limit your intake of things like processed foods, and alcohol., Maintaining a regular exercise routine can promote overall health. In terms of your digestive health specifically, exercise can actually help strengthen the muscles in your abdomen and trigger the digestive process. Try fitting in a brisk walk or light jog at least a few times a week.You can also fit exercise into your everyday routine by taking simple steps such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or picking the far parking spot rather than the one right by the door.
Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week, or 150 minutes total.

, Stress can wreak havoc on your body, and really do a number on your digestive process. Stress can cause constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and even loss of appetite. If you have high stress levels, try to find a de-stressing method that works for you, like daily meditation, or eliminating unnecessary triggers of stress."

Get a small metal can.This can will be used to contain water that will be heated as part of the calorimetric measurements.,
Get a larger metal can.,
Puncture four small holes in the small can.Using a hole punch, ice pick, or other implement, carefully puncture four small holes (each one directly across from another) in the small metal can.,
Slide two thin rods between the four holes in the can.Slide one rod through the can to the other side, then repeat with the other rod and the two remaining holes; the two rods should cross each other.,
Fill the small can with water.Using a graduated cylinder, flask, or other container, pour 100 mL of distilled water in the small metal can.

,
Measure the temperature of the water.Using a mercury thermometer (not a digital one), take the initial temperature of your water.,
Place the small can inside of the larger one.The small metal can should rest securely inside the larger one, supported by the rods made of glass or another nonflammable material.,
Unfold a paperclip and insert one end into a cork.A standard-size paperclip will be used to hold the food inside the calorimeter.,
Obtain some food to test.Weigh the food using an accurate scale, and record the measurement.,
Prepare the cork food holder.Carefully wrap the end of the paperclip that is not sticking in the cork around the food you will test (or pierce it with the paperclip).

,
Light the food.Set the cork on a flat, nonflammable surface so that the food on the paperclip is sticking up.,
Let the food burn.Keep the cans over the food for as long as it takes to burn completely.,
Check the temperature of the water.Once the food has completely burned out, stir the water in the small can using the thermometer.,
Weigh the burnt food.Once the burnt food has cooled completely, remove it from the paperclip.,
Understand the formula you will need to calculate calories.The formula used to determine the caloric value of a sample of food using a homemade calorimeter is relatively simple: calories = volume of water (in mL) x the temperature change (in Celsius) of the water.,
Gather the data you need to calculate.,
Calculate the calories contained in the food.",How to Build a Calorimeter," Any small metal can will work, such as those used to package vegetables, or a soda can.Make sure that it is empty, clean, and open on one end. If you are using a soda can, the opening used for drinking out of the can will suffice.
, You will need a second metal can, large enough that the small metal can will fit inside it with room to spare. Any larger metal can will work, such as a coffee can. Make sure that it is empty, clean, and open on both ends.

, Position the holes just below the rim of the open end of the can., These rods will be used to support the small can in the calorimeter. Temperature-resistant glass rods are ideal. If you do not have any, try any kind of sturdy, nonflammable rod.,, You may need to leave the thermometer in the water for some time so that it can get an accurate reading of the water (which may change temperature as it adjusts to room temperature).


Leave the thermometer in the water; you will need it to take another reading later.

,, Completely unfold the paperclip so that it forms a single long strand. Insert one end of the strand into the cork. Make sure it can stand upright with the unfolded paperclip sticking up.

, You will only need a small amount of the food. Good choices include a shelled peanut, potato chip, or other high-fat food.

,, Light the food, using a butane lighter or other device. As soon as it catches fire, place the cans over it.


Be very careful lighting the food and placing the cans over it so that you don’t burn yourself.

, As the food burns, it will heat the water in the small can that is suspending in the large can.

Carefully watch the food as it burns. If it goes out quickly, before the food burns completely, relight it.

, Record the temperature of the heated water.


Be careful moving or touching the calorimeter, as the cans and other parts may be very hot.

, Weigh it again, and record the measurement.,, If you filled the small can with exactly 100 mL of distilled water, then you already know the volume of water (100 mL). If you recorded the initial temperature of the water, and its temperature after the food was burned, you can determine the temperature change by subtracting the smaller value from the larger.

For instance, if the water in the can was initially 35 degrees Celsius, then 39 degrees Celsius after the food was burned, then you have a temperature change of 4 degrees (39-35 = 4).

, Using the formula and the data you collected, determine how many calories were in the food you analyzed.

For instance, if you had a temperature change of 4 degrees, then the food contained 400 calories (400 = 100 mL x 4, using the formula calories = volume of water x the temperature change of the water)
To determine Kcal of the food, multiply the temperature change of the water by the volume of water in liters.Using the example above, the sample would contain 0.4 Kcal (0.4 Kcal = 0.100 L water x 4)

Do what’s best for you.",How to Break Nicotine Gum Addiction," You’re hopefully not smoking anymore if you’re chewing nicotine gum. But, you are still addicted to nicotine and its stimulant effects. That means cravings. Physical cravings usually last less than five minutes, so try to wait them out by distracting yourself, delaying the urge, or engaging in an activity.One tip is to take 10 deep breaths (or count to 10), walk to the sink for a glass of cold water, and slowly drink it until the craving passes.
Try going for a walk, washing dishes or cleaning, or gardening. Call a friend for support or meditate.
Or, keep an interesting book with you. Pick up the book with a pen or highlighter and read when you feel a craving, taking notes and occupying your mind.;
, You might be surprised to learn that only a small number of nicotine gum users meet the standard of physical addiction. This doesn’t mean you don’t have a habit, and some users do get withdrawal symptoms. But it’s more likely that your habit is psychological. You might be chewing because you feel anxious, nervous, or out of sorts without it.Constant chewing of nicotine gum may be an oral fixation for you. Try something else in its place, like gum without nicotine or a peppermint.
Try chewing on ice shards, mastic gum (made from plant resin), or honeycomb.
You can also engage your mouth by eating a healthy snack. Chew on some carrots, celery, or cucumber.
Keep in mind that chewing tobacco is NOT a good alternative, as it has many of the same cancer-causing ingredients as cigarettes., The human brain is crafty and can justify just about anything. You may find yourself thinking, “What’s the harm in just one piece today?” This is a rationalization and can derail your efforts to quit. Learn to spot these thoughts and suppress them.A rationalization is an excuse. It is an attempt to create reasons for doing something you know, deep-down, you really shouldn’t do. It is a form of self-deception.
Watch out for rationalizations like, “What’s the harm in just one?” “I’m in control; I can stop any time I want,” “Today is an exception, I’m having a really stressful day,” or “Chewing is my only way of coping.”
When you recognize a rationalization, remind yourself why you want to quit chewing in the first place. Review your reasons. Write them down and carry them in your pocket, if need be.

, Studies show that regular exercise can reduce the negative effects of nicotine withdrawal. Working out will blunt your cravings and release feel-good endorphins, but also focus your mind on the activity and away from the gum. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise.Do exercises you enjoy. This might be walking, running, swimming, cycling, or weight training.
Consider joining an exercise class, like yoga, pilates, or aerobic dance.
You might even take up a team sport in a rec league, like basketball, hockey, or softball.

, Everyone who’s hooked on nicotine knows that they have weak moments — things, experiences, places, or people that will trigger your craving for nicotine. And certain times and places are worse than others. Do you have more cravings when you’re with smoker friends, for example, or socializing at a bar? These are your high-risk situations.These triggers could cause you not only to chew gum when you're trying to quit, but even start smoking again.
Avoid, avoid, avoid. Spend your work breaks somewhere else if you get cravings while your friends smoke. If you get cravings at bars, go out less frequently or find alternate venues like coffee shops.
Do you have the urge to chew after meals? Since you still have to eat, consider chewing on a toothpick instead.
If you find you want to chew or smoke when you're stressed, bored, or anxious, it is important you find more productive ways to relieve these feelings. Try journaling about how you are feeling to relieve anxiety. Pick up a new hobby to prevent boredom and keep your brain occupied so you don't have time to think about cravings.

, Talk to trusted friends and family and ask them to be there for moral support and encouragement. Let them know what you’re going through. They should be only too happy to help you.You might ask your supporters for specific things. For instance, you could ask them not to smoke or use nicotine products around you. They might be able to have your favorite healthy snack around whenever you visit.
You may also just want a sympathetic ear. Ask if you can vent or call them if you’re in a moment of weakness.

, Arm yourself with more support than just family and friends. There are plenty of smoking and nicotine cessation support groups available. Find one and share your experiences with other people who know exactly what you’re going through.


Look online or in the phone book for smoking and nicotine support groups in your area. Call for more information or go to a first meeting in person. There may also be online support groups held in chat rooms if you can't physically get to a meeting.
For example, Nicotine Anonymous is a non-profit, 12-step program on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous.Organizations like the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institutes of Health can also provide you with listings of support groups., Your nicotine gum habit is either a psychological or physical dependence, maybe both, and might qualify as an addiction. Try setting up an appointment with a therapist or counselor who deals with addiction if you are serious about quitting, and she can help you kick it once and for all.A counselor will offer you strategies to cope. For example, she might have you try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT. This will teach you to recognize your problematic behavior and to learn better alternatives.Your therapist might have you talk about how gum chewing affects your life, for example, and its pros and cons. She can also teach you to moderate your cravings and avoid those “high-risk” situations to avoid a setback.

, Doctors prescribe nicotine gum as a short-term smoking cessation aid. They normally do not advise anyone to use it for more than one to two months. Even as part of longer treatment for ex-smokers, nicotine gum is not designed for use beyond 12 months.People who chew for long periods of time often report chronic jaw pain.
Nicotine gum still has stimulant properties that narrow blood veins, raise your heart rate, and increase your blood pressure. Users may therefore be at higher risk for heart palpitations and chest pain.
Nicotine affects your immune system, increases risk of cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. It can predispose you to metabolic syndrome (which increases your risk of diabetes), affect your reproductive health, and more., We definitely know that smoking cigarettes causes cancer. So can chewing tobacco, another product that contains nicotine. Some studies with lab animals suggest that long-term use of nicotine in general and in gum may elevate your risk of cancer, too.Nicotine gum is quite different from smoking, however. It delivers the drug slowly through the tissue in your mouth and enters your bloodstream much more slowly, at much lower doses, and doesn’t contain the same ingredients as tobacco.
The risk of cancer from gum is also not proven. While nicotine is very addictive and even poisonous in high doses, scientists haven’t shown so far that it can cause cancer by itself.
Be aware that the science is unclear. Chewing nicotine gum may be harmful, but we really don’t know yet. However, the risk on the whole is lower than in smoking., Many people who chew nicotine gum aren’t necessarily addicted, at least physically. They do it because they are afraid of having a setback and going back to smoking. This is a pretty good reason to continue to chew. In the end, though, you’ll have to decide for yourself.


Ask yourself whether you are ready to give up chewing nicotine gum and feel safe that you won’t fall back on cigarettes.
Weigh the pros and cons. If need be, write them down to map out how nicotine gum affects your life, positively and negatively.
Above all, know that, according to what we know, smoking cigarettes is far more dangerous than chewing nicotine gum.

Understand the risks.",How to Buy a Cardiac Stress Testing System," The main component of an exercise-based cardiac stress system is some sort of exercise machine. The two main options are a treadmill or a stationary bike.Both are commonly used in hospitals and clinics, but there are pros and cons to each type of machine. For example, gripping the railing of the treadmill too tightly or leaning against it for support can skew the results of a cardiac stress test.As the cardiac test progresses, the speed and incline of the treadmill increases, whereas the pedal resistance increases on a stationary bike. Both are automatically controlled.
Treadmills are easy to get on and off when not in motion, but trying to stop, get off or accidentally tripping while the treadmill is in motion can cause injury.
Stationary bikes are a little more difficult to mount and get off of, but more stable and less likely to cause an injury due to some accident. Bikes are also typically half the cost (or less) compared to treadmills.;
, An ECG is a diagnostic tool used to assess the electrical and muscular functions of the heart.The heart's electrical activity (contractions, rate and rhythms) are measured by electrodes placed on the skin — typically 6 placed across the chest over the heart and 1 on each arm and leg for a total of 10 electrodes. The signals received from each electrode are recorded and shown on a computer monitor, and printed recordings of the information is actually the electrocardiogram.


ECG units are the most expensive part of a cardiac stress testing system, costing between three to five times more than the exercise equipment, on average.
While it's a relatively simple test to perform, ECG interpretation requires specialized medical training and experience. Don't attempt to use one at home if you're untrained.
Decide on the size of the print outs. ECG machines that print out 8.5 x 11 inch sheets of paper are often preferable because they are easier to handle and store — although paper costs will be higher.

, A blood pressure cuff (also called a sphygmomanometer) is also needed during a cardiac stress test in order to monitor blood pressure.Normal blood pressure should be under 120/80 (systolic/diastolic) while resting, although that can slightly increase with exercise and during the stress test.The cuff is attached to an arm during the test to make sure blood pressure doesn't get too high or too low while exercising.


Blood pressure that's too high is called hypertension, whereas hypotension is the term for blood pressure that's too low. Hypertension is usually an indicator of cardiovascular disease.
Sphygmomanometers used for cardiac testing are fully automated and inflate/deflate by themselves. The readings are recorded on a computer monitor along with the other heart measurements.

, Some cardiac stress test systems also monitor breathing rates.With these systems, a tube is attached to the mouth while the nose is plugged, and a machine records how well you breathe during the exercise. Normal resting breathing rate is between 12 – 20 breaths per minute and that's expected to rise moderately during the testing. The equipment can monitor hyperventilation, which is a reason to stop the testing.


Breathing equipment shouldn't be used on people with asthma during cardiac stress testing.
Breathing equipment and all the other accessories can be purchased at medical supply stores or ordered online from medical equipment distributors; however, you may need to prove your medical credentials before purchasing.

, Electrodes are the least expensive part of the system, but vital because they transmit electrical information of the patient's heart to the ECG and computer system.Electrodes are small, flat, sticky patches that attach to wires — they can be disposable (one-time use) or reusable. Keep in mind that 10 electrodes are used per test, so buy them in bulk or be prepared to clean/sanitize the reusable kind often.


Along with the reusable electrodes, you'll need to buy some conducting gel, alcohol swabs to clean the skin, and medical tape to attach the electrodes to the skin.
Electrodes come in different diameters, but for cardiac testing, get ones that are at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter if not a little bigger.

, A new cardiac stress testing system can easily cost upwards of $10,000 or more, although good used systems can be half that and maybe still have some warranty left. The benefits of buying new medical equipment is that it's often easier to finance and/or lease, it has more warranty and you can customize the set-up to your specific needs.Tax write-offs may also be easier. Used equipment is obviously more affordable, but maybe more difficult to finance. The systems are tested and refurbished to work perfectly, but the warranty is almost always less than new equipment.


Do an internet search for reviews and quality ratings of specific manufacturers. Compare equipment from different countries — German made is often in higher quality (and more expensive) than Chinese made, for example.
Both treadmills and stationary bikes are easy to get used, either online or from local doctors and therapists in your area. Most are only very lightly used.
If you have to cut corners to come in on budget, do so with the treadmill / bike and blood pressure cuff, but try to get the best ECG machine you can.

, There are medical equipment reps that deal with both new and used equipment. If you choose to deal with a medical rep when purchasing a cardiac stress testing system, you'll likely pay a little more to account for their commission, but you might get some good advice and be able to avoid some pitfalls.You may also have established a good relationship with a medical rep from buying other equipment, so there's an element of trust to consider. On the other hand, thanks to the internet, you can browse a wide range of equipment from around the world online without a medical rep. You'll like get a better price and not feel pressured into buying certain brands or packages.


If you buy from a medical rep you'll likely get a demonstration of your cardiac stress testing system in your office.
Medical reps are usually easier to get a hold of to troubleshoot problems compared to customer service departments with internet companies.
Although internet shopping is all about saving money, be mindful of potentially expensive shipping rates and insurance costs.

, Once you've got all your equipment, you'll need to configure and integrate it into a computer system with a monitor. Most cardiac stress testing systems include the computer and necessary software so you can clearly see how the patient is doing. Make sure to buy a system that shows all 10 leads on the same screen (in real-time) in order to avoid having to constantly switch between screens — it can be annoying and distracting. However, remember that your eyes shouldn't always be on the screen; you also need to watch the patient for any obvious changes that suggest the test should be stopped.You'll also need to buy a mobile cart to house the above-mentioned equipment and computer system — these run between $300-500 for sturdy ones. Get one with wheels so you have the freedom of moving it around the testing room.
To store on your cart, you also need to buy alcohol wipes, tissues, medical tape, conductance gel, latex medical gloves and hand sanitizer.

, Doctors usually recommend cardiac stress testing to help diagnose coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or understand its severity.CHD involves plaque build up (atherosclerosis) in the coronary arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. It leads to potential chest pain (angina), hypertension and heart attack. Signs of CHD aren't always obvious while at rest, but they become apparent with cardiac stress testing.


Another reason to get a cardiac stress test is to diagnose heart rhythm problems called arrhythmias.Arrhythmias develop when the electrical impulses coordinating the heart rhythm don't function properly — the heart then beats either too fast, too slow or irregularly.
Stress testing also helps to guide treatment for heart problems — to see how well treatment is working or to establish a different treatment plan. It can also help determine the timing of cardiac surgery (valve replacement).

, There is a lot to learn to be able to run a cardiac stress test on a patient and then to interpret the results for them. It takes significant medical training and hands-on practical experience to gain the knowledge, ability and confidence. In general, the American Hear Association states that non-doctors with the appropriate training and sufficient experience can conduct and oversee cardiac stress tests without a doctor present, but a doctor must be present when a high-risk patient is being tested.Non-doctors typically include clinical exercise physiologists, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and physiotherapists.
Doctors and non-doctors who supervise stress tests should perform at least 200 tests to establish proficiency and about 50 tests yearly to maintain proficiency.Non-doctors must be capable of screening for and identifying high-risk test patients and then alert the supervising doctor.

, Although exercise-based cardiac stress tests are generally considered safe for patients, complications do sometimes (rarely) occur. Potential complications with stress testing include: low blood pressure (hypotension, which can lead to dizziness), abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias, which feel like a ""racing"" heart) and varying severity of heart attack (myocardial infarction).If any of these symptoms are felt or noticed, the stress testing should be stopped immediately.


According to research, heart attack and death can be expected to occur at a rate of 1 incident per 2,500 cardiac stress tests.As such, the risk is small, but clearly there.
Taking heart medication and drinking caffeinated beverages prior to cardiac stress testing can increase the risk of complications during the test.

, Remember that many of these symptoms are not specific to thyroid disease. Determine if you have multiple symptoms, or just a few. If you are unsure, go to your physician for tests.For example, gaining weight may be due to eating more or exercising less, and not due to thyroid disease. Feeling nervous or anxious may be due to a new job or an underlying mental health issue. Skin dryness can be due to low humidity or not enough healthy fats in the diet. Constipation can be due to not enough fiber in your diet or a number of digestive conditions while diarrhea can be due to digestive conditions or food sensitivities.

, Use a mirror to check the base of your neck. Focus the mirror on the lower part of your neck, between your voice box and collarbone. Tilt your head back and take a sip of water.If there is any swelling, tenderness, or bumps/lumps or nodules at the base of the neck, call your physician and let her know you are concerned about the finding and if you should be checked for thyroid disease.


Make sure the lighting is good enough so that you can see clearly.

, Look for symptoms that last longer than two to three weeks. If your symptoms revolve around your monthly cycle, look for symptoms that continue longer than two to three cycles.For example, you may be constantly tired with no good explanation for it because you seem to sleep long enough and get enough rest.


Being tired alone is not enough to indicate a thyroid problem, as tiredness and fatigue can be caused by many things.

, Use a large calendar on the fridge or a large notebook to record how many hours you slept and if you felt rested, when you get your periods, if you feel too cold or too warm, if you have gained weight or lost weight, or if you feel like your heart or breath is racing. Record what you were doing when you had that sensation. If you feel nervous or anxious, take a few minutes to assess if it seems to be because of events in your life or if it seems to be unexplainable.Thyroid disorders can be silent for a long time. The body has a number of mechanisms to compensate for thyroid dysfunction; however, don’t hesitate to ask your physician to run tests if you are concerned about your thyroid function.

, The best way to check your thyroid is to get your doctor to test your blood. Your doctor can check for the levels of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). You should also consider asking that your levels of T3 and free T4 be checked as well, because differences in these levels can give you more information about the condition of the thyroid.Since the thyroid is controlled via TSH from the pituitary, sometimes what looks like thyroid disease may actually be due to pituitary problems, though this is rare.
Low TSH may indicate an overactive thyroid, while high TSH may indicate an underactive thyroid. High levels of free T4 or T3 may point to a hyperactive thyroid, while low levels may point to a hypoactive thyroid. Your doctor will be able to interpret your results and let you know where your TSH levels fall.

, Since pituitary conditions may be the underlying cause of thyroid problems, your doctor may order additional tests to look for other conditions. Depending on your specific situation, other tests may be ordered to determine a final diagnosis.These additional tests include: an iodine uptake scan, thyroid ultrasound, measurement of thyroid antibodies, or a thyroid needle biopsy if nodules are detected."

Look at the food to determine the color.,
Feel the food with your fingers to note the texture.,
Work the food with your fingers to note any sound.,
Look at the packaging to see if it suits the food.,
Smell the food to note the aroma.,
Taste the food to determine the texture.,
Taste the food to experience the flavor.,
Hold the test in a quiet, smell-free area.,
Set out water to cleanse your palate.,
Record impressions as you go to keep different foods straight.,
Use a preference test if you want to determine likability.,
Use a discrimination test if you want feedback on a product attribute.",How to Carry out Sensory Evaluation," Examine the food with your eyes. If it is in a test container, remove it so you can get a better look at the color. Write down what color you perceive the food to be. It can be helpful to note if the color is light or intense and whether the color seems pure or muddy.


Note if the color is consistent throughout or not.Note if any liquids are transparent or not.;
, Remove the food from the test container. Touch it to see if it is mushy, grainy, crumbly or another texture. Write down any notes about the texture and free associate if you like. If the food is solid, touch to see if the surface is smooth or rough.For example, a coarse sugar might remind you of sand.

, Press a bit of the food between your fingers. Listen for any crackling or crunching. If the food is something like a cereal with many small bits, listen to hear if the pieces make noise as they brush past one another in the container. Make notes to catalog your thoughts., Inspect the food’s packaging with your eyes and hands. Notice if the packaging holds the food well or makes it easier to eat. Fonts and instructions may also be worthy of comment. Write down any notes about the food’s packaging, whether about its usefulness or the way it looks.If the packaging has any important parts that enable you to eat the food, do they work? For example, if the food item is a juice box, does the diameter of the straw fit in the hole that is cut for it?

, Hold your nose to the edge of the test container and inhale deeply. Take note of any scents or aromas you smell. Be creative and write down any associations.You might smell flavorings or ingredients that are a part of the food you’re smelling. The smell might also trigger a memory. For example, a cereal may smell of corn if that is an ingredient.
Alternatively, a chocolate chip cookie might smell not only of vanilla but also remind you of your grandma’s house.
If you’re having trouble smelling the food, break it up a bit with your fingers., Take a bite of the food and feel its texture as you chew it. Notice if the texture of the food when you’re eating it feels different than when you touched it. Make notes not only about the food’s physical texture but also how you feel eating the food, if it is comforting, for example.You might consider if it crunches between your teeth or dissolves, for example.
It can be helpful to think of texture, soft to hard, on a scale of 1-10. A numerical system can help if you are comparing different samples.
Observe whether the food’s texture makes the food easy to swallow and eat or if the texture leaves your mouth dry.

, Take another bite, and move the food over your tongue. Certain areas of your tongue are most attuned to sweet, while others are more attuned to salt or sour, so this will help you experience all the flavors this food offers. Note if the food tastes the way it smelled, or different. Write down your impressions of the food’s taste, not just good or bad, but at least five phrases that would help you characterize it if you were trying to remember it in the future. Rate the sweetness, savoriness, sourness, and spiciness of the food. If you like, you can do so on a scale of 1-10.When tasting a food, it can be helpful to think about what’s pleasing about it and what you would change about it.
Note the aftertaste, if any.
For example, when tasting certain lasagna, you might note that it tastes like fresh tomatoes, pecorino cheese and too much oregano. Maybe it reminds you of a bad lasagna you had in a frozen dinner once because it has some sweetness you do not like (5/10). You could also note it is not spicy and not sour. The lasagna is dry and could use more tomato sauce.

, In order to get the clearest impression of a food, hold your sensory evaluation in a quiet and smell-free spot. Other smells in the area may change the way a food tastes to you. A calm, clean space will help you focus on the food sample at hand.Your sense of taste and smell is sharpest in the morning before eating other foods. This may be a good time of day to hold an evaluation.

, Have some sips of water while tasting, especially if you’ll be trying multiple samples. This will ensure the smell and taste of one food doesn’t mess up the next one. Drink a few sips between different foods to cleanse your palate.If your food sample is oily, crunching on a cleansing food, such as raw carrots, before sipping water can cleanse your palate of some residual fats., Set out a notepad so you can write down your impressions of each dish as you taste. Especially if you taste multiple foods, it can be difficult to record your thoughts after the fact when each food might blend with the next. Take lots of notes as you taste to record your thoughts most accurately., Preference tests are used to determine whether you like or dislike a food product. An example of a preference test would be if you enjoy the taste of a particular muffin or not. Letting your testers know that likability is most important will allow them to focus on that their notes.

For example, if you are giving direction to other testers, you might say at the beginning of the test, “Today, I want to find out if you like this blueberry muffin or not.”

, Discrimination tests are used to judge a preference about one part of a product, such as the color. An example of a discrimination test could be a marketing study about whether you prefer green mint chip ice cream or white. By telling your testers what characteristic of the food you want feedback on, they can tailor their notes accordingly.

For example, if you are giving direction to other testers, you might say at the beginning of the test, “Today, we want to find out which color of ice cream you like best.”

Talk to your doctor.",How to Boost Your Energy Level in the Afternoon," Sometimes all you need is a little motivation to help you feel a little more energized. Put on some of your favorite upbeat music. A faster beat can help you feel a little more energetic.


If you're able, listen to your music a little loudly. This can help jolt you out of your midday fog. If you're not able, try listening to the music throughout headphones so you don't bother your co-workers.
Also try singing or humming along to the song. This can help force your brain to concentrate and focus instead of zoning out.;
, A small afternoon snack can provide your body with a little boost of nutrition and energy. Just make sure you pick the right type of snack to keep your energy boosted the rest of the day.


Choose protein and complex carbs for your snacks. Protein can help boost energy and keep you satisfied. Complex carbs are higher in fiber and help prevent a rapid spike in your blood sugar.Together they make the perfect afternoon snack combination.
Try snacks like: carrots and hummus, a low-fat greek yogurt, a piece of fruit and a cheese stick or even a small bowl of oatmeal.
Try a piece of dark chocolate, which contains caffeine and can improve focus. Look for chocolate that has at least 60% cacao.Avoid high-sugar snacks like candies, sweetened beverages or desserts. These cause your blood sugar to rise rapidly and then crash causing additional fatigue.Also skip foods that are higher in fat. Too much fat can cause you to feel sluggish and tired since it takes a long time to digest., Small amounts of caffeine can help you beat afternoon fatigue as well. Caffeine is a stimulant that can help you feel more awake and focused.Brew a cup of coffee or tea to help you wake up. Be mindful of the sweetener you use — too much sugar can cause a crash later on. Use very minimal sugar, a natural calorie-free sugar or none at all.
Keep caffeine intake moderate. Too much can be irritating long-term. However, most studies show that two to three cups of coffee throughout the day is safe for most healthy adults.Note that caffeine can also have the opposite effect - especially on those who already drink somewhat large quantities of it. If you're already a caffeine junky, lay off of it for a few weeks to see if it helps with your fatigue., Wash the day's stress from your mind by splashing cold water onto your face and neck. Some studies have shown that the cold water can help you wake up and feel more focused.When you're starting to feel a little sleepy, take a walk break to the bathroom and turn the faucet on cold. Splash yourself for a few minutes until you feel a little more alert.
This same study also showed that a cold shower in the morning, although uncomfortable at first, can help you wake up and de-stress more than a typical warm shower.

, It only takes a few seconds, and the sensation of a stretch can be surprisingly revitalizing. Stretch a little to wake up, de-stress and relax.It's easy to get stiff at work — especially if you're sitting at a desk all day. You might feel hunched over from staring at your screen, or your neck feels strained for leaning forward all day. Get up and stretch to help your body relax.
Some stretches to try include: neck rolls, reaching up towards the sky and arching backwards, touching your toes, side stretches and seated twists.

, Break from work for a moment and spend it laughing with friends, going out to grab a coffee or talking about weekend plans.


Socializing is a great way to feel refreshed, even for just a moment. It takes your mind off stress, and laughing picks up your mood.Ask your friends or co-workers if they'd be interested in taking a regular 3 or 4 pm coffee break. You can get up, move and socialize (all of which can help you feel a little more awake and refreshed).
You can even ask your co-workers to join you on a daily 10 minute yoga break, stretch break or afternoon walk. You're probably not the only one feeling a little sleepy in the afternoons.

, Multiple studies have shown that going for a quick walk can help wake you up and give you a burst of energy to get through your afternoon.Try to go for at least 10 minutes. However, moving around for about 30 minutes will be even better for you.Get outside if you can. The fresh air will give you a great boost of energy and motivation. A brisk walk will get your heart pumping and your body and mind will no longer feel sluggish.Consider attending a gym in the mornings to give you more energy throughout the day. A cardio workout or a calming yoga session will help build your stamina and endurance, while relieving stress.

, If you have the opportunity to sneak away right after lunch for a little shut-eye (possibly finding a conference room that is not in use, going to your car, or closing your door if you're in an office), a 15 to 20 minute nap may be enough to re-energize you for the rest of the day, improving alertness and motor skills.Longer naps, between 30 and 60 minutes, can improve your decision-making skills and memory.
To get the most benefit from a mid-day nap, try to be consistent about the timing. Aim for a nap between 1 and 3pm. Use a sleep mask to block out any light and, if possible, wrap yourself in a warm blanket or your jacket., Many studies have shown that regular and consistent physical activity is the best way to fight fatigue and increase your energy.Health professionals think that regular exercise helps increase the release of energy-promoting neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine which helps you beat the fatigue.In addition, health professionals recommend doing at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each day.In addition to aerobic activity, also include a day or two of strength training to balance out your workouts., A well-balanced diet is very important for general health, but may also determine how you feel throughout the day.


A balanced diet is a way of eating in which you consume foods from every food group each day. In addition, you should eat a wide variety of foods throughout the day.
To help prevent fatigue you should make sure that all your meals are balanced as well.
For example, big carbohydrate-rich meals (like a pancake breakfast or spaghetti for lunch), can leave you feeling tired and sluggish.Include a source of lean protein, fruits or vegetables and a high fiber carbohydrate to help balance your energy levels., Sometimes, eating more often can help you balance out your body's blood sugar and energy levels throughout the day.Try eating four to six smaller meals daily. These little meals can help provide your body with some nutrition and a small boost of energy throughout the day.


Many people typically go for the three meals a day approach. But if you need a snack during the day or have frequent afternoon slumps, try eating more often.

, In addition to eating multiple smaller meals throughout the day, make sure that your lunch-time meal is also small. This may help with your afternoon energy levels.


Studies have shown that circadian rhythms are significantly different for those people who ate large meals at lunch. These changes resulted in a more sluggish, tired feeling in the afternoons. This is most likely from drops in blood sugar.To minimize these effects, stick to smaller portions at lunch time. Stop eating when you're satisfied and not full. Once you're full, you've probably eaten too much and are at risk for some sleepiness later on.
If you have a smaller lunch and feel hungry in the afternoon, have an energy boosting snack to help decrease your hunger and provide a boost.

, Being dehydrated is one of the top causes of afternoon fatigue and grogginess.Stay hydrated to avoid the afternoon slump.


When your body is hydrated it is more energized. Drink fluids all day long to help prevent fatigue in the afternoons.
Aim for eight to 13 glasses of clear, no-calorie fluids to help keep you hydrated. Try: water, flavored water and decaf coffee and teas.Also monitor the amount of caffeine you drink. Although it can provide a little boost in energy, large quantities of caffeine can exacerbate dehydration.

, Obviously how much sleep you get each night will also play a significant role in how energized you feel the next day.Aim to get enough sleep every night to prevent fatigue during the day.


Most health experts will recommend getting about seven to nine hours of sleep each night for adults.
Try going to bed earlier or waking up later to help you get in a little more sleep time.
If you have chronic sleep problems, it's important to see your doctor for help. He or she may be able to help you find a medication to help you get to sleep and stay asleep.

, Some studies link stress to more than half of the reasons why people experience afternoon fatigue.Since stress seems to play a big role in your energy levels, manage it as best you can.


Talk about your stress. This can help you ""vent"" and relieve some of the tension. Consider talking to friends, family or a therapist for help.
Also try some stress-reducing activities like: meditating, walking, listening to music or reading a good book.

, If you're experiencing afternoon fatigue often, severe fatigue, or you're unsure of what's causing fatigue, it might be a good idea to talk to your doctor.


In rare cases, there are some health conditions that can cause fatigue. Many of these should be managed by your doctor.
Talk to your doctor about how long you've been feeling fatigued, how often it happens and the severity. This will help him or her better manage your condition.
In addition, many chronic diseases like diabetes, obesity or sleep apnea can cause fatigue and should be closely monitored by your physician.

Do high-intensity resistance training (HIRT).,
Choose an adequate weight level.,
Do push ups.,
Use the bench press.,
Do an overhead press.,
Do a deadlift.,
Perform a cross-body curl.,
Try some aerobic exercise.",How to Block Myostatin2," HIRT is a type of resistance training that pushes you to your physical limits. It involves doing lots of different exercises consecutively without breaks.To perform HIRT, string several exercises together into a “super-set.” A super-set consists of multiple exercises done as fast as possible over a set amount of time.
For instance, you might perform 10 bicep curls, 10 pushups, and 10 sit-ups in a cycle for eight minutes straight. After completing your last set of 10 sit-ups, you would start again by doing 10 bicep curls.

, When doing resistance training, it is important to lift enough weight to feel strained, but not so much that you hurt yourself. To determine the right amount of weight for you, start lifting with the least amount of weight. Perform 8-12 repetitions of the given exercise. If you do not feel winded by the end of the set, add weight in five-pound increments and try again.You’ll know that you’ve found the right amount of weight for you when you feel winded after 8-12 repetitions of the exercise in question.

, Place your hands on the floor in front of you. Push your legs out behind you and balance on your toes. Position your feet in such a way that they are perpendicular to the floor. Keep your back and legs in a stiff, straight line. Lower your body so that your elbows bend at 90-degree angles. Push back up off the floor to return to the starting position., Lie flat on the bench and grasp the bar with both hands. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width. Lower the bar slowly to your chest. Keep your glutes and abs tight, and arch your back as you lower it. When the bar touches your chest, push it back up to the starting position., Set the barbell in a squat rack or cage. With the bar just in front of your head, place your hands on it with your palms facing forward. Lift the bar off the rack and lower it to shoulder level. Push the bar up above your head, keeping both arms at an equal height.Place your hands at a distance from one another that is slightly wider than the width of your shoulders.
Each hand should be placed equidistant from its corresponding end of the bar. In other words, your left hand should be the same distance from the left end of the bar as your right hand is from the right end of the bar.
After you’ve extended the bar above you as far as possible, bring it down slowly to the starting position.

, Stand with your feet hip-width apart. With the barbell in front of you on the floor, grip it with your palms facing backwards toward you. Keeping your back straight and your chest forward, push up with your legs and thrust your hips forward. Carefully lower the bar to the ground to return to the starting position.Your arms should remain straight and your hands should continue gripping the bar throughout the deadlift.
Take care not to bend your back during the deadlift.

, Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing out. Keeping your elbows tight to your sides, pull the dumbbell toward your opposite shoulder. For instance, if you’re holding a dumbbell in your right hand, pull it up toward your left shoulder. Pause for one second when you touch the dumbbell to your shoulder, then slowly bring it back down to the starting position., There are a number of aerobic exercises that could also help you reduce your myostatin levels. For instance, you could ride a bike, go for a walk or run, or use an elliptical. While resistance exercises should be performed at high intensity, aerobic exercises should be performed at moderate intensity.Exercising at moderate intensity will give you a feeling similar to that you get when walking briskly, and should make you feel that you’re working at about 50% of your maximum physical output."

Make changes to lower your risk.",How to Calculate Your Heart Disease Risk," In order to calculate your risk of developing heart disease, you will have to test certain aspects of your health. Your doctor should be able to do this during a normal appointment. She will also draw a sample of your blood and test the levels of certain substances.One thing that your doctor will measure is your blood pressure. Blood pressure is the strength that your blood exerts on the inside walls of veins and arteries as it flows through the body. If it is too high, the blood puts extra stress on your heart and arteries, creating a higher risk for heart attack or stroke.Your doctor may also take a sample of your blood and send it off to the lab. One thing that she should look for is your blood glucose level — that is, your amount of blood sugar. A normal blood glucose level is 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) two hours after eating. Higher levels — 11.1 mmol/l or more (200 mg/dl or more) after eating— can indicate diabetes.(Target levels will be different if you take the test while fasting.)
The blood sample will also test your LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. LDL is ""bad"" cholesterol that builds up in the arteries, while HDL is ""good"" cholesterol that acts as a kind of janitor, helping the body to process bad cholesterol. A healthy LDL level is generally below 100 mg/dL, while a healthy HDL is around 40 mg/dL.;
, Heart disease is relatively uncommon in people younger than 30 years old but the risk increases with age for both men and women. Women run a slightly lower risk of heart disease than men of the same age group.Calculate for your age. Add or subtract from a baseline of zero. If you are male, subtract 1 point if you are between 30 and 34 years of age. Add one point for every 5 years. That is, if you are between 65 and 69 years of age, add 6 points. The highest age group (70 to 74 year olds) should add 7 points.
If you are female, subtract 9 points from a baseline of zero if you are between 30 and 34 years of age. Subtract 4 for 35 to 39 and 0 for 40 to 44. Add 3 points for 45 to 49, 6 for 50 to 54, 7 for 55 to 59 and 8 for 60 to 74 years.

, LDL cholesterol are lipids that are bad for your heart and blood vessels. They are deposited on the walls of your coronary arteries (blood vessels in the heart) and cause plaque to form. This plaque impedes blood flow and can lead to heart disease.Continue to add or subtract from your answers above. If you are male, subtract 3 points if your LDL level is below 100 mg/dL. Similarly, add 0 points for 100 to 159 mg/dL, 1 for 160 to 190 mg/dL, and 2 for more than 190 mg/dL.
If you are female, subtract 2 points if your LDL level is below 100 mg/dL. Add 0 points for 100 to 159 mg/dL and 2 for more than 160 mg/dL.

, HDL cholesterol is known as good cholesterol because it helps to lower your risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is considered “good” because it transports bad lipids back to the liver, where they are flushed from the body.If you are male, add 2 points if your HDL level is below 35 mg/dL. Similarly, add 1 point for 35 to 44 mg/dL, 0 for 45-59 mg/dL, and subtract 1 point for more than or equal to 60 mg/dL.
If you are female, add 5 points if your HDL level is below 35 mg/dL. Similarly, add 2 for 35 to 44 mg/dL, 1 for 45 to 49 mg/dL, 0 for 50 to 59 mg/dL, and subtract 2 for more than or equal to 60 mg/dL.

, High blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Blood pressure has two values: the upper value is called “systolic pressure” and the lower value “diastolic pressure.” The ideal blood pressure for adults is less than 120/80 mm-Hg (120 for systolic and 80 for diastolic). Blood pressure that is more than 140/90 is called hypertension. The target blood pressure for people who have diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease is even lower.Add 0 points if you are male and your blood pressure is less than 130/85. Add 1 for a reading of 130/85 – 139/89. Add 2 for a reading of 140/90 – 159/99. Add 3 for pressure of more than or equal to 160/100.
If you are female, subtract 3 points if your blood pressure is less than 120/80. Add 0 points for a reading 120/80 – 139/89. Add 2 for systolic pressure 140/90 – 159/99. And add 3 for blood pressure more than or equal to 160/100.
Take the higher reading if your systolic and diastolic pressures fall in different ranges. For example, if you are male and your systolic pressure is 170/90, add 3 points rather than 2.

, Diabetes is strongly related to heart disease. In fact, diabetics are twice as likely as non-diabetics to develop heart disease at some point in their lifetime. This is partly because diabetics are more likely to also have high blood pressure, while elevated blood sugar levels increase fatty deposits and plaque in the arteries and the risk of clogging.If you do not have diabetes, add 0 points (either male or female).
If you have diabetes or take anti-diabetic drugs, add if you are male and 4 points if you are female.

, Some behaviors like exercise can give you moderate protection against heart disease. Being physically active can lower your blood pressure, help to lower your cholesterol levels, and reduce your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors recommend that you aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise (i.e. walking, light aerobics) five times per week or 25 minutes of vigorous exercise (running, basketball, cycling) three days per week. In addition, they recommend moderate to intense strength training two days per week.Subtract 1 point if you are male or female and meet the recommended guidelines. Add 1 point if you do not.

, Smoking is not only terrible for your lungs but also increases your chances of getting heart disease. Chemicals in tobacco directly damage heart muscle and blood vessels, while smoking in general promotes atherosclerosis, lowers HDL cholesterol, and raises blood pressure.Add 0 points if you are male or female and a non-smoker. Add 2 points if you are a smoker. Consider yourself a smoker if you have smoked even one cigarette, cigar, or pipe of tobacco in the previous month.

, Diet is another mildly protective factor against heart disease. Put simply, the foods that you eat can control blood pressure, diabetes, weight gain, and high cholesterol. For the best results, try to eat a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins like fish, chicken, and beans. Avoid sugars, refined carbohydrates, and red meat.Make sure to get plenty of fiber, as well. Soluble fiber, found in foods like oatmeal, is known to reduce “bad” cholesterol in the blood stream.The American Heart Association has heart healthy guidelines.Check these and subtract 1 point if you meet them (either male or female). Add one point if you do not.

, You have now scored all of the parameters for risk and prevention. Add up your points from the previous sections and see your final score.


For example, if you are a 62 year old woman (8 points), regular exerciser (-1 points) with healthy diet (-1 points), non-smoker (0 point), diabetic (4 points) with blood pressure 130/80 (0 point), HDL level 45 mg/dL (1 point) and LDL level 140 mg/dL (0 point), your final score will be 8-1-1+0+4+0+1+0= 11.
If you are a 48 year old male (2 points) who does not exercise (1 point), smokes (2 points), eats poorly (1 point), has diabetes (4 points), and has a blood pressure of 160/100 (3 points), HDL of 20 mg/dL (2 points) and LDL of 220 mg/dL (2 points), your score will be 2+1+2+1+4+3+2+2=17.

, Take your point total and then find the corresponding percentage. This percentage represents the risk that you have of developing heart disease or of experiencing a cardiac event in the next 10 years. The points-risk relationship is different for males and females.If you are a male, a point total of less than -3 represents a 1% risk of heart disease in the next 10 years. Similarly, you have a 2% risk for -2 or -1 points, 3% risk for 0 points, 4% for 1 or 2 points, 6% for 3 points, 7% for 4 points, 9% for 5 points, 11% for 6 points, 14% for 7 points, 18% for 8 points, 22% for 9 points, 27% for 10 points, 33% for 11 points, 40% for 12 points, 47% for 13 points, and more than 56% for 14 points or more.
Our 48 year old male, for example, has a score of 17. This means that his 10 year risk is more than 56%. In other words, more than 56 people out of 100 with a similar score will have a heart attack or cardiac event in the next 10 years.

, If you are a female, a total point score of less than -2 points represents a 1% risk of heart disease in the next 10 years. Similarly, you have a 2% risk for -1, 0 or 1 point, 3% for 2 or 3 points, 4% for 4 points, 5% for 5 points, 6% for 6 points, 7% for 7 points, 8% for 8 points, 9% for 9 points, 11% for 10 points, 13% for 11 points, 15% for 12 points, 17% for 13 points, 20% for 14 points, 24% for 15 points, 27% for 16 points, and more than 32% for 17 points or more.


Our 62 year old female has a score of 11. This means that she runs a 13% ten year risk of heart disease. So, 13 out of 100 with a similar score will experience a heart attack or other cardiac event in the next ten years.

, If you have a 20% or higher chance of having a heart condition in the next 10 years, you should seriously consider making some lifestyle changes. While you cannot control your age, you can control many of the other parameters. For example, if you have high LDL cholesterol you can reduce your cholesterol by exercising regularly and taking lipid lowering drugs like statins.


Talk to your doctor about heart health, even if you got a fairly good score. She will be able to recommend ways in which you can improve, including quitting smoking, controlling your blood pressure, eating and exercising better, or lowering your bad cholesterol.

Look up local trials in a database.,
Contact nearby hospitals and universities.,
Watch for advertisements posted around town.,
Consider the costs of the trial.",How to Become Involved in Medical Research Studies1," There are many reputable websites that are used by researchers to identify potential volunteers. These databases can help you find trials based on your location, medical history, gender, age, and risk factors. The following websites are reputable sources for clinical trials:


Clinicaltrials.govResearchMatchCenterWatch;
, Visit the websites of any nearby medical research departments or facilities attached to local hospitals. You can also call these places or visit them in person. If there is a specific study you are interested in joining, contact the principal investigator. Otherwise, look for a research coordinator at the facility to volunteer yourself as a general participant.

, If you live near a major research center, university, or hospital, you may be able to find medical advertisements put up locally. Keep an eye on the posters found on buses, subways, and taxis. Read the bulletin boards at your local coffee shop. By being constantly on the lookout, you may find a trial that works for you. They may even be advertised on TV.

, Some trials offer monetary compensation, and most will provide some level of free health care. That said, there may be many hidden costs in the trial.



Cost of transportation: Some trials may be able to cover your transportation costs while others will expect you to pay for it. If the trial is close by or does not require travel, this will not matter. That said, if the trial is far away, you may have to pay substantially for treatment.

Cost of health care: While the researchers will most likely cover any tests or medications that are directly required for the study, you may need additional care that is not compensated."

Stay home from work or school.,
Sleep as much as you need.,
Refrain from high-impact exercise.,
Wash your hands frequently.",How to Become Better when You Are Sick1," Going out and having a normal day will usually make you sicker. It also exposes those around you to illness. Stay home and take care of yourself so that you can go out again soon. Keep in mind that you’re usually at your most contagious at the beginning of an illness — for a cold, this means the first three days, possibly four or five., Sleeping can be one of the most vital steps in allowing your body to get better. When a sickness attacks your body, it needs as much energy as it can to fight it off. Sleep helps give you that energy., Even if you do it every day and find it gives you increased energy, working out hard when you're sick doesn't give you that energy. It typically makes you even more drained than before and can exacerbate breathing or congestion issues., This will help prevent you from getting more germs and conceivably getting sicker. It’s also going to help you get rid of the germs that have collected on your hands.Wash your hands with hot water, scrubbing with soap for at least 20 seconds.

Regular exercise is one of the most important steps toward a healthy body and mind, with innumerable benefits such as a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s,type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancers.You should strive for some form of physical activity each day. You don't necessarily have to hit the gym seven days a week. Simply look for opportunities to be active at least 20 or 30 minutes each day, such as parking father away or choosing to walk somewhere instead of driving, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, taking your dog for long walks, etc. You will still get a lot of health benefits through daily moderate exercise.Choose an activity that's convenient and that you enjoy. If you love long walks, take your dog for a brisk 30 minute walk each night. If you love biking, consider biking to work each day instead of driving. Try aerobic classes, Zumba, pilates, or high-intensity training.;
, Carrying too much or too little body fat can affect our health in many ways. Being underweight is also not ideal for your health. It's important to find a comfortable and healthy balance for your frame and height. Speak with your doctor for guidance as to where you fall on that spectrum.


One tool that can determine if you need to gain or lose weight by discovering your BMI. This is a calculation based on your height and weight and you can use a BMI calculator online to figure out if you need to gain or lose. Your BMI should be between 18.5 and 24.9. Anything lower than 18.5 is considered underweight. Anything higher than 24.9 is considered overweight. A BMI over 30 is considered obese.Be aware that BMI is not always an accurate indicator (if you are very short and very muscular, for instance, your BMI may be skewed), so make sure you also talk with your doctor.
If you are overweight or underweight, talk to your doctor about a weight loss or weight gain plan. You gain or lose weight by eating more or less calories than you consume each day. Food labels and online nutrition calculators can help you assess the amount of calories in your food. You can also use online calculators to estimate how many calories a given activity burns for you considering your height and weight.
While being overweight or underweight is not healthy for your body, it is also unhealthy to make very sudden or drastic changes to your diet. Remember that weight gain and loss both require a slow, gradual, and consistent change to your diet and exercise routine in order to be safe and healthy for you.

, Many people prefer to focus exclusively on either cardio health (running, biking, etc.) or weight training. However, a truly healthy body needs to exercise both sets of muscles.Not only does doing several different activities work all your muscles (which can help prevent injury), it also keeps you from getting bored. Include aerobic and strength training workouts in your routine.
Aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly. Moderate aerobic activity would include things like walking or light cycling. Vigorous activity would include things like jogging, running, and intense cycling.
You should incorporate strength training twice a week. Strength training can come in the form of lifting weights or engaging in activities like Pilates, which forces you to use your body as a weight to strengthen and tone core muscles., While exercise is necessary for a healthy body, if you don't follow certain precautions and exercise correctly, you put your body at risk for injuries. Make sure you treat your body with respect when working out.


Ease into a fitness routine. Do not try to go from a sedentary lifestyle to working out at the gym five days a week. Give yourself small fitness goals, like taking a certain number of steps per day, or running half a mile, then a mile, then two miles.
Stay hydrated. You should sip water throughout your workouts. Becoming dehydrated can lead to dizziness or headaches during your sweat session.Have a rest day between strength training workouts.
Get a fitness partner. Having someone to walk or jog with or take group fitness classes with at the local gym can be motivational. It can also help by providing you with someone you know that can watch for signs that you are overdoing it.

, In the early stages of working toward a healthier lifestyle, you must assess what you are currently eating. If you notice any unhealthy habits, strive to make changes to your diet.


Keep a food diary. For a week or so, write down every food that you eat. Websites like www.myfitnesspal.com provide free templates for logging foods and keeping track of calories. It's important to know what your areas of strength and weakness are so that you can make improvements where needed.
Get a rough sense of how many calories you're eating. Women need about 1,800 to 2,000 calories a day. Men need about 2,400 to 2,600. However, these levels are for sedentary adults. If you're more active, you may need to be consuming more calories., After keeping a food log for a week, make adjustment to your diet. You want to make sure you're getting the healthiest foods possible.


At every meal throughout the day, half of your plate should be plant-based, such as fruit and vegetables, and processed as little as possible. In other words, uncooked fruits and vegetables are ideal.Round out your meals and snacks with lean protein like chicken breast or tofu, dairy, and whole grains. Remember that a healthy diet is about variety: your body requires many types of nutrients to function optimally, and eating a bland diet of the same foods every day (even if they are healthy foods) will not provide these nutrients.
Not all fats are bad for you. Good fats can be found in oily fish like salmon and tuna, avocados, nuts, and olive oil. These are essential to a well-balanced diet and proper brain functioning.
It may take a few days or even weeks for your body to become accustomed to eating healthy foods. Some foods like caffeine, carbs, alcohol, and sugar are addictive and can cause withdrawal symptoms like headaches or moodiness.

, Even though our bodies are made mostly of water, most Americans do not consume enough water throughout the day. Drinking more water can help with your overall health and minimize fatigue, hunger pangs, and other symptoms of dehydration.


It's a common misconception that you should drink eight glasses of water a day. The amount of water each person needs a day varies depending on body size, activity level, and climate. In general, to calculate how much water your body needs at rest in a cool climate, divide your weight in half. A 200 pound person needs about 100 ounces a day when doing things like working at a desk or watching TV.If you're more active, or live in a hotter climate, you may need a bit more than half your body weight.
Even caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea count toward your total intake of water, but these should not make up the bulk of your fluid intake., Soda, juice, or alcoholic beverages are heavy on calories and sugar but low on nutrition. These should be banned from your diet if you want to be healthy.


If you don't enjoy the taste of plain water, drink decaffeinated tea or add a bit of 100% juice into your water. You can also try creating infused water: make a pitcher of ice water and put in a variety of sliced fresh fruits or even herbs like rosemary or mint. It's essentially a mild herbal tea.

, Research has shown that people who skip breakfast tend to overeat during the remainder of the day.So, to curb your appetite, don't skip the first meal of the day.


Many Americans eat a carb-heavy breakfast like donuts, waffles, or cereal, which can be high in calories but low in nutrition. These types of breakfast will not keep you feeling full very long. Instead, opt for protein like eggs or unsweetened yogurt with fruit, and lowfat milk, fresh orange juice, tea, or black coffee (avoid adding sugar and cream). , Train your body to expect a specific amount of calories at regularly scheduled meals three times a day. If you find that you feel hungry in the afternoons or mid-mornings, try eating smaller meals more frequently. Avoid mindless eating throughout the day or eating late night snacks.


Snacking isn't bad for you if you do it right. In fact, grazing throughout the day on healthy snacks like yogurt, nuts, or string cheese can keep you from feeling deprived and overindulging later. Just make sure it's all in moderation and that you keep track of your calorie intake, since it can be easy to overdo it by mistake., Smoking is directly correlated with lung and mouth cancers, heart disease, stroke, and cancers of the throat, pancreas, and bladder. It is impossible to be a truly healthy person who smokes.

Seek help to quit if you can't do it on your own.

Talk to your doctor about quitting smoking. He or she may be able to help you form a treatment program.
You should seek support when quitting smoking. Ask your friends and family members to support your decision. If you know people who smoke, request that they not do so in front of you. You might also want to consider joining a support group.

, Engaging in risky sexual behaviors puts you at risk for unwanted pregnancies as well as sexually-transmitted diseases. Use protection when having sex and avoid sleeping with partners you do not know.


Latex condoms can greatly reduce the risk of contracting an STD. If you do not know your partner's status, always use a condom during sex. Make sure you check the expiration date and check for tears.
If you're sexually active and not in a monogamous relationship, get screened for STDs routinely. Make an appointment with your doctor at least every six months for a full panel STD test. If you're uncomfortable going to your regular doctor, there are many free clinics that offer STD screening.
Many STDs are treatable with antibiotics; however, they can cause serious complications, such as infertility, if left untreated long-term. STDs which are common and treatable are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Some STD that are not curable but one can live with are herpes, HIV, and genital warts.The majority of STDs have no symptoms so the only way to know if something is wrong is getting tested.

, Binge drinking has a lot of negative effects on your overall health. You should strive to drink in moderation only. Having more than three drinks in one night is considered heavy drinking. Heavy drinking, especially on a regular basis, can lead to a host of health problems including cancer, heart failure, and stroke. If you do drink, have only a couple of drinks a night.Do not feel pressured to drink. Binge drinking is a common past time, especially for young people, but try to remember your health. There are absolutely no health benefits to binge drinking. If you're in a social situation where people are drinking heavily, have something like soda instead of alcohol.It is recommended that women stick to one drink or less per day and men have two drinks or less per day.
If you consume more than a few drinks a week, recognize that you may have a drinking problem and join Alcoholics Anonymous or quit drinking without Alcoholics Anonymous.


, Stress and anxiety can take a toll not only on your mental wellbeing. They can also affect your physical health. Learn some strategies to control intrusive, anxious thoughts and to take your mind off of your troubles.


Confront your anxieties by allowing yourself to think through what is bothering you, determine how much control you have over the situation, and then set aside worries about anything you cannot control.
Consider practicing meditation to take your mind off your anxieties. Meditation is a conscious way of clearing your thoughts, most often by focusing on your breathing or other physical sensations and not allowing other thoughts to take residence in your mind.
If you have chronic trouble controlling worrisome thoughts, consider seeing a therapist. You may have an underlying anxiety disorder.

, By focusing on the positive in given situations, rather than dwelling on the negative or ruminating possible bad scenarios, you can improve your physical health: studies have shown that people who think positively can fight off illness like colds and heart disease better than people who think negatively.

It can be hard to retrain a lifetime of thinking negative thoughts. Start by focusing on things you are grateful for instead of things that worry you or bother you. Every time you start to think a negative thought — whether its a worry that your boss won't like your report or a mental criticism of another person's appearance — replace that thought with two things you are thankful for in that moment.

Consider the skills you'll need as an assistant pharmacist.,
Earn your high school diploma or General Equivalency Degree (GED).,
Develop basic communication and mathematics skills.,
Get useful experience.,
Apply to jobs a variety of workplaces.,
Understand location requirements and pay differences.,
Be prepared for a job interview.,
Consider advancing your career.",How to Become an Assistant Pharmacist," Unlike pharmacists and technicians, assistant pharmacists mainly perform secretarial tasks and provide customer service. In addition, you should be accurate and efficient, especially when performing repetitive tasks, like typing up medication labels.


Even though your job will be very different from that of the pharmacist or technician, you'll usually be working the same hours. Be prepared for long shifts on your feet.
Understand the differences between pharmacy assistants and technicians. Unlike assistants, technicians require more certification and education. They're the ones that will be filling medications, managing medication inventory, and taking prescription information from patients or medical professionals.;
, This is technically the only education requirement to become an assistant pharmacist. You'll usually get on the job training from the pharmacist or other knowledgeable co-workers.


It may help to have an advanced degree. Consider getting an associate's or bachelor's degree in a public relations, business, or mathematical field.

, As a pharmacy assistant, you will need to be able to write clearly and communicate well with customers. You'll also need to accurately perform calculations to determine prices and medication amounts. Experience in secretarial or retail sectors would prove helpful.


Pharmacy assistants mainly perform clerical tasks. Be prepared to answer phones, restock shelves, and type medical labels.

, Unlike pharmacy technicians, pharmacy assistants don't need any special certification or training. But, having volunteer experience or an advanced degree will give you an advantage in landing a job. Customer service and efficiency are some of the best skills for the job. Take courses, find volunteer programs in medical facilities, or take a part-time job in a pharmacy in one of the following fields:


Business communication
Human anatomy and physiology
Medical terminology
Pharmacology, pharmacy law, ethics, and math (these would require advanced education)
Retail pharmacy experience, such as a part-time job
Sterile product preparation, pharmacy compounding, hospital pharmacy, and pharmacy software (consider getting a pharmacy or hospital internship)
First aid and CPR (take a local community course)

, You can work with licensed pharmacists in a hospital, community pharmacy, outpatient clinic, nursing home or pharmaceutical organization. Consider working in retail locations, medical facilities, or in the federal government.


If you've taken coursework or completed an internship, ask your professor or advising pharmacist about job opportunities. They may be able to put you in touch with people that are hiring.
Don't forget to check pharmaceutical resources. Look at hospital websites or the American Pharmacists Association for job postings (www.healthecareers.com/apha).

, If you're just starting out as an assistant pharmacist, it may be easiest to get a position at a retail location, like a supermarket or health store. They often pay less, but don't require much in the way of experience or training. Some locations, like hospitals, may require years of experience. The best paying sectors include government, education, and medical (like hospitals or offices of physicians).The majority of pharmacy assistants work in lower paying sectors. 75% of assistant pharmacists work in the retail sector.Colleges and universities usually require years of experience too and offer the highest salaries.

, Create a resume that emphasizes your customer experience. You should also highlight any work experience that shows you are efficient and accurate. Once you've filled out a job application and been selected for an interview, emphasize your reliability and great communication skills.


Since much of an assistant pharmacist's job is dealing with customers, expand on any customer service experience you have. Let the interviewer know that you can handle answering phones, dealing with customer concerns, and effectively communicating with the pharmacist.

, If you've decided you want to move on from being an assistant pharmacist, know your options. Being an assistant pharmacist is a great way to get your foot in the door at a pharmacy. You can also work towards becoming a certified pharmacy technician while you're still employed as an assistant pharmacist.


If you think you want to become a pharmacist, working as an assistant pharmacist will give you a chance to watch a pharmacist at work. This will help you decide if you'd ultimately like to go to school to become a pharmacist.

Consume a balanced diet.,
Exercise throughout the teen years and in puberty.,
Get adequate sleep each night.,
Understand that a majority of your height will be predetermined by genetics.,
Try not to stunt your growth.,
Expect to be in your twenties when you stop growing.",How to Become Taller Naturally1," A person will look a lot shorter when having a plump body. Not only that, being fit by eating right will make you taller and feel better!


Eat plenty of lean protein. Lean protein, such as white poultry meat, fish, soy, and dairy, helps promote muscle growth and healthy bones. Simple carbohydrates such as pizza, cakes, sweets, and soda, are the stuff to stay away from.
Eat plenty of calcium. Calcium, found in leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale, and in dairy (yogurt and milk), helps promote healthy bones.Get enough zinc. Studies, although they have been inconclusive so far, point to a possible link between zinc deficiencies and stunted growth in boys.Good sources of zinc include oysters, wheat germ, pumpkin and squash seeds, lamb, peanuts, and crab.Get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D promotes bone and muscle growth in children, and a deficiency has been shown to stunt growth and cause weight gain in teenage girls.Modest amounts of Vitamin D can be found in fish, alfalfa, and mushrooms, as well as Vitamin D-fortified foods such as some milks and cereals. However, the vast majority of your Vitamin D comes from sunlight exposure. Just 15 minutes a day out in the sun (on average) can ensure you get enough Vitamin D.;
, Getting regular exercise may help you to grow taller during your teen years. Get out and about and work your muscles for at least 30 minutes each day.


Join a gym. Joining a gym will help give you access to a lot of great exercising and muscle-building machines. It will also keep you motivated to work out (you'll feel silly if you're in the gym but not exercising).
Join a sports team. People who join sports teams can use their natural competitiveness to burn extra calories and hopefully get their bodies taller. The great thing about team sports is that half the time, you don't even realize that you're exercising.
If nothing else, walk around. If you can't find the time to do anything else, get up and walk around. Walk to the grocery store. Walk to the library. Walk to school.

, Sleeping is the time when your body grows, so having plenty of sleep is equivalent to giving your body more time for growth. Get between 9 and 11 hours of sleep per night if you're a preteen or still younger than 20.


The human growth hormone (HGH) is produced naturally in our bodies, especially during deep or slow wave sleep.Getting good, sound sleep will encourage the production of HGH, which is created in the pituitary gland.

, Scientists reckon that 60% to 80% of your height is determined by genes.Unfortunately, either you have the tall gene or you don't. That's not to say that you can't grow tall if you have parents who are on the shorter side; it just means that having shorter parents means you're more likely to be on the short side.

, There might not be a lot you can do to increase your height, but you can take several steps to make sure your natural height isn't shortened by environmental influences. Drugs and alcohol are both thought to contribute to stunted growth if they're ingested while you're young, and malnutrition can keep you from reaching your full height, as well.



Does caffeine really stunt your growth? Scientific study shows that, no, caffeine does not stunt growth.Caffeine does, however, have a higher chance of keeping you from sleeping soundly and regularly. Kids and adolescents needs about 9-10 hours of sleep, and caffeine may hurt your ability to get that much sleep.

Does smoking really stunt your growth? The effects of smoking and second-hand smoke on body mass index (BMI) are inconclusive. According to Columbia University's Internet Health Resource, ""Although the studies that have been done are largely inconclusive, the available research suggests that children who smoke or who are exposed to second-hand smoke are shorter than those who do not smoke or are children of non-smokers.""Do steroids really stunt your growth? Absolutely. Anabolic steroids inhibit bone growth in young children and teens, along with lowering sperm count, decreasing breast size, elevating blood pressure and putting you at higher risk of heart attack.Children and teens who suffer from asthma and use inhalers that dispense small doses of the steroid budesonide are, on average, half an inch shorter than those not treated with steroids., A lot of young kids look at themselves and ask, ""Have I finished growing yet?"" If you're under 18, the answer is probably ""No!""If you haven't stopped puberty yet, then you haven't stopped growing.Try to be thankful that you have a little time to grow taller instead of worrying about how tall you will be.

That means 7-9 hours per night for adults, 8-10 hours for teenagers, and 9-11 hours for children. This keeps you awake and alert, so you don't have to drink caffeine and sugar-loaded energy drinks. Sleep is also when most of the body and mind's healing and detoxifying takes place. If you are a kid and have early school times, go to sleep earlier on school nights.


Don't overdo it, though. Sleeping too much can be as bad as not sleeping enough. If you miss some sleep one night, you can sleep longer another night to make up for that. But in general, try to stay within the right range for your age.;
, A proper diet contains the right balance of carbohydrates, protein, fruits and vegetables, and fat. For carbohydrates, try to eat whole grains. Lean meat, fish, eggs, and nuts are some of the best sources of protein. Try to get at least 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. A certain amount of fat is also needed to keep your body functioning smoothly; fish oil, olive oil, and coconut oil are some particularly beneficial fats., It is key in making you run throughout the day. Try drinking 8 eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It helps you re-energize and keep going. Not drinking enough fresh water can lead to acne, headaches, and even dehydration. Do this, and you'll become a very healthy person.

, Get glasses if you need them. If you don't want the look of glasses, try contact lenses or surgery to restore eyesight. Use the correct eye drops for your eyes by asking your doctor. Wear sunglasses so that your eyes aren't damaged.

, Get your shots and booster shots. Take medicines the doctor tells you to take. Get tested for allergies. Get blood tests to figure out things like your cholesterol levels. Find out if you have any conditions and treat any you do have.

, This will not only make you feel better, and make you look better, but help you to get through the day. Research has proven that exercising regularly helps you feel better because endorphins released by the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus during exercise produce a feeling of happiness and well being. Walking is a great exercise. Walk to work or school if you can. If you can't walk the whole way, try parking farther away from your destination so you can walk a least part of the way. You can get of the bus or train a stop earlier if you don't drive., It feels great! From when you wake up in the morning, to your gym class, this easy form of muscle exercise warms you up and makes you more flexible. If you continuously stretch each day, you will end up being really flexible and nimble. It keeps you running longer and gives you strength.

, This doesn't necessarily mean run five miles every morning, but jogging or running for about 10 minutes at an easy pace definitely make you a very healthy person. Try jogging for about ten minutes three to five times a week. It will keep your muscles strong and fit every day. Don't ever run for an hour and then suddenly stop and sit on the couch for another hour. This will give you terrible cramps and will make it hurt to walk the next day. Slowly kick down the pace to a walk, and take deep breaths. Running will get you that A in gym class and make you a very healthy person.

, If you can do 10 push-ups, maximum, try going for 12! Little challenges like this make you a very healthy person.

, Play with a pet, go swimming, or jump on a trampoline, make love, play chess! Doing things you love to do keep you in a good mood, and make you happier. If you had a bad day at school or work, ride a bike and take out your anger. Not only is this fun, but it lets you be yourself for awhile. Try it!

, There is always going to be someone in the room who does at least one thing better than you, so try your best to not compare yourself to other people. Find things you are good at, and use your talents.

, Smiling a lot makes your face look younger and it feels great. If you laugh a lot, it has been scientifically proven to keep you healthier., Don't take things too seriously. Be laid-back and open minded, explore new things, such as new cultures, new foods and new experiences.

, Staying in a dark, quiet place without having any stressful thoughts for about ten minutes will leave you feeling refreshed.

Visit your doctor.,
Identify potential study topics.,
Decide what type of trial you are willing to do.,
Identify whether or not you fit the criteria.,
Check if your insurance covers medical trials.,
Weigh the potential risks.",How to Become Involved in Medical Research Studies2," During most trials, you will continue to see your primary care physician in addition to the medical visits during the study.Have your doctor do a physical or check-up to make sure that you have no new, hidden disorders. During this visit, tell your doctor that you plan to start volunteering for medical studies. The doctor may be recommend you to certain studies. They can also tell you, based on your medical history, what kind of study would be ideal for you. It is important to have this conversation with your primary healthcare physician.

, If you suffer from a particular medical condition, you may be able to find a study that will treat the problem with new techniques. If you are a healthy subject, you can volunteer as part of a control group. Find out what types of studies may be interested in participants with your profile. Look to your family history. If someone in your family has a disease and you don't, you still may prove valuable to researchers. Some common medical conditions that are studied include:


Alzheimer’s Disease
Cancer
High blood pressure
AIDS/HIV
Weight loss
Mental Health
Smoking
Heart conditions, Different types of trials require different levels of intervention. Some trials will require you to report to the research center frequently where others will simply ask you to submit a form with your medical information periodically. Understand how much work you are willing to put into the trial. There are two primary types of trials that researchers use to conduct research.



Clinical Trial: These are medical trials wherein researches put participants through a new drug regimen or medical procedure. Patients are carefully monitored for improvement in their condition and for side effects.

Observational Study: These are studies where researchers follow the daily lives of participants over a long period of time. These are often to determine environmental causes of disease, the impact of diet and exercise on health, or the long-term effects of particular medications., Each study has specific guidelines for the type of participant that they need. These guidelines may include age, gender, race, medical history, family medical history, and current medication usage.


Inclusion criteria are the specific qualities researchers want in a participant
Exclusion criteria are the specific qualities they do not want in a participant, Most of the time clinical trials offer some form of compensation and are paid for by the organization that is conducting the trial. However, some trials may require payment. Some insurance plans do not cover you if you are volunteering for medical trials. Others only cover trials that are deemed “medically necessary” or that fulfill certain rigorous scientific standards. You will have to have the trial approved by your insurance plan to make sure that any extra care costs are paid., If you are seeking to test a new medication or medical procedure, there will be many risks involved. The research team may identify some of these risks up front, although there will be some risks they cannot foresee. Read over the advertisement carefully, and see what they label as risks. Call them if possible to ask them about risks as well as potential benefits.


For example, if you are suffering from a rare condition, you may find a trial testing new experimental medication that can help you. While there may be many risks, you may find that the low cost of healthcare and the potential improvement of your health are worth the risk.
Medical trials must be approved and monitored by an institutional review board (IRB). The IRB ensures that you are informed of all risks and that your rights are protected during the trial. Clinical trials must inform you of their IRB status. If they are not IRB approved, you should not apply."
"
Contact the trial.,
Provide your information.,
Attend a screening.,
Ask questions about risks and responsibilities.,
Sign the informed consent contract.,
Schedule your baseline visit.",How to Become Involved in Medical Research Studies3," Usually medical research ads will include a website, email, or phone number to contact. The recruiters for these studies need very little information to go by, because generally the in-depth questions will happen in person. Follow their instructions to apply for the study.


If you use a service like ResearchMatch, you may be contacted by researchers who are searching for participants. Your use of the service does not mean that you are required to join the study., Once you have applied, you will be contacted by a research coordinator. This will not be a doctor. Rather this is the person who will meet with you for the study, inform you of the procedures, and communicate vital information between the researchers and you.They will ask you general questions to test your eligibility to the study, and, if you qualify, they will also set up your screening and baseline visits. Information you may have to provide includes:


Name
Date of birth
Address
Medical history
Family history
Allergies

, This will be a visit in person with the medical professionals to determine if you are a correct fit for the study. It may involve a medical check-up. The clinical coordinator will outline what will happen during the study, what is expected of you, and what your rights are., Because there are many unknown risks in medical trials, you want to be sure that you know as much as you can about the study. There are certain questions you should always ask before agreeing to do a study. These include:


What potential risks are there? Do you know of any side effects? How do the potential benefits outweigh the risks?
How long will the study or trial last?
What expenses are covered? Are all medical visits covered during this trial? Will I be reimbursed for other expenses?
What type of long-term follow-up care do you offer once the trial ends? Can I continue with this treatment, even after the trial ends?
How will my personal information be used, stored, and protected?
What will I have to do? How often will I have to visit the hospital or clinic?
What tests and procedures are involved?
Will hospitalization be required?, The informed consent form will acknowledge that you have been informed of the study’s procedures, risks, costs, and purpose. Read through the contract carefully. Sign it only if you fully understand what will be required in the study.The informed consent contract is an integral part of the process, and is imperative for conducting a good investigational study. This should be given to you by a clinical coordinator or doctor.

, If you feel comfortable with what you have been told and still wish to join, you will be scheduled for a baseline visit. This may involve more tests, such as X-rays or a CT scan. You may also be given instructions on how to monitor and report your condition from home.You are now officially a part of the study.


Occasionally, your baseline visit will take place at the same time as the screening.

Determine if you have a cold or the flu.,
Keep yourself hydrated.,
Drink hot tea.,
Eat healthy foods.,
Take a hot shower.,
Gargle to help your sore throat.",How to Become Better when You Are Sick2," By knowing which one you have, you can take appropriate action. A cold is typically confined to your head — coughing, sneezing, and a runny nose. The flu can take over your whole body. Flu symptoms include headaches and muscle aches, chills and fever, and vomiting, though often not all together. The flu tends to make you feel much sicker than a cold., Sometimes just drinking lots of fluids can help flush out the infection in your system. Water is often the best choice, but drink whatever tastes the best to you. For water, try for a big glass every two hours or so. You also might want to try Pedialyte or another beverage that provides electrolytes, especially if you are vomiting or have diarrhea., Especially for a cold, tea can help ease congestion and soothe a sore throat. Tea also contains theophylline, which helps to clean out your lungs and decrease the mucus. Any kind of tea will be helpful, and honey often helps coat your throat and makes you more comfortable., If you have an appetite, stick to whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats. Even though sweets or fast foods might sound good at the time, they are not going to help your body function well and fight off your illness. Your best choices for food partially depend on your symptoms.A sore throat would benefit from soothing foods like mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, or creamy soups.
Body aches, on the other hand, might be helped by dark leafy greens, yogurt, and avocados — foods high in magnesium or calcium.
Headaches benefit mostly from drinking water. Sometimes caffeine can help in small doses, particularly coffee or tea. But be sure to re-hydrate with water after the caffeine has dried you out.
For congestion, try making ""golden milk."" Use two cups of coconut milk to simmer on the stove with a teaspoon each of ginger and turmeric, and a dash of black pepper. After a couple minutes of simmering, let it sit for 10 minutes before drinking. Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties, and this is a good way to get it into your system.Eat some chicken soup. Traditional wisdom was right — chicken soup can help you recover from a cold. It boosts your immune system, and based on the ingredients, can add electrolytes and an array of vitamins, as well as helping to thin out mucus., The hot steam can help dislodge the mucus. The water can also help energize your skin while washing away some of the germs that have gathered on your body as you’ve been sick.

, Use hot water and a spoonful of salt, with an optional spoonful of hydrogen peroxide. You could also use hydrogen peroxide alone, but be careful to use a small amount (two teaspoons) at room temperature. You can also water it down, but it is very effective at clearing mucus."
"
Take an over-the-counter flu or cold medicine.,
Use a saline spray or nasal saline irrigation.,
Suck on cough drops.",How to Become Better when You Are Sick3," Look for the medicine that can apply to your particular situation. For example, cough medicine for a cough or a painkiller/fever reducer (like aspirin or ibuprofen) for headache and fever. Coughs can benefit from dextromethorphan, an ingredient in some cough syrups and suppressants that can help pause coughing. Address your congestion with medicines that contain the ingredients guaifenesin and pseudoephedrine. When in doubt, ask the pharmacist., Drugstores carry an array of products that help wash out the mucus and clean your nasal passages, from decongestant sprays to neti pots. The nasal irrigation products, including a neti pot, can feel weird (you have to pour a saline solution into one nasal passage and it comes out the other) but they can be extremely helpful. Be sure to use purified or filtered water (not tap water) in making your saline solution., Sore throats will often feel much better with a cough drop, which also prevents you from coughing as much. The ingredients help coat your throat and make you more comfortable. Consult the package — you shouldn’t suck them nonstop even though they might taste good."

Call your medical provider’s help line for more tips.,
Visit the doctor for extreme flu symptoms or if your cold doesn’t improve.,
Take the steps your doctor or medical professional recommends.",How to Become Better when You Are Sick4," Talking to a nurse or other medical professional can help tailor your recovery plan to you. A medical professional can also recommend a particular medicine or even call in a prescription to a pharmacy for you.

, Do not hesitate to go if your symptoms include a high fever (over 101°F or 38.3°C), chills that make you shake, an inability to keep down food or drinks, and bloody phlegm or mucus. Any of these elements will require more help than you can give yourself at home. , If she gives you a prescription, fill it and take it as long the doctor recommends. If she wants a follow-up visit, schedule it. Even if you think you are feeling a lot better and don’t need that medication or other visit, trust that your medical professional is recommending it for a reason. Don’t hijack your recovery.

Have a good posture.,
Wear tighter clothes.,
Enhance your height.,
Show the best features of your body.,
Wear dark colored clothes.,
Wear clothing with vertical stripes.",How to Become Taller Naturally2," Always stand straight instead of hunching your back. Spread out your shoulders slightly towards the back. Having a good posture will make you look much taller!

, Tighter clothes accentuate the lines of your body. If you wear baggy clothes, those lines disappear, making you look smaller. Wear slim-fitting clothes that make you feel good about yourself, however, not ones you're nervous about wearing or uncomfortable in.

, You can always wear high-heels. Avoid wearing flats or flip-flops. Instead, wear shoes with heels.

, If you have long legs, wear shorts or mini-skirts to highlight your legs. Try to avoid wearing leg warmers or leggings which will visually shorten your legs and make you look shorter.

, Sometimes, looking taller is all about looking slimmer. If you're able to look slimmer, there's a good chance you'll also look taller. Colors like black, dark blue, and forest green can all contribute to looking both slimmer and taller, especially if you go dark on both the top and the bottom.

, Wearing clothes with vertical stripes can make you look taller than you are. Horizontal stripes do the opposite, so avoid wearing horizontal stripes.

Address your priorities about work.,
Examine your relationship with your current job.,
Make an outline of how you feel about different aspects of your job.,
Think of specific instances in your career.,
Prepare to be asked questions about your work ethic.,
Provide an honest answer that implies a strong work ethic.,
Use real-life examples to support your answer.,
Describe a difficult scenario at your last job, and how you worked to solve it.,
Follow up with questions about the potential job.,
Ask questions about the team environment at the workplace.,
Avoid asking questions about benefits and pay.",How to Answer What Is Your Work Ethic," Is your job your first priority or are other aspects of your life more important?


You may find that your job is your first priority and you are able to fit in your other responsibilities around your work life.
A person with a healthy work-life balance is an attractive candidate to most companies. Many companies may even ask you about your interests outside of your field.;
, In order to best answer questions about your work ethic, you must first have a thorough understanding of how you, personally, relate to your job. Consider the following:


Your attitude towards work relates to how you approach occupational responsibilities. Someone with a strong work ethic has a positive, willing attitude when it comes to putting effort into a job.
Your feelings about work relate to how work affects your performance, and is an important contributing factor to overall work ethic. Work may make you feel energized, proud, and positive about yourself and your accomplishments. On the other hand, you may feel that work makes you feel stressed.
Your beliefs about work pertain to the role you give work in relation to life itself. For example, you may believe that work builds character and is central to a well-balanced life.

, Writing these ideas down might help you remember important details about your work ethic and your skill sets for an interview.


How do you feel about working with others? Describe both pros and cons about working directly with co-workers and clients.
How do you feel about continuing education and expanding your skills? Describe your attitude and feelings towards putting extra time into professional training.
How do you feel about working overtime or through difficult scenarios? Outline your attitudes towards working extra hours or through unfamiliar and difficult situations.

, These will help you describe the specifics of how your work ethic has benefitted you in your career. These can be things like:


Working with a team: Has there been a specific time where working with a team has been difficult or beneficial? How did working with others help or hinder you?
Working with a difficult client: Has there been a difficult scenario involving a client? How did you handle working with a client through a difficult problem while being sensitive to the clients needs and company restrictions?

, Other questions related to this might be about your attitude towards your current job, job performance, ability to work with others, skill sets, etc. Questions about your work ethic might not be phrased exactly as ""describe your work ethic"" or ""What is your work ethic?""
Similar questions might include: ""How would you describe yourself?"", ""How do you feel about working in a team?"", ""How do you feel about training and learning new skill sets?""

, Choose characteristics of your attitude, feelings and beliefs about work to give an answer that is true to you, and that presents your work philosophy in the best light.


For example, you may state that you approach work with dedication because you believe in doing your best, and when you do your best you feel accomplished and satisfied.
You might also say that you also do your best to make sure you enjoy your work, and that helps you to complete tasks with enthusiasm.
Stress that you see jobs as a continual learning experience and that you will always seek new training and workshops that will allow you to further your skills and contribute to your workplace in new, innovative ways. Employers will look for individuals who want to advance their own knowledge about their job and contribute new insights to their team.

, Consider situations you have been in that exemplify the work ethics you claim to have.


For example, if you say you place a high priority on honesty, cite a scenario in your life where you were especially honest in the face of difficult circumstances.
If you claim to work well with others, describe a group project that you successfully contributed to.

, Describe how you successfully troubleshooted and worked with others to come to a solution.Use concrete examples. You might say something along the lines of ""A client was having a problem with their account and they were very upset and angry. I was able to maintain being very calm and understanding while I worked to resolve the issue. I had to work directly with my manager to come up with a solution that addressed the clients and company needs at the same time. In the end, the client was happy with the solution and how I worked effectively with my team.""

, Employers are most interested in candidates which ask questions during an interview. There are very good questions to follow up a question about your personality, work ethic, or ability to work with others such as:""What skills and experiences would make an ideal candidate for your company?"" This is a good chance for your potential employer to lay all cards on the table and describe exactly what they are looking for. It can be a good way for you to follow up with more answers about yourself and your work ethic that you haven't covered yet.
""Do you offer professional training or continuing education?"" This is a good way to show that you are interested in continuing to learn new ways of doing your job and that you are willing to grow with the company.

, This shows you are interested in being part of a successful team and thinking of ways how your skills might contribute.""Can you tell me about the team I'll be working with?"" This question shows that you know you'll be working in a team environment and might lead to ways in which you can describe how well you have worked with others in the past.
"" Describe how your attitude and approach to work fits in with the company or team philosophy. You might say ""I'm an effective team player. I first evaluate where in a team project my skills would be most effective and offer strategies in that area. I offer support and positive feedback to my coworkers.""

, It is not a good idea to ask questions about benefits, time off, changing your work schedule, gossip you might have heard, or too many personal questions about your interviewer.Stick to specific questions about your potential jobs, the company in general, and the team you'll be working with.
Questions about benefits and salary can be addressed later in the hiring process rather than in an initial interview.

Work from the data that you have for a specific market sizing problem.,
Use your own logical methods to extrapolate estimates for market sizing.,
Understand the vagueness of market sizing questions and work with their versatility.",How to Answer Market Sizing Questions," Often, the challenge in market sizing problems is addressing various factors that could be called variables, because they may change over time or because they may not be transparent to the business involved in researching market sizing.


Collect your known elements. By understanding what you know, you can work on how to answer what you don't know.
Identify unknowns in a market sizing scenario. Try to isolate the questions that you will need to solve in a market sizing situation. Much like complex math, market sizing includes both static and variable components that work together to provide estimates of a market.;
,


Show your work. When you are answering market sizing questions, it often helps to let the questioner in on how you're going about solving a specific market problem. For instance, some employers have been known to ask such random questions as how many flights go over a specific city each day. Here, the savvy interviewer will start with basic elements like how many airports are in any given area, and start to estimate unknown variables like how many flights go out of each airport per day.

, It's important to keep in mind that many times there are no right answers for these types of questions, but only an approach that is critical to your value to an employer. In most cases, the interviewers are listening for how you would solve a general problem, evaluating your sense of logic and leadership. Don't be afraid to put your best foot forward as you approach a technical problem with creativity.

However, you may need to request an information packet.Read the job description carefully. If you don’t understand the job requirements, you won’t be able to answer the selection criteria successfully.


Make sure to save the job description or print it out so that you can refer to it later when you draft your answers.
Analyze whether you can fulfill the job duties. If you can’t, then you might not want to bother applying.;
, Their name and phone number should be listed in the job details.Tell the person you have read the selection criteria and ask what specific experience they are looking for.


Many selection criteria are written in a vague manner. For example, the selection criteria might say something like “Demonstrated excellence in communication skills and negotiation.” You probably have no idea what that means.In practice, your “negotiation” might be working with vendors to secure the best price. You won’t know that unless you call and ask more information.

, Key Selection Criteria (KSC) are the skills, knowledge, and qualities that you will need to successfully do the job. There are many common KSC, though each job will have its own list that you must respond to. Consider the following:ability to prioritize tasks
ability to develop and maintain systems
resilience to achieve goals
ability to identify a problem and propose a solution
ability to work in a teamword processing or other computer skills

, Return to your job description and highlight the particular selection criteria for the job you are apply for.Some criteria have more than one skill listed, so identify the skills requested in each criteria. Then drill down and analyze what they are really asking. For example:


The words “demonstrated” or “proven ability” refer to skills or tasks you have previously performed. You will need to refer to your actual experience and give specific examples when addressing this criterion.
When responding to language concerning your “abilities,” you should speak to your potential based on your previous experience or training.
Terms like “sound” or “high level” will require you to show you have advanced skill or knowledge in this area.
When the words “an understanding of” are used, you need to show both your in-depth knowledge of the subject but also explain its importance.
When asked about “desirable” criteria, you should draw from your extra-curricular and non-work activities., Take the first KSC and come up with concrete examples that illustrate each. For example, think about relevant experience, training, incidents, or personal qualities. Jot down your notes. Try to write down the following:The situation. Where were you? For example, you might have been in your first job as a secretary.
The action. What did you do? How did you do it? For example, you might have devised a new filing system for the office by organizing patient files alphabetically by last name and creating digital scans for easy access.
The outcome. What was the result of your action? Did it improve things? For example, the waiting time in your office might have declined because of how easy it became to find client files.

, Try to turn your notes into a short paragraph of about 100 words.Write in complete sentences and use connections such as “as a result,” “but,” and “for that reason.”


Analyze any specific examples. Do they seem vivid to you? Can you think of better ones?

, State that the selection criteria has been important in your work, or that you have extensive experience. For example, you can write, “Word processing has been an important responsibility in my two previous secretarial jobs.”You definitely need to mention the selection criterion in the first sentence, otherwise the employer will be confused as to what you are responding to.

, If you typed up documents, identify the types of document. If you solved problems, identify what types of problems you were confronted with (e.g., customer complaints about a product not working).


For example, you can write, “In my role as secretary to Mr. Nelson, I compiled numerous word processing documents. These included the following: word processing collation of official company documents, reports, executive summaries, and contracts; formatting and maintaining databases; formatting and drafting Power Point presentations; writing letters and memorandums.”, Highlight one situation or incident that vividly illustrates your skills in action. An employer reading your answers will probably remember the example more than anything else.


Continuing with the word processing example: “Each year, I was responsible for drafting the annual report for review by our Board of Directors. As part of that task, I imported data from multiple Access databases in order to create pie charts, tables, and other graphics to supplement the written report.”
The biggest mistake is not providing enough concrete examples.Go through your answers and bulk them up with specifics, if necessary.
If the KSC asks about two skills—e.g., problem solving and organization—provide an example for each.

, If you solved problems, then you should explain the result. Did you fix the problem? Did consumer complaints fall? You have to give the person reading your answer some idea of the effect of your contribution.


Explain results even if the KSC isn’t about problem solving. For example, you can write about your word processing skills: “The graphic presentations assisted the Board greatly when analyzing the company’s financial performance.”

, You can’t lie in your answers. Don’t claim to have experience that you don’t have. The employer will likely call your previous bosses and double check whether you did these tasks. You’ll be instantly rejected from a job if you lie.


Also avoid coming across as too perfect. You don’t want to say “I never make errors.” Instead, you can write, “I am committed to making as few errors as possible and quickly correcting those I do make.”, Answers should be sufficiently long to explain your experience. Generally, more senior roles will require about a page for each KSC. Junior positions will require one-half to three-quarters of a page per selection criteria.


However, reviewers might appreciate a shorter response.They are reading these back to back and will quickly tire.
Always check whether you have been given a word limit. If so, obey the limit.

, A full page of densely packed information will make an employer groan. For this reason, assess whether the text looks comfortable to read on the page. If not, use the following:


Use bullet points, where possible.If you’re listing accomplishments in one sentence, then bullet points help make the text easier to read. However, don’t have most of the answer consist of bullet points.
Break up giant paragraphs. You want plenty of white space on the page.
Select a comfortable font size and style. Avoid 10 point or smaller fonts.
Add section headings, if possible. You might provide an introductory paragraph and then a detailed example. You can set off the example with the word “Example” as a bolded section heading. If you have more than one example, use “Example 1” and “Example 2” as headings.

, Set your answers aside for a day or two and then proofread the work. Catch all typos, dropped words, and grammatical errors. Have another person read your answers, which will increase the chances of someone catching your mistakes.


You can also read your answers from the end. Start with the final sentence and then read the one before it. Work your way slowly to the beginning."

Though the specific rules will vary from business to business, usually, every day, week, or pay period worked will add a specific number of hours or days toward your total vacation time. For instance, in the U.S., it's common for an entry-level full-time employee to earn about two weeks (10 work days) of paid vacation per year.Assuming about 250 days of work per year (5 days per week × 52 weeks per year - 10 days for holidays), this means that each day worked earns about 1/25 (4%) of a paid vacation day.


As noted, however, vacation arrangements can vary greatly between jobs. For instance, some employers may grant all vacation days at the beginning of the year and allow the employee to use them as she pleases. Other jobs — especially part-time and ""temp"" jobs — may not allow for any paid vacation at all.
Note also that many employers choose to grant their employees ""sick days"" and/or ""personal days"" in addition to normal paid vacation time. These usually accrue at different rates than ordinary vacation days and are intended to be used for illnesses, moving, and other situations when the obligations of the employee's personal life interfere with his work commitment. However, it's common practice for employees to sometimes use these days for vacation time.;
, Sometimes, employers require that a new employee works a certain length of time before he becomes eligible for benefits, including vacation time and other paid time off. If this is the case for your job, you'll need to finish your probationary period before you begin to earn paid vacation time — there isn't really a way around this.


Like an employee's benefits, the length of a new hire's probationary period can vary from company to company. For instance, some companies have probationary periods of three months, while others have probationary periods twice as long.It's also important to note that employers may place an employee on ""probationary"" status for disciplinary reasons. If this is the case for you, you'll need to work with your employer to fix the problems that caused your probation to start accruing vacation time once again.

, Usually, long-term employees are rewarded for their loyalty with additional vacation time. Working for the same company over many years can have other benefits, as well, including raises, recognition, and additional work flexibility. If you're a relatively new hire but you're happy with your current job, consider aiming for a few years of good work to start earning additional vacation time.


While vacation policies differ greatly between employers, on average, new hires in the U.S. earn about 14 days of paid vacation per year, while employees who have been working for more than 15 years earn about twice as much at 27 days per year., Even with paid vacation time, it can be tricky to schedule a lengthy, refreshing break from work — sometimes, two weeks per year just doesn't cut it. For situations where employees need to take breaks longer than the amount of vacation time they have saved up, some employers allow their workers to buy additional time from other employees or the company itself. In these cases, the vacation time is almost always valued at the full value of the equivalent time worked — for instance, if you make $20 per hour, a full eight-hour day off of work would cost 8 × 20 = $160.


Note that, in these situations, the cost of the time off isn't usually paid as a lump sum. Instead, the cost is deducted in small amounts over a long period of time from the employee's regular paychecks., Independent contractors, seasonal workers, and most other part-time or temporary (""temp"") employees do not usually accrue vacation time, no matter how much they work. The logic behind this is that part-time workers have much greater flexibility in their hours than full-time workers, so they don't ""need"" as much vacation time.However, in reality, it's easy for a temp worker with one or more jobs to end up working long hours without accruing any sorts of benefits (including vacation time). If you're in this situation, try making the switch to full-time employment either by reworking your commitment at your current job or by finding new work.


If you're a temp worker and you're on good terms with your boss, you may want to cautiously try asking for enough work to qualify as full-time and start earning benefits. Note, however, that the prospects for temp workers can be slim in this regard — many temps have a difficult time making the transition to full-time work., As noted above, vacation days are often not the only type of paid leave offered by employers. Companies often offer a certain number of ""sick days"" and ""personal days"" per year for things like illnesses, moving days, and so on. While these often don't accumulate as rapidly as paid vacation days (for instance, some employers offer one sick day per month worked), you may want to use these to take breaks when possible to preserve your vacation time.Keep in mind that employers are also legally obligated to give you time off for certain types of important duties that are beyond your control. For instance, if you get a jury duty summons, most states have laws in place that require your employer to give you time off without requiring you to use your vacation days.Similar protections are in place for members of the armed forces or reserves who have periodic military duties. However, these laws do not always require your employer to pay you for the time off.
In addition, many employers offer several days of paid bereavement leave when a close family member dies. However, this is often not mandated by law., Most workplaces have a ""cap"" on the amount of vacation time that can be accrued. This means that once you have a certain level of vacation time saved up (like, for instance, three weeks), you won't continue to earn more vacation time, no matter how much you work. You want every hour that you work to go towards more vacation time, so if you're about to ""cap out"" on vacation time, seriously consider taking time off.


Vacation caps vary between employers — in many states, the law is worded to allow employers to offer as high or as low of a cap as is ""reasonable.""However, many state and private agencies set minimum recommended amounts. For instance, in California, the CEA (California Employers Association) recommends a ""cap"" of at least 1.5 times the annual amount of vacation accrued per year.

, Like wages, health insurance, 401(k) accounts, and other benefits, an employee's vacation time is subject to negotiation — especially in the U.S., where there is no national mandate for paid vacation time. If you can't get the level of vacation time you want without specifically asking for it, ask for it. If your employer is willing to talk, you may be able to reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of you.


However, it's worth noting that the strength of your bargaining position can vary greatly depending on your standing with your boss, the quality of your work, your current hours, the desirability of your skills, and more. In general, employees who are on good terms with their boss, who have a record of good work, and who have high-demand skills are more likely to fare well in negotiations.
If you've decided to negotiate with your employer (or potential employer), see the section below for helpful advice on getting the level of vacation that you want.

, If you're unable to get the amount of vacation time you need at your current job by using any of the strategies above, you may want to consider looking for other work. If you have a proven record of good work, highly sought-after skills, or both, there's a chance you may be able to secure a greater amount of paid vacation at a new job than at a current one.


Keep in mind, however, that when you leave a job you forfeit all of the paid vacation you've saved up for that job. About half of the fifty states have laws that require an employee to be paid for his unused time off when he quits or is fired.If you don't live in one of these states, strongly consider taking your vacation before you quit.

, One of the most important things an employee can take to the negotiating table is thorough knowledge of her field of work. Employers have an interest in keeping their wages and benefits competitive with their competitors — if they don't, they'll lose skilled employees to companies that are more generous. Before asking for more vacation time, do some research to find out the average amount of paid vacation time awarded to employees with jobs similar to yours in other countries. If you can prove that you're receiving less vacation time than is normal in your field, it will strengthen your bargaining position.


One great source of this information is the U.S. Department of Labor (specifically, its Bureau of Labor Statistics), which, among many other things, regularly publishes data on the sorts of benefits offered to employees in a variety of fields., When asking for vacation, it's a smart idea to ask for a little more than you actually want. This gives you plenty of room to negotiate — you may get what you ask for, but if your employer ""pushes back"", you're more likely to get the amount of vacation you actually wanted than if you had started with your original number. As long as your request isn't completely outlandish, it's unlikely that you'll damage your relationship with your boss by simply asking for the extra time.

, For any sort of workplace negotiation, it's usually in your best interest to frame yourself as someone with a steady, dependable record of good work. Before you negotiate, take some time to review the work you've done recently and find a few examples of times when you've gone beyond your normal duties and done especially good work. If your employer is reluctant to give you the vacation time you want, you can bring these up to demonstrate your hard work and loyalty and claim that a little extra vacation will help you keep up your high-quality output.


Statistically, taking occasional vacation leave is good for most workers' productivity. Research has found that, if every worker in the U.S. were to take just one more day of vacation each year, the U.S. economy would create an estimated $73 billion in revenue from the additional productivity., Just as important as the work you've already done for you (if not more so) is the work you'll do in the future. Telling your employer that you need the time off to keep the quality of your work high (with the implication that not taking a vacation will leave you unable to do your job properly in the future) can help your boss understand the importance of giving you a break.


Again, science supports the idea that vacation time can help make you a better worker overall. Research has shown that vacation time is one of the most important ways to prevent ""burnout"" — a state of intense fatigue and dissatisfaction that leads to dramatically reduced productivity.

, Would it be a good idea to tell your boss that you plan on taking a two-week vacation the day before you plan to leave? Unless you have an unusually generous manager, the odds are that it is not. For the same reason, you'll want to ask for major increases in your vacation benefits well in advance of when you'll actually need it. This gives you two benefits — not only does it make you appear more kind and thoughtful in the eyes of your employer, but also gives you a better bargaining position. Since you don't need the extra vacation time right away, it will be harder for your employer to force you to settle for the bare minimum.

, Every negotiation with your manager is a give-and-take. To get what you want, you may have to give something back to your employer. For instance, if you want the freedom to work from home on certain days as a sort of ""semi-vacation,"" you may be asked to take a minor cut in your salary. It's up to you to work out an arrangement that's satisfactory for you and your employer.


As a very general rule, you'll never want to take a reduction in pay in exchange for vacation time that's equal to or greater than the amount of money you could have made from working during your vacation. Agreeing to this is against your financial interests — in effect, it's reducing your wages for no net benefit to you.

, Perhaps the absolute best way to get what you want from your current employer is to prove that you can get it somewhere else. If you can get a job offer from another employer that includes the amount of vacation time you want, you win regardless of the outcome of your negotiations. There are one of two possibilities: your employer will either agree to give you the amount of vacation time you want, or you'll be able to leave for the other job (and get the amount of vacation time you want). Either way, you come out ahead, so don't be afraid to leverage this aggressive strategy if you can.


The problem with this strategy, unfortunately, is that it requires you to put in extra effort outside of work to get the job offer in the first place. This can be difficult, especially if you're already working long hours. Don't get discouraged — many business experts agree that being employed makes you more attractive to potential employers.See our resume-writing and interview-prep articles for more information!
It goes without saying, but you definitely don't want to do your job-searching work on the company dime. If your employer finds out you're looking for other work, you run a major risk of being let go.

Keep the flow happening from your life at work to your time spent outside of work.",How to Add Zen to Your Workplace," These include: Chi, career area, life, green, purple, etc. These words are used to express the idea that bringing natural and life-oriented organization and imagery into your working spaces will help you to de-stress, focus and ultimately bless your career and wealth.

, Just focus on organization, simplicity, and success.

, Cleaning crews may occasionally make the rounds, but aside from an empty wastebasket, it is usually hard to notice as they're not invested in truly cleaning your space. Bring in your own supplies--not only for this feng-shui project, but also to use on a regular basis to get at the dirt most cleaning crews always seem to miss.


Try a natural combination of water, vinegar and tea tree oil.
Also, do not use an artificial sponge or similar; try wiping things down with a fabric cloth as this increases your sensory connection with cleaning and reduces the waste impact on our planet from overuse of paper towels and disposable rags.;
, Empty all cabinet and drawer contents, to clean the shelves and inside. Clear your desk of everything and wipe it down--keyboard, mouse and monitor included. Just pile everything onto the floor and under your desk until your storage spaces are clean.


Make sure you remove, recycle, or re-organize paper piles as they leave a subconscious feeling of unfinished work and stress.

, If possible, arrange the computer monitor(s) so that your back is not facing the door, which is bad feng-shui. Facing away from the entrance forces you to work under the constant anticipation of someone surprising you from behind, and blocks good chi (the very energy that feng-shui is intended to help you attract). If you are unable to face the door, hang a mirror on your cubicle wall beside your monitor, positioned in such a way that you can see when people come to your door or come up from behind you. This mirror will also attract light and good chi into your cube.

, If there is anything in your cubicle that you do not need--old files left by the last employee, a three-hole punch that you never use, a pen holder that you hate--get rid of it. Dig into those files that have been building and bulging for months, maybe even years. Get rid of what you can and straighten up the rest. If you cannot return it to a supply closet, ask your manager or supervisor how to get rid of those space wasting items.


Do not push your unwanted items on to a co-worker. It is not fair to ruin their chi while you try to balance yours.

, Avoid the habitual inclination to put everything back where it was. Put some thought, but not too much effort, into where items are best utilized.


Do not scatter documents, calendars and post-its around your desk. Keep these items carefully filed and organized, making room to add inspirational items. The latter can be photos, drawings, figurines––anything that brings you joy and inspires you. However, beware again of over-cluttering your workspace with knickknacks.
Space is at a minimum in cubicles, so people often use the area under their feet for storage. Find a new place to store your personal belongings (i.e. in a drawer, in your car). At the very least, make sure the area directly below your feet is clear. You should be able to sit straight when you view your computer screen. Sitting sideways can cause numerous health issues.
Also, do not fill any overhead shelves with books or other heavy items. If you do, you may feel downward pressure, like a literal weight on your shoulders. Items overhead can also lead to headaches.

, Light is a symbol for energy, and natural sunlight helps us to energize and jump start our bodies every morning. Make sure that your desk or cubicle has a good amount of light to give you energy and focus. If you need, bring in additional lamps or reading lights.


Turn your light on to increase the energy of the space and invite visitors.

, Artificial, man-made things can almost literally suck the life out of you. Avoid turning your career into a job-like prison. Add life to your workspace by bringing in living plants and other naturally themed items to your office. Plants can also increase the energy levels you experience when you work. Try to focus on things that would increase your mental energy and relaxation. Just don't over clutter again with a whole botanical garden.


Placing a plant in your cubicle enhances the life energy in the space. Consider a money tree plant, bamboo or jade. The plant should be healthy, green and alive, connecting you to nature. The color of green is representative of wealth. A soothing water fountain also creates active, positive chi and encourages only abundance-building individuals and energy to enter through your cubicle opening.
If you are a music lover, try to create a collection of natural sounds that will help make even the most hectic workday a bit for peaceful. For example, try: http://naturesoundsfor.me/.
Hang some pictures of landscapes on your cubicle walls. It creates the illusion of windows, through which chi flows, but also creates for you the kind of peaceful environment you need to feel at ease, which is the ultimate intention of feng-shui. Bodies of water are especially helpful, as water is associated with the career area of your life. Hang this picture on the wall that your door is on, as this is the career area of your space.
Your company may not permit burning a candle at your desk, but consider keeping peppermints in your drawer or a small citrus air freshener under your desk. Periodically during the day, as you reach in your drawer for supplies, you will catch a draft of the clean refreshing scent. These scents awaken your spirit and give you an all-natural pick-me-up in the middle of the day.

, Keep the chi flowing by staying social and keeping up relationships.


Treat yourself to lunch with your teammates so that you can share successes, seek guidance, and share the tips from this article.
Place a small jar of candy in your cubicle. It encourages others to stop by to say hello and grab a treat.
Do activities that promote communication which will increase the flow of energy, wealth and happiness.

There are a lot of factors to consider when trying to find your perfect away-from-home working space;however, there are certain things that anyone working in a coffee shop is likely to want.


A comfortable place to sit that is warm or cool enough for your liking.
A menu that you enjoy with reasonably priced items.
Free Internet access.
A place where you can sit for long periods of time without being asked to leave outright... or subtly.;
, It's also a sensible precaution to select a range of possible coffee shops to use should one be too crowded or closed for any reason. Things to consider include:


Crowds. The noise from a crowded coffee shop can make it hard to think, but the activity from all the people might actually be energizing and inspirational.
Music. Shops that play music can create a distracting atmosphere, or the music may be invigorating. Mostly this depends on you, your mood, your tastes, and the music being played.
A relaxed atmosphere. In general, this is a good thing; however, some people work better in the middle of a vibrant buzz.

, It never hurts to research shops ahead of time. There are many resources that will help you find the right coffee shop for you without having to drive all over the place. Try a little research to avoid disappointment.


The iPhone app, WHA (Work Hard Anywhere) allows users to find laptop-friendly coffee shops in their area by showing a bar graph that rates things such as internet speed, noise level, and the accessibility of power outlets.Websites such as Workfrom use crowd-sourced reviews (similar to YELP) to inform visitors of laptop-friendly coffee shops as well.WOM! No, this isn’t another app, it simply stands for “word of mouth” and it is considered one of the most powerful forms of advertising. Simply ask people if they have experience with any local shops that are laptop friendly. People are usually very happy to share their opinions.

, If you don't want to have to make trips back and forth between the coffee shop and your home office, make certain you are equipped with everything you need, or even might need, ahead of time. Items to consider:


Laptop, iPad, or other form of text processing or Internet access device. You may or may not need this; for some, a simple notepad and pencil may suffice depending on what your work consists of.
A suitable bag to carry your laptop, files, books, etc. Choose one that is comfortable to wear and sits well between your feet or next to you.
Extra batteries for any of your electronic equipment. Better safe than sorry.

Think with resolve and leaving emotion out of it, often agree with portion of it. Next, a strong character will incorporate feedback into their work and produce an improved work product. Guard against excessive emotion. Attaching your self-worth to the feedback creates disconnect and havoc in the mind and that will result in even more chaotic work product. A strong character listens, incorporates and acts with others in mind.;
, If the boss has some accurate points, own them. Listen to how you can improve and do it! There is nothing wrong with the ultimate result here.

We have 20/20 vision looking toward the outside and often cloudy vision when looking inward. Anger alienates the boss and reduces your chance for success. Most Managers want you to succeed. Feedback is designed to ensure your success. They don't want to re-hire or train a replacement. Wasted resources are never a good idea.

, If your job is routine, say taking phone calls and creating tasks. Make a 3 X 5 card of the 5 most critical steps in producing perfect work. Check these off with EVERY transaction.

, Just run through it again. Verify phone numbers, client or order numbers, return messages, follow through steps. It only takes a second and it will eliminate the next dreaded step in correction action. You will become known as a person who produces reliable work every time

, Stop in - don't be afraid - ask if she has a minute and just see if there has been any follow up. Exercise coolness and prudence in the workplace. Professionalism always pays off. Professionalism with a smile is even better.

, It is always better to produce an excellent product with a little time added, than to go back and re-do anything.

, Calmness regulates your feelings and keeps your responses reasonable. When you feel an angry or emotional response welling up inside you, grab onto in and replace it with a calm demeanor with all your senses directed at absorbing what is being said to you.

Calculate transit time between activities, and then add 10-30 minutes for unexpected delays.
If you overschedule out of fear of downtime, give yourself something pleasant or productive to do during waits. You might bring a novel you like, or use waiting time to catch up on your email.

It's highly likely that there are other people in your life just as suitable to run some of your errands and do some of your chores, from family members to staff.
Look at each thing on your calendar and ask yourself what end it serves.
If you have multiple commitments that serve similar ends, cut some from each category.
Only do the things that don't take you right out of your way and that are things you're able to do in a timely way. Over stretching yourself harms your health and your interactions with others.

, Look for activities that suck up your day, like going online, playing video games, watching shows, cleaning, or worrying. Even helping other people can be a time suck. If you have certain activities that cause you to forget the time, schedule them for moments when they won't make you late for anything.Staying connected all the time may seem efficient and clued in but it can all too easily mean that you're not noticing time passing by.
If checking emails or playing games causes you to be late for meetings or appointments or it's causing you to miss deadlines or other things that need doing in life, it's time to realign your priorities.

Buying one drink every two to three hours of work is considered fair.If you are working through lunchtime, consider buying your lunch from their menu.
Tip the baristas well. This will also likely keep you from suffering “the evil eye” after you’ve taken up a table for a few hours.

, You don’t need to take another seat for your laptop bag, etc. Put them on the floor if you need to. Leave the chairs for other customers.Chose a bag with a long strap to wrap around your ankle if you are concerned about someone possibly taking it.

, Try your best to make one table work for you by not spreading out too much.


One way to conserve space is to have as many of your work materials already in digital form on your laptop or on flash drives.

, Coffee shops make their money in direct proportion to the number of customers they serve. If they can’t turn over your table because you keep overstaying your welcome, the shop will lose customers and profit.


As long as you keep spending money, most places welcome you to stay until closing, but you should NEVER stay past closing time.
If you are freeloading, eight hours is considered pushing it, so take that into consideration.Consider using a timer on your phone or laptop to signal when you may be coming to the end of a reasonable stay.

, It may be best to avoid working in the shop during times when they generate their key profits from turning tables.Try having two shops or more to frequent that have different high volume schedules and then working your schedule to accommodate those times.

, Although shops generally don’t require you to do so, it’s a very good way of showing consideration for the employees.


As a regular who cleans up after themselves, you are likely to find employees will be much more receptive to your long visits., If you go to the restroom, take easily carried valuables like your phone and wallet with you, and ask a trusted neighbor to keep an eye on the remainder of your stuff.


If you are a regular who has earned the respect of the employees, you will often find they will be receptive to keeping an eye on your things.

Manage your time.,
Set specific goals.,
Use headphones to shut out noise.,
Take periodic breaks.,
Be prepared for unwanted interruptions.",How to Work From A Coffee Shop3," Decide how often you'll work from a coffee shop. It may not be practical to work there daily, especially if you have a lot of reference texts, papers, and other information you need at your home or studio space. However, every freelancer should be able to slot in at least one occasion a week that is marked for working outside the home so that you can have the chance to mingle with people and soak up the energy from being near others.


Creating a regular schedule will depend on your ease of getting to the shop as well as what days and hours the shop is open.
Don’t forget to factor in travel time. For a suburban worker it's going to take more effort than for someone already situated near a cafe and restaurant district.

, Ask yourself ahead of time how you can best use your time away from your office. Plan out what you want to accomplish by the end of the visit.


It can help to write down your goals in a calendar or activity book so that you can prepare ahead of time and keep track of what you have, or have not, accomplished.

, These can be an excellent way to stay focused on your work if the ambient noise is distracting. They will also come in handy if you need to listen to an audio or video file.

, Sitting at a desk in front of a computer screen for long periods of time can cause serious health problems, so it's a good idea to schedule in your breaks from the computer.Look away from the computer every fifty minutes or so to refocus your eyes from the screen.
Get up and stretch to refresh and restore your circulation.
Enjoy a breather; just don't forget to eventually get back to work!

, Working in a coffee shop can attract attention. A curious bystander might try to strike up a conversation with you. Being friendly is great, but be aware that too many interruptions will likely prevent you from finishing your work.


If you don't wish to be disturbed, you can smile and say something like: ""I wish I had time to chat, but I'm on deadline. Maybe I can catch you during a break."" This is friendly but also keeps you in control of your time.

Remind yourself that being punctual as a matter of good etiquette.,
Keep in mind that being punctual is practical.,
Be timely out of love.,
Consider the consequences of lateness.,
Honor time.",How to Stop Running Late2," Being late is inconsiderate, while being on time is an expression of respect toward others. You lack the power to restore time other people have lost waiting for you, so it's disrespectful to assume you have the right to take it from them without good cause. While the etiquette of being on time varies according to the occasion, punctuality is always respectful. The following situations all require punctuality:Eating occasions: Always be prompt for a meal – the cook deserves respect and the food grows cold as it waits.
As for a date in a restaurant, aim to be on time; it is unacceptable to be more than five minutes late.
When invited to a dinner party, time it well so that you're not early (the host will still be preparing and doing last minute fixes) and so that you're no later than ten to fifteen minutes after the invited time.
If you realize you're not going to make a dinner party on time, ring the host and inform them so that they don't keep warming the meal to destruction while waiting for you.

, In many situations, arriving late will prevent you from taking part in the activity you are planning.


Always arrive early for a movie or theater date with friends or others: If you have to purchase tickets, be there in plenty of time for lining up in what might be long queues. If you already have the tickets, arrive around 10 minutes before the show or movie begins.
Show up a few minutes early for appointments with doctors, lawyers, hairdressers, and other professionals. Be on time; their time is money as a business and by being late, you impact their earnings and the next customers. If you're going to be late, call ahead and advise them.
A job interview: Being late by even half a minute is too late. Always be on time for a job interview if you want the job.
A business meeting: Be right on time if not earlier to set up for presentations.

, Treat being on time as a matter of expressing love. Coordinating schedules allows you to be part of a team. Think of how much it means to your partner, friends, family, and even coworkers that you respect their time and appreciate their timeliness.

, If you're an optimistic person, or if you are dealing with ADD or ADHD, you may underestimate the negative consequences of showing up late.Spend some time thinking about the possible repercussions of missing an upcoming event.
Promise yourself that you will avoid these negative repercussions by showing up on time.

, Getting in touch with time requires focusing on it directly. People who are late often lack a consciousness of time as a concept that needs to be harnessed to get the most out of one's life.



Meditation may be a good way to open up the channels to a better understanding of time.
You might also try keeping an appointments diary, making plans for your day each morning, and writing estimates of how long each activity might take you and a record of how long it actually did take you."

Pinpoint why you're a perpetually late person.,
Look at your anxiety.,
Ask yourself if you're arriving late to test others.,
Identify processing failures.",How to Stop Running Late3," If you're perpetually late, it may help you to keep track of what's making you late. Figure out if you're late due to psychological reasons or processing errors.


Ask yourself if you are always late by the same amount of time. If you are, your problem is probably psychological. If the time varies, it's probably organizational.Spend a minute at the end of the day taking notes on your lateness. What were you late to? What were you doing that prevented you from arriving on time? What feelings were you having?
Make note of any worries you had, or any times you got stuck.
Consider any errors you made in your calculations.
When you've done this for a week or two, look over your notes. Do you see any patterns?

, Do you stress intensely about things you feel you can't do, don't want to do, or can't find the resources to do? Does this lead you to cancel events, or arrive so late they can't really take place?


If you suspect this is the case, talk to a counselor about your anxiety. You may find talk therapy or medication to be helpful.

, If you're insecure about your importance to others, you may arrive late to prove your own necessity. Ask yourself if being late make you feel needed. Do you feel superior because others must wait?Does being late help you feel assured of another person's love for you? Does making people wait for you serve as a way of confirming that they're willing to sacrifice their time and presence for your sake?
If this is the case, you might want to talk to a psychologist about improving your self esteem.

, You may arrive late because you genuinely struggle with spatial and temporal calculations. You may have a processing disorder, or an attention disorder like ADD or ADHD.If this is your issue, you may underestimate the time you need. Try timing your regular trips so that you have an actual estimate available to you.
If you're going somewhere new, look it up on an app like Google Maps first.
Pad your time. Even if you look up the distance, you may need extra time, especially if you get lost on the way.

Finish projects before you leave.,
Write a plan for the work you need to do when you get back from vacation.,
Set an out of office auto-reply message.,
Leave work at work.",How to Unwind During a Week Off Work1," If you have a project hanging over your head during your vacation, you will not be able to relax. Finish major projects before you leave, even if it means working more. You’ll thank yourself later. Leave your team ready to continue in your absence. Before your vacation, spend the previous week making sure everyone else has what they need to do their jobs well. With everyone else able to continue getting the work done, you do not need to worry about it yourself.;
, If you have a plan for getting the work done, you will not feel overwhelmed by it. If your plan doesn’t include working on your vacation, you can reassure yourself that as long as you stick to the plan, it will get done.


Your plan should be specific. Include precisely what work will get done and when you will do it.Part of the stress of leaving work is the uncertainty about work that still needs doing. Your plan will help remove that uncertainty.

, You can set up your e-mail to auto-reply to e-mail you receive. This will let people know when you will be back and when they can expect a reply. This saves you from having to worry about unanswered e-mail.


Specify that you will not be able to check your e-mail for the entire duration of your time off work. This will help give you the freedom from feelings of obligation to check and respond to messages. Setting up the auto-reply message will depend on the e-mail client you use. Regardless, it is a simple process.

, This can be easier said than done. However, one of the most stressful things about a vacation can be thinking about all of the things that need to be done when you return.


Leave behind any physical work (e.g. paperwork), in the office. If you take it with you, you will feel pressured to work on it.
If you're really inclined to bring work home, lock it into your filing cabinet or cupboard at work and give a co-worker the key. Tell them to give the key back to you only when you return to work.

Go to bed early.,
Exercise.,
Pamper yourself.,
Do things outside your normal routine and activities.,
Catch up on projects around the house.,
Invite friends over dinner and a movie.",How to Unwind During a Week Off Work2," It can be easy to go to sleep late when you do not have to get up for work the next day. However, rest is an important part of unwinding. Create a bedtime routine during your week off. Sticking to a routine will help get your brain in the mindset that it is time to sleep.
Turn off lights, leave your electronic devices in another room and shut the shades or curtains. Remove as many distractions as possible to help get sufficient sleep. , Go for a run, jog, or walk. If you have a gym membership, go to the gym. Working out can relieve tension and help you get out of your usual routine. If possible, run or walk in your community, rather than indoors on a treadmill or track.


Studies have shown that as little as 20 minutes of exercise per day helps encourage relaxation, Take some time out to treat your body as well as seeking to relax your mind. The two aren't always separate!


Get a massage. Massages help your mind to relax, in addition to your muscles Take a hot bath. , Occupy yourself with unusual activities that break up your usual daily rhythm.


Do puzzles, crosswords, and play board games. You'll enjoy the different sort of intellectual stimulation.
Spend some time learning a new hobby like knitting or playing a musical instrument. Completely engaging our mind in something actually helps us to relax. , You have time off, but that doesn't mean you can't get some things done. It can be relaxing to get projects done that have been lingering for a long time.


Take an afternoon and finally clean our your basement or attic.
Put photos from your last trip in a photo album.

, It can be difficult to find the time to have social events during your regular work schedule, so find time for them during your week off.


Try making a new food or dish you have been wanting to try.
Play some board games for a fun group activity

Schedule in transition time.,
Avoid technology.,
Do fewer things, but spend more time on them.,
View your vacation as an experience, rather than a task.,
Avoid social media.,
Try new activities.",How to Unwind During a Week Off Work3," Instead of leaving early the first day you have off from work and returning late the night before you have to go back to work, consider leaving and returning a day earlier. You will have less time at your destination, but you will not have to rush, and will be able to enjoy your vacation more.


You do not have to leave a full day later or a full day sooner. Even considering the time of day you will leave or return can make a big difference. , Our laptops, smartphones and other devices are often associated with work. When on vacation, leave them behind whenever possible. Try not to check your work e-mail, and check your personal e-mail only rarely.


At night, keep screens off and phones away from the bedside. The light from devices can throw off your sleep cycles. , Your vacation should not be a checklist, but rather an experience. It is easy to let your vacation become like work. Try to deliberately schedule fewer things than you have time for, and then spend more time on them.


Take the time to do one thing per day and enjoy it, instead of rushing around to several attractions just to have seen them. , That experience begins with the planning and continues after the vacation is over when you remember it. Studies show that a lot of happiness comes from planning vacations, so let yourself enjoy the anticipation.


Studies also show that experiences tend to lead to more happiness than material things. Focus less time on getting the photos and souvenirs. Instead, focus on being in the moment an experiencing things., While it can be tempting to tweet, share photos on facebook, and otherwise keep in touch with your friends, it can quickly turn into an exhausting task. Put down your devices and avoid social media until you return. There will be plenty of time to show off those photos later.


This will also help you avoid instances where social media overlaps with work, and therefore brings you back into the work world.
Consider destinations that do not have good cellular service, data connectivity, and internet access. Although it can feel odd to be disconnected, it also helps you relax. , Vacations are a great chance to try something new. Try something you can’t normally do where you live, like water skiing. Doing something entirely new can help you break out of your normal routine and embrace the moment.


You do not need to try things well outside your comfort zone. Instead, choose something that sounds enjoyable and fun. You don’t need to push yourself. Just do something new. "

Find out all the particulars.,
Thank the employer for the offer, even if it’s horrible.,

Do your homework.,

Listen to your gut during the entire negotiation process.,
When asking for a salary, ask for a precise number.,
Don't play the pity card.,
Be courteous, understanding, and never burn bridges.,
Be confident.",How to Negotiate a Job Offer," It's important to know what you have to work with when you're offered a job. Ask the hiring manager or your liaison in the company about the dimensions of the offer, and be sure to get them in writing. These include:


What is the salary?
Where is the job located and would there be any relocation reimbursement if you had to move?
What are the benefits? (401(k), paid vacation time, remote working opportunities, etc.)
Is there a signing bonus?
What is the starting date?;
, Always appear gracious and thankful when accepting any offer. Try to conceal any feelings of disappointment if you receive a low ball offer — the idea of negotiating is to not tip your hand.

, When you get your offer, don't be so star-struck by its shininess that you immediately accept or start the negotiation process right away. Give yourself some time to think things over rationally. Say something like ""I appreciate your offer. I'm very excited about starting, but am still waiting to hear back from several other organizations. Can we discuss the offer again in a week?""


Talk with the hiring manager about the company's expectations for hearing back and try to reach a middle ground. If they want the position to be filled immediately, you may want to give them an answer sooner rather than later. A reasonable amount of time to think about the offer is anywhere from a day to a week.
Don't be worried about losing the job offer after asking for time to decide. This happens very rarely. An employer that really wants you will give you as much time — within reason — as is necessary to decide. An employer that makes an offer and rescinds it before you've made a decision is likely to cut corners, cheat, and generally treat its employees poorly. Consider yourself lucky to have gotten out!

, Know what you are saying “yes” to before you sign on the dotted line. Obtain a financial history of the company to determine if this is the type of company you want to align yourself with and whether you see a future at the business.


Talk to other employees. If you have friends or business connections with the company ask for a candid response to what it is like to work for the company. You never really know what the work conditions are like until you talk to someone who is on the inside. If you don’t personally know anyone at the company, don’t try to talk to a random employee but instead look for message boards online where you could pick up cues or hints within threads between employees.
Obtain the company mission statement. Consider if the mission statement is something you agree with or whether it isn't aligned with your personal work ethics or goals.

, Ask yourself what advantages and disadvantages the potential job has for important areas in your life. Because you'll be spending the majority of your waking week at work, finding a good personal and professional fit is extremely important. Consider these three needs:



Individual needs. Does the job satisfy your intellectual needs, creativity, and natural curiosity? Do you think you could fit in with the company culture? Would you be motivated about and excited for work?

Family needs. Is the job likely to be compatible with your family duties and interests? Is the job geographically close enough to give you enough time to spend at home? Can you imagine your family thriving with other families in the company?

Career goals. Can you imagine furthering your career with the organization? Is there room for growth? Do they offer competitive training, job experience, and pay to make this a ""step up"" from where you were before? Is there job security?

, Knowing what the company’s competitors will offer may provide you with leverage during negotiations. Research salary and benefits from two to three competing companies using career search engines on Careers.com, Monster.com or Salary.com. Take into consideration that each comparable job may offer different perks and benefits, but use the general information to make comparisons to the possible offer on the table.

, Leverage is ability exert control or influence over a situation. Brainstorm things that might give you leverage. You'll use these things as bargaining chips very soon:


Stronger leverage:

You're a great candidate in a highly sought-after position
You have a respectable offer from another company in a related field/industry


Weaker leverage:

You know the company wants to fill the position soon
You know what the ""industry standard"" salary for the position is



, Shoot them a quick call in order to set up a meeting to talk in person. Don't start the negotiation process over the phone, or worse, over email. It's harder to say ""no"" to someone in person than it is over the phone. Plus, the human connection of face-to-face interaction will be important later on in your job — don't treat it lightly!

, The minimum offer is the absolute lowest salary you'll take. The target salary is what you'd like your salary to be. Establish what these two numbers are for you. The more leverage you have, the lower the difference between these two numbers will be.

, What you'll want to try to do is ask for a higher salary without actually stipulating a number.


Why not stipulate a number? If you place the burden of renegotiating your salary back on the employer — and they know their initial offer was too low — they'll think long and hard about offering you a number that doesn't lowball you twice in a row.If you get the employer to offer first, you're putting yourself in a position of power.Here's how you might bring it up: ""I'm excited about the opportunity to start, and I feel like our partnership is going to be beneficial for both parties. Is there any way we can increase the starting salary?"" If the salary is non-negotiable, decide whether the salary is a serious sticking point for you. (it doesn't need to be.) If it is negotiable, continue trying to get what you want.

, At this point, the employer is starting to squirm, and they're hoping you'll make the tactical mistake of blurting out a number, which they could say is out of their budget. Don't budge. Here's a hard-line scenario of what the employer might say if s/he's dead set on having you spit out a number, and what you can say in response:


Employer: ""Well, what do you have in mind for a starting salary?""

You: ""Given my would-be job responsibilities, I was hoping my starting salary would be a little higher.""

Employer: ""Our salary is negotiable, and we certainly want you on board, but until we know what you're asking for, I'm a little in the dark.""

You: ""My rates are competitive with market rates of individuals in with years of experience.""

Employer: ""I really don't know what to offer unless you give me a ballpark figure.""

You: ""A competitive rate for my services would be somewhere in between and ."" If you need to, you can give the employer a salary range, but this will still force the ball onto their court.

, This may involve an uncomfortable silence, but it's worth the momentary awkwardness. When the employer says the number, smile but wait to speak. Mull it over. There's a chance that the employer could perceive this as hesitance on your part, prompting them to immediately offer an even higher number.

, Put yourself in the employer’s shoes if you plan to re-negotiate a better offer. While you may think the employer should bump up your salary by $20,000, realistically that may not be possible. At the same time, staying firm about a high number could help you chip away at a the gap between your minimum salary and your target salary.Keep your offer high if you think you have leverage.


Start to use your leverage. Do you have another offer from a competitor? Are you highly sought-after talent? While not bragging or showboating, make your case for why you should get the job at or near the salary you're asking for.
Be ready to walk away. When putting together a better offer, remember that the employer may not be able to meet your requirements. If that’s the case, consider just walk away. It's a risky strategy, but you could call the employer's bluff and get an offer of just what you wanted all along.

, If the salary discussion grows stagnant, and it feels more like bickering than a fruitful conversation, consider trying to get make your case for added perks or benefits. Ask for things like a matching contribution to your 401(k), additional paid time off, or even a defined travel stipend. Although these things seem small, they can have a huge financial impact over the course or months or even years.

, After you've used your leverage to negotiate your best salary and benefits, get the offer in writing. If the employer doesn't put the offer in writing, they might not honor the details of the contract come starting day, and you could find yourself in the unenviable position of needing to make your case all over again when you realize the facts aren't straight. Unfortunately, this does happen. Make sure to get the offer in writing!

, The entire interview process is an opportunity for both parties to get a feel for one another. It may seem like they're the one interviewing you, but you're also interviewing them! If it feels like the employer is constantly trying to wiggle out of firm commitments, tell untruths, or intimidate you into accepting a lower salary, consider whether you actually want to work there. If they're willing to do these things, it probably won't be pleasant to work with them for a long period of time.


The negotiation process is war, but it's the 16th century equivalent of war, not the anything-goes modern equivalent. The negotiation process should be civil, filled with ""honor,"" and governed by rules. If it feels a bit too much like Vietnam instead of the Battle of Agincourt, run far away, knight.

, In salary negotiations, asking for $58,745 is a lot better than asking for $60,000, even if it's asking for less money. Why?


New research suggests that people who ask for a precise salary instead of a round figure are perceived by employers to better know their worth. The idea is that a precise number tells people you've done your homework on comparable market rates.On the flip side, the perception of people who ask for a round number, such as $60,000, is that they don't have specific knowledge of what the job entails or what the market is priced at.

, Don't invoke your sick spouse or your children's rising daycare costs during the negotiation. The employer doesn't want to hear about it, and could even be negatively affected by its mention. The employer wants to hear about your skills, and why they make you a great fit for the job and a steal at the price you're asking for. Focus on them!

, During the negotiation, be on your best behavior. You probably will get flustered, annoyed, or even afraid, but try to maintain your calm and civility. It's in your best interests. You never know — the person you're negotiating with may end up being a working partner or direct supervisor.Even if the negotiation stalls and you end up taking a different job, circumstances can change; you might find yourself looking for a reference, a job, or a referral later on. Being courteous and keeping those connections alive will help you later on.

, Be confident in your skills, your past experience, and your ability to secure the best deal for yourself. Your high (but entirely reasonable) estimation of yourself should translate into a high estimation by your potential employer.


Power pose your way to increased confidence by striking an open, relaxed pose during the interview process. Scientists have discovered that people who ""power pose"" for just minutes at a time have increased testosterone, reduced stress, and are perceived by other people as being more in control."

Research the event: You need to know, to the last detail, what happened.,
Create a timeline: This is not just for the past but for the future too.,
Create alternate event descriptions: This is where you will build the ""spin"" for the public.,
Roleplay and improve: To do this properly, it takes a group of people dedicated to the result.,
Prepare your audience: You're not going to just jump in and make your presentation.,
Pause: Don't release your information immediately following the leaks.,
Go Public: Release your information.,
See Step 1: Spin only lasts just so long.",How to Spin Bad News," If you don't have this knowledge, you will do better to gloss over the event until you do know. Note dates and times, things that led up to the event, people involved and most significantly, the immediate results.;
, Use your research to build this, then project as many repercussions as you can into the future. If, for example, a retail corporation had a very poor fourth quarter, will you need to close stores; lay off people; borrow money? Identify all the bad things that are likely to come of this.

, You can't do anything about things that happened - they happened - but you can present them differently.


People didn't buy from lower-priced competitors; they delayed premium buying decisions.
You didn't have ineffective marketing; you delayed premium advertising to coincide with the delayed buying decisions.
You aren't going to close stores; you're repositioning for market acquisition.
You aren't laying off sales employees; you're elevating the consumer's experience through added independence.

, You will need several ""devil's advocate"" types to listen to the presentation and slice it to pieces. You want to know every possible argument ahead of time. Use small focus groups and make the presentation, then tweak it, then do it again. Each time the backlash is reduced, you've made an effective improvement. Eventually (after 4 or 5 sessions) you should get to a stable point.

, You want the audience to be receptive to your information. Start leaking information that is favorable to your position and negative to any alternate position. You will neither confirm nor deny this information, but you will caution people that any information about your corporation will come from official sources, only.

, Let the audience have time to absorb and process the information - they need time to reach equilibrium.

, Publicly and loudly. A surprise press conference (that was rumored to be in the works) is an effective and time-tested method. Whether you have a Q&A session after will really depend on how good your spin is and, to a large extent, how prepared you are. It's also a matter of personal taste.

, Eventually, the future catches up to your timeline, and you'll need to make new announcements. Start planning for how you'll do that, now. This is really an endless cycle and there is strong job security for somebody that's good at it.

Start your job search quickly.You might be in a tight financial position without a job.",How to Retract a Resignation Letter," Set up it up as a standard business letter, using a legible font such as Times New Roman 12 point. Address your letter to the person who received your resignation letter. This could be your direct supervisor or Human Resources.Remember that business letters are set up using block-style paragraphing. You don’t indent between paragraphs but instead leave an extra blank line.;
, The first paragraph should get right to the point: say you want to retract your resignation letter because circumstances have changed. Mention the date of your resignation letter.


For example, you can write, “I am writing to retract my previous resignation letter, dated May 22, 2017.”, In the second paragraph, you can go into more detail about why you have changed your mind. Be careful. You shouldn’t admit that a job offer fell through. Instead, state generally that you realize what a good fit the job is for you. You don’t have to say a lot in the letter, because you can explain further when you meet in person.

For example, you can write, “This job has given me many opportunities to expand my knowledge base and develop my skills. I can assure you that the company will benefit if I can stay.”
You might want to retract your resignation because your boss made a counteroffer. For example, they might have offered a bigger salary or more responsibility. If so, include the details in your letter and say you accept them.

, In the third and final paragraph, you should boost your manager’s overall opinion of you by writing positively about the company. Express gratitude for your experience and what you have learned.


For example, you can write, “I look forward to continuing to work here at Acme Consulting and apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you very much for your consideration and understanding.”Include “Sincerely,” and then type and sign your name.

, You should send the letter as soon as possible, preferably no more than two days after submitting your resignation. Keep a copy of the letter for your records.

, The key is to talk to your boss soon after submitting the letter. If you have a casual office, then drop in and ask to talk. However, schedule a meeting if your office is more formal. Tell the secretary that it is an emergency.

Have a copy of your resignation letter with you in case your boss can’t find it.

, You’re feeling all kinds of nerves, which is natural. Fortunately, you don’t have to say a lot. Open the conversation by saying you really want to stay at the company and would like to retract your resignation.

, Your boss might already have started advertising to replace you. Or they might have asked a more junior person in the company to step up and replace you. By backing out now, you’re throwing a wrench in a lot of people’s plans. Say you’re sorry.


For example, you might say, “I know this is a real inconvenience, but I’d love to continue working here.”

, Your resignation might have come out of nowhere like a thunderclap. You also might have resigned in a huff and not fully explained your decision. Expect plenty of questions about why you resigned in the first place.Everyone’s circumstances are different, but you should remember the following tips:


Emphasize things that are easy to fix first. For example, you might have wanted to leave for more professional development opportunities. If you’re a good employee, a current employer might be able to help you with that.
Be honest but professional. You might be struggling with a coworker or a direct supervisor. Acknowledge as much, but remain tactful. “Janine and I have different communication styles, which has been apparent over the past six months” is better than, “I absolutely hate my boss, Janine.”

, You might want to retract your resignation because your next job fell through. This is a terrible thing to acknowledge to your boss.It’ll look like you really don’t want to work there but are forced to. For this reason, keep this information to yourself.


If your boss asks you if you have another job offer, you can always say “no” if the offer fell through. You’re being honest.

, Emphasize the things you like about your job and how you realize your current job is a good fit. If you resigned in an eruption of anger, explain that you’ve cooled off and realize that there isn’t a better job for you out there.


For example, you can say, “I was just angry when I resigned. I see now that the problems I have with Janine can be fixed easily and there’s no better place for me to grow than here.”

, Ideally, your boss will immediately say you can stay. Nevertheless, be prepared to sell yourself. Emphasize how dedicated you are to the company and explain how keeping you will benefit the business.For example, you can say, “I know that training someone for that position will take a lot of time, and this is a critical moment for the company right now. I want to stay to help us through the transition.”

, Your boss might need some time to think over whether to accept your retraction. Also, you might have given a two weeks’ notice, so you still need to work regardless of their decision. During this time, perform at your highest level. Show up to work early and complete all assignments before they are due.


Also volunteer to help out other people. You really want to show your boss that you are dedicated to the job.

, With luck, your boss will welcome you back with open arms. Make sure to express your gratitude and do your best work going forward. If you resigned because you had problems with a coworker or supervisor, make a good faith effort to repair those relationships., Word might have gotten out that you resigned and are trying to get your job back. Don’t feed the trolls. Always remain upbeat and answer any coworker questions in a vague way. Soon enough they will move onto something else to gossip about., Remember that your boss doesn’t have to keep you after you’ve submitted your written resignation.Try not to take rejection personally. For example, several weeks might have passed between your resignation and retraction, and your employer might have already promoted someone to your position. They might feel awkward keeping you.


Refuse to badmouth your boss or anyone else in the company. Instead, always speak positively of your experience while working there.

, Increase your odds of landing something quickly by using all available resources, such as your state’s employment office.

Start the process by updating your resume and asking your network if they know of any jobs available.
You might need to use your employer as a reference. Be sure to get their permission before you leave.

Decide what not to talk about.,
Know what employers cannot ask you.,
Cut out personal calls at work.,
Leave domestic affairs at home.",How to Keep Your Personal Life Private at Work1," The first thing to do if you are trying to keep your private life private at work is to determine where exactly you want to draw the line. This will vary from person to person and according to the particular culture at your workplace, as well as what kind of balance between work and home life you are looking for.Whatever the norm is in your office, you can still draw up your own boundaries. Start by making a list of the things you don't want to discuss with your colleagues.


This might include things such as your love life, any medical conditions, religion and political views.Think about what things you are not comfortable with or just not interested in discussing with your colleagues.
Don't publicise your list, but keep it as a mental reminder to yourself so you can excuse yourself from conversations you would rather avoid.;
, There are a number of questions that, by law, your employers cannot ask you about. These are questions about your background and life which could lead to discrimination. For example, your employer cannot ask you how old you are, whether you have any disabilities, or whether you are married or not. If someone does ask you these questions at work, it is your right not to answer them. Other questions you don't have to answer are:


Are you a US citizen?
Do you take drugs, smoke or drink?
What is your religion?
Are you pregnant?
What is your race?, If you are trying to keep your work and private life separate then you need to avoid bringing your private life into the office with you. This means cutting downs on private calls and emails from the office. Occasional calls to make an appointment with the hairdresser or dentist are fine, but if you are frequently heard on the phone talking about your private life, not only will your colleagues most likely overhear you, but they may ask you about the conversation.Excessive personal calls may also displease your boss and colleagues who think you are not working hard enough.
If you don't want to receive work calls at home, don't get into the habit of making personal calls at work.

, It can be easier said than done, but you should try to leave your home life at home and switch to the strictly professional version of you at work. You might find that getting a routine or daily habit to mark the transition between work and home life will help you to do this. For example, a short walk before and after work could have you mentally separate these two spheres of your life.Your commute could be a time in which you try to switch your thoughts from home life to work.
Just like limiting personal calls at work, if you walk in each morning with a clear mind not thinking or talking about your personal life you will not invite questions from colleagues.
If you look stressed or upset, or you walk into the office while on the phone to your partner, don't be surprised if your colleagues ask you about it.
Think of this as actively managing your relationship between work life and home life."

Feel empowered.,
Conserve your computer's energy.,

Prioritize your paper use.,
Reduce energy usage.,
Maintain healthy airflow.,
Green your desk, cubicle, office... literally.,
Recycle.,
Eat green and healthy.,
Travel green.,
Spread the word.",How to Go Green at Work," You don't need to be management to institute change; your role as someone who cares about improving the energy efficiency and healthiness of your workplace is just as vital as those able to make the ""big decisions"". In fact, change from the bottom-up is often a lot more effective as everyone has ""buy-in"". And just because you don't make the purchasing decisions, it doesn't mean you can't influence them. Do your research, point out the financial savings to management, and enlist the enthusiasm of your team members too. Tell them about the research that shows a happier workplace is more productive and creative, with less absenteeism. Encourage them to take this further by considering how to bring sustainable happiness into the work environment. Find the information, show by doing, and create the momentum, all just because you care.;
, For many people with desk jobs the computer is necessary to get things done. Yet, this ""efficiency"" comes at a cost - it is estimated that people waste over $1 billion in electricity every year just in computer use! To help conserve energy from your computer use, you can:


Invest in an energy-saving computer, monitor and printer - it's easy to find these computers thanks to the Energy Star label in the USA. The energy savings rating is available in many other countries as well.
Switch to energy-saving settings - the Climate Savers Computing Initiative recommends these power management settings:Monitor and display sleep: Turn off after 15 minutes or less;
Turn off hard drives and hard disk sleep: 15 minutes or less; and
System standby or sleep: After 30 minutes or less.


Set the computer to sleep mode when you are away for short periods of time. And don't use a screensaver - these use energy rather than save it, and you are much better off relying on the power management features to power down to lowest energy use, or sleep mode. A computer in sleep mode can save 60-70% of power.
Turn off your computer whenever you’re not using it, especially when leaving work. And note that it isn't true that turning your computer on and off will wear it out.Switch to a laptop or a thin client. Laptops and thin clients use less energy than desktop computers., Peripherals such as printers, video cards, speakers, and scanners continue to consume power even when not in use. Unplug them and save energy.


Unplug power adapters when not in use.
Unplug battery chargers and other chargers when the charging is complete, otherwise they are still consuming energy.
Use a power strip as a central turn-off point to reduce the number of switching off actions required.

, The printer is one of the most used office items. Every day it cranks out tons of important faxes, emails and other documents. Here are some ways you make your printer use greener:


Don't print unnecessarily. Most stuff can be handled online or on-screen. Learn to increase the font or zoom in if you need to see better.
Try not to print in color - learn how to Cut Printing Costs on an Inkjet Color Printer.
Use a printer that does double-sided copying (also called duplexing). If your workplace doesn't have this, request that such a printer be added to the network and designate that one for the big printing jobs.
Print in draft mode. In addition, try to print more screen pages to a paper page. Printing two screen pages per printed page is still readable and double-sided, that means four screen pages per one paper page—a huge paper savings!

Recycle ink and toner cartridges - learn how to Refill and Reuse a Printer Cartridge.
Try to use a multifunction device. This is a combination of printer/scanner/copier in one. Especially if it is Energy Star rated, it can save both energy and space.

, Do you have to print out every email and handout? Reduce paper waste by deciding to go paperless wherever possible. You can try to:


Keep copies of important emails, files, and more on your computer, or share them online or in the cloud.
Use old paper with extra space to print small documents.
Don’t get any extra catalogs or magazines mailed to your office. Use a sharing system to pass around interesting materials between everyone's in-trays, or get off mailing lists entirely and consult such matter online. This saves paper and money, and it cuts down on clutter.
Get your check directly deposited. Payment direct to your bank account saves paper, and it's likely to save you time, too.
Send company updates through email instead of on paper.

Use just one paper towel each time you wash your hands.

, When you do use paper, make eco-friendly paper choices. Here are some things you can do:


Buy recycled and chlorine-free paper.
Try paper made from organic products like bamboo, cotton or hemp.
Print on both sides of the paper.
Shred old paper to use as packing material.
Save and reuse old boxes.
Use old sheets of paper for scrap paper or note taking. Use mistake prints as scribble paper, or send a stack along to your children's daycare or school for artwork use.

, Along with reducing the energy usage of your computer and peripherals, there are several broader ways to reduce energy usage in the workplace:


Replace your desk lamp light bulbs and overhead lights (where possible) with compact fluorescent light bulbs or LEDs qualified with the Energy Star rating. These bulbs use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs and last up to 10 times as long. You may have to ask whoever is in charge of facilities for help with changing building lighting.Turn lights off when nobody is using a space. Where the lighting controls are on automatic override, talk to building management about having the settings changed to only use sufficient lighting for security and safety purposes, rather than over-lighting the whole building. Request motion sensing light switches, to turn off unused lights automatically.
During cold weather, keep blinds open to let the warmth in; during warm weather, keep blinds pulled to close out the heat of the summer sun.
Keep windows and vents clear of obstructions, to allow the free flow of air.
Use Energy Star rated programmable thermostats to adjust heating and cooling in the building automatically to avoid wasting energy, especially when no one is around.
Get an Energy Star qualified water cooler. These use half the energy as standard units.
Turn off projectors and screens in conference rooms when not in use.

, It is already bad enough that you have to worry about air pollution every time you walk outside, but it is also a big priority when you work inside. If you work in an office, cubicle, or workshop, it's likely that you're spending most of your time indoors. A Canadian survey found that people spend over 96% of time at home indoors and over 83% of time at work or school indoors,equaling about 40 or more hours at your desk, office, or cubicle. Here are some ways that you can maintain a healthy air flow in your office:


Use non-toxic cleaning products, and encourage cleaning staff to do the same. Water-dampened cloths are sufficient to clean most dusty work spaces.
Open your windows to increase air flow. If you can't open windows, be sure to take outdoor breaks throughout the day.

Don’t smoke in or near the office.
Never bring any aerosol can to work.
Use an air purifier to get rid of contaminants.

, Get a plant and place it on or near your desk. Better yet, buy plants for all of your neighbors. They will not only see this as a friendly gesture, but they’ll also have cleaner air to breathe. Plants absorb indoor air pollution and increase the flow of oxygen, so get a green accessory to complement your desk. Check out wikiHow's article on how to choose a good office plant.

, There are many items in your office that you can recycle. If you do not have a recycling station at work, start one on your own. You can get a few bins and post recycling guidelines above them. Some of them may include recycling:


Paper products like copy paper, envelopes, magazines, etc.

Cardboard boxes from shipped supplies;
Soda cans and plastic bottles;

Aluminum foil;

Plastic bags;
Ink cartridges; and
Edible items (see next).

, Everyone looks forward to their lunch break. You can save a good amount of money (about $3,000 a year) by not going out to eat every day and instead packing your lunch.Follow these lunch tips to have healthier, greener eating habits:



Pack your lunch in a reusable lunch bag or box. Bento boxes are popular, allowing you to have a delicious, healthy variety every lunch.
If you bring your lunch in a paper or plastic bag, recycle it. Plastic bags can be washed and left standing upside down overnight to dry.
Use containers, mugs, and silverware that can be washed and used again.
Switch to organic food and drinks.
Drink from the fountain instead of bringing water bottles. You can bring your own durable, reusable water bottle for constant refills.
Use a ceramic or glass coffee cup instead of paper or plastic.
Recycle your soda cans, bottles and aluminum foil.
Use a washable napkin instead of paper towels.
Walk to a healthy lunch eatery if you forget to pack your lunch.
If there is a break room, ask that dish soap be provided there, so you can wash your reusable cups and flatware, and simply leave them at work.

, The first part of your workday starts with getting to work, and for many people that means driving. Cars emit tons of carbon dioxide gases into the air, contributing to greenhouse gases. Getting stuck in a traffic jam regularly is also bound to increase your stress levels. Here are some ideas you can do for a green ride:


Join a ride share or carpool.
Take the train, bus or subway.

Ride a bike or walk if you live close enough.
Invest in a hybrid or electric car, but remember that the energy to power it must still come from somewhere.
Reduce your travel by telecommuting, or working from home whenever possible. This option is becoming increasingly viable for many office-based jobs, and if your workplace offers it, look into the potential of using it for at least some of your work week.
Reduce your air travel, too. You'll save time, money, and significant greenhouse gas emissions by phoning or teleconferencing in to a meeting, instead of flying to be there.

, The best way to stay involved in the green scene at work is to get others involved. Share your practices and wisdom with your boss and coworkers. You can do this by:


Creating a Green Team. The US Environmental Protection Agency suggests creating a Green Team that includes everyone from the CEO to the office intern and to set a goal to make your building the most energy efficient one in your country.Encouraging the office to join or start a recycling program.
Purchasing company carbon credits.
Buying eco-friendly office products.
Setting up a carpool calendar.
Making green actions fun. Get everyone to pack their lunch and eat together. Not only do you get to share tasty morsels, but it's a great chance to get to know your coworkers outside the daily work grind.

Physical contaminants include skin cells that flake off, dandruff, clothing fibers, and loose hair. Paper, pencils, packaging materials, and many other things shed dust, and even tiny particles can damage the delicate products built and tested in clean rooms.
, There are a couple of different sets of standards, but in general, the lower the number, the cleaner the cleanroom.,, Clean room apparel varies. It may consist of gloves, a cap, and smock at its most basic all the way up to a full ""bunny suit"". These are the general instructions.,,

Do not wear cosmetics, hair spray, perfumes, or colognes into a cleanroom.

Be friendly.,
Use tact.,
Maintain some flexibility.",How to Keep Your Personal Life Private at Work2," Even if you don't want to discuss your private life with your colleagues, you can still develop good working relationships that make your time at work more enjoyable and productive. It's easy to find topics of conversation for lunchtime small talk that don't involve you talking about any intimate details of your private life.


If there is somebody at work who talks about their private life a lot, or there is a conversation that you don't want to be involved in, politely excuse yourself.Talking about things such as sports, TV and film can be good ways to be friendly and chat to colleagues without bringing up your home life.

, If you find yourself in a conversation that is turning to your personal life, or a colleague has asked you about something that you would rather keep private, it's a good idea to tactfully sway out of the way of the question. Try to avoid saying something like ""Sorry, but that's none of your business"". Instead, make light of it and say something more like ""Oh, you don't want to know about that. It's boring"" and then change the subject to something you are more comfortable with.These deflecting techniques can help you to maintain friendly relationships while avoiding certain topics of conversation.
If you sway away from the question and change the subject, rather than just ending the conversation, your colleague will probably not think too much of it.
If you switch the conservation back to your colleague you will politely avoid their questions without seeming aloof or disinterested.
You could say, ""Nothing interesting is going on in my life, what about you?""If coworkers are persistent in asking about your personal life, you can set a boundary letting them know that you would rather not discuss it. You can say, “I know you guys really care about me to ask about my life, and I appreciate that about you, but I’d really like to leave that stuff at home.”

, While it is important that you have an idea in your head about the boundaries you have set between home life and work life, you should try to keep some flexibility. Having good boundaries needn't translate into you always shunning certain interactions, or isolating yourself away from your colleagues entirely.If your colleagues invite you for a 5pm drink, go along every now and again but stick to conversation topics you are comfortable with.

Be aware of your social media activity.,
Adjust your privacy settings.,
Only use your work email for work.",How to Keep Your Personal Life Private at Work3," Increasingly the biggest problem for those who would rather keep their work and private lives separate is the proliferation of social media. People record all aspects of their lives and sometimes don't fully comprehend how accessible all of this information is to anybody who cares to look for it. The first step to tackling this problem is simply being aware of it and thinking about how your social media activity could reveal parts of your private life you'd rather keep out of the office.


If you want to maintain a professional image online and don't want to invite questions about your private life, avoid posting anything openly that could threaten this.This includes text and comments as well as photos. If you want to keep the two elements of your life separate you need to do this outside of the office as well as inside it.
Don't tweet or comment about your job or your colleagues in your social media accounts.
You might consider setting up multiple social media accounts to keep the two areas of your life separate.Consider connecting with work colleagues on professional sites such as LinkedIn, and reserve things like Facebook for personal friends and family. This will help you keep these arenas separate.

, It is possible to be active on social media without blocking your colleagues' friends requests, if you just want to use your online profile to keep in touch with friends. Think about how you can adjust your privacy settings so that you limit the amount of material you share with your colleagues.


You can control the amount of information about you that goes online and you can, to some extent, control who has access to it.
But be aware that once something is on the internet it is not likely to disappear quickly., So much communication in our working lives and our lives outside work is conducted through email, that it can be easy for your work email and personal email to blend into one. You should be conscious of this and take steps to make sure you keep the two separate. Always use your work email for work and your personal email for everything else.


Set a time when you will stop looking at your work email in the evening and stick to it.
Keeping these email boundaries will help you to avoid carrying your work around with you.
Depending on your place of work you will have to develop a strategy for cutting off work communications that fits in with your job.In most cases, you do not have a right to privacy in your work email. Your boss is usually legally able to read anything sent or received in work email accounts. Keep your personal matters in your personal email to avoid any sharing of information you want to keep private."

That usually means that if your practice starts at a certain time, say 9:00 am, you should be dressed and ready to go then, not just arriving., It can be easy to let your mind wander when you are doing drills and exercises. It is important, though, that you stay focused on what you are doing., Once you have finished a workout or practice session, take some time to give your body a physical cooldown period. Some low-intensity movements and stretches are good to help restore your muscles and process metabolic waste. It’s also a good way to relax mentally after an intense practice or game., If you want to become a great athlete, the best thing you can do is to find something that really matters to you. This can be a sport that you enjoy playing and practicing, something that will help you get through the tougher days. Plus, if you enjoy what you are doing, you’ll be less stressed, which helps you recover better from practices and injuries., If being a good athlete is important to you, then improving needs to take up a lot of your time. You may not be talented or skilled enough to be a professional, but by making sure that you regularly have time blocked out for practicing and playing, you will be able to show regular improvement., Being an athlete is an opportunity to compete against others and be successful in something. Focus on the great things you can do, which will allow you to pursue excellence, not perfection., When you start a practice or workout regimen, give yourself something to work towards. Great athletes are able to set goals for both the short and long term that are realistic and achievable. Part of improving as an athlete is your ability not only to set goals, but regularly achieve them.Setting performance goals. These are goals for achieving specific milestones while playing. They can involve scoring a certain number of points, or reaching another statistical marker, like reducing the time it takes you do run a certain distance. These goals should be easily tracked so you can see how close you are to achieving them.
Setting habit goals. These are goals meant to change the way you play, focusing on your process rather than results. These can be things like making sure your head is up while making a pass, or going to bed at a certain time.

, Preparing your mind for what you want and what it will be like when you get it is an important part of being a successful athlete. Elite athletes spend time visualizing their success before it happens. This can help them calm down before a competition, thinking about how good it will feel to accomplish their goals, rather than being nervous about not being able to achieve them.One way to help is to identify and focus on successes you’ve already had. Think about your greatest accomplishments, and how it felt to achieve them. This will help prevent you from dwelling on mistakes and errors, as that is a sure way to repeat them., Great athletes don’t just take care of their bodies and develop their skills. They also respect the others involved in their sport, including their opponents. A good athlete will be able to control his or her emotions, not getting too angry when things go wrong. Not only will this help in dealing with coaches and supporters, but also in overcoming difficult opponents, or other things that can hurt an athlete’s self-confidence., Whatever level of work you are doing, it is important that you get the right amount of water before, during, and after your physical activity. If you aren’t properly hydrated, your body can’t perform properly, and you’ll feel fatigue, cramps, and dizziness, if not something worse like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.The American Council on Exercise has recommendations for drinking water before, during, and after your exercise. Drink 17 to 20 ounces of water 2 to 3 hours before you start, then 8 ounces 20 to 30 minutes before or during warm-up. While exercising, drink 7 to 10 ounces every 10 to 20 minutes. After finishing, make sure to drink 8 ounces no more than 30 minutes later.
If the weather is particularly hot, or the workout especially intense, feel free to increase the amount of water slightly.
When working out, sports drinks can be helpful to maintaining hydration and energy. Look for drinks that are high in carbohydrates and electrolytes, as these will help you maintain your energy., Eating right will help give you the nutrients necessary to grow muscle and maintain your energy throughout practice or a game. A good athlete will also be able to vary his or her diet before and after exercising to derive the best benefits from food. The specifics of your diet will change depending on the kind of sport you play and how much training you do, so don’t be afraid to consult with a coach, nutritionist, or doctor to get the best diet for you.Before you work out, you need to consume foods that will help give you the energy to get through. These can be simple meals with lean proteins like chicken, vegetables, and whole-grain rice. If you need something quick, look for easily digestible carbohydrates, such as half a banana or a carb-heavy energy bar.After exercising, your goal should be recovery. You want more foods with protein and carbohydrates to help restore your energy. Foods like milk, which contain both, are particularly good. You can also consume things like trail mix with nuts or yogurt and granola to help the recovery process.

, Sleep can play a major role in consistent and strong athletic performance. Sleeping helps to regenerate your energy and strength after exercising, which lets you be at your best the next day for the next practice or game. Regular sleep will also keep your stress levels lower. This will help helping you remain calm and focused during competition.8 hours of sleep is generally ideal, but you can always give yourself a little more or less depending on your personal needs and habits.If you’re going through a period of increased training, or a tough stretch in your schedule, don’t be afraid to add a little more sleep to your routine. An extra nap during the day can give you a little extra boost of energy as you go along."

Stick to a weekly exercise plan.,
Keep track of what you eat.,
Don’t cut nutrients when you cut calories.,
Get a professional trainer.",How to Be a Fitness Model1," Commit to a routine that incorporates both weight and aerobic training. Each day, focus on different part of your body, and take one day off per week for rest, grocery shopping, and meal prep. For example, a sample weekly workout could be:Mondays: shoulders and triceps
Tuesdays: legs
Wednesdays: cardio
Thursdays: biceps and chest
Fridays: back
Saturdays: cardio;
, Control your diet year-round and keep track of how many calories you consume daily. Your needs will depend on your age, sex, and fitness goals.For example, if you want to build muscle and burn fat for a competition, you’ll need to bulk up first by consuming more calories, then create an energy deficit by burning more calories than you consume. If you consume 2,500 daily calories, you’d aim to burn at least 3,000 in your workouts.
Avoid consuming less than 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day, or you might have trouble meeting your nutritional requirements., Don’t forget nutrients when you’re counting numbers like calories, protein, and carbs. Reducing calories gradually is necessary to sustain the fat burning that makes muscles visible, but don’t lose sight of your overall health. If you’re allowed a set amount of a type of food, meet that requirement with a rich source of nutrients.For example, if you’re allowed 200 grams of carbs per day, don’t squander them on sweets that contain no nutrients. Instead, go for nutritious carbs like potatoes or berries.
Don’t rely on multivitamins, and never skip a meal.

, There’s only so much you can accomplish without learning from an experienced trainer. When you’re just starting off, work out with a trainer at your gym. As you break into professional modeling, get a trainer who has experience with your area of focus.For example, competitions and print require different physiques. If you compete regularly, you’d want a trainer who can help you achieve and sustain a contest-ready shape.  
Even if you’ve achieved a good physique on your own, a trainer can help you set your goals even higher.

Figure out your brand.,
Learn how to pose.,
Get active on social media.,
Create a portfolio.",How to Be a Fitness Model2," Decide what makes you stand out from the crowd and defines you as a fitness model. Your brand makes you recognizable and defines the type of physique you build.Think of what your motivation is and how it could inspire others. Perhaps you’ve built your physique after having several children, or overcame a struggle through fitness.
Consider your day job: fitness magazines often use yoga instructors or personal trainers instead of standard fashion models. If you teach others how to do yoga pose or workout technique, you’ll be able to execute it precisely and look good for the camera while you do it.
Your brand also defines the type of fitness modeling you do and the type of physique you need. Competitions require a more built, defined physique than mainstream magazine work.

, Knowing how to pose properly is just as important as your appearance, so it’s a good idea to hire a modeling coach or take a modeling class. You could also look online and scour fitness magazines to learn how models pose.


For example, you can watch videos of poses required by the National Gym Association.You can also search for images online or look for videos on YouTube.
Practice different poses in front of the mirror to figure out what works best for your body.

, Set up Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat profiles and update them daily. Engage your followers by tracking your fitness journey, giving workout and meal prep tips, and sharing stories about what motivates you. Follow people in the industry, from models to photographers, to build a professional network and, hopefully, get discovered by a scout or sponsor., When you’re just starting out, creating a portfolio can be as simple as having a friend take snapshots of you in good natural lighting.A beginner’s portfolio should include 6 to 12 shots, and try to get as close to professional quality as possible. Once you start booking gigs, include published shots in your portfolio.You don’t have to start assembling your professional portfolio until after signing with an agent and booking gigs. However, you will need up to date photographs of yourself to send to agencies and magazines.
Fitness models will need to include body shots. Women should wear a sports bra and shorts, and men should wear only shorts."
"
Send your photos to modeling agencies.,
Enter fitness or figure competitions.,
Do your research before signing any contracts or releases.",How to Be a Fitness Model3," Submit your photographs to modeling agencies to find professional representation. Your agent will help you develop a professional portfolio, alert you about job opportunities, and help match you with the right jobs. You might not be able to immediately land a contract with a major agency like Wilhelmina, so cast a wide net and submit photos to smaller agencies.Search online for agencies that represent fitness models. Check out the social media profiles of fitness models at various career levels to get a feel for which agencies represent established and emerging models.
Many agencies periodically hold open calls, so search online regularly for open call opportunities in your area., Bodybuilding and bikini competitions are a popular way of gaining recognition. They’re great for networking, and can offer opportunities for you to meet scouts and product sponsors. Look online for competitions in your area, and give yourself a few months to get in contest-ready shape.

Just keep in mind a contest-ready physique might not be what a mainstream magazine defines as marketable, especially for female models., Steer clear of an agency that requires you to pay for any service.An agent is entitled to a commission, which is generally between 10 and 20 percent of your earnings. Even though you might feel hesitant to assert your rights when you’re just starting out, try to handle your business with confidence.When signing a release with a magazine or photographer, negotiate restrictions such as, “Photos may not be used on sexually explicit or pornographic websites or publications,” or “Finished photographs may not be used to subject the talent to scandal, scorn, ridicule, or indignity.”
If you know someone with legal expertise or have a lawyer, ask them to read any contract or release before you sign it.

Create a great CV.,
Find opportunities.,
Perform well.,
Be persistent and patient.,
Sign a professional contract.",How to Become a Football Player After 20," Motivation can drive you a long way and keep you focused. If you really want this to happen, you have to focus on one main thing and that is football.;
, Being in good shape and fit are essential for a football player. To achieve your goal, start building your stamina, fitness and agility. A football player must be able to clear a distance of about 6 kms in one hour. You must be physically strong.

, Football is not all about stamina and fitness, it is more about your technical and tactical ability. You must have a lot of footballing skills, such as great dribbling, passing, corner kicks and free kicks. It also helps to have your own unique move, one that will cause coaches to look and take notice. Practice as much as you can and play as much as you can.


It also helps to watch as many matches as you can, to get an idea of good playing techniques.

, In order to progress, join a local football club in your area. This means joining a very basic level of club. Here you will feel safe to improvise, review and view your skills. It will also allow you to enhance your footballing skills and give you a good idea as to how well you can perform.

, Prepare a killer video with the help of an HD camera. Show all of your skills in the video, such as free kicks, dribbling and passing.

, Just as you need a CV when applying for a job, a football CV should be able to explain to a coach, club, or agent, all about who you are as a player, in less than a minute. Include a player photo, height/weight, positions, experience, links to articles you’ve been featured in and statistics.


The football network Fieldoo allows you to create and share a player CV online. You can even go the extra mile by creating your own.

, Now that you have the skills and the tools, you have to find ways to show off your talent. Here are a few ways to find opportunities:


Email and call as many clubs as you possibly can, but don’t expect replies (you may need to email 50 clubs before receiving a reply!).
Check out the Market on Fieldoo.com for opportunities abroad.
Consider getting an agent, however many agents can be very deceiving, so be careful.Some players have famously been accepted into pro teams, just by showing up to a practice session with their boots and asking if they could train with them.

, It’s easy to only think of getting to the next level, instead of focusing on your performances in matches. Take your football career game-by-game. Every game you play, focus on playing well and giving 110%, as you never know who could be watching. Make sure you build a good relationship with the club, players and club staff, as having their off-field support will contribute to good on-field performances.

, It is going to be difficult trying to become a pro. Becoming a professional soccer player doesn’t happen overnight. It doesn’t take months either. It takes years and a lifetime of dedication. When you hear people say that success takes ‘blood, sweat, tears’, they’re totally right. In football, no one ever cheated their way to becoming one of the less than 0.001% of the 240 million players worldwide, that ‘made it’. It takes time and patience. Sometimes you have to wait for the right opportunity. Sometimes it takes just a bit of luck to swing your direction, but being persistent and having the ability to never give up will determine whether you’re successful or not.

, Ensure that you are confident about your agent. Never hesitate to take things slowly at the start. There will come a time to leap frog and take victory with both hands. Just be careful while signing the contract and have the clauses read over by a lawyer or someone capable of understanding the fine clauses.

Be conscientious about proper hip extension.",How to Beat Marathon Muscle Cramps," Stretching exercises are recommended to relieve the frequency and severity of muscle cramps. In the run up to a marathon, you should aim to do at least 5 to 10 minutes of stretching, three times per day.


As cramps are most frequently experienced in the calves, you should focus on stretching these muscles. One good calf stretch involves starting in a standing position about 60 – 90 centimeter (35.4 in) from the wall, keeping the soles of the feet flat on the floor.
Step forwards with one foot and lean your hands against the wall until you feel a stretch in the calf of your back leg. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds before switching to the other leg.
For more information on beneficial stretches, see this article.;
, There are a couple of things you can try to prevent calf muscle shortening (and the resultant cramps) during sleep. These include:


Keeping the legs slightly elevated by placing a pillow under the feet while sleeping on your back.
Hanging the feet over the edge of the bed while sleeping on your front.

, Dehydration or the loss of fluids is the major cause of cramps. Therefore, it is essential to stay hydrated while you are training for a marathon, while you are running during a marathon and after the marathon is over.


Before training (or the marathon itself) it is recommended that you pre-hydrate by drinking only water - sports drinks will not benefit you at this stage, as no electrolytes have yet been lost. You should also avoid caffeinated drinks in the lead up to the race, as these have a diuretic effect that can lead to water loss.
Rehydrate with water during the first 60 minutes of exercise, and with a sports drink after 60 minutes of exercise. After an hour of exercise, your body loses energy and electrolytes which the sports drink helps to replace.
To maintain proper body hydration, it is recommended to drink 5 to 12 ounces (148 to 355 millilitres) of water for every 20 minutes of activity. Before and after running, take in 4 to 8 ounces (118 to 237 millilitres) of water. The amount of fluid intake will also depend on the body weight of the runner. It is suggested to seek professional advice on the amount of fluid to be taken.

, Make sure that you are wearing properly fitted running shoes. Shoes that do not fit properly cause stress to the muscles and tendons that puts the runner at higher risk of developing muscle cramps.

, Be aware of which foods and drinks can contribute to (or prevent) muscle cramps during a run. For instance:


Caffeinated beverages contain substances that worsen muscle cramps due to dehydration.
Don’t consume foods that are high in protein or fat in the 4 to 5 hours before running. Eat foods that are high in carbohydrates instead.
It is recommended to eat bananas while running because they contain high levels of potassium, a substance that helps prevent muscle cramps.

, Prolonged exercise duration greater than 90 minutes puts the body at risk for cramps. The body gets deprived of its main energy fuel, glucose, as the muscles scurry for the final stretch. Carbohydrate loading is a technique that focuses on storing glucose in the liver and muscles which can be tapped into for energy later


During the training period for a marathon, you should be getting 60% of your daily calories from carbohydrates, 25% from fat and 15% from protein. Some examples of good carbohydrate sources are rice, bread, pasta, sweet potatoes, and potatoes.
In the final days before a marathon, you should increase your carb intake to getting 70% to 80% of your total calories from carbs, with the remaining 20% to 30% of your calorie intake divided between protein and fat.
After the marathon, you should resume a normal diet. Carbohydrate loading is not advised for long-term use because it may lead to a rise in blood glucose levels and diabetes.

, A well maintained and consistent pace of running will help you to avoid muscle cramps.


Take your overall health and fitness levels into account in order to determine the appropriate pace for you, both during training and during the marathon itself.
Wear a watch or use a phone app that tracks your pace and alerts you if you are running too fast or slow.

, This prevents overtraining and reduces the risk of injury. Tapering is very important in a marathon race, when it is coupled with carbohydrate loading to maximize glycogen storage rates.

, Getting an adequate amount of rest will ensure that your muscles recuperate well in between training sessions and that they are not already damaged or worn down by the day of the marathon.


Hitting the sack for at least 7 hours per night is necessary for optimal regeneration of muscle damage and prevents overtraining.
Unfortunately, sleep may be difficult to come by in the night before the event, as it is normal for a person to experience extreme anxiety and excitement in anticipation of the day ahead. Therefore, the most crucial sleep happens two nights before the event. It is essential that you get a full 8 hours sleep two nights before the event to ensure that your body is well-rested and prepared.

, Painkillers block the receptors that signal pain to the brain, preventing pain from being interpreted and felt. Therefore, these medications can be a useful tool in relieving the pain of muscle cramps following a marathon. There are two different classes of painkillers, as follows:



Simple Painkillers: These are over-the-counter drugs used to relive mild to moderate pain, such as paracetamol and acetaminophen. Doses of simple painkillers may vary according to age, but the usual recommended dose for adults is 500 mg oral tablets every 4 to 6 hours.

Stronger Painkillers: When simple painkillers do not work, stronger prescription painkillers are sometimes recommended, such as codeine or tramadol. For oral tramadol, the usual dosage for adults is 50 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours. For codeine, the recommended oral dose is 30 mg every 6 hours (drugs.com).

NSAIDs: NSAID stands for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These medicines work by blocking specific body chemicals that causes the affected area to become painful and inflamed. Examples are Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin.

, Approximation is a massage technique used to relieve muscle cramps. It is done by pressing the muscle fibers together in the same direction for a specific time.


You can perform this massage by grasping the muscles above and below the cramps. Then push the hands together to shorten and compress the muscle until the muscle relaxes.
Try to contract the muscle without pressing the opposing muscle against the cramping muscle. This forces the cramping muscle to relax, thereby relieving the cramp.

, Cold therapy helps to reduce blood flow in the swollen and inflamed muscle and slows down the pain signals that are transmitted to the brain. Thus, the pain felt during muscle cramps is decreased.


A cold compress can be applied to the affected muscle for at least 20 minutes every 4 to 6 hours for three days.

, Heat therapy involves the application of heat to the affected area, which causes the muscles to relax by dilating the blood vessels and promoting blood circulation to the area.


Some studies show that the use of continuous low-level heat wrap therapy (CLHT) can help to decrease muscle and joint pain more effectively than oral analgesics, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen.
A hot compress can be applied to the affected area for 20 minutes three times a day. Be careful when using heat therapy as it could cause burns.

, Medical problems such as spinal cord injury or a pinched nerve in the back or neck could cause malfunctioning of the affected nerves and lead to the development of muscle cramps.

, Overworking certain muscles can result in a loss of energy in the muscles. When this happens, the overworked muscle suddenly contracts, leading to a muscle cramp. This frequently happens in sports like running, where the same muscles are used repeatedly.

, A lack of adequate hydration can result in a fluid and electrolyte imbalance that is more likely to provoke muscle cramping.

, Muscles require an adequate blood supply in order to function properly. Therefore, any underlying blood conditions that interfere with the supply of blood to the muscles can lead to muscle cramping.

, When a person gets tired, the normal response is to lean to the side, with a hand on your waist. Holding this position for prolonged periods can strain the core muscles. It puts the abdominal muscles in a vulnerable position which can lead to muscle cramps.

, Proper hip extension while running involves placing the upper thigh and leg backwards when the foot hits the ground. This gives more power and speed to your running. However, if the hips are not extended properly, it puts strain on the calf and quad muscles, leading to cramps.

Push yourself further than others are willing to go.",How to Be Good at Sports," This does not mean being unrealistic, or saying you're going to go professional within a year. Instead, you should take a look at what you are, and figure out where you think you would like to be. Give yourself a suitable amount of time to achieve that goal, and break it down into smaller parts if the goal is especially big.;
, Being good at sports means more than physical strength and speed. In order to be truly great, you need to apply that positive attitude to the way you treat other players, even if they're on the other team. If you lose a match, accept the loss and show respect to the other player for their victory.If you set an example of good sportsmanship, you'll receive the same respect in turn when you win.

, No matter what you do, skills are often slow to build. There is always going to be someone who can do it better than you, at least at first. Impatient athletes tend to make poor ones. If you're not patient, you will try to leap into more advanced techniques long before you're ready. Your motivation will sap away when you don't see improvement immediately. Keep the long-term goal in mind, and hang tight in the meantime while you make it a reality.

, When you play sports, you will inevitably receive criticism. Whether from a coach, other players, or spectators, you need to take most of it with a grain of salt. Are they angry because you missed a pass, or do they sincerely want to help you improve? Learn to distinguish the constructive criticism from the hurtful remarks. In a lot of cases, you can use criticism as motivation to get better in whatever area they bring up.


Don't let yourself get defensive.Your thinking becomes more limited if you allow yourself to become emotional against criticism.

, One of the biggest reasons people join sports teams in the first place is to make friends with new people.If you join a team, you're bound to run into a lot of people. Chances are you'll develop friendships with at least some of them. Making these friendships a priority is a good move if you want to become great at sports. You can practice together on your own time. The morale boost of playing with friends helps as well.


Team sports like soccer can have some skills practiced in solitude, but for others (like goalkeeping and passing) another person is needed. It's helpful to have this other person as a friend. It'll make the practice process more enjoyable in the long term.

, It's possible to get so obsessed with being good at something that you lose track of why you want to be good in the first place. Not taking the time to enjoy the sport you play results in a fast burnout. Whether you're practicing or playing a competition, try to remember the other reasons why you play sports. This may include the natural satisfaction you get from exercise, or quality time spent with friends., If you want to become a sports superstar, joining a team is a good way to start. Even if your skills are currently low, joining an amateur league will sharpen up your skills. Sports teams are everywhere, and most of them are free to join. If you go to school, you should go for team tryouts when they're happening. Recreation centres are often host to sports teams as well.If you're not in school, you can find or start a sports club online., Great coaches come in all shapes and sizes.Certain coaching personalities will suit you better than others. The best scenario is having a coach who genuinely wants to see you succeed. In the early stages, enthusiasm is often more helpful than scientific know-how.


Across the board, communication skills are the most important trait a coach can have.There are different levels of sports coach. Most after-school coaches are volunteers with a working knowledge of the sport and enthusiasm for the game. You can hire a sports coach with full training and education, although it will set you back a lot of money., If you want to be truly great at sports, it's not enough to focus on a couple of sports alone. It is important to set your sights wide with your exercises. Don't specialize in skills unless you're already a great athlete. Find ways to train every part of your body. Whether this means playing multiple sports or doing an all-encompassing exercise routine, training your entire body will boost your sports performance.


There's a lot of evidence to suggest that athletes are better if they play more than one sport., it's a common misgiving for young athletes to want to jump into the advanced stuff quickly. This isn't an effective way to spend training time. You need a solid bedrock foundation before you move on to bigger things.If you're new to a sport, take as much time as you need to get the basic movements down properly. It will make advanced skills a lot easier to grasp in the long run.


Some argue that fundamental ""movement skills"" (such as jumping and kicking) should be mastered properly before moving on to applied sports skills., In an actual competition, things aren't usually going to play exactly by the books. While you're practicing, you'll usually be playing under optimal circumstances. In order to make sure you'll be up for the unforeseen challenges, you need to predict the conditions of the competition.Ask yourself if you are learning a skill, or if you're learning to actually use that skill in the competitions you'll be in.


Remember this motto: ""Train the way you want to play.""There's no way to perfectly replicate a competition in practice, but playing with other people can get you used to the scenarios you'll need to beware of.

, It is common for bodies to adapt to a level of strain. Progress will slow down if you don't keep upping the stakes as you go along. Bodybuilders and strength-oriented athletes do this by increasing their reps or the weights they work with. As a competition athlete, the best thing you can do to keep progress going is to practice the skills while under fatigue.Studies have shown that skill execution goes out the window when you get tired, so it's a good idea to practice under those conditions.


Building up your speed is important too. Speed usually comes with practice, but you shouldn't try to rush into speed until you have the basics down pat., If you're wondering at what point a skill becomes mastered, it is when you're able to do it automatically and without thinking. This is called the autonomous phase, and it's where you want to be at if you want to play sports competitively.Given enough time and repetition, a skill will eventually fall under this category. When you're in the fray of a game, you won't have time to think everything through, so practice until it's all automatic, so you'll know you're ready.


When you're playing a sport like football in a competition, you're going to potentially need to throw a ball while getting chased by several competitors. You can't replicate this stress in private practice, so you have to make sure your tosses perfected beforehand.
Keep practicing. Practice is never something that should stop. even if you become great at sports, you can always become better. If you stop practicing, chances are that someone more determined will beat you.

, The best athletes know that training doesn't stop at sports skills. You want your body to be as sharp as it can be for whatever sport you're playing. On the downtime away from sports, keep your body in general shape by going to the gym. Although it may seem daunting or expensive, it is absolutely worth the investment if you want to be good at sports. There are lots of benefits to going to a gym. As you'll know from playing in sports teams, exercising with others is very motivating.Do some research into a prospective gym before you pay for a membership. Go for a tour, and ask for details. Make sure the gym fits the circumstances of your life before you make your first payment., This is especially true during times of intense practice or training, where things get so busy it becomes hard to cram everything into a regular day. Nonetheless, your body needs its full rest. At least 6 hours is good, but 8 will ensure your body's had its full time to regenerate.

, Everyone should make a point of eating a diet that benefits their body. This is especially true if you want to be great at sports. Eating junk food will work against whatever efforts you make n the gym. Base your diet on leafy greens and legumes.Cut back on ""empty calories"" (like soda) and replace them with things that improve your health.


If you're lactose intolerant, try going without dairy. It may sound hard, but you'll see benefits within a month.

, As a general rule, the more you drink it, the better you'll feel. Water regulates everything, and you should expect to lose some of your natural hydration via sweat while you exercise. The common ""8 glasses a day"" guideline isn't mandatory, but you should try to keep water next to you whenever you can. It's especially important to stock up on water while you're exercising.


Keep a refillable bottle of water around with you. Refill it when it goes empty. You'll find your water consumption goes up a lot if you simply keep it near you.

, Drugs and alcohol aren't recommended if you want to be great at sports. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it drains your body of hydration.Your body will expend resources trying to get rid of the alcohol, and it can have a negative impact on your sports performance for days after the fact.


In the long run, the amount of calories you digest from alcohol like cider and beer can have a negative impact on your gut., The competition will be stiff enough, so it's not worth it losing your edge just because you weren't willing to sleep at least 8 hours.

, While it wouldn't be regularly recommended in a diet, athletes should load up on their carbohydrate intake.Carbs essentially give your body energy, and you'll need lots of energy if you're playing a sports competition.


Stay away from sugar for a few hours before a big competition. Sugar and starches dehydrate your body. That is something you want to avoid in the midst of competing.Keep yourself up to pace with snacks.Longer matches will be a test of endurance, and something as simple as an energy bar can mean a big difference.

, Warm ups are important for any physically strenuous activity. They can be fairly light, but a proper warm up will help prevent early exhaustion and injury. Aim to warm up around half an hour before the start of the game.Stretch out your arms and legs. Run in place. Work up a bit of a sweat. This will get your body in the right mode for the competition.


Warm ups also help fight off anxiety. Pre-game anxiety can be an issue for some players, so you should keep that in mind if it's something you suffer from.

, Having a good idea what to expect with the opposing side is important, regardless whether you're going one on one or playing as a team. If you want to know which techniques you should be using in the midst of certain competitors, it's a good idea to study their methods in the days and weeks before a big game. If there is any footage of those players during a game, give it a shot.


The science of analytics turns the respective skills of your teammates and competitors into a sharp formula.Matching each player to their best strengths is integral to a team's success. Professional sports analysts make it their specific business to analyze the sporting behaviour of athletes.

, Life is always complicated, and there may be things in your personal life that are bothering you. However, at least for the course of the game, you can't let any of that stuff get to you. It may be easier said than done, but if winning the game means enough to you, it should be a straightforward matter to keep your eyes on the prize.

, A lot of the best athletes may have had a natural aptitude for it, but the reason they ultimately succeed is because they want victory more than any of the competition. That's a tricky thing to develop inside yourself, but if the desire is intense enough, you will do just about anything to make your dreams a reality. This broadly applies to the mindset of training, but it's incredibly important during a competition. How much you want to win will have an effect on how far you end up pushing yourself. Sometimes, the distance between winning and losing is very small. A world of difference is made from that added bit of effort. Passion is the key to most kinds of success, and the same applies to sports.

Before this, go to a race and experience it for yourself.,Next, when the opportunity arrives, get to the track early and ask to meet with the announcer

,
Go over the horses names that will be racing in each race and write down their pronunciation, though many are fairly easy to say.

,
Practice, practice, practice.,
If the original announcer is with you, get your cues from him on when to say different things before the actual race.,
Adjust the binoculars; all track announcers will use binoculars, whether they hold them in their hands or if they are on a tripod.,
Stay calm.,
During the race, read quickly, (not like an auctioneer) but clearly so the people can understand what's happening.

,
In between races, stay hydrated.,
At the end of all the races, thank the people for coming and to drive safe.",How to Be a Good Guest Track Announcer," That way, you can see how the race is done and how they call them;
,,, Yes, have that old phrase stuck in you head. Just pretend to call a race either watching an old race on the television or write down your own race calls. Now is the time to make mistakes, not when you are talking live to the spectators. Your job is to accurately describe what's going on in the race.

, Obviously during the race itself, you will have to say what's happening then

, Also, check your headset microphone, obviously, it has to be a headset so you can talk and handle the binoculars.

, It's not going to help your announcing if you start to panic. Just relax, breath slowly in and out a couple of times and say ""I could make a mistake, but I'll move on and overall just do my best"" the actual announcer will be will you the entire race giving you support.

,, It's good for you to drink water so that 1) you have a good clear voice and 2) it'll also relax you and not feel as tense.

, Turn off your wireless headset Microphone and thank the actual announcer for letting you do the races. Good luck, as this may be a huge step in your broadcasting career.

Let the ball sit at room temperature for two hours.,
Insert the tip of your ball pump into the hole in the ball.,
Pump the ball up 80% of the way.,
Pump the ball up to its full diameter.,
Insert the plug and the let the ball sit for another day.,
Measure the final diameter of the ball.,
Sit on your inflated exercise ball.,
Bounce up and down slowly on your exercise ball.,
Sit on top of your ball with your legs spread.,
Remove the stopper and slowly bounce until the ball is deflated.,
Fold up your ball when you store it.",How to Air up an Exercise Ball," Remove your stability ball from the packaging and allow it to sit in a 20°C (68° F) room for two hours. Doing this will normalize the temperature of the plastic and make it easier for you to blow up the ball., Take the pointed end from your ball pump and place it into the hole in your exercise ball. There may also be an adapter that fits over the nozzle of the pump. This will usually look like a cylinder or cone that comes with your exercise ball. If you have one, simply screw it onto the nozzle of your pump.If there is a white plug inside your ball, you'll have to remove it with a butter knife or other object like a key.
If you are using an electric pump, flip the switch to inflate it.
If you don't have a plug, you'll have to find replacement parts.
When removing the plug, be careful not to puncture your ball.

, Push up and down on the handle on your ball's pump to inflate your ball. The ball should start to become bigger as you pump. Once the ball is pumped up, insert the small white plug that came with the ball and allow it to sit for 24 hours before pumping it up again.


The ball will be very firm at this point., After you've allowed the ball to sit, the ball is ready to be pumped its full size. Remove the white plug that you inserted earlier and quickly insert the ball pump adapter into the hole. Continue to pump the ball by pressing up and down on the handle until the ball is filled completely.

, Once the ball is fully filled up with air, press the plug back into the hole to stop the air from escaping your ball. Sit your ball indoors for a day before using it., Read the instructions or the packaging that your ball came in and got the correct measurements for how large your ball should be when fully inflated. Use a tape measure to measure the diameter of the ball and make sure that it corresponds with what it says in the instructions.If you are 4'11""(1.49 m) to 5'6"" (1.67 m) tall you should get a 55 cm (1.80 ft) ball.
If you are 5’7″ (1.70 m) to 6’0″ (1.82 m) tall you should get a 65 cm (2.13 ft) ball.
If you are 6’1″ (1.85 m) to 6′ 6″ (1.98 cm) tall you should get a 75 cm (2.46 ft) ball.You can place a marker like a box or piece of tape to mark the distance., Sit on your ball with your knees slightly bent with your feet flat on the floor. Your knees and hips should be level and your thighs should be parallel to the ground. Look in the mirror to see if you are sinking in too deeply, in which case you'll need to inflate your ball more. If your feet are not flat on the ground or your thighs are sloping downwards, your ball is overly inflated. In this case, release a little air from your ball., Doing a bounce test will give you an indication of whether your exercise ball is properly inflated. Bounce up and down on the ball and make sure that your hips and shoulders are in a vertical line while you’re bouncing. If the ball is able to hold your weight and your posture stays straight, the ball is properly filled up.As you work out on your exercise ball, it will slowly deflate over time. Remember to keep the levels of air adequate as time goes on.

, Move the ball under you and find the white stopper on the ball. Face the stopper in front of you in between your legs.

, Once you remove the stopper, the air should start escaping from the ball. To speed up the process, lightly bounce on the ball to force the remaining air out of the ball. Continue to do this until it's completely deflated.

, When your ball is fully deflated, and you've removed all of the air, fold it several times before putting it back into storage. Do not crumple your ball because it can damage it over time and can create creases and cracks when you inflate it.Store your ball at room temperature and don't expose it to direct sunlight."

Launder the jersey on gentle cycle to remove any debris.,

Lay the jersey on the ironing board with numbers smoothed out.
,

Set your iron to the hottest setting and turn the steam feature off.
,

Position the number carefully, and place the edge of a sheet of plain paper over it.
,

Press the edge (not the whole bottom) of the iron to the edge of the letter.,
Gently press down and slide the edge of the iron slowly along the edge of the paper.,Continue until every edge is tacked back down into place.,Leave the jersey on the ironing board until everything has cooled down.,

Pat yourself on the back and prepare for your kid to say ""Hey!",How to Reattach Plastic Lettering to a Jersey," Allow it to dry. Turn your jersey inside out when laundering it to avoid additional loosening of the lettering.
,,,,

Notes:

Place the edge of the paper even with the edge of the plastic number so that you can see what you are doing more easily.
Use only the edge of the iron, not the entire flat surface. The object is to seal the two layers of plastic to each other along their edges. Using the entire flat part of the iron will place too much heat over too much surface area at once.
You will need to experiment with heat, time, and pressure applied to find the best combination. Start with very short pressing time... almost a ""tap"" and gradually increase it until you come to a (few seconds) time period which will adhere the plastic layers without melting them so much that they stick to the paper.



,

You do not want the iron to actually touch the plastic, as this will melt the plastic and leave ugly goo on your iron. See ""Tips"" below.

Consume vitamin C. Some studies suggest that antioxidants like vitamin C may help prevent sore muscles.,
Consider taking magnesium supplements.",How to Accelerate Muscle Recovery," If you've pulled, strained, or torn a muscle, you'll need to let it rest as much as possible. Try to avoid using that muscle if at all possible, or at the very least avoid engaging in the activity that led to your injury (running, lifting weights, etc.).Avoid strenuous physical activity as much as possible for the first 48 to 72 hours after sustaining the injury.;
, Icing an injury will help reduce swelling and inflammation by slowing the flow of blood to the site of the injury.If you don't have ice or an ice pack, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables or other packaged food from the freezer.Ice therapy is most effective in the first 24 to 48 hours after you've sustained an injury.Do not apply ice or an ice pack directly to the skin, as this may cause a cold burn. Instead, try wrapping the ice or ice pack in a clean, damp towel.Apply the ice or ice pack for a maximum of 20 minutes at a time, then remove it for at least 10 minutes before reapplying.Repeat ice therapy for at least 20 minutes every hour, unless the ice becomes uncomfortable or painful to use on the injury., After sufficiently icing the injury, it may be helpful to use compression therapy and elevation during rest. Compression therapy is as simple as wrapping an elastic bandage, like an Ace bandage, around the injury to reduce blood flow. This will help prevent swelling.You can also elevate an injured limb to further reduce blood flow and prevent swelling. Simply prop the limb up on a pillow or two while sitting or reclining.Do not wrap the injury too tightly, or you may restrict too much blood flow to the limb., If your injury is causing you significant pain, you can take acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin and ibuprofen. These medications will help reduce inflammation and increase mobility while helping to manage the pain.Follow the dosing instructions on the label, or ask your doctor about how much of a given medication it is safe to take.
Aspirin should never be given to children or teenagers unless otherwise recommended by the child's pediatrician. Aspirin has been linked with a potentially-fatal condition in children/adolescents called Reye's syndrome that causes swelling of the liver and brain., You probably know that you should stretch your muscles out before working out, but it can be easy to forget that you must also stretch out after a workout, or even the next day when soreness sets in. Stretching helps improve blood flow and remove any lactic acid/buildup that may cause soreness in your muscles the day after a workout.Extend the muscle group that is sore and hold the pose. This will increase blood flow to that muscle group, improving circulation and flexibility.
Hold each stretch for a minimum of 10 seconds. Start out with shallow stretches and gradually increase the deepness of the stretch on each repetition.

, Even seasoned athletes may feel that they can go from vigorously working out to hopping in the shower, but experts advise that a cool-down period should be an essential part of any workout. Simply add on a relatively brief (approximately 10 minute) period of easy aerobic activity, like jogging slowly or walking, then stretch out your muscles for a few minutes to further promote blood flow., Many experts recommend using heat therapy (like a heating pad, warming gel pack, or submersion in a hot bath) to treat sore muscles.That's because heat, when applied to the skin, promotes blood flow to the sore muscles, which helps the muscle heal and rebuild.Do not apply heat to a muscle that is swollen or inflamed, as this will only increase the risk of continued swelling.Do not use heat therapy if you are diabetic or have poor circulation in your body.Do not lie down with a heat source, as you may fall asleep and burn yourself.Talk to your doctor about how often and how long to apply heat therapy, as your injury may dictate the specifics of this therapy option. Your doctor may also advise you to avoid heat therapy, depending on your medical history.

, Massages are popular among professional athletes, and for good reason. A sports masseuse or another good massage therapist will be able to help your muscles heal more quickly by working deep into the tissue, reducing inflammation and promoting cellular healing.Search online to find a qualified masseuse in your area.
If you don't want to make an appointment with a masseuse, have your partner give you a massage, or give yourself one. Knead your arms and legs with firm, deep motions to promote blood flow and reduce tension.
Using a foam roller may also stimulate muscles in a similar manner as massage. Simply run the foam roller over your sore muscle groups for 30 - 60 seconds each and repeat throughout the day.

, Swimming acts as another form of massage for your muscles, providing gentle resistance so your sore areas get a chance to stretch and move without getting more worn out. Swimming also helps keep your muscles moving during the sore period, promoting blood flow without causing additional inflammation or soreness.Don't do a full-blown swimming workout. Aim for 20 minutes or so of easy laps around the pool for a good sore muscle workout. Use strokes that work your sore muscle groups.

, Allow your muscles enough time to recover from a strenuous workout, especially if you just started a fitness routine. Failing to take a well-needed rest for a day or two can result in muscle tears, which will make muscle recovery time even longer and may result in an ongoing injury.Short-term recovery is the break you take between sets of a workout.Training recovery is the break you take between gym or workout sessions.Some experts recommend giving sore muscles up to 48 hours to rest and relax during training recovery before you work that muscle group again., Getting proper sleep will help your muscles recover more quickly and put you in better shape next time you hit the gym. Aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep. Consistent sleep is made more possible when you go to bed around the same time each night and rise around the same time in the morning.

, Besides soothing the pain of sore muscles, getting into a hot tub or bath relaxes your tissue, reduces muscle spasms, and improves your range of motion.Use your gym's hot tub or sauna once a week to help your muscles bounce back from tough workouts, or try to take a weekly soak in your bathtub at home to help heal sore muscles.


Add epsom salts to help decrease muscle soreness.

, Protein is the building block of muscle tissue.But contrary to popular belief, a diet high in protein won't actually build new muscles, and could actually be detrimental to your workout and your overall health.You should be consuming 0.36 grams (0.013 oz) of protein for every pound of body weight you have. So, for example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you should eat approximately 54 grams of protein every day.Eggs, lean meat, fish, beans/legumes, and tofu are all good sources of protein.
Protein won't build new muscles, but it will help rebuild the microtears in muscles sustained while working out.

, However, you should talk to your doctor before taking any vitamins or supplements, including vitamin C.In addition to citrus fruits like oranges, you can get vitamin C from berries, broccoli, green and red peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, and other leafy greens., Magnesium helps your body's muscles function better while also increasing energy levels and workout endurance.Because of this, magnesium may help ease muscle cramps and speed up the recovery process.


Always take magnesium supplements with food. Taking them on an empty stomach may cause diarrhea and upset stomach.In the US, it is typically recommended that adult and teenage men take between 270 and 400 milligrams each day.Adult and teenage women should take between 280 and 300 milligrams each day.Magnesium is naturally found in roasted almonds, cashews, and peanuts, as well as rice, beans, spinach, and broccoli."

Make reverse snow angels.,
Do hip hinges.,
Do the Superman.,
Try the cobra yoga position.,
Do some wall slides.,
Do pull-ups.",How to Work Your Back Muscles at Home1," This exercise involves reaching your arms out wide, just like when you were a kid in the snow. The arms can move through the full range of the ""angel wings,"" from overhead to beside the hips for a full trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid and spinal erector exercise. Hold a soup can to increase resistance once you have mastered keeping the torso and arms slightly lifted off the floor, shoulders pulled back.Lie facedown on the ground, or a mat. Put your hands to your side with palms facing down.
Slowly bring your arms forward at the shoulder until you reach past your head and your thumbs touch.
Slowly bring your arms back to the starting position. Make sure your arms are straight and elbows are locked for the entire movement.
Do three sets of five reps. Make sure to rest for about 30 – 60 seconds between sets.
If you are a beginner, and not comfortable bringing your arms all the way around, you can work to get them even with your shoulders. Eventually you should be able to build up the strength to reach over the head.;
, Also called “Good Mornings,” these are simple exercises that involve bending forward at the hips. You’ll be able to work your spinal erectors (as well as your glutes, hamstrings, and hips) as you perform a very simple maneuver, one that doesn’t require any equipment.Stand up straight with your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart. Put your hands on your hips.
Pull your shoulders back slightly to tighten your back muscles.
Slowly bend forward at the waist. Make sure your shoulders keep in line with your hips as you go forward.
Bend forward until you are parallel to the ground, then slowly pull back up.
Keep the movement slow and keep the abdominal muscles contracted.
Start with one set to be sure this exercise agrees with your back. Gradually increase up to three sets of 10 – 15 reps. Give yourself 30 – 60 seconds of rest between sets.
You can also do these exercises while sitting. Sit up straight in a chair with your feet planted on the ground directly below your knees. Put your hands on your hips. Pull your shoulders back slightly to contract the muscles, then bend forward to a 45 degree angle.
When you do this, be careful not to bend your back. This will not only prevent you from really working your back muscles, but there is also a chance you will hurt your spine.

, This is a great exercise for your spinal erector muscles, glutes, and trapezius. It doesn’t require any equipment, just enough room to lay out on the ground. By emulating Superman as he flies, you’ll be able to isolate your core muscles to give them a good workout.Lie facedown with your arms and legs extended out straight. Your palms and the tops of your feet should face downward.
Lift your arms and legs off the ground. Make sure they stay straight while keeping your core in place. Think of Superman, stretched out as he flies.
Hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds, then slowly lower your arms and legs back to the ground.
Do three reps with this hold, then rest 30 to 60 seconds before doing another set.
To work the deeper lower back muscles, you can try what is called the Aquaman, where you raise and lower the opposite arm and leg (for example, your left arm and right leg), and hold for 15 to 13 seconds. Repeat with the other arm and leg.
If you are a beginner, try holding the Superman for five seconds, working your way up to 15 to 30 second holds.

, This is a beginner yoga position that works the mid to lower back and increases flexibility.Lie facedown on the floor. Stretch your legs straight out behind you with the tops of your feet on the floor. Bring your arms into your body, elbows bent and hands under your shoulders.
Contract the muscles in your back to lift body upward, using your hands to assist with the positioning. Press your feet, legs, and thighs against the ground. Inhale as you lift upward.
Hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds, breathing normally.
Slowly lower yourself back to the ground, exhaling as you do.
Do around 10 reps. Like any exercise, try to push yourself to hold for a few more seconds each time you do it. You don’t need to do this every day, but it is one you can do several times a week., These are simple exercises that you can do using only a wall. They are also really good for preventing or relieving back pain you may experience while working.Stand with your back against a wall, feet shoulder distance apart and heels one stride length away from the wall.
Slide down into a crouch, getting so that your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Hold that position for five seconds.
Slowly slide back up the wall until you are straight again, then repeat five times.

, Also called chin-ups, this is a common exercise that involves pulling yourself upward using a fixed bar. It is one of the simplest and best exercises out there for working your lats. It does require a pull-up bar, which you can permanently install in a doorway, or buy a door-hanging bar that you can easily hang and remove when you're done. Keep in mind that this is an advanced move — you can use a resistance band to start if you are a beginner.


Wrap your hands over the top of the bar, slightly more than shoulder-width apart. Hang for a moment with your arms straight. Arch your back and pull yourself up so that your chin clears the bar. Pause at the top of chin-ups to sustain muscle contraction. Return to the start position and repeat.
You can change your grip to work different muscle groups. If you spread your hands further apart on the bar, it will be more difficult to pull up, but you focus more energy on your lats. A reverse grip, wrapping your hands around the back of the bar, will put more emphasis on your biceps.Don’t swing during this exercise. The temptation is to help yourself up using momentum, but this lessens the effect of the exercise on your lats. You will wind up pulling the bar towards your chest, which engages other muscles that you aren’t trying to work out.To do a beginner modification with a resistance band, wrap the band around your pull-up bar and hold on to the two ends of the band, backing up so that you feel some tension in the band. Keep your arms shoulder-width apart and pull your elbows down toward your sides, bringing your shoulder blades together. Do two to three sets of 10 reps.Pull-ups can be difficult to start, as you need some good bicep strength already before really attempting them. The key is to push through the early frustration so you can build the muscles necessary to do more and more.Make sure the chin-up bar at your home is positioned above shoulder height and firmly in place. You’ll suffer a pretty nasty fall if it comes off during the exercise.

Hold yourself in a plank position for 1 to 5 minutes .,
Make neutral planks more challenging.,
Add side planks to your static-core routine.,
Do “moving-plank” exercises such as crawling.,
Do a series of hip lifts.",How to Work Your Core1," While there are literally countless ways to work your core, you can begin to stabilize and strengthen your core simply by holding your body in certain static positions. Maintaining a stable trunk while holding a static position that engages several muscles groups in your core is a great way to initially strengthen your core. A great position to start working your core is the plank.To place yourself in plank position, lay down on your stomach, with your upper body propped up on your elbows. Clasp your hands together, palm-to-palm. Place your elbows directly beneath your shoulders and make sure they’re shoulder-width apart.
Raise your hips off of the ground, pushing into the floor with your forearms and toes. Hold your hips at the height which allows your body to make a straight line from your neck to your ankles.
Hold the plank position for at least 15 seconds. Repeat the position five times.
Increase the duration of the hold by 15-second intervals. Try to get to where you can hold a plank for an entire minute. You can also increase the number of times you hold the position.;
, You can vary plank exercises to work your core more aggressively. Once you can hold a plank for over a minute, start making your plank routine more challenging. Do this by raising one of your arms, as well as the opposite foot, off of the ground while in plank position. This will focus the weight of your body on particular muscle groups, and give them a more targeted workout.At first, just lift your right arm and hold it out in front of you for a few seconds. If you can do so while maintaining stability, raise your left leg and hold it out behind you simultaneously, for as long as you are able. Lower these limbs and switch to holding your left arm and right leg out for as long as you are able.

, Side planks will target more specific muscles groups along either side of your body, particularly in your abdomen. To start, lie on your side with your forearm perpendicular to your body and your feet stacked sideways. Tighten your abdominal muscles and push your forearm downwards into the floor. Raise your hips until your whole body is aligned.Hold the position for as long as you are able — at least 15 seconds — and repeat the process on your other side. Do 5 side-planks in each side.
Add to the duration of the amount of time you hold the position in increments of 15 seconds. You can also add the number of reps you do on each side.
You can increase the challenge of a side plank by raising your arms and legs on the side of your body that is off of the floor for 15 seconds to a minute.

, While crawling might not seem like a workout, rest assured it can quickly provide an effective and rewarding core workout. Avoid crawling on your hands and knees. Instead, do an army crawl, resting your weight on the inside of your upper legs and lower arms. Go slow and focus on how you’re moving your body, noting how different muscles in your hips, abdomen, and back engage with each movement.Keep your hips horizontal to the ground, and do not allow them to rock from side to side.
Focus on bring your knees forward with each “stride,” as opposed to splaying them out to the sides of your body.

, Lay down on your back with your knees bent and the soles of your feet flat on the ground. Tighten your ab muscles and raise your hips off the floor until torso and thighs are aligned and hold for five seconds. Your knees should be bent at about a 90° angle when your hips are raised. Repeat the position ten times, adding reps as you are able to do so.Do not allow your hips to drop or rotate while holding the position.
Initially, place your arms at your sides, with palms against the floor for added stability.
To increase the challenge of this exercise, cross your arms across your chest and keep them there through the exercise.

Limit your high-intensity workouts.,
Refrain from only doing cardio.,
Focus on low-impact workouts.,
Use caution when performing shoulder exercises.,
Avoid movements that are more likely to cause an injury.",How to Avoid Exercises That Age You Faster1," High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a great workout. However, if you only do high-intensity workouts and do them too often, you can injure yourself.HIIT workouts put more wear on your body and may cause your body to wear down faster without proper rest in between.
Rest around two days between your HIIT routines to allow your body time to recover.;
, Cardio exercise is beneficial in a lot of ways, like heart health and lowering blood pressure. However, if that’s all you do, it may age you. Cardio exercise doesn’t do anything to help build muscle mass, which is important as you age.As you age, you lose muscle mass. This is a problem because it can lead to a higher risk of falls. Losing muscle mass also slows your metabolism and weakens the skeleton. This means you should include muscle strength training into your workouts.
You should include two and a half hours of moderate aerobic, cardio activity every week along with at least three days of strength training., Doing low-impact exercises such as walking is safer than doing high-impact workouts as you get older. High-impact workouts such as running may even increase your risk of needing a hip replacement or developing osteoarthritis, especially if you have a high BMI.This is because high-impact exercises cause more pounding and wear on the hip, knee joints, vertebrae, and intervertebral discs. Doin this to your body over and over causes the problem.


To stay healthy and avoid potential complications from high-impact exercise, limit exercises such as running, jogging, or jumping rope.
Another option is to mix it up. For example, you can do two days of a low-impact workout, such as cycling, followed by two days of brisk walking workouts, and then finish your week with a high-impact workout, such as jogging., If you are recovering from a shoulder injury or if you are prone to shoulder problems, then you may want to modify your shoulder strength training. Keeping your shoulder muscles strong is important, but some exercises can put strain on your joints and back.For example, you can use elastic resistance bands instead of a machine to do latissimus dorsi pulldowns. Or, you can use dumbbells to do shoulder presses.
Always follow your doctor's instructions for exercises and other movement guidelines following a shoulder injury or surgery.

, Certain exercises are more likely to lead to a bone fracture, especially in those who have weak bones. If you have osteoporosis, then you should avoid these exercises. However, you may also want to avoid them if you are concerned about injuring yourself. These exercises include:abdominal exercises with lots of spine flexion, such as sit-ups.
twisting motions, such as swinging a golf club.
bending motions, such as a dead lift.
explosive or high impact movements, such as jumping up onto platforms.

Do a reverse fly while bent-over.,
Do arm dumbbell rows.,
Do a Romanian deadlift.Adding dumbbells to this exercise provides some additional resistance to give your back the workout.,
Do a twisting bend to the opposite foot.",How to Work Your Back Muscles at Home2," By effectively lifting your arms while leaving them fully extended, you can work the full range of your upper back’s muscles. You’ll need a bit of space for spreading out your arms, but won’t need any equipment other than your dumbbells.Bend at the waist with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees bent, back straight, abs pulled in, butt out. Hold dumbbells with your palms facing in and your elbows slightly bent. Your arms should be hanging toward the ground, but not dangling loosely.
Slowly elevate your arms out to the side. They should end parallel to the ground. Make sure to keep your elbows slightly bent, and use your upper back to carry the weights up.
Slowly lower your arms back to their original position. Your arm muscles should be focused on staying straight. Let your back do the work.
Repeat the exercise, slowly elevating and returning your arms for about 30 seconds. Keep your spine straight during this exercise, and make sure that your arms don’t swing. Moving slowly will help make sure your back is doing the work.

, You can work your upper back by pulling weight upward, a similar motion to rowing a boat. This will help develop your shoulders and upper back, building muscle to help your arms when lifting things. You’ll want access to a weight bench, or at least a low, sturdy chair with which you can support yourself.Put one knee and hand on a weight bench or sturdy chair for support, and hold a dumbbell in the other hand. Keep that arm extended toward the floor.
Pull the weight upward by bringing your elbow toward your body. Make sure to tighten your back muscles for each rep. At the height of your rowing, hold the position for a second to maximize the contraction.
Slowly lower your arm.
Make sure your movements are slow and deliberate to make sure you are properly working the muscles in your back. You shouldn’t be jerking your arms up and down, but slowly moving them between the positions.
Do this for 30 seconds with one arm, then switch sides to work both shoulders. One set involves working both arms.
If you don’t have a bench or a sturdy chair, bend your knees and hips to lean forward towards the floor. You want to be pulling upwards to use gravity for additional resistance. If you are leaning forward, you can also use two dumbbells at once since you won’t need the other hand for support.
If you don’t have dumbbells, look for something that weighs about 3 to 5 pounds, and you can hold easily in your hand. The weight is there to provide resistance, so as long as you can grip it easily in one hand, it will help. A can of food from your pantry is a good replacement., Deadlifts will also really engage the backs of your legs. Rounding your back during this exercise can cause serious injury — make sure you keep it straight. When done correctly, however, reaching downward can help stretch out the muscles in your middle and lower back.Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, and make sure your knees are slightly bent.
Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight, until your back is almost parallel to the floor; the dumbbells should be at about shin-height. Make sure your arms stay straight in order to make sure it is your back doing the work lowering you down. Keep your abs pulled in to protect the lower back from rounding and becoming injured.
After a brief pause at that position, slowly raise your upper body back until you are fully upright.

, This exercise will use the dumbbells to provide resistance as you bend over. In addition, the twisting you make moving between feet with help strengthen your lower back and core. Keep your abs tight throughout, back straight.


Stand up straight with your feet spread further than shoulder-width apart. Have a weight in each hand. If you only have one dumbbell, grab it with both hands.
Inhale and reach your hands down to one foot, twisting your body toward that foot. Make sure your knees are slightly bent and that your arms stay straight. Keep the forward reach well within comfortable range of motion.
Slowly stand up straight, then lower your upper body towards your other foot. Continue alternating sides.
This exercise should not be performed by anyone with any lower back pain, or sciatica, since this move may aggravate that condition.

Do some pulling straps.With a resistance band and enough space to lie down, you can give your shoulders and upper back a quick workout.Lie facedown with the elastic band under your torso.,
Do sitting rows.,
Do back extensions.,
Do trunk rotation exercises.",How to Work Your Back Muscles at Home3," Make sure to hold one end of the band in each of your hands. Hold your hands underneath your shoulders with your elbows drawn into your sides.
Lift your chest off the ground and reach both arms straight out from your shoulders. When you are fully extended, pull on the band by drawing your shoulder blades together. You won’t hold this position for very long, maybe a few seconds.
Relax your shoulders to bring your hands back to the original position. Slowly lower your chest to the ground. Repeat eight times.

, You can use the elastic band to mimic a rowing machine. The band provides resistance to your shoulders and upper back as you pull back.Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you. Wrap your elastic band around the bottom of your feet, or a fixed object near your feet. You should keep your arms extended so that the band is as loose as possible, with one end in each hand.
Pull your arms toward your body, tightening your shoulder blades to get the effect on your back.
Return your arms to the original position. Make sure your feet stay planted as you pull and return the elastic.

, By anchoring your elastic band to the floor, you can extend your back muscles by leaning backwards. The band gives some resistance while you keep your back straight.Make sure the elastic band is anchored to something stable below your knees. It can be under your feet, or be held down by a really heavy object.
Sit upright on a stool, or some other object without a back so you can lean back. Hold the other end of the band up against your chest so it is taut.
Slowly lean backwards until you are at about 30 degrees. Make sure your pelvis doesn’t move and your back stays straight.
Hold that position for several seconds, then slowly return upright. Repeat 10 times.

, Using the elastic band as resistance, you can rotate your upper body to work the back muscles while seated. You’ll need a door knob or some other point you can use to anchor the elastic band.Rotation, especially under resistance, can injure backs, so do this exercise with caution and remember to keep your abs engaged.


Anchor the band to the knob of a closed door or some other location at your seated chest height. Make sure the door or whatever else you have anchored the band to won’t move.
Sit next to the door so that it is off to your right side. Hold the other end of the band against your chest with one hand. Make sure the band is taut.
Slowly rotate your upper body to the left, away from the door. Make sure your pelvis and knees stay in place so your back muscles are doing the work.
Hold the position for a few seconds, then slowly rotate back. Repeat 10 times, then turn around and rotate to the right to work the muscles on your other side.

Use a broomstick for thrusters.,
Try some standing push-ups.,
Leave your laundry basket on the floor.,
Clean out gutters.,
Do some gardening.",How to Work Your Back Muscles at Home4," With a broomstick in place of a weight bar or other equipment, you’ll be able to work out your back as well as a variety of other muscles. It can be a nice break while sweeping up in your house. For your back, this exercises your upper back and shoulder muscles.Stand with your legs apart, slightly wider than your hips. Hold a broomstick in front of you, arms shoulder-width or a little wider. Hold the broom parallel to the ground, at chest-height.
Squat down, and push the broomstick straight up. Make sure you are tightening your upper-back muscles as you push the broom stick upwards.
Lower the broom and stand back up again.

, Similar to regular push-ups, you can use the edge of a household appliance like the washing machine to help work your back and arms. This is a great exercise if you have a few minutes to kill while the washing ends.Stand a few feet away from the washer. Place your hands on the machine about shoulder-width apart. Keep your feet together.
Slowly lower your chest toward the washer by bending your arms. Don’t keep your feet flat on the ground, but lean forward on your toes.
Push back out until your arms are fully extended again. Repeat 20 times.

, This is good when you are moving clothes to and from the washing machine, dryer, ironing board, or drawers. By leaving the basket on the floor, you will constantly be bending over to pull things out. Make sure to stretch out your back each time you bend over.Remember to keep your abs tight and back straight as you bend forward.
It can also be helpful to take out items one at a time. This will force you to repeat the motion over and over again.

, Reaching up and clearing leaves and debris out of your gutters will give your whole body a workout, including your back. You’ll be stretching and reaching from the ladder over the gutter to get your hands in there, and your core will be engaged to keep balance on the ladder.


Remember to keep moving your ladder as you go along the gutter. Reaching too far can cause you to fall over, plus the constant up and down is good exercise for your legs.

, Planting, watering, and weeding outdoors are all good ways to get in some stretching and exercise without going to a gym. You’ll be bent down near the ground. Just be sure to bend at the knees and avoid arching your back to avoid strain.Mulching is another good gardening task for working your back. You’ll need to carry around heavy bags of mulch, and then shovel it around your yard or garden. Just remember to lift correctly when carrying the mulch to avoid straining your back."

Do Swiss ball sit-ups.,
Use a Swiss ball to perform knee tucks.,
Increase the challenge of the knee tuck.",How to Work Your Core2," Swiss balls (or stability balls) allow you to perform classic exercises while amplifying their effectiveness. While you’re likely well-accustomed to traditional sit-ups, incorporating a Swiss ball into this exercise will provide a better workout in less reps. To position yourself, sit upright on a Swiss ball, as though you’re sitting on a straight-back chair with the soles of your feet flat upon the ground in front of you.Swiss balls can be purchased at most stores that sell exercise goods. They are balls made of a soft elastic material, and vary in size. Choose a size based on your height.
Start doing six reps at a time, and repeat the exercise for three sets. Increase the number of reps per set as you are able to do so.
If you can easily do sit-ups on a Swiss ball, hold a weight plate across your chest while doing so to increase the level of challenge.

, Begin in a push-up position with the Swiss ball just beside your lower legs. Carefully lift one leg at a time onto the ball, supporting the weight of your body with your hands on the floor and the ball beneath your shins. Pull the ball forward along your shins by contracting your abdomen, and pulling your knees towards your chest, then allow the ball to roll backwards by slowing pushing your legs back out.Keep your hands directly beneath your shoulders.
Shoot for three sets of six reps each to start, increasing the number of reps as you’re able.

, If you can easily complete multiple reps with the ball beneath your shins, do the same thing with the ball beneath your toes instead. This will make it much harder to pull the ball forward and push it back, as well as increase the distance you are able to roll the ball. When the ball is beneath your toes, take care not to roll off of the ball.To add to the challenge even further, trying rolling the ball forward and backward while balancing on one foot. Don’t forget to do so with each leg.

"
"
Do back extensions.,
Vary your core workouts as you build strength.",How to Work Your Core3," The flip side of the sit-up is the back extension, which uses a hyperextension bench. This is a piece of equipment that holds your body at an angle (about 45°) and securely holds your feet and ankles. Begin by lying face-down on the bench with your ankles under the footpads. Your upper thighs should hit the large, upper pad (if they don't, adjust the bench until the pad is at your thighs).Keeping your body straight, cross your arms over your chest.
Slowly bend forward at the waist, lowering your upper body as far as you can without rounding your back. It is essential for your safety that you keep your back straight during this exercise. If your back begins to round, then you have gone too far forward and should stop.
Raise your torso back to the beginning position. Repeat.
If you’ve been doing a lot of crunches and sit-ups, make sure to start including back extensions in your routine as well.
Don’t extend your upper body backwards too far past a straight spine.
Shoot for three sets of as many back extensions as you can handle.
Back extensions can also be performed without equipment. Lying flat on your stomach, simultaneously lift your arms, chest, and legs off the floor. You should use your back muscles to lift yourself off the floor. Hold for two to five seconds if you are a beginner, hold for up to a minute if you are more advanced. Then release and lower back to the floor. This is similar to the Superman or cobra pose.

, Every few months, change up your core workouts extensively. Otherwise, your body will acclimate to the specific routine you’re doing and it will be harder to gain further strength from the same workout.There are many core-specific workout routines available online. Many sites even offer printable core workouts, some of which are designed to strengthen your core according to the physical activities you most enjoy.
One of the best ways to vary or expand a workout routine is by including or focusing on a new muscle group. In particular, incorporate new exercises that focus on your back, as people tend to favor exercises that focus mostly on their abs.

Strength train.,
Do exercises for your posture.,
Practice yoga.,
Include flexibility and balance exercises.",How to Avoid Exercises That Age You Faster2," Your body loses muscle mass as you age. Including strength training in your workout routine helps you avoid this. You also help prevent your body from sagging by keeping it firm with muscle tone.You should strength train three to four times a week, skipping days in between for muscle recovery. Even just 15 to 20 minutes a day can give you increased health benefits.
Make sure to include free weights into your strength training workout. Don’t just use machines because that doesn’t work as many muscles as you do when using free weights. Alternating, or using just free weights when you are more advanced, can help build more muscle.You may also want to avoid machines that force your arms or legs to move in a fixed path because these machines are more likely to cause an injury.

, As you age, your posture can suffer. Bone health is extremely important to maintain as you get older, and your spine is no different. By incorporating exercises that help your posture, you can help work against osteoporosis or a slouch.Try a single leg extension. Get on your back and bend your knees. Place your hands behind your head. As you exhale, pull your belly button towards your spine as you pull your knee to your chest and extend your other leg until it is at about a 45-degree angle. Make sure your lower back remains touching the floor. Do five to 10 reps with each leg.
Perform these exercises two to three days a week. You can do them more often if you desire.
However, keep in mind that all types of sit-ups place pressure on your back, so you may want to skip the exercise if you have back problems. Sit-ups are also not recommended for older adults., Yoga may help with the aging process. Not only does yoga help reduce stress, but it boosts oxygen, which may make your skin look healthier and younger.You can learn how to do yoga at home through books or videos. You can also take yoga classes at your gym, or you can join a yoga studio. Try adding two to three yoga sessions to your workout routine each week.
Make sure that you listen to your common sense when you take a yoga class. For example, if the instructor suggests a head stand, and you do not feel ready to do one, then don’t. Ask what alternative exercises you can try for your skill level. Remember that building flexibility takes time, so try to be patient and practice yoga in a way that feels safe to you.

, Keeping your body flexible helps you stay fit and mobile as you age. Working on flexibility helps your body and muscles move with more ease. Balance exercises can also keep you agile and mobile while helping you prevent falls.You should schedule 20 minutes two or three times each week for flexibility and balance. You can do a routine like yoga or pilates, or you can work on specific flexibility and balance exercises."
"
Lift appropriate weights.,
Schedule in proper recovery time.,
Make sure you always warm-up.",How to Avoid Exercises That Age You Faster3," When you strength train, use weights that are heavy enough to create some resistance, but not so heavy that you can barely lift them.


Choose a weight that you can safely control and lift.
You should try to do six to eight reps with the weight because this will cause less wear and tear on your joints. The last few reps should be a bit difficult, but not impossible or unsafe.

, After workouts, make sure you give your body and muscles plenty of time to recover. As you get older, it takes longer for muscles to recover after a workout.If you are still sore, tired, and feel achy, you should rest another day before working out again.
Remember to leave at least one day per week for rest.

, Everyone is strapped for time. Maybe you only have 20 minutes to work out or you make it to class late. However, that is not a reason to skip your warm up. Skipping a warm up may cause your body harm. You should warm up and cool down before and after every workout.Failure to warm up can lead to injury to cold or unprepared muscles.
Skipping the warm up might also cause your body’s recovery process to slow down.
You should do five to 10 minutes of light cardio or lifting to warm up before each workout.

Add variation to your practice.,
Get some good competition to practice, before you play a full game.,
Jump into a game and try your layup.",How to Always Make Your Layups in Basketball," You lay the ball with your hand under it. The ball leaves your hand gently and it causes a nice and smooth touch on the backboard. This is useful if you are driving your way towards the basket and are unable to slow down and take the time to aim.;
, The overhand layup is a great alternative to the underhand layup. You hold the ball on top of it as if you will be dunking, it produces more power to touch the backboard roughly. It is useful when you are on the low post.








, Make sure you’re running into the shot. This is the key to the underhand layup, as during the game you’ll be dodging other players and running toward the basket. Don’t run too fast. When you’re practicing take it easy and try to perfect your skill.








, A one foot layup is what most people commonly do. It’s used when you’re moving toward the basket from far away with the ball, or when you’re moving toward the basket and you expect someone to throw you the ball to take a shot.









Run toward the basket.
Once you’re near, jump off one of your feet up toward the basket. You’ll probably jump with one foot (the left) and shoot with the other hand (the right).
Practice this until you’re comfortable running toward the basket and jumping with one foot., Sometimes it’s more appropriate to do a two foot layup. This is often when you’re positioned near the basket and someone passes the ball to you. When doing this layup, you’ll have to be prepared to catch a ball quickly and to shoot at a moment’s notice.









Be aware, the ball could come from a teammate at any moment.
Be ready to jump and aim the second you get the ball.
Don’t let distractions or nervousness break your concentration. , The sweet spot is the two corners of the square on the backboard which sits just above the basket. Laying the ball on this spot will assure you to make the shot.


If you’re tall enough, you won’t have to aim for the sweet spot and can just shoot the ball directly into the basket.
If you’re younger or just starting out, try to hit the sweet spot.
Don’t shoot the ball with too much force, as it’ll probably bounce off and won’t go into the basket.
Feel free to experiment without aiming for the sweet spot, if you are confident.
Watch others who are more experienced shoot the ball and emulate their technique., Before you hit the court with a ball and with other players, make sure to try doing your layups without a ball. Practice your running and jumping technique until you feel comfortable with it. This should help you build your own technique.







, Practice makes perfect, at least most of the time. When it comes to layups, this is true, too. Make sure to practice your layups with a ball on your own as much as you can.








, Now that you’ve practiced a bit, add some variations to your approach. Variations will simulate the many situations you might find yourself in during an actual game. Try as many as possible, as you'll never really know what to expect in the heat of the moment.









Practice coming at the basket from different angles.
Practice coming at the basket from different speeds.
Use cones or other obstacles on the court to simulate opposing players who will try to contest your layup., When you’re practicing your layups, you need to make sure you’ve got some pretty solid competition who is going to contest your layups. Find some friends who are pretty good on the court, and practice with them. Remember, though, you need to play against people who are as good as or better than you in order to improve your skill.









Play full games and go out of your way to practice your layups against a skillful opponent.
Ask skilled friends to let you practice layups against them.
Realize that skillful competition is key., Now that you’ve perfected your layups and practiced, find some friends and play a game. Take it easy, though. Try to find a few friends who want to play a low-stress game. This’ll be the best way for you to test your skills without the stress of a normal match. Don’t worry if you miss some layups, that’s part of learning.









Keep practicing on your own after the game.
Keep practicing with friends.
Keep finding games to play in order to perfect your skills."

Imagine a line that starts at the middle top of your head and travels along the middle of your chest to the lower body. This is the center line of your body and it is the most vulnerable. It should protected at all times.According to the center line theory, you should always attack down the center line and perform your defensive moves against your opponent’s center line.
The basic open stance in Wing Chun is based on the theory of the center line. In the open stance, stand facing forward with your knees bent and your feet pointing slightly outward. By facing your opponent head-on, you are able to attack with the most balanced force.;
, A key Wing Chun principle is that, during fighting, energy should be used conservatively and economically. Use your opponent’s energy by deflecting or redirecting blows. 








Use motion economically and wisely. The idea here is that your body should travel the shortest distance in a minimum amount of time to connect with an opponent. This also helps conserve your own energy.

, A tense body will use energy unnecessarily. Keep your body relaxed and you will be more at ease.








If you have experience in other martial arts, (especially ""hard styles""), you will have to ""empty your cup"" or unlearn bad habits. Wing Chun is a soft style with many neutralizing techniques that require you to be ""soft"" and relaxed. Reconditioning your muscle memory and building relaxed habits can be frustrating and takes time, but it will be worth it in the long run.

, In Wing Chun, the fighter will react to a fight using quick reflexes to interrupt an attack and change the fight to be on your terms.







, Your opponent might be tall or short, big or small, male or female, and so on. Similarly, the environment in which you fight can be different – outside, inside, rainy, hot, cold, and so on. Be ready to adjust your fighting to suit the conditions.







, The practice of Wing Chun is broken into a succession of six different forms, each of which builds on the previous form. In each form, you will learn proper stance, body positioning, hand and foot movements, and balance. These forms are:


Siu Nim Tao
Chum Kiu
Biu Gee
Muk Yan Chong
Luk Dim Boon Kwun
Baat Jaam Dao

, Martial arts schools often focus on one style of martial arts, especially for serious students. Wing Chun academies or clubs may be affiliated with a martial arts association. Search online or in a phone book for local Wing Chun schools.


Check with your local martial arts academies to see if they teach Wing Chun. They may only teach the basics, and if you are serious about learning advanced Wing Chun, you may need to go to an area that has more advanced classes.
Meet with the sifu (instructor) and ask about their background. How many years of experience do they have? How did they learn Wing Chun?
Sit in on a Wing Chun class. Get a feel for how the sifu conducts the class and how the other students respond.
Learning Wing Chun in person is the most preferred method.

, Many websites have lessons for self-teaching Wing Chun. These usually provide videos and levels of instruction and have tiered subscription pricing based on your expertise level (beginner, intermediate, advanced, etc.) and access to material. These can be useful if you do not have qualified instructors or a Wing Chun school in your area. They can also enhance your in-person training if you do currently attend a Wing Chun school. Choose a DVD set or online course that is taught by a Wing Chun Grandmaster or Master.


Some online study courses also offer instructor certification for advanced students who would like to teach their own students.
Some online courses may offer one-on-one instruction via webcam with a Grandmaster.
There are apps available for assisting in your study of Wing Chun, available for Apple or Android phones.
Examples include the “Wing Chun Online Course,” released and endorsed by the International Ip Man Wing Chun Martial Art Association, and the “Wing Chun Kung Fu Long Distance Learning” course., Find an area in your house where you can practice Wing Chun. Make sure there is enough room for you to move your body around in all directions. Check by swinging your arms and legs around. You do not want your moves to be hampered by furniture in the room.


Ideally, this space will have a mirror so that you can see how you move.

, Learning the movements on your own will only take you so far. Eventually, you’ll need to start learning how your movements connect with an opponent. Having a partner will give you good practice in how to react to another person’s movements. This person can also help encourage you and give you feedback on your form.








, Siu Nim (or Lim) Tao, or “Little Idea,” is the basis for many moves in Wing Chun. Siu Nim Tao is the first form in Wing Chun, and it is here that you will learn proper stance, holding your body, relaxation, and basic hand movements.


Each section of Siu Nim Tao should be mastered before advancing to the next section, and before learning other techniques., You will learn the open stance, which faces you head-on to your opponent. Work on keeping your body relaxed.


Practice the Gee Kim Yeung Ma stance, or the open stance. In this stance, stand facing forward. Point your feet outward slightly. Keep your knees bent. Your weight will distribute evenly over both feet. You will focus on your positioning of your arms and elbows in preparation for learning hand and arm movements. This front-on stance will give you the most advantage in a fight, such as allowing your arms and legs to protect your center line. Both sides of your body can be used equally, rather than favoring one side of the body over the other., Fajing develops the release of power. Here, you learn how to use strength and how to preserve strength and energy. Focus on staying relaxed until the moment when your hands are ready to strike.


One of the common movements in Fajing is the palm strike (yan jeung) in which your left hand opens, rotates to face downward, and moves downward to strike your opponent.,


Some of these basic skills are Pak Sau or Huen Sau (strike), Tan Sau (palm up block), Gan Sau (splitting hand), and Bong Sau (wing arm). Much of the Siu Nim Tao practice in this section involves a combination of these movements. Once you learn these skills, you will practice them first on the left hand side and then on the right hand side., Chum Kiu, or “bridge seeking,” introduces the movement of the entire body to supplement what has been learned in the basic form of Siu Nim Tau. In Chum Kiu, you will focus on how to turn your body correctly and efficiently, paying attention to weight distribution and balance. Foot movements like turning and kicking are introduced here.Each section of Chum Kiu should be mastered before advancing to the next section, and before learning other techniques.

, The first section, Juun, focuses on turning, balance, and structure. In Juun, you also start paying attention to your surroundings, even behind you, in order to fight effectively. It also introduces intermediate arm movements, such as Jip Sau (arm break) and Fut Sau (eye rake).

, The second section, or Ser, of Chum Kiu emphasizes deflecting your opponent’s attack and redirecting that energy back at them. You will learn to move your hands and feet as one unit, and then you can learn how to move these parts independently of each other.








, The third section of Chum Kiu focuses on using force in tandem with hand and foot movements. It also uses a combination of tense arm movements and relaxed body movements to accommodate a variety of fighting scenarios. You also work on turning your body to the right and left in order to work on your balance and finding your centerline while fighting.

, Biu Gee, or Darting or Thrusting Fingers,” focuses on using power in very short distances. Students also learn emergency techniques, such as how to recover the centerline when sustaining a fall or being trapped.In each of the three sections of Biu Gee, you will use combinations of hand and foot movements of the first two forms to recover from a disadvantaged position. This will then put you in an offensive position where you can use short range power to disable your opponent.

, Muk Yan Chong, or “Wooden Dummy,” is an advanced form in which you practice with a stationary opponent (the wooden dummy). This helps you identify and learn how your hand and foot movements come in contact with your opponent.







, This form, also known as “6.5 Point Pole Form,” incorporates a pole as a weapon that you use when attacking your opponent. Fighting with a pole can enhance your skills in balancing and defense., Baat Jaam Dao, or “Eight Cutting Swords” or “Butterfly Knives,” is the most advanced form where you use short swords as weapons. It is not taught to everyone who might reach this level; only a chosen few get to learn Baat Jaam Dao. The form focuses primarily on precision, technique and position. Foot and hand movements are altered somewhat from other forms because of the knives."

Breathe deeply.,
Inhale a deep breath.,
Splash water on your face.,
Relax your muscles and hold your breath.,
Hold for 4 counts and then do the opposite on the way down: 8 counts exhale, 2 count hold, exhale, 2 count hold, exhale.,
Try simple breathing exercises.",How to Increase Your Lung Capacity1," You can increase the amount of air your lungs can absorb in a short amount of time, without a long-term investment in exercise or training equipment. The trick is breathing steadily and deeply.


Exhale completely and slowly. Practice it a few times before you start. Don't let any air linger in your lungs. This allows you to inhale more air on the next breath.
Allow your diaphragm to descend by keeping your abdominal muscles relaxed. Your abdomen will expand as your diaphragm descends, making more room around your lungs, and allowing them to fill with air.
Widen your arms, holding them farther away from your body, to help open up your chest.;
, You probably want to fill your lungs to about 80%-85% capacity, to give your body room to relax. You do not want to fill your lungs to full capacity if it means that your muscles tighten up and you're uncomfortable.


Have a friend with you, monitoring your breathing, if possible. You could pass out, in which case you'd want your friend to respond appropriately.
You don't need to puff your cheeks out. You want the muscles in your face to be loose and relaxed. The muscles in your stomach and diaphragm are going to be the ones working.

, Do this while you're holding your breath. Scientists have figured out that splashing water on your face accelerates bradycardia, or the slowing of the heart rate, or the first phase of the mammalian diving reflex.


Your body is preparing to dive underwater, where it will need to regulate its heart beat effectively and pass oxygen throughout the blood in order to keep you alive.
Try to keep the water cold, but not icy. Icy water will trigger another reflex in your body that causes you to hyperventilate, or try to breathe quickly. Hyperventilation will hurt your ability to hold your breath for a long time.

, Try meditating, or closing your eyes. The less energy you expend, the longer your body will be able to hold its breath.


Set an online metronome to 120 bpm.
Breathing from your diaphragm (stomach), inhale for eight counts.
Do two sets of holding two and inhaling while still holding your breath. You might try this step with inhaling through your nose.

,


After 3-4 times, your lungs will be able to hold much more air than they could just twenty minutes beforehand.
Practicing this exercise regularly will also help train your lungs in the long term. Try lowering the metronome's bpm by three or four counts each week.

Make sure you don't lower the metronome too much or else you'll hurt your lungs. Just like exercising, you want to take this at a gradual and regular rate.

, You can do these exercises around the house, at your office, hanging out while watching TV, the list goes on.Blowing balloons is a good method for increasing lung capacity. While you're walking, at home doing chores, or have a spare second, practice blowing up a balloon and letting it deflate. Do this over and over again; you should notice your lungs' ability to pump more air, stronger and longer.
Another method is to tape a long, light slip of paper (or a tissue) to the tip of your nose and try to keep it in the air by blowing it as long as possible. Time yourself and if you practice this, exercise regularly, you will be able to keep your slip of paper in the air much longer thus, increasing lung capacity.
Breathing exercises during everyday activities can be helpful. Breathe in for 2-20 seconds, breathe out for 10-20 seconds, and slowly increase the rate. Soon you will find yourself breathing out 45 seconds-2 minutes if you practice enough! You can easily do it while driving, sitting in the office, watching television, playing video games, doing paperwork, at the desk at school, or when you are simply bored!
Try hyperventilating before holding your breath. Hyperventilating simply means breathing in and out very quickly. Note: hyperventilating before diving can be dangerous because the urge to breathe can be delayed beyond the point where you pass out!

Exercise in water.,
Participate in rigorous cardiovascular activities.,
Work out at high-elevation.",How to Increase Your Lung Capacity2," Exercising in water will add an element of resistance training to your regimen. Your body will have to work overtime to supply enough oxygen into your blood, making for a good lung workout.Develop a normal stretching and weight lifting routine out of the water. Make sure that you compensate for the fact that weights will feel lighter when you have the water around you. Practice this routine for a few days until you are comfortable with everything.
Take it to the water. Submerge yourself up to your neck, and do the exercises while in the water. This may not seem like it is doing anything to help you at all, but don't worry. Due to the blood shifting into your chest cavity and the compression on your body, you will have to take shorter, quicker breaths when exercising in the water. Research shows that your air capacity will be cut by up to 75% during this time, and your body will try to compensate for that. If your exercise in the water lasts long enough, and you do it regularly, your respiratory system will become more efficient, increasing your lung capacity.

, Exercising is a great way to increase lung capacity. For at least 30 minutes, push your body to exhaustion so that your lungs are working hard. This hard work will pay off in better lung capacity.Try aerobics. It can surprising how much lung capacity you can develop doing short bursts of intense training.
Do cycling. Pepper your route with elevated climbs. Going up hills means your body needs to pump more blood to your legs; your lungs supply the oxygen to the blood.Go running. Run on a padded track or treadmill to be kind to your knees and joints. Mix in sprints to make sure your lungs are working extra hard.
Swimming - The best sport to improve on your cardiovascular fitness. At their peak, swimmers' lungs will use oxygen three times more efficiently than an average person.

, Working out at higher elevations is a surefire way to boost your lung strength. Higher elevation air contains less oxygen, making the workout tougher, but ultimately more rewarding, on your lungs.If you're serious about increasing your lung capacity, live in high altitude for the duration of your training. At 8,000 ft (2,500 m) above sea level, the oxygen content in the air is only 74%of what it is at sea level. This means your lungs have to work harder to get as much oxygen out into your blood.
When you travel back down to lower-elevation, your body still has increased levels of red blood cells and hemoglobin — for up to two weeks — which means that your overall lung capacity is increased.
Be careful not to train too hard at high elevation, as you could develop altitude sickness.

"
"
Create resistance.,
Breathe in more than your brain thinks you can.,
Play a wind instrument.",How to Increase Your Lung Capacity3," Your lungs will respond to training, so get some resistance training in your routine and watch your lung capacity increase.Breathe in normally through your nose. Take deep breaths. Breathe out through your mouth with your lips still close together. Open them just slightly so a little bit of air can get out, and with resistance. Try to do this as often as possible. It makes the sacs in your lungs more used to having to hold air longer, stretching them out.

, Your brain, of course, looks out for the safety of your body, and is averse to stretching the body's limits. But the body can do amazing things when the brain is persuaded that everything is okay. Make sure you try this.


For eight counts, breathe until your lungs are totally full. After each count you should be able to breathe in more.
For the next eight to sixteen counts, take small sips of air. Feel your belly expanding. You shouldn't feel your shoulders moving.
Hold your breath for a few seconds and release forcefully.
After you feel ""empty,"" make a ""tssssss"" sound for as long as possible. (This is called tizzling, and it mimics the resistance of playing a wind instrument.)
Practice this periodically. When you train your brain to stretch the body's limits, your breathing intake will spike.

, Playing a wind instrument is a great way to give your lungs a regular workout and have fun making music in the balance.


Learn how to play a woodwind or brass instrument such as a bassoon, tuba, trumpet, trombone, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, or flute. This activity will help you control breathing and expand your lung capacity to utilize all the alveoli.
Play in a marching band or a Drum and Bugle Corps. This activity requires more and more lung capacity utilization for your movement and playing and is quite healthy.
You can also learn how to sing. Singing really works the diaphragm, and can aid in continuous breathing exercises. Singers, of course, need to have really strong lungs.

Wear clothing that actually fits, it'll make you seem way more attractive.",How to Be Pretty if You Are Unfortunate With Your Looks," There is no point sitting in your bedroom worrying over your looks. You can change yourself and there are ways of bringing in confidence. Walk with your back straight, and don't slouch. Have a positive outlook on everything. You are beautiful no matter what in your own way.;
, Bathe or shower every day. Wash your hair on a regular schedule that works for you. Use a bath gel that smells great, and try skin lotions if you have dry skin.

, It's best to leave this to the professionals and have it cut at a salon. Not only will this be more accurate, the style will frame your face properly, the stylists will help pick a style with you to suit you, and the products used will be much better. Try out products like:


Mousse
Straightening cream
Heat protector serum or spray
Hairspray
Gel (for wearing hair up)
Hair accessories

, If you wear makeup, remove it properly with makeup remover. Cleanse the face with facial wash (this will help with spots), try a spot cream if you get acne often, and moisturize skin daily.

, Make sure fingernails are never dirty. Wear nail polish if you like. If you're not a fan of color on nails, wear clear nail polish. This will not only make nails stronger, but will add shine. Try dipping them in olive oil each night, this will help build strong nails and heal cuticles. (Be sure the olive oil stays on your cuticles for 2-3 minutes.) Why not jazz them up a bit with a sensible but pretty pastel shade? A French manicure is always most effective. False nails are over-rated and unnecessary in the opinion of many.

, If you're under 18, it's best to keep it toned down. If you have acne, then try getting rid of it with home remedies or consider foundation—but make sure it is the same color and tone as your skin, and wear the color powder over the top. For an easier option, apply concealer which matches your skin color. Try covering under-eye circles in the same way. Add Vaseline to your lips and lightly add pink to your cheeks for a rosy glow (then add a little Vaseline for a 'glow'). Try a little bit of mascara.


Don't feel like you have to wear makeup to be beautiful.

, Don't go as far as false lashes, and make it look natural, yet noticeable. Always make sure you look natural—and don't wear any more makeup than that except for special occasions.

, If you are horrible on the inside, then it will show on the outside. Be nice to people, share your things, and work hard in lessons.

, Smiling makes you look more attractive. When somebody catches your eye, smile confidently. Be polite to people. This looks a lot more attractive than frowning and mumbling.

, Try out mints for good breath, and a little teeth whitener but don't over-do it.

, Instead of wearing boring jeans, try out skirts and tights (or leggings). Alternately, try a classy scarf and some earrings—and if you're sticking to the 'classy' category, hoops aren't recommended. Studs are a better idea.

, It's what's on the inside that counts.

,, Stay fit! Make sure to play or get outside at least 60 minutes a day and eat healthy! Exercise doesn't have to be boring! Try swimming, or horse riding, or walking, WiiFit or even yoga or martial arts. Fruit and yogurt helps, and try to stay away from more unhealthy foods such as cake, candy, ice cream, etc.

, Wear colors that you think will make you look good. Be bold, wear good quality clothes and plan outfits ahead of time.

, Remember that they only try to make you feel worse and make themselves feel better than you. You don't want to sink to their level by saying something back.

, But always remember, don't always count on your prettiness, it's about what's inside your heart that counts. Always be yourself, even if people don't like you for who you are!

Go to different places.,
Read and learn about the news in as many areas possibles.",How to Be More Social and Gain More Friends," People like to be near people who are clean and that smell good. So brush your teeth twice a day, take a shower everyday or as many times as it's healthy in the climate of where you live, and always use deodorant and a cologne or perfume.;
, What type of message are you sending to people through the way you dress? You like wearing plain clothes, larger clothes or plain colors? Well, try to dress more joyful, then. People are more drawn to people that look like they have joy in their lives. You do not have to change completely, but try to improve a few things.



Brighter colors. Instead of going for pales, beiges, dark or grayish tones, go for baby blues, pastel greens, pinks or any color that transmits happiness.

Get updated in fashion. Make a research on the internet, Google about what types of shoes, jeans, shirts and accessories are fashionable right now. There are thousands of websites and blogs out there that can help you.

Do not try too hard. You do not have to wear everything that they say it's fashionable, but do take note of what would look better for your body type, skin color and personal taste. People look much cooler when they dress in style yet look like it's effortless.

, Go on Google and search for what types of haircuts and hairstyles are in right now for your face shape and go for what suits better your personal taste. Once again, you must not look like you've been trying too hard. A subtle look is the best. If you want to wear makeup, you can go on YouTube and search for makeup tutorials.

, Do not slouch! It's not only bad for your back, but it's also bad for how people perceive you. Stand up straight, swing your arms a little as you walk and always look people at their face and make eye contact. This shows people you aren't afraid of life and they will instantly respect you much more.

, Go up to someone you do not know or that you barely talk, and ask anything. ""What time is it? I want to know if the time on my cell phone/watch is right"", for example. Then, you can smile and say thanks. You can also take the chance to pay a compliment on the person, like ""By the way, that shirt looks cool on you"". Try doing it to a different person everyday... people will feel more familiar to you when they see you next time after this, which can lead to more interaction and then friendships.

, Get out of the house, simple as that. Get dressed your best, put on your improved attitude and go take a walk and eat something nice at the mall, or take a walk somewhere that's crowded. In these places you can practice speaking to new people, like asking them about anything. It's a great way to show people how cool you are and also practice your communication skills.

, Read about celebrities news and also politics news, learn what's happening in the world and in entertainment. The more you know about popular culture, the more subjects you will have and more things you will have to ask people in order to strike a conversation.

If the party involves food, consider making something delicious that will become your signature dish that people want you to bring every time you attend a party.;
, Upon your arrival to the party, grab a few friends and make your way to the center of the room. Standing in the center of the room will make it look like you’re the center of attention, and it will draw people to you.

If you arrive alone and don’t know anyone, move towards the center of the room and see if you can start a conversation with anyone, or join any existing conversations.

, Joining an ongoing conversation between a group of people at a party can be a bit daunting. There are a few different ways in which you can do this:Walk up to a group, listen in for a minute or two, and then contribute if/when it makes sense to do so. Only contribute if you have something interesting to say. If you know nothing about the topic, you can ask a question instead.
Introduce yourself to the group. If you do this while people are talking about something else, make it quick and then return the focus to the conversation they were having: “Hi I’m just wandering around introducing myself to people. I’m Jane. Please go on with the conversation!”
Talk to one person in the group first. If you notice someone standing on the sidelines of a large group and not really engaging in conversation, introduce yourself to them and talk to them for a while before turning your attention to the group.

, At a party it’s important to read people, particularly when you're trying to join conversations.If you try to join a group conversation, it’s possible that the group won’t be receptive to you.


An unreceptive group may politely say hello and then return to their conversation without making space for you. If they do this, just move on to another group or person. Remember that it might not be personal. They could be having a somewhat private conversation that they don’t feel comfortable sharing with new people.Another thing that could happen is that the group receives you but doesn’t actively include you in the conversation. In this case they’ll likely make space for you and look at you and smile now and then. In this case, you need to make an effort to contribute., If you want people to notice you, dress to get noticed. This could mean showing off your shoulders at a holiday party, where most people are wearing sweaters, or wearing a brightly colored dress in a room full of little black dresses (LBDs).Dress to stand out, but don’t dress outside of your comfort zone. Exploring different styles is okay, but most of all it’s important to stay true to who you are.

, At a party you of course want to seem friendly and approachable, but smiling all the time may make you look insincere. Instead, keep a smaller smile on your face and reserve your big smiles for greetings.


Smiling big when you say hi to people will make them feel special, like they’re the reason you’re smiling., Casually touching someone’s arm while talking to them can make them feel good, leading them to like you more. Seeing you touch that person may make others want your attention more, too.If you’re not a touchy-feely person, you might skip this step. It’s important to stay true to who you are. That said, you may want to try it out even if it does feel weird at first, just to see if it’s something you’re comfortable with.
Pay attention to who you touch. Some people do not like being touched by other people. If someone seems uncomfortable when you touch them, don’t do it again.

, Good standing posture means having a straight back, squared shoulders, your chest out, your stomach in, your feet forward, and your hips and knees in a neutral position.

A good posture shows confidence. Just be sure that you’re not overdoing it, otherwise you may look overly stiff or snobby, especially if your chin is raised too high, with your nose up in the air.
If you’re sitting in a chair, if possible, move one of your elbows so that it rests atop the back of the chair. This will cause you to lean back a bit and make you look more confident. A standing version of this is to lean on a counter with one arm., Avoid shielding yourself by crossing your arms or holding your drink in front of you. If you’re holding a drink, holding it off to the side will show of your wrists and midsection, making you look open and confident.When you're talking to people, use positive, non-judgemental body language: smile; keep your chin down so that it doesn’t look like you’re turning your nose up at them; stand at a slight angle (a full frontal posture might feel dominating or insulting to some people); keep your palms up; and elevate your eyebrows while you talk.Avoid negative body language such as slouching, crossing your arms across your chest, furrowing your brow, or tightening your lips.Playing with your hair too much will make you look nervous, and make others nervous, too., Don’t get stuck in one place for too long. Unless you’re deep in conversation, aim to change where you’re standing every 10 to 15 minutes.


This will open you up to meeting new people and will also give any admirers the opportunity to view you from different angles., Don’t leave it to the last minute to confirm unless you have a real reason to do that. Leaving the host hanging for a response is inconsiderate, and if they’re planning on food or party favors, it could end up with you missing out.

, When you seem to be at ease yourself, this will make it easier for people to be comfortable around you. Other things you can do:


Encourage people to talk about themselves by asking questions and actively listening. Receive what they say respectfully and without judgement, even if you disagree.
Acknowledge any similarities between the two of you, as this will build a common rapport. Just be careful that you’re not one-upping them — for example, if you both had the same test at school, agree that it was hard, but don’t brag about the A+ you got.
If you want to talk to your crush or maybe someone new, make them feel at ease by saying you’re just on your way out but you wanted to say hi. If they know you’ll be leaving soon, they won’t feel nervous about talking to you for too long, and will be more likely to engage in conversation with you., If people know that you are consistently fun and pleasant to be around, they’re more likely to approach you at a party. Your close friends are around enough to see all sides of you, but strangers won’t know you’re having an off day, so it’s important to be on at a party.


Have you ever stopped going to a restaurant because of the inconsistent quality of their food? When it’s good, it’s wonderful, but when it’s bad, it’s bad, and since it’s not consistent, it’s no longer worth the risk of going there. It’s the same with people and personalities.

, As you listen to what they say, nod and make short comments (e.g., “yes” or “go on”) that show you’re listening. When they’re done, repeat the gist of what they said and ask follow-up questions.When others are speaking, resist the urge to think about what you’re going to say next. Try to stay focused on what the person in front of you is saying instead., A great way to build a bond with someone is to ask for their thoughts and opinions, and then listen non-judgementally to what they have to say. Ask follow-up questions.If someone says something you don’t agree with, try not to get insulted or argue right away. Instead, tell them you never thought of it that way, and ask them to explain further.If the person expresses an opinion that offends you, consider whether you need to let them know that. For the most part, if someone is bigoted, it will be difficult to change their mind and probably not worth your time. Just politely excuse yourself and move on.

, Appealing to another person’s expertise is a way to show your respect for them and to gain their confidence. If you know someone is experienced with something you’re interested in, ask them for advice on things.


Just make sure that your questions are sincere. You don’t want to seem like you’re asking just to make conversation.
Maybe don’t ask a doctor about an illness you have if you meet one at a party. They’re not there to work. You can, however, ask them what they do with difficult patients or about how difficult med school might have been, particularly if you want advice on scheduling your own time.

, Put your own thoughts and needs aside when you’re listening to others. Resist the urge to correct them if you think they’re wrong, and definitely don’t one-up them with your own story. It will just feel like you’re trying to compete with them, and this will look worse on you than it does on them, even if they’re wrong.,

Maybe you like a dress someone is wearing, or you love their hair cut. Tell them! Just make sure that you’re honest about what you compliment them on., Try not to think of it as acting as someone else; instead, think of it as acting as the best version of yourself.


It can feel a bit uncomfortable to practise new skills. You might even feel like you’re faking it, but this is where the saying “fake it till you make it” rings true. With time those skills will become second nature, and you’ll be happy you took the time to practise them., If you’re always miserable, chances are, people won’t want to talk to you. Try to be positive and friendly, especially when you’re talking to people you don’t know very well.Avoid complaining too much or gossiping negatively about anyone. Your listeners are more likely to associate the things you’re complaining about with you than with who/what you’re complaining about., This is related to being a good listener. You can be the center of attention without talking everyone’s ears off. Listen to people. Ask questions about what they say.Encouraging people to talk about themselves will make them feel special and they will likely remember the conversation as being an interesting one.
If you’re stuck for conversation, try asking someone about what sort of hobbies they have or what they’ve recently been up to.If you know anything about the subject they’re talking about, share your experience without interrupting and without trying to one-up the person. If you don’t know anything about what they’re talking about, ask questions.

, Choose a few stories that you know entertain people, and rehearse them to ensure that you don’t bore your audience while you try to remember details or go off on tangents.Some experts recommend having three good stories.Just make sure that you switch them up every now and then so that people don’t catch you telling the same ones over and over again.
Tailor your stories to the party. The stories you tell at a career-oriented party will likely be different from the ones you tell at a party full of your close friends. Stories about people are recommended., Whenever you’re talking, keep in mind that people have shorter attention spans than ever before.

For this reason, try to keep your comments and stories short and to the point.If no one is asking questions about what you’re saying, you might be boring them.If you’re generally a bit of a rambler, and you realize you’re doing it at a party, stop and check in with your audience to make sure they’re still following you.
If your listener begins to look restless or bored (checking their watch or phone, or looking around the room), stop yourself and apologize for being too chatty, and ask them something about themselves.

, Studies have shown that body language, emotion and voice count for far more than the words you say.For this reason it’s important to hone your public speaking skills and body language.

, Find a style for your hair that complements your face and your outfit. If you’re wearing casual clothes, keep your hair more casual; if you’re going more formal, a more formal hair style will be nice.

, It’s not necessary to wear makeup to look good, but it can be fun to add a little boost to your natural look. If you want to keep it low-key, try just giving your skin a creamy glow and topping it with some mascara and a nude lip color.


If you want to go more dramatic — for example, with a smokey eye or vibrant red lipstick — make sure that you makeup matches your outfit. You probably don’t want to look like Morticia Addams in blue jeans and a white T-shirt (although that could be funny).

, A study has found that women’s lips are the most attractive part of their body, particularly when they’re painted red., Which clothes look best on you will depend on your body type — for example, if you’re smaller on top and larger on the bottom (a “pear-shaped body”), wearing tops that accentuate your shoulders will help your body look more balanced., Accessorizing is a great way to add interest to your outfit, particularly if you can’t afford to buy new clothes all the time. It can also help you look more polished.

, Get a stylish haircut, trim your nails and either shave or trim your facial hair. If you have ear or nose hair, it's time to do some man-scaping. Avoid being overly hairy - a hairy back looks good on no one.

Just a little bit of colour added: find colourful scarves, bangles, necklaces, hats, shoes, handbags, glasses, belts, makeup and nail polish.






In the middle: A colourful T-shirt, hats and shoes are still an open option. Tone it down with some jeans or wear a black or grey long-sleeved shirt underneath your shirt.

If you can do that, you will almost certainly get a good response.

, Remember, if you are doing something good, you will be surely noticed! Outcome: You will get a friend and people will realize how good you are!

Accept that you're beautiful the way you are.,
Be confident and secure in yourself and your body.,
Be yourself.,
Be nice, be kind, and be patient with others.,
Try to be friendly.,
Keep a sense of humor about your disability.,
Do not try to cover up your disability.",How to Be Beautiful when You Have a Disability," Everyone is different and special in their own way. This makes us all unique and beautiful. Thinking your disability has made you ugly will only make you self-conscious and uncomfortable. True beauty shines from the inside out. Work on being the best person you can be...not on looking like anyone else.


Read about your disability online to learn more about it. Read what other disabled people have written, and realize that you're not alone.
Each night, write down two positive things about yourself and two positive things about your day. As time passes, you will begin feeling better and better.;
, No matter what your disability is, have the confidence to carry yourself with grace. You have acknowledged the attention you get already...don't let this intimidate you or make you feel ashamed. Hold your head high, return the gaze of people who stare, and explain as much as you feel comfortable if you are asked about your disability. Most people are curious, rather than disparaging. Talking with them lets people know how friendly and open you are....That small step will help your beauty bloom.

, There is no reason to be ashamed of yourself, your disability, or its symptoms.Whether you were born this way or had an accident, there is not much you can do about this, except love yourself. Your disability gives you a unique perspective on the world, and without you, they would be missing something.

, If you have these qualities, then you are beautiful... It is already visible to others, even though you might not have realized your true beauty just yet. There is always going to be some insensitive jerk who says something to hurt you. It happens to everyone at times and your disability is just an excuse for that person to take it out on you in this moment. Do not let this stop you from seeing your beauty. Ignore the ignorant jerk and continue on your way or find someone else to talk to or just tell a joke. Or even smile at the jerk and tell them to have a wonderful day! There is nothing more beautiful than true grace! Others will take notice.

, Don't be afraid to engage people in any given situation. It might not be a good idea on a dark street while all alone, but, when in the grocery store, convenience store, or at a doctor's appointment, look up and smile at the person across from you. Recognize them as fellow human beings looking for happiness in their life.


However, don't worry too much about being social, especially if your disability interferes with it (e.g. social anxiety or autism). In-person interaction is not a prerequisite of beauty. If you prefer to interact through the internet, or keep to yourself, that's fine too, and you can still make a positive contribution to the world.

,

There is nothing more beautiful than a man or woman who exudes happiness with a smile on their face. Laughter really IS the best medicine! There is no reason to make other people uncomfortable by making fun of yourself, but a joke or two can lighten the mood. Smiles make everyone look better., If you are missing a limb and have a prosthesis, most people don't really notice or care until you try to actively distract from it or hide it. People will see what you want them to anyway. Nobody looks like ""everyone else;"" we are all unique. This is what makes you special and memorable. What makes you beautiful is the way that you carry yourself—with kindness, respect, and love.

Even if you don’t go to a spa, however, there is no excuse for dirty and unkempt feet.
Dry your feet properly after showers to avoid athlete’s foot and smelly feet when you take off shoes.
Wear absorbent cotton socks.

Be fit.,

Be fashionable and stylish.,
Be multilingual.,
Be Exciting.,
Be organized and fulfill your commitments.",How to Be a Man of the World," A worldly-wise man knows things, lots of things. Read books, talk to interesting people, and debate a wide variety of topics. Keep up to date with current affairs by reading a daily newspaper. It doesn't take a lot of these kind of actions for others to notice and listen intently as you display your vast knowledge. Also, the ability to read body language is useful, particularly when analyzing the opposite sexes' impression of you. Be interested in and have a vast knowledge of the humanities..;
, Drive a car, and know how to look after yourself. Be financially secure, and own your own place.

, See the world, experience things, other cultures. This is a major step in becoming interesting. Immerse yourself in foreign cultures and come back from travels having 'seen the world', having done things. You should be able to show people this in many different ways, for example, in a bar, have a sophisticated alcoholic drink that is known as an acquired taste (e.g. Guinness over lager). Keep in mind not to be obnoxious about it.

, An interesting, intelligent person is almost always relatively fit, it shows you care about your health and can look after yourself. Playing a sport helps. Health and fitness also give you a certain energy, and add to your presence with both the ladies and the guys.

, This is particularly effective, and yet very accessible. The Piano is a particularly good one. Learn different styles and show them off, this makes for a very interesting person.

, This can be achieved in a number of ways: have immaculate manners, be charming, and smell good. Know how to dance, and well. A very important step is to have a decent handshake. This is a classic greeting that when done wrongly sets a bad first impression (Limp handshake = limp personality). Be firm, but not too bone-crushingly aggressive. Know how to counter someone who has a dominant handshake (palm down). Another important step is knowing how to order wine in a restaurant. Basically, the top tip is to match the origin country of the food type you are eating with the origin country of the wine (e.g. French wine for French food).

, You don't have to be a 'fashionista' for this. Essentials like knowing how to iron a shirt properly, wear a suit properly, tie a bow-tie properly and having a proper pair of shoes will do. Own a high quality watch. You don't have to spend loads of money on your fashion sense and clothes, but don't go cheap. Look for plain clothes, essentials such as a white, long sleeve shirt, plain white and black t-shirts, classic jeans etc.

, If you aren't already, become multilingual. This has links with travel, and is very effective for becoming interesting and cultured. Speaking the languages of your country are a must, as well as some of the most spoken languages of the world (Certain dialects of Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Arabic etc.)

, Be an amazing dancer, and a great cook. Learn about music and have good taste.

, Keep your agenda well planned and never over commit or make promises that you can't deliver. Make sure to always be punctual. A man of word entices respect and admiration from others.

, Some people might assume that in order to be ""hot"" a woman must also be slutty and dependent on others. This couldn't be further from the truth; a woman can still ""be hot"" and respect herself as a person. You can do this by dressing for yourself, and not for the pleasure or acceptance of others. If you think that strong eyebrows or wild hair is hot, then go for it! If you think that sleek hair and thin, arched eyebrows are the way to go, then do that instead.

, It is perfectly find to have close friends, but try not to confine yourself to a clique and exclude other people. You might come off as condescending and snobby, which aren't always considered to be attractive traits.

, You don't want to come off as condescending or as a bully. If someone tries to push you to do something that you don't want to do (or don't feel comfortable doing), be firm and say ""no."" Do not let others bully you, but at the same time, do not bully other people back.


If you find yourself in a hostile situation, end the conversation, and leave. This will paint you as a strong, confident woman, and people may look up to you and admire you. Do not talk back to the attacker, and do not try to bully him or her back. This will only make things worse for you.

, Keep your back straight and your shoulders slightly tilted back. Hold your head high, but not so high that you are looking down at others. A good posture is both comfortable and confident. If your posture feels a little stiff, you might be over-doing it; loosen up a little, but don't slouch.

If you have green eyes, stick with warm browns and violets
If you have hazel eyes, choose something that this brown, gold, or green.
Consider wearing gold or copper eyeshadow to compliment your skin tone., Smokey eyes can be sexy, but they don't have to be black and silver. Try using neutral shades, like tans, beige, browns, pecan, or black. Apply a tan color over your entire eyelid, and sweep a creamy color onto your brow bone. Use a deep brown shade in the crease of your eyelid, and be sure to blend it well into the tan shade. Finish off with some black eyeliner and mascara.

, Chances are, you already have long, thick eyelashes, but you can bring them out further with a lengthening or volumizing mascara. If you are going out to a special event, consider adding on some false lashes for extra glamour.

, This can help draw attention to your lips. Try something in bright red or even plum.You can also go with something peach, rose, orange, or coral toned.Don't wear a bold eyeshadow and a bold lip color at the same time. Don't also wear bold lipstick and bold highlighter. This will make your makeup clash and look too heavy. Instead, pair a bold eyeshadow with a neutral lipstick, or a bold lipstick with a and neutral eyeshadow., Eyebrows are important, because they help frame your face and eyes.Sometimes, they can get unruly and need to be thinned. Try not to get carried away while plucking them; if you make them too thin, they won't frame your face and eyes anymore.


Consider going to a salon to get your eyebrows plucked or waxed by a professional. This will ensure that they are even and the right shape for your face.
If you don't have time to run to the salon, consider grooming them using a brow brush.

, Your skin tone will lighten and darken throughout the year. Try getting a lighter color for the winter months and a darker color for the summer months. You can also mix the two colors together as your tan deepens or fades.

If you have a paler complexion or a lighter tan, try a light bronzer. If you have a darker complexion or a deep tan, you might not even need one to get that healthy glow., Use your ring finger to apply under eye creams or concealer. This is your weakest finger, and will be the gentlest on the delicate skin under your eyes.You can also use concealer to hide blemishes on the rest of your face.

If you want to get a tan, try a lower SPF instead., Straight hair can be sexy, but if you find yourself constantly using mousse to give it some volume, consider adding some layers to it the next time you go for a haircut. The layers will help give your hair some volume, and you'll end up using fewer products, which will be better for your hair in the long run., If you have curly hair, you might be no stranger to frizz.

Don't brush your hair when it is dry. Instead, detangle it with a wide-toothed comb while it is still wet.
Go easy on the heat styling. If you must heat-style your hair, be sure to use a heat protecting spray.
Try using a little bit of Argan or coconut oil in your hair to moisturize the strands and smooth down the frizz.
Consider drying your hair with a t-shirt or a microfiber towel. These will be much gentler on your hair than a towel, which tends to snag and cause tears.

, If you like to dye or highlight your hair, make sure that you are choosing a color that won't clash with your skin's undertone. Even those with darker complexions will have either a warm undertone or a cool undertone. The easiest way to tell is whether gold or silver looks best on you. If gold looks best on you, you will likely have a warm undertone. If silver looks best on you, you probably have a cool undertone. Here are some hair color suggestions, based on your skin's undertone:If you have a warm undertone and would like to dye or highlight your hair, try a warm color, such as a golden blond or brown.
If you have a cool undertone, try a cool blond, red, or espresso brown.

, Silicones can make your hair look smooth and shiny, but they also cause build-up and can only be removed with sulfates. Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents that cause your hair to become dry and brittle.If you find that your hair is looking duller, frizzier, or drier than usual, take a look at your shampoo bottle and see if it contains any silicones and sulfates. If it does, consider switching to a brand that does not contain those.


Consider using a round brush when blow drying your hair to give the ends a slight curl. This will add flow and movement to your hair.

, For a quick, sleek look, pull your hair back into a high ponytail. Be sure to smooth the hair down on top of your hair with some gel or hairspray. This will keep it flat, and make your ponytail appear seamless.


If you have curly or wavy hair, you can do this as well. If you want a really sleek look, however, you might want to try straightening your hair first.

, You can even experiment by parting your hair off to the side. You can also try straightening just your bangs. This will help your hair frame your face a little bit more.

, You will want to do this even if you only straighten or curl your hair a few times a year. Curling irons and flat irons get very hot, and even at their lowest settings can damage healthy hair. A heat protective spray will help keep your hair looking soft and shiny, and prevent it from getting frizzy or split ends.

, Different people have different ideas of what looks hot and what does not. Large and curvy can be just as attractive as thin and willowy. Instead of trying to change your figure, try to wear something that brings out your best feature, be it your tiny waist, your full hips, or your sculpted calves. The most important thing is to dress in a way that you find attractive.

, If you have an apple-shaped figure, you are fullest around your middle and slimmer in the legs. You can help balance the proportions between your top and bottom by wearing slimmer tops and wider pants. Here are some ideas to get you started:Try blouses with corset-like seams or tops that wrap around you. Both will help your waist appear smaller.
Try a dress or jacket that has some pleating under the bust line. This will draw the eye down vertically and make your midsection appear flatter.
Try a V-neck or a scoop neck shirt. This will make your neck appear longer, and it will draw attention up towards your pretty face.
Consider straight-leg jeans instead of skinny jeans. This will help balance out your figure. If you want to hide your tummy, try some high-waisted pants.
Avoid A-lines, billowing blouses, or small prints. If you want to wear something with prints, try a larger pattern.

, If you have a pear shape, then you likely have a smaller chest and a larger hip and tight area. You can make your figure appear more proportionate by wearing slimmer bottoms and looser tops. Here are some tips to get you started:Try wearing darker colored pants or skirts. They will make your legs appear more slender.
Try wearing an A-line blouse or a tunic. If you like to wear belts with them, position the belt just below your natural waist line.
Consider a skirt that flares out slightly at the bottom.
Thick, wide, waistbands will help your lower portion appear smaller.
Avoid wearing tight tops. They will make your top part appear smaller and your bottom part appear even larger.

, If you have an hourglass shape, your hips and bust will be the same size (or similar) and your waist will be much smaller. Most women probably envy you. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of your figure:Avoid anything with too many frills or ruffles. You might also want to avoid straight-lined blouses and dresses.
Make your waist appear even smaller by wearing thick belts.
Avoid wearing busy prints and patterns. Instead, opt for simple patterns or solid colors.
Consider wearing a wrap top, or a shirt with a scoop or boat neckline.
Try some bootcut or flared jeans.

, There is nothing wrong with lacking curves, but there are things you can do to give the illusion of having some. Here are a few tips to get you started:Try a blouse or dress that has ruffles or rouching at the top. This will help your bust appear fuller.
Don't be afraid to wear sleeveless tops. This is a great chance to show off your toned arms.
Try a high-waisted skirt. This will give the illusion of a slender waist and fuller hips.
Get some low-rise bootcut jeans. These will draw the focus to your hips and make them appear fuller than they actually are.
If you want to appear more feminine, then you might want to avoid anything that is too boxy or straight-cut. These sorts of styles will give you a boyish figure (unless this is what you are going for).

, Every body shape is beautiful, but if having a slimmer waist or larger hips will help you feel more confident about yourself, there are a few simple things you can try without making drastic changes:


If you want to have more cleavage, try a push-up bra. You can also buy some silicone pads to stick inside your bra.
If you feel self-conscious about your tummy, try wearing some high-waisted pants or skirts. They will give you a chic, classy look that is still sexy. You can also wear supportive or ""control top"" tights.
If you think your neck looks too short or chunky, try wearing a V-neck blouse. This will draw the eye downward, and make your neck appear longer than it actually is. On the other hand, if you think your neck is too long, try wearing collared blouses. They will draw the eye upward and make your neck appear shorter.
If you think your legs look too stumpy and short, try wearing some nude-colored heels. These will make your legs appear longer than they actually are.

Ensure that you’re comfortable.",How to Be a Stylish Girl," A great way to develop your own personal style is to explore the style of others. This will help you figure out your tastes — what you love, what you dislike, and what you’d like to try.


Fashion bloggers, celebrities, and designers are great people to look to when exploring fashion. Follow them on Instagram and Pinterest to keep track of their looks and interests.;
, This can be online via sites like Pinterest or Clothia, or using a physical scrapbook, into which you could paste print-outs and magazine cut-outs.


You might organize your pages according to season (winter, spring), piece (jackets, dresses), or purpose (work, formal, casual).

, As you explore fashion, consider whether a theme emerges when you look at your favorite items. Are you often choosing punky looking outfits? Maybe you’re more into a retro style like ‘70s rockstar or ‘50s pin-up, or maybe you’re more of a minimalist.


Think about what the things you like say about you, and about how you can express who you are through the things you wear.
If you’re an outgoing actor who loves to dress up, you might wear bright colors and chunky accessories, for example.

, As you start out it might feel overwhelming to put together a great outfit, and it may be tempting to just copy other people’s outfits. Try to keep your look more unique by doing variations on what you see elsewhere.


For instance, you might do the same silhouette but different colours or patterns, or the same colours and patterns, but a different silhouette.
As an example, you could copy the popular look of wearing a high-waisted mini-skirt and a loose-fitting shirt with heels, but do the skirt, shirt, and shoes in different colors from the outfit you saw on someone else. You can also switch things up with accessories.

, Ever seen those “who wore it better” photos? People rarely wear the same clothes in the same way. In addition, they’ll often pair their clothes with different hairstyles and accessories.One person might wear a loose-fitting blouse untucked over skinny jeans with a pair of thigh-high boots, while another person might wear the same blouse tucked into the same skinny jeans, with their sleeves rolled up and a pair of chunky ankle boots.

, Stylish people can put together great outfits no matter what store they’re in. Don’t limit yourself to the big brand stores. Check out thrift, vintage, and discount shops to see if you can find any treasures.A popular thing to do nowadays is to consider the corporate ethics of the stores that you shop in. It can make it a bit more difficult to purchase cheap, stylish clothes, but if you’re politically and environmentally conscious then it’s something you’ll want to consider before entering a store.

, It’s important to step outside of your comfort zone and try new things, but don’t do so at the expense of your self-confidence. Only wear what makes you feel like the best version of yourself.

, Confidence is as important to style as what you’re wearing. Ever heard the saying “don’t let the clothes wear you”? If you lack confidence, you might not be able to pull off the stylish clothes that you love.


Work on feeling good about yourself no matter how you look, and no matter what hangups you may have about your body.

, Style experts build their closets around a few key pieces — all in neutral colors — that can be combined to make the majority of their outfits.Nearly all of them list the same basic pieces:Slim-legged black slacks
Dark blue skinny jeans
Pencil skirt in a neutral color (black is the most popular)
Little black dress in whatever shape best fits your body type

A white, long-sleeved button-down dress shirt
A soft crew-neck sweater (cashmere is popular but expensive) in a neutral color
V-neck t-shirts in neutral colours like white, grey or black
Basic black pumps
Ankle boots in black or brown
Nude or black ballet flats
A black blazer
A beige or black trench coat
A black or neutral colored motorcycle jacket, Narrow your style down to a set of silhouettes that suit your body. This will help focus your choices and make it easier to buy new clothes and put together outfits.Once you know what you look best in, stick to that silhouette and buy variations on it.
Your silhouette might be tight pants with chunky boots and loose-fitting tops, or high-waisted skirts and dainty heels.

, When buying clothes, shoes, and accessories keep in mind how you spend your days. This will ensure that you actually wear what you buy.A teacher will need a completely different wardrobe (i.e. maybe slacks, pencil skirts, sweaters and flats) than a hostess at a fancy restaurant (i.e. perhaps cocktail dresses and heels), for instance.

, Remove everything that doesn’t match your current style tastes. If something doesn’t fit you properly, donate it or have it tailored.Make sure that you feel great in everything that’s in your closet.


Be brutal as you choose what to keep and what to get rid of. Anything that you don’t feel great in is just taking up space and making it more difficult for you to put together stylish outfits.

, Belts, handbags, and statement necklaces are a great way to spice up your classic clothing pieces.Take a little black dress from day to night by switching your flats for heels, and adding a big statement necklace.

, Earrings and necklaces aren’t the only things you can use to boost your style.


Cinch in your waist and add a retro look to a plain little black dress by combining it with a vintage brown belt and handbag.
Wide-brimmed hats have enjoyed popularity for a while now. They’re a great way to dress up most outfits, and are often seen paired with maxi dresses or skinny jeans and blazers. Just be careful not to wear the hat on a windy day!

, Generally big aviators and cat’s eye sunglasses have been popular over the past few years, but you need to choose what looks best on your face.


Stand at a sunglasses rack and try on all the different styles. Who knows? Maybe you look best in a pair of small circular sunnies like John Lennon wore.

, If you’re worried about what colors to go with, start with a neutral palette like black, grey, beige, and white, and then incorporate a few punchy items as you go.


As an example, you could buy a vibrant green blouse to go with your black pencil skirt and black blazer, or a chunky, colorful statement necklace to complement that little black dress and heels.

, Monochromatic outfits, or outfits all in one color, can be really eye-catching. Try putting together an outfit in all one color — popular choices are red or white, but really it depends on what looks best with your skin and hair.All black is a safe bet (although maybe a bit too safe!) and can go easily from casual to chic., Classic fashion advice is to go minimalistic on the clothing and silhouettes and then amp them up with accessories.As an example, you might punch up a plain, loose-fitting black shirt, black skinny jeans and black chunky ankle boots with a chunky gold chain necklace necklace and diamond (or diamond-like) ear studs. Or you might wrap a colorful scarf around your neck and wear a pair of silver hoops.Some people say that adding accessories to an outfit is like seasoning a meal, which is a great way to think about accessorizing.Adding an unexpected accessory that doesn’t obviously go with your outfit can give it an extra punch — for example, a chunky watch and spiky ear studs with a classic, feminine cardigan and fitted pencil skirt., Show off those long legs, accentuate that small waist or full bust, or choose a color that makes your eyes pop (or do all three!). Whatever you like best about your body, choose things that show that off.

As an example, you might make your legs look a mile long with a miniskirt or skinny jeans and heels in the same color, or you might wear a lovely blue-grey scarf to draw out your blue-grey eyes.

, Leave that shirt partly untucked, or wear a pair of casual shoes with dressy slacks and a blazer. Looking too put together might make you look like you’re trying too hard, which can make you look less stylish.

, Stylish people always look stylish, whether they’re in their pyjamas, having low-key hangouts with friends, or out for a night on the town.


With the right styling, you can look stylish even in skinny jeans and a T-shirt. As an example, you might pair black skinny jeans and a simple white V-neck T-shirt with a grey scarf, charcoal ankle boots, a black blazer, and silver hoop earrings.

, Having great-looking hair, eyebrows, skin, and nails will immediately boost your stylishness by making you look more put together.

, No matter what you wear, make sure you feel comfortable in what you’re wearing. This will immediately boost your stylishness by making you look at ease in what you’re wearing.


Heels won’t matter if you look like you’re drunk or injured while you try to walk in them."

Muscles.,
Exercise properly to get or maintain a healthy and fit appearance.

,
Never bulk up for someone else, especially not a current or potential lover.,
Eat properly in order to maintain a healthy weight.,
If you are eating mostly processed foods, eat fresher things instead.",How to Avoid Male Stereotypes1," You do not need Rambo style muscles to be masculine, no matter what anyone says. Plenty of girls like all kinds of body types, and sometimes ""Rambo"" is a turn-off.;
,, It's your body, you should change it only to make you happy.

, Men can eat more healthy foods and it does not take away from your manliness.

, Your diet affects all aspects of your life. The healthier a man is, the higher his stamina and the better his performance is mentally and physically. It doesn't hurt in the bedroom, either.

"
"
Keep yourself well-groomed.,
Shower every day, especially after physical exertion when you sweat.,
Use a good antiperspirant or deodorant.

,
Spray on some cologne for special occasions or everyday events.,
Your hair need not be model-perfect, just clean and neat looking.,
Take care of scalp problems like dandruff as soon as you notice a problem.

,
Keep your teeth clean by brushing at least twice a day, and floss at least once.,
Keep your clothes clean.,
Don't fake it.",How to Avoid Male Stereotypes2," Treat is as an everyday thing.


This doesn't mean you need to spend long amounts of time in front of a mirror, possibly annoying everybody else who shares your bathroom, but spend some time in front of it each day.







,


Do not wait too long after exertion to shower, or else the salt in your sweat dries onto your clothes and your body - leaving you dirty and smelly.







,,


Don't put on too much cologne if you do. Axe and Tag are good examples of this. Nobody likes to hold their breath around you because you wear too much cologne. Not many people like strong cologne, which makes it even easier to put too much on. Stick with a medium to weak scented cologne.







, The style isn't very important, as long as you are happy with it.

,, Don't just brush what you see when you smile- brush all sides of your teeth, paying careful attention to the gum line.


Also brush the roof of your mouth and tongue. Be gentle to the roof of your mouth.







, Stains can be removed usually by rubbing a little laundry detergent on it before throwing it in with the rest.


Don't wear dirty clothes repeatedly just because they pass ""the smell test""- you may not smell them because you are used to the smell. Others can and will.






Throw out clothes with holes, rips, tears, permanent stains, bleach stains, etc. unless your clothes came that way or only wear them around the house. We all have that one tattered, but really comfy shirt or jeans and that's okay, but don't wear it for a night on the town. You don't want to look like a bum.







, If something is ""in style"" but it isn't you, don't wear it! Sacrificing your personal taste for popular style is a mistake. You will look like you are trying too hard, or if you pull it off- you will project a false image of yourself. There is nothing wrong with being a jeans and T-shirt guy if you are one. Your clothes should fit your personality, never the other way around.

Don't be afraid to be polite, gracious, giving, or kind.,
Confidence.,
Don't develop a big ego.,
Keep in mind that the only man who should ever be emotionless is a statue of one.,
Be Yourself.",How to Avoid Male Stereotypes3," These things don't make you less of a man. They make you a gentlemen. There are plenty of masculine men who open doors, say thank you and give up their seats for old ladies on the subway. Potential mates will find chivalry surprising- but wholly charming and attractive and all people appreciate politeness and courtesy.

, Show it! People prize confidence highly, and everyone has some, even if you don't feel it all the time. Know your strengths as well as your weaknesses. Be proud of your strengths and in knowing that your weaknesses do not detract from your self worth. Show your self-assurance in the way you walk and with good posture. Keep your head up and your eyes forward looking ahead, or making eye contact with the person you're talking to instead of at the ground.

, Confidence is a very good thing. But when your self-worth gets out of hand, it can turn into cockiness and that is not good. Keep a balance grounded. Don't show off too much or seem over-confident. People can tell the difference. It makes you look like a jerk, and nobody likes a jerk.

, All emotions are perfectly fine and normal to have and display. Crying, being sad, hurt or happy is okay. The key is timing and compatibility, not the emotions themselves. It is perfectly acceptable to cry or be emotional around a lover. Usually, if you are open about your feelings with someone you care about, they will do the same. That leads to a deeper and more meaningful relationship. But don't turn into an overly-emotional fruitcake.

, Be who you really are inside. Things you believe, your morals, feelings and interests should never change for anyone but you. It will do you no good to meet and deal with other people behind pretenses. If you can't be 100% you 100% of the time, that's okay (in fact, it's normal). But when appropriate, express yourself and talk about things you enjoy. You can connect more genuinely with people by being you, and they will like you for who you really are- consequently you will be able to do more things you enjoy with like-minded people.

Ask preliminary questions.,
Check for licensing.,
Understand the hazards of nail salons before you use them.",How to Avoid Unsanitary Nail Salons," When you arrive, look around you at the general environment inside the building. Check to see how well the salon has been cleaned.Look to see if the floors, ceilings, and walls are clean and if the tables and work areas are tidy.For example, the floor should not have nail clippings or dead skin all over it; the walls and ceilings should be free from mold, dirt, and other grime; and the floors should look mopped. The tables and work stations should look wiped down and free from the remnants of past nail treatments.;
, The cleanliness of the tools is extremely important in order to avoid getting infections from nail salons. When you walk in, look to see if there are nail clippers, files cuticle scissors, or other nail tools scattered around the facility. These should be cleaned and put away between patrons.


The clippers, files, scissors, buffing blocks, and other tools should be kept in air tight pouches after cleaning and opened in front of each patron.
Ask the nail salon workers how they clean their implements. There are two common practices, either liquid disinfectants or steam treatments in an autoclave., Even in the facility is clean, the actions of the workers can affect the sanitation of the salon. When you walk into the facility, watch how the workers deal with their tools. Watch to see how they put the implements away. See if they wash their hands between patrons and after working with different parts of the body.


Make sure the workers are keeping their own stations clean by sanitizing the tables and implements between each patron.
Also look to see how clean they are themselves.
You can also see if your technicians wear gloves, which will help limit possible cross contamination., When your manicure or pedicure starts, the salon worker will bring out the tools to do your treatments. Make sure that the implements come either out of sterile liquid or of airtight pouches. This will ensure that your tools are clean.


If they aren't, ask your nail worker to get different implements that have just been cleaned., In order to avoid getting infections in your nails, do not allow your nail technicians to cut back your cuticles. Your cuticles provide protection against infections naturally. If they are cut back, you are more likely to get an infection.


If your technician wants to work on your cuticles, only allow them to be gently pushed back after they have been soaked and softened in water.
You should not cut your own cuticles or shave your legs before you go. These things provide perfect places to contract infections., If you are worried about keeping extra clean at a salon, consider putting together your own set of nail instruments. Put together the files, buffers, clippers, brushes, and other tolls needed for your nails that you like best. You can bring this to the salon with you so you know where the instruments have been so you won't get infected.


The salon worker may not like working with equipment they aren't used to, which may make it difficult. However, you may be able to insist that they at least try to use them.
Make sure your keep your own instruments clean after you go to the salon so you don't accidentally spread infection to yourself.
You can bring your own nail polish as well to avoid the spread of fungal infections, which can stick around in the polish bottles., When the salon worker needs to get rid of your calluses, they will likely use a pumice stone. Make sure the stone is clean and has been washed. Do not let your technician use a razor or chemical callus remover. These can irritate your skin, cut too deep into your skin and allow infection in, or even burn your skin.


If you are worried about the cleanliness of the pumice stone, you can bring your own., When you are getting a pedicure, you want to make sure the tub of water you soak your feet in is clean. The tub should be drained, cleaned, and refilled between each treatment. This will help get rid of any infections left behind by the person before you.


The same goes for manicures as well. Any water bowl you soak your hands in should be emptied, cleaned, and refilled between patrons. , If you find a salon you like, try to go on a day where it isn't really busy. If the different technicians are rushing through treatments, they may not take every cleanliness precaution they do on less busy days.


You may need to call the salon beforehand or go by a few times before you find the least busy time that works for you.

, Before you go to a nail salon, do some online research to check out the salon. See if the salon has a website, if they have been reviewed on consumer websites, and if there are any negative reviews.


You can assess any comments about the salon to see if anyone discusses how clean it is or if anyone has gotten infections from the salon in the past., Before you pick the nail salon that you want to use, you can ask some questions of the staff and owner. This will help you make sure the salon follows safe practices and cleanliness standards as a general rule. When you choose a salon, call the salon and ask:


Does your salon follow the safety standards? Do you use liquid disinfection or steam sterilization for your equipment?
How do you cut calluses?
Are the nail technicians required to wear gloves?
Are there any nail technicians with advanced training?, In most states, nail technicians need to be certified and trained. You can ask the salon where their technicians were trained and certified to ensure that they will be able to adequately provide you clean service.


You can search the online listings of individual state requirements to make sure you know what is required of the nail workers in your state., Nail salon workers work on many different people every single day. Because of the large amount of people, the workers come into contact with infected skin and blood, which puts them and the salon at risk for a number of infections. These infections include:


Viral infections, such as hepatitis, HIV/AIDs
Bacterial infections, such as Staph, strep, and MRSA
Fungal infections, such as tinea"

Take all necessary academic prerequisites.Some PhD programs in accounting require a bachelor's degree in accounting, business, economics or finance.,
Complete a graduate degree.,
Take the appropriate tests.",How to Earn a PHD in Accounting1," Other programs allow you to obtain an undergraduate degree in any subject as long as you satisfy prerequisite courses, which typically include a fundamental accounting course, calculus, linear algebra, statistics and probability.


Check the prerequisite list of the specific program you’re interested in applying to. If you are unsure, contact the university department directly with your questions. This can help you see if the classes you took at one school will transfer to another university.
Common perquisites include linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and an understanding of integration and differentiation. An MBA-level statistics course is a good class to take as well.;
, To prepare yourself for a PhD in accounting, you’ll need at least two years of graduate-level econometrics, statistics, and mathematics.The best way to get an understanding of these topics is through a master’s degree program. While not every PhD program will require a master's degree, getting a master’s before embarking on your PhD program is the best way to prepare.


Earning a master’s will also make your university application much stronger.
In addition to earning a master’s, some programs prefer applicants to have worked or conducted research in the accounting field prior to applying. For instance, a job as a CPA or independent auditor could strengthen your understanding of the field.

, Graduate students in accounting will need to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Some programs prefer the GMAT, whereas others accept only the GRE. Other schools will take either.Check with the program you're applying to in order to find out which test you should take. Apply to the schools you're interested in as soon as possible after taking these tests; in most cases, your test scores cannot be accepted if they are more than five years old.


The GRE is a general proficiency test covering verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing.The test lasts about four hours, including short breaks allowed between the test sections. There are a variety of test prep materials available for free at https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/. You can take either a paper-based or computer-based test, and sign up for either online at https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/register/centers_dates/.
The GMAT is a general proficiency test covering analytical writing, integrated reasoning, quantitative problem solving, and verbal comprehension. The exam lasts 3.5 hours.There are a variety of test prep materials available online at http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/prepare-for-the-gmat-exam.aspx. You could also check out your local library or bookstore for GMAT handbooks and sample tests. To sign up to take the GMAT, visit https://accounts.gmac.com/Account/Register.

Pen your personal statement.,
Select a program specialty.,
Look at various programs and choose one that will help you meet your goals.Using the generalized personal statement you wrote before, compare the programs at each university you’re considering.,
Talk to professors in the accounting program at the universities you’re applying to.,
Solicit and submit letters of recommendation.,
Submit your applications.",How to Earn a PHD in Accounting2," Explain why you’re interested in a PhD in accounting. Do you want to work for a major financial policy institute? Teach at the university level? Expand your professional opportunities? The personal statement is a good opportunity to clarify your own thinking about why you want to get a PhD in the first place.Decide what type of research you want to do -- archival, experimental or behavioral, or analytical -- and commit to it in your personal statement before applying to a school.To get a better idea of what type of research is available, read some current academic literature and meet with the professors at the school(s) you’re thinking of applying to.
Later, you can incorporate a modified version of your personal statement along with your university application. Add information about why or how the particular PhD program you’ve applied to will help you meet the goals you expressed in your personal statement. Follow the doctoral program's guidelines for word length and content.

, Some accounting PhD programs offer a focus on finance, marketing, organizational management, real estate or operational management.Other specialties include public policy, business policy, or pure accounting. Read academic papers in each sub-field in order to determine what topic speaks to you.

, For instance, if your personal statement is to get a job as a professor, you should choose the school that produces the most accounting professors.


Whatever school you choose, ensure its program offers the necessary coursework and will provide you with the experience you want to help you meet your future goals.
You should also look at requirements for obtaining a PhD at the various schools. Do they expect students to graduate in three years? Two years? What classes and skills does the program emphasize?

, Get a feel for whether you might want any of them as your academic advisor.Additionally, read the academic publications of the accounting faculty at the various schools you’re considering to see if their work excites and challenges you.If not, you might want to look at other programs.

, Part of your application will require professors and/or work supervisors to recommend your abilities and competence. If possible, request these letters while still in school and on the job so that your qualities and performance are fresh in their minds. If you request them after graduation, be sure to include a sample of your work -- a well-done project or essay -- along with a polite email or letter asking for a letter of recommendation.


Explain why you need the letter, and why you’re asking for the particular professor’s advice. For instance, you might explain to a favored professor that he or she inspired you to continue developing your understanding of accounting, and you’re now following up on their advice by pursuing a PhD.

, Most programs require an application to both the accounting program as well as the graduate school.One or both applications will require information about your academic background, work history, and GRE or GMAT scores.. After double-checking all your required documents for spelling errors and omissions, submit them to the appropriate university department.

Arrive early at the school.,
Dress professionally.,
Don’t try to read everything.PhD students are assigned a dizzying amount of reading, often 300-500 pages of reading per week.,
Present at conferences.",How to Earn a PHD in Accounting3," Many PhD students are expected to be in the office or on campus from 8:00-5:00 during the week. This will earn you the respect of the faculty.Making a good impression with the faculty, especially as a first-year student, is very important and could open more opportunities for you later.


Additionally, stay late once in a while. Stick around to talk to students you’re teaching, or put in some extra time on your dissertation.
Show up on at least one day during the weekends, too. Vary the time you go to campus on weekends so that you see many different professors (and many different professors see you).

, Keep your wardrobe business casual when on campus, at least during weekdays.This will create the impression that you’re a serious person. Don’t wear cargo shorts, brightly colored clothing, or torn/ripped jeans. Choose neutral earth tones. Men should wear khakis, dress shirts, or short-sleeved polo shirts. Women should wear skirts or slacks. Avoid open-toed shoes and t-shirts.

, Try to understand the main points the author is making, and draw out enough information so that you can talk about it during your seminars with a reasonable degree of proficiency.

, Academic conferences, colloquia, and consortiums are great opportunities for presenting your original research and networking with others in your field who can inspire you to investigate new avenues for research.Your university will distribute calls for papers (CFPs) to you and all graduate students in your department. Check them regularly to see if there’s a conference or other meeting where you feel you could contribute something.


Presentation experience looks great on a resume.
Even if you can’t present at a conference, you should attend as many as you can to keep up with current research and meet your fellow accounting colleagues.

Read the syllabus.,
Consider the challenges you will have in an online class format.,
Keep a calendar.,
If you have a question, ask it!,
Schedule study time.,
Set up an appropriate study space.,
Start early on your assignments, and make up for missed work early on.,
Have integrity.",How to Develop a Self Disciplined Routine for Online Studying," In a traditional classroom environment, the professor or instructor typically spends a majority of the first class period going over the syllabus and schedule for the class and answering questions that may arise.  However, in an online course, this is your responsibility.  


The syllabus is considered on par with a legal document in some institutions and you are bound by its parameters, so be familiar with them.  
Ask questions via e-mail or other communication tool about anything you would like to have clarified.
Many professors will make allowances if difficulties come up. However, this is for things such as recovering from surgery, or a parent dying, or a natural disaster. Not submitting your test because you had to make Christmas dinner is not.;
, In most lower-level educational settings, the environment is structured: Accounting meets Monday and Wednesdays at 9:30, for example. But many classes allow the student to essentially participate whenever and wherever the student desires. While this comes with incredible benefits, there are also some common pitfalls. For example:


Do you tend to procrastinate? If so, you may need to structure your learning so you do not try to cram a semester's worth of education into a frantic week.
Is time organization an issue? Online learning means you are responsible for your progress, so if you have a hard time with using time wisely, you will have to problem-solve.

, Buy one, download one, create one on your PC, laptop or phone, but get a calendar!  Especially for adults, it is difficult to keep track of dates. And you cannot rely on your instructor to remind you of every assignment and exam date; his or her job is not to keep your organized.


Consider keeping a checklist of things that you need to do so you can check them off one by one.  Sit down and fill out that calendar at the beginning of the course so that you will always know ahead of time what is due on what date.  
Check that calendar on a daily basis! This tool is useless if you do not refer to it.

,  In online courses, the professor has no way of knowing you are confused, or need clarification, or help if you do not speak up!  You may enjoy the anonymity of an online course, or you may hate missing out on the classroom interaction, but there is no reason to have a question go unanswered just because you are ""home alone"" when the question arises.


If you ask a question of your professor (especially in a text) and get a short, terse response, do not take it as a rude response. A simple question will likely yield a simple answer. Also, If a professor has 50 students, it is not really possible to give an elaborate answer to each student. Or, if you need a more detailed answer, simply ask for it.
Consider talking to your professor face-to-face in his/her office if that is possible or he/she may ask you to phone or a Skype session.
Most professors and instructors prefer to a more complete answer via e-mail or other communication tool. ""After-hours"" is usually when instructors have time to devote answers to questions. Very often online professors have classes on a campus, or have another job such as a high school English teacher, a practicing doctor, or is a stay at home father.
Many courses provide or even require  students to interact with each other online.  Take advantage of the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of your classmates.  Share study tips, discuss study topics, even share (sparingly) personal experiences.

, You would certainly schedule time to attend a traditional classroom course, wouldn't you?  It follows that since you are eliminating the travel time and classroom time required for a traditional class, you would have time to schedule study time for your online course.  But ""life"" has a way of distracting us from non-specific tasks like ""studying.""


You may need to be assertive with your family and friends.  Tell them that you need time to study for your online course.   ""Online"" does not mean simply the time you spend on your computer; you need time alone to do the studying or homework required just as you would for a traditional course.  
If you have young children, you will either need to study when they are asleep or when someone can watch them. Young children will simply not let you study uninterrupted. Sitting young children in front of a television or computer is not recommended.

, What this is will vary a bit from person to person, but it will have minimal distractions. Keep it clear, except for a laptop, tools (e.g. calculator, pencil and scratch paper), and maybe a fidget toy or two to stimulate your brain as you work.


If you are a fidgety sort, sit on an exercise ball or give yourself a five-minute break to walk around the room.

, Give yourself more time than you think you'll need, just in case you have a problem you didn't foresee or a hectic day in which you can't work.

, On-line courses are subject to the same code of ethics as any college course. And cheating, plagiarizing, or otherwise committing academic fraud on-line is as serious as doing it in a traditional classroom. Also, as a student, you may learn how to cheat, but you will not actually know the material that you have paid so much money to gain.


In some courses, you have unlimited access to study materials. For instance, if you are writing your Master's of Education thesis, you will need to cite studies, books, quotations, research, and so on. And your professor will have a sense of whether you have actually done the work, or have plagiarized or falsified your efforts.
In some cases, tests are timed so that students do not have time to look up the answer to every question.  
Exams are sometimes given on campus at testing centers that are proctored.  If you are required to take the final exam in a proctored situation, check the syllabus for the percentage of your grade that depends on that exam.  When a student passes every online exam with flying colors then fails miserably on the final exam in a proctored testing center, professors generally understand this as an indication that the student has been cheating.  
The same goes for plagiarism.  The internet has opened a world of research at our fingertips.  What a temptation to just ""cut and paste"" another person's idea and/or findings and present it as our own.  Again, your instructor has ways to check that.
Most educational institutions have a Student Code of Conduct that addresses cheating and plagiarism.  Read it; as it applies to you.

Collect schoolwork and other memorabilia every day.,
Photograph and videotape your child.,
Interview your child.,
Keep a written journal of your child’s milestones.",How to Document Your Child's Educational Milestones1," Start collecting the schoolwork your child brings home in a secure place. Get a storage box, file organizer, or a bin with a lid for papers. You can store artwork and photos separately in photo or archival boxes. Report cards and notes from the teacher are also good documents to keep.


Consider adding other documentation about your child’s school years to the collection. For example, you can clip announcements about your child from school and classroom newsletters, or local newspapers.;
, Photographs and videos are important keepsakes that provide a good visual record of your child’s school years. Take photos or videos of your child throughout the year during school events, including plays, sporting events, spelling bees, science fairs, etc. Also pose your child with special schoolwork and artwork, dioramas, and other school projects. You can also photograph close-ups of the projects you especially wish to remember.


Mark every photo with the date and a note about the event or project depicted in the photo.
Keep copies of class pictures and official school photos.
Ask other parents for copies of photos and videos from school events.

, Talking with your child about school helps you learn more about their experiences. You can record some of these conversations as interviews and keep the recordings with other documentation of school milestones. Choose a single topic for the interview and prepare your questions in advance.


Let your child say whatever is on their mind. This will give you more information about what is important to your child.Topics can include the latest field trip they went on, who their friends are, or which subjects they like. You can find helpful sample questions online.Keep your questions simple. Open-ended or vague questions can be overwhelming.
If you cannot video or audio tape the interview, write it down. Your child might write their answers and it will be fun to see their handwriting and spelling in future years.

, Journaling is another way you can record milestones and achievements as they happen. You do not need to write a lot about each milestone. The important thing is to keep a written record you can look back on to remember those milestones. You can save report cards, notes from the teacher, etc. in a journal with pockets.

Think about how sounds could describe colors.,
Describe how the colors make you feel emotionally.,
Determine the nature of the person’s visual impairment.,
Ask if the person has been blind since birth.,
Find out if the person has color blindness.",How to Describe a Color to a Blind Person," Have the person hold certain objects while you tell them what color it is. It might be helpful to consider using objects that are almost always a certain color.


Have the person hold different pieces of wood, touch the bark of a tree, or touch dirt on the ground, and explain that these things are all brown.

Say, ""Brown feels like the earth, or the dead parts of things that grew out of the dirt from the earth.”


Give the person some leaves or blades of grass to hold, and explain that these are green. Green feels like the alive parts of plants, because when plants are green that means they are alive. You can even give some dead leaves and explain the difference between green and brown.

Say, “The smoothness and suppleness of the leaves feels like green; green feels like life. But when the leaves are crispy like these other ones, they have turned brown and aren’t alive anymore.”


Have them put their hands in a bowl of cool water, and explain that water is blue. Tell them that small amounts of water are very light blue, almost clear with no color, and large amounts of water, like rivers or the ocean, are very deep blue.

Say, “How you feel when you’re swimming in water, the cool wetness that feels relaxing, is how blue feels.”


Explain that heat, such as a fire or candle flame, or a hot stove burner, is red. Red can usually be thought of as heat, or even a burn.

Tell the person, “If you have ever had a sun burn, your skin turns a red color. Or, if you have felt embarrassed and blushed, that heat on your cheeks looks red.”


Explain that concrete, such as on walls or sidewalks, is grey. Metal is also grey – tell them that grey often feels hard and is either cool or hot depending on if the sun is out.

Say, “Grey is very hard and strong. It feels sturdy like a road under your feet, or the wall that you can lean against, but it isn’t alive and doesn’t grow or have feelings.”;
, Smells and tastes can definitely be associated with certain colors.


Explain that spicy foods, and the peppers for spicy foods, are often red. Other foods that are also red are strawberries, raspberries, and cherries. Explain that how those flavors are a very intense sweet is how red looks.

Say, “Just like how you can feel red from feeling heat, you can also taste it when eating something hot and spicy.”


Give the person an orange, and explain that oranges are the color orange. Have them pay attention to the smell and taste.

Say, “Oranges are usually described as refreshing, sweet, and tropical; the sun is orange, and many orange foods need a lot of sun to grow.”


Do the same thing with a lemon and a banana, and explain that lemons and bananas are the color yellow. Even though they are different flavors, both are yellow, and yellow can either taste sour and citrusy, or sweet and nourishing.

Say, “Yellow foods also need lots of sun, they are bright and happy.”


Give the person salad leaves (lettuce and spinach) and explain that these are always green. Green smells and tastes clean and crisp like plants from the earth, and sometimes they are a little bit bitter tasting. Green is usually not sweet like fruit; it is often bitter or can have other smells.

Give the person different herbs to smell, such as mint, and say, “Green smells like this – fresh, clean, and healthy.”


For non-food smells in nature, explain again that leaves and grass are green, and water is blue. The smells at the beach are blue for the water, and brown or white for the sand. Explain that flowers can be any color, and often the same type of flower comes in many different colors, but they usually are not green, brown, grey, or black., Certain sounds can definitely be associated with certain colors.


Explain that sirens should make them think of red, because red is a color used to get people’s attention and many fire trucks and police and ambulance lights are red.

Say, “When you hear a siren, it is to cause people to be alert and pay attention right away, because there might be danger. Red is like that – it’s urgent and grabs your attention.”


The sound of running water, especially a stream bubbling or the ocean waves crashing, should make them think of blue.

Say, “blue is calm and nice, like how the sound of water makes you feel relaxed.”


A sound for green could be the rustling of leaves, or the chirping of birds. Explain that not all birds are green, but because birds live in the trees, the sounds of birds often make people think of the color green.

Say, “When you hear trees rustling and birds singing, that is what green sounds like.”


Describe the sounds of a storm as grey. When there is thunder and falling rain, the sky is grey and it makes everything look more grey.

Say, “Storms are grey. The sounds of the loud thunder and rain mean that it looks grey outside, it’s a bit dark and depressing because the sun isn’t out.”, People commonly associate colors with certain emotional or other psychological states, and many studies have been done on the associations between color and feelings. Explain to the person the most common ones:


Red- usually the color of anger, sexual excitement, physical strength or aggression
Orange- physical comfort, having enough food, warmth, and security, sometimes frustration
Yellow- friendliness, cheerfulness, optimism, confidence, sometimes fear
Green- balance, refreshment, harmony, environmental awareness, peace
Blue- intelligence, coolness, calmness, serenity, logic
Purple- spiritual awareness, mystery, luxury, truth; often associated with dreams
Black- sophistication and glamour (positive), or heaviness, menace, or oppression (negative)
White- cleanliness, clarity, purity, simplicity
Brown- earthiness, reliability, supportiveness
Grey- neutrality; lack of confidence or energy; depression
Pink- nurture, warmth, femininity, love, The majority of people with visual impairments have some useful vision, even if it is just the perception of light. According to the American Foundation for the Blind, only 18% of people who are visually impaired are classified as being totally blind, and the majority of them can differentiate between light and dark.The ability to differentiate between light and darkness can help you to explain black and white, by saying that black is darkness, and white is the presence of light.

, Since almost all blindness (in the United States) is due to eye disease, many people with visual impairment have been able to see at some point in their lives. This means you could help them to remember certain things they used to see by describing them., Color blindness is a certain type of visual impairment in which the person can see objects, but many colors are confused or are not seen as most people see them. Most often people who have color blindness see red, orange, yellow, and green as all the same hue, and they see blue and purple as being the same. While working with or talking to a person who has color blindness, you can simply name the colors of everyday common objects.


Teachers of students with color blindness should always be sure to use white paper and white chalk in order to maximize contrast. Labeling various writing utensils and art supplies (crayons, markers, colored paper etc.) would also be helpful."

Create a list of necessary training materials.,
Write an explanation of core skills to be learned.,
Dedicate a separate section to each learning objective.,
Integrate visual elements.,
Incorporate review exercises.,
Establish an assessment component.,
Ask learners for feedback.",How to Develop Training Materials," The goal may be to teach computer lab managers how to access and navigate various software programs. In a classroom of aspiring babysitters, the objective may be to help teenagers master the most critical aspects of caring for small children.;
, A plan is an overview or outline of how training will be approached. It typically includes the training program schedule, key learning objectives and a list of the available resources.


Estimate how much time to spend on each learning objective. This will assist in the development of training materials and ensure that equal time is devoted to concepts of equal importance.

, For example, participants in a software training program may need hands-on access to the software, screen shots of more complicated software elements, and a training manual that details software features in a step-by-step fashion.

, This is an overview of what class participants can expect to learn after progressing through the training materials. In a class for babysitters, for example, delivering first aid, changing diapers, providing meals for children and handling emergencies may be the main objectives.

, For example, when creating an online module for babysitters, you would provide an entire chapter consisting of various first aid lessons.


Create individual lessons. In a software training class, if the main objective is to teach occupational trainers how to navigate instructional software, each lesson might focus on a different objective. For example, one lesson might introduce learners to the goal of the occupational software. The next lesson might demonstrate the function of each navigational button. The following lesson might address how to run performance reports after students have completed assigned lessons.

, Use graphics, videos, tables and other visual tools to reinforce important concepts.

, To accommodate various learning styles, integrate review exercises in various formats. For example, training materials may include true or false or multiple choice questions to reinforce content. After watching an instructional video, ask students to break up into small groups to discuss the content.

, If using videos or presentations to train students, assess students by asking learners to write down their impressions. When creating a training workbook, knowledge may be assessed through the use of quizzes.

, Evaluate the effectiveness of the training materials by asking training program participants to share their opinions. Training material feedback forms could contain questions about organization, clarity, variety and usefulness, and may be used to revise and improve the materials.

Enroll in and complete the required courses.,
Meet exam requirements.,
Develop your dissertation topic.,
Craft a research plan.,
Conduct your research.,
Take rigorous notes.,
Write your dissertation.",How to Earn a PHD in Accounting4," Depending on the program and your area of specialty, courses might include economics, business, finance, accounting principles, research methods in social science, microeconomic theory, qualitative methods, data mining, managerial accounting, auditing and a doctoral seminar.


Most PhD programs require two years of coursework, though some require three years., Most doctoral programs require that you successfully pass at least one comprehensive exam (or comp) that covers the content you learned throughout the course of your academic career in accounting. There are both written and oral comps, and you might need to take one of each.In many cases, the PhD program will provide you with study guidelines for the exam and will tailor the comp questions to your specific area of specialty.


To prepare for the comps, write a brief (one page) summary of each academic article you read during your seminars and classes. Summarize the main argument or question the author is tackling, as well as his or her findings and conclusion.

, When getting your PhD, you’ll need to write a dissertation, a long, book-like treatise on a particular problem or issue in modern accounting. Your dissertation should be focused, specific, and thorough. Your academic advisor -- a member of the university’s accounting faculty -- will help you focus the dissertation question or questions, and point you in the direction of useful research.


You may have suggested the topic you want to work on in your initial application to the university. Don’t feel obligated to stick to that exact topic, since other issues or problems in accounting might spark your interest as you progress in your program. However, ensure that whatever topic you select is one that you’ll be able to receive guidance on from your academic advisor.
Current trends in accounting encourage PhD students to pursue positivist (non-theoretical) research on subjects relating to the influence of accounting practices on global markets., After you’ve settled on a research topic, you’ll need to make an actual research plan. This means identifying sources you want to examine, traveling to archives (if necessary), and creating a timetable in which you’ll meet certain benchmarks for writing the dissertation.You may need to pursue outside funding from your institution or the institution you will be conducting research at.


You might begin by drafting an outline of your dissertation on the topic of tax evasion. Perhaps you’ll break the dissertation down into various subtopics or chapters, each focused on a particular issue or question related to tax evasion such as the ethics of tax evasion, the law regarding tax evasion, and the future directions accountants that investigate tax evasion could pursue.
Decide when you want each chapter completed and give yourself a certain number of hours each week to work on the dissertation.
If you're conducting research at a far-away archive, ask the archive or its parent institution if they offer funding for visiting scholars. Alternately, contact the head of your own school's accounting department about getting travel funds.

, With your research questions and your timetable laid out for you, you’ll be able to look for sources to develop your dissertation. You should take advantage of both academic literature and raw data if you’re interested in financial accounting and taxation. You should use an experimental approach if you’re conducting research related to auditing or financial decision-making.Use academic literature databases like Corporate Information (http://www.corporateinformation.com/), EconLit (https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/), and Research Papers in Economics (http://repec.org/) to look for useful academic resources.
Examine raw data relevant to your topic. There are man sources of raw data that you can use to develop your dissertation, including stock prices, financial statements, and mathematical proofs.Think about the sources that would be most useful to you and ask your academic advisor for advice as to where you might look for more information.
If you’re interested in experimental research, you will need to arrange controlled experiments with people to probe questions related to accounting. For instance, perhaps you want to find out how much people know about different types of investments. You could conduct oral interviews or administer surveys asking specific questions about the differences between IRAs, Roth IRAs, stocks, and mutual funds.

, When you identify useful sources, immediately write them down in a notebook or a word processor file. Alternately, you could note them directly in your working dissertation document, then develop them later when you have time look at the source and footnotes in more detail.If you’re conducting experimental research, use surveys and record interviews whenever possible. Either way, ensure you document the sources you use and keep a paper trail for yourself to consult when you go back to summarize your findings.


Ensure you obtain permission before recording potential interview subjects.

, Crafting the dissertation is a research-intensive process.The dissertation should explore the findings of your research or experimentation in depth, and demonstrate that you have a deep and thorough understanding of accounting.The front portion of the dissertation should be used to ground your research process by demonstrating how your research relates to the other academic publications in the field. For instance, if you write about managerial accounting, you should read as much as possible in the academic literature about managerial accounting, including past PhD theses. Use prior studies to give meaning to your own work by demonstrating that your dissertation is exploring new territory.You should end the introduction with a specific statement outlining your argument, and a summary of each chapter or section of your dissertation.
The body of the dissertation lays out your main findings. Each chapter should look at a specific topic relating to the larger issue you're examining. For instance, if you write about managerial accounting, you might use each chapter to examine accounting practices in several different large firms within a single industry. The chapters would offer in-depth information comparing and contrasting the different accounting practices with each other.
Conclude your dissertation with a final section summarizing your findings overall and suggesting new directions or solutions to the topic you've examined. Include raw data -- stock prices, interview transcripts or surveys, and other documents -- in an appendix.
During your writing process, submit chapters or portions of the dissertation to your academic advisor for review. Use his or her feedback to shape your dissertation.
After completing the dissertation, you must present your dissertation before a departmental committee. The committee will ask you probing questions about your research process and findings. Talk to your academic advisor about how you can best prepare for the questions you might be confronted with.

Keep all of your documentation together.,
Decide which schoolwork is worth keeping.,
Talk to teachers and other parents.,
Organize materials into binders and photo albums.",How to Document Your Child's Educational Milestones2," It will be easier to find and organize your documents when you store everything in one place. You might not have time to organize your documents regularly. As long as they are in the same place, it will be easier to sort and organize them when you are ready to do so.Put your documents in a location that's easy to access so you can add to it throughout the school year.
Choose a place out of the way of small children's hands (to avoid items being destroyed!).

, Once you start collecting your child’s schoolwork, you will need to choose which items to keep or you may be overrun with material. Begin by selecting items that you will want to look at in the future, especially any work that you really like. You might choose to only keep specific kinds of materials, like tests, stories that have a special connection, special projects, and certificates and awards.Involve your child in the process and ask which schoolwork and projects they want to keep. You might need to limit the number of items they are allowed to choose or they might want to keep everything.
Do not keep any duplicates., Learning how other people organize schoolwork can give you some helpful ideas. Let your child’s teachers know that you are collecting examples of educational milestones and ask what they think are important documents from their classes. You can also ask other parents about the types of schoolwork they keep and how they store it. If your child is in a class with their children, you can also suggest sharing photos and videos about your children’s school year.


Teachers’ classroom displays can give you ideas for organizing your collection of documents. Your child will likely want to keep any of their work that the teacher displayed.

, Putting your documents into binders and photo albums is a simple way to organize them. It will be easier to look back on your child’s schoolwork when it is neatly arranged in a binder or album than if it is in a box. You can organize documents and memorabilia by grade level, educational subject (math, science, English), or by type of material (tests, report cards, stories).Photo albums can focus on specific events, like school plays.


To organize materials into a binder, insert your documents and mementos into page protector sheets and arrange those in the binder in chronological order.
CDs, DVD-ROMs, or flash drives with recordings, photos, and videos can also go in the page protector sheets.
Label the outside of your binders and photo albums so you will be able to identify the contents easily.

Accept there are many ways to define career success.,
Define your passions.,
Examine factors that are important to you.,
Define career success in your own terms.,
View life as a continuos journey rather than a series of goals.",How to Define Success1," Career success need not have a rigid, set definition. While many insist on defining career success based on measurable qualities, such as salary and ranking, there are many ways to define success in your career based on your goals.

#*Part of what makes it difficult to precisely define career success is that there are so many factors at play. Your relationship with your co-workers, your reputation in your field, your salary, your benefits, and more all play a role in whether you can consider yourself successful. A lot of people feel overwhelmed by the many factors that influence their sense of success.To avoid feeling stressed about whether your successful in traditional terms, try to view your career success in a personal manner. Do you fulfilled by your job? Are you happy going into work in the mornings? Much of success is unfortunately beyond your control. You need to accept there are various definitions of success and what ultimately matters is your own sense of worth and fulfillment.;
, If you're looking to define success, first define your priorities and passions. Whether or not your career helps you fulfill your passions is a major determining factor in whether or not you feel successful.


Think about when you were younger. What did you want to be when you grew up as a child? What were your goals in college? Are you using your degree? Why or why not? Oftentimes, people fall into a career path and lose track of their true passions and interests. Conversely, people who feel stressed over their career feel successful when they realize their work truly reflects their passion.Do not fear change. Sometimes, defining one's passions can help with a personal definition of success. Acknowledging what you're doing in the present moment is not, by your standards, successful is scary. It can also be an opportunity to grow. If you always wanted to be a teacher, for example, and work in marketing consider returning to school for a teaching degree. In some states, community colleges may allow you to teach with just an undergraduate education., What is really important to you? Do you crave prestige and honor? Does climbing the corporate ladder, making connections, and closing deals sound like an ideal career? Or are you more idealistically oriented? Does the idea of making a difference and helping others inspire you? There is no wrong way to crave success, but acknowledging what factors truly matter to you as an individual can help you define success., It's vital that you avoid outside definitions of success. Research shows the happiest, most fulfilled people across all careers are those who define success based on personal goals, passions, and desires.Try to write down your definition of success and put in a place where you can see it each day. Reminding yourself of your goals can help you on your way to success.Your definition of success should be somewhat vague. As so much of success is beyond your personal control, keep your definition all encompassing. Something like, ""I want to feel fulfilled in my work every day and do a job that's intellectually stimulating for me."", Many people view success as a series of goals. You get your degree, then a job, then a promotion, and so on. Oftentimes, people find their measurable success to be somewhat hollow and disappointing. Once you've reached a goal, you may feel disappointed that you're not as happy or fulfilled as you thought. Instead, view your life as a continuos journey where you try to do a bit better each day. This will keep you stimulated and emotionally and intellectually active longterm."

Make a scrapbook.,
Sew a memory quilt.,
Create a shadow box.",How to Document Your Child's Educational Milestones3," Scrapbooking lets you keep and creatively display items from school, including the smallest memorabilia. Your scrapbook can document the whole school year or you can focus the contents on specific subjects or events. Scrapbooks generally include photos, documents, notes, and decorations.


Notes, decorations, and titles on pages of the scrapbook are the creative elements that help you personalize the milestones you are documenting.
You can buy scrapbooking kits or you can make you own., You can create a memory quilt featuring your child’s photographs, artwork, and even copies of stories or tests. A quilt will have fewer documents than in an album, binder, or scrapbook, so it is also a good way to focus on an event or a very special set of documents. The quilt squares are documents and photographs that are transferred to fabric squares..


You can send photographs, including photos of schoolwork and artwork, to some photo websites, where they will create a memory quilt for you.

, A shadow box lets you display fewer items than you can in a scrapbook or even a quilt. This is a good way to display items from an event at school, a special project, or field trip. You could also create an overall picture of the school year with your child’s class photo, final report card, and a few examples of their work.


You can make a shadow box yourself or buy one online or at a craft store."

Read up on standard milestones at each stage of your child’s education.,
Monitor your child’s milestones.,
Find academic support.",How to Document Your Child's Educational Milestones4," The standard milestones indicate what children should be capable of at different stages of their education. Knowing what the milestones are for each grade level can help you better understand how your child is doing in school. You can also use this knowledge to help you decide which schoolwork best documents your child’s progress towards specific milestones.Check the websites from your school, school district, or state’s Board of Education for lists of milestones.
Ask your child’s teacher or principal for resources that can help you identify typical milestones.
Consult with your pediatrician about the guidelines they use. Your pediatrician can also tell you how well they think your child is meeting milestones.
Visit your local library to look for lists of educational milestones.

, By comparing your child’s progress with standard educational milestones, you can better track their academic development. Tracking your child’s milestones can let you know if they are performing at grade level. It can also alert you to any learning delays or let you know if your child is achieving above their grade level.Start by making a checklist of standard milestones for each grade level and updating it as your child reaches those milestones.
Report cards and results from standardized testing can help you monitor milestones.
Check in regularly with your child’s teachers about how your child is doing. You can ask about specific indicators of your child’s progress, like lexile levels or college readiness.
Ask your child to perform short tasks associated with specific milestones, like solving mental math problems or describing the characters in a story.Describe your child’s progress in school and any concerns you have in your journal of your child’s milestones.

, If your child is not reaching expected milestones, they may not have the knowledge and skills needed for them to go on to the next level of learning, including the next grade level.This can also be a sign of developmental delays. Extra academic support, including tutoring, can help your child do their best in school.


Have your child tested for developmental delays.
Consult with the school or school district about tutoring, or other assistance for children with learning delays.

Realize first that if you completed the IB program, did well on your exams, scored well on college placement exams etc., then you are probably just as intelligent as the people who got into your top choice schools.,
You might feel some sort of angst at the educational system or the state of your country of origin, so rather than ignoring these feelings, consider putting your IB training to good use and become a political dissident.,
If you're absolutely fed up with where you are now, consider leaving.,
Continue learning, including on your own.,
Set goals and continue making progress.",How to Deal With Post IB Intellectual Angst," Quite simply, admissions committees don't quite know what to do with all the applicants they receive and don't judge decisions based on who was the best student and end up floating into the real of strange subjective things. You may hear differently from them though, but rest assured this is probably post-facto justification that helps them sleep at night. Additionally, no one really knows what goes on exactly in admissions rooms, especially for very ""selective"" universities, however much like a measurement of an undetermined quantum particle, the statistics allow us to know that there are some disturbing trends as of late, including but not limited to the rationing of admissions for minorities... Anyway, you're ok regardless, plus with the out of control grade inflation at most of those schools, your friends are in for quite an existential shock of their own once they graduate.;
, The 1970s was famous for social unrest, civil rights progress, and cultural change. Maybe there's a cause you want to advocate for now, political or otherwise? Maybe come up with a new political theory on how social structures or political misconduct have led to current economic disparities. Angry disenchanted intellectuals have helped spur a lot of social progress throughout history.

, If your next college is a boring intellectual wasteland, transfer to another one. If the patriarchy has got you down, join a lesbian commune. If entrenched social structures in your country of residence have spoiled your personal, spiritual or intellectual goals, become an expatriate and laugh at your countrymen across the border. Not fitting in with the mainstream can be the beginning of great personal growth and change.

, Seriously, nowadays any driven person with a computer can become a modern good will hunting. A lot of web developer types are self-taught, sometimes lectures in college are so terrible you have to teach yourself the material, or maybe the stuff you always wanted to learn about astronomy is posted online. Sidestep the ridiculousness that is getting into a decent college and just teach yourself. Also consider whether college is your thing. If you find your college is completely intellectually shallow (and it often is for us IB folks), consider transferring but also realize that dropping out is an option. Perhaps you could become a self made entrepreneur or forestall returning to college until you've given writing a novel a go. In this economy, many intelligent people are finding it hard to justify getting a degree in the first place.

, Being an independent thinker can be difficult but your continued constructive efforts should pay off. If you're in your view ""unsuccessful"" at the moment, you won't necessarily be in the future. Plus the economy sucks now regardless.

Highlight difficult material to return to before the test.,
Study in more than one place.,
Schedule your studying.",How to Create Study Guides," There are many different types of study guides, each formatted to suit different subject types and learning styles. Whatever you're reviewing for, there's a study guide not only right for the subject, but for your particular needs in learning that subject. Organize the information into the most user-friendly study guide you can.



If you're a visual learner, consider using color-coded sections in your study guides, or using idea mapping to draw out the information and make it more quickly-accessible.

If you've got a linear mind, organize the information chronologically, or alphabetically, so you can make learn one thing in a series, and then move on to the next.

If you need to connect to information emotionally to understand it, organize your notes into narrative form to study it better. Translate concepts from math into a story that you can connect to, then organize your study-guide like a short-story you can recite to remember the application of the formulas.

If you can memorize information quickly, use a format that will help you memorize efficiently, whether it be recording yourself reciting vocab words and definitions, then listening back on your iPod throughout the day, or by creating flash cards and testing yourself regularly.;
, Concept maps involve writing each main idea into a separate box, which are connected according to their chronology or importance. Then, connect branches of associated information stemming from the main ideas. This study guide method provides a good visual of how subject material fits together to make a whole concept.


An example of a concept map for a history chapter on space flight might involve ""The Space Race"" as a main heading, which would branch off into separate categories for The United States and the Soviet Union, with trailing data about specific missions, projects, successes, and failures.
A formal outline, as you're sometimes expected to write for an essay assignment, is an example of a concept map. If outlining works for you and organizes information in a way you find useful, outline the info to study. Formal outlines can make excellent study guides, but only if you find them easy to write out. If it would be stressful to make one, find another solution.
Diagrams of technical information can help to visually represent processes or procedures that take place by way of a series of defined steps. These start with a main concept and are organized from left to right in a way that highlights important key factors in the order in which they must happen.Time lines are good for outlining a series of chronological events, most often used for subjects like history, politics and biology., Create study guides using comparison charts, or tables, when it is necessary to compare and contrast a related group of ideas. You might use tables to organize particular parallels in history or biology, or to compare different writers for a literature course.


For example, a comparison chart collecting different plant species would might have the names of various plants in different column headers, with the plants' kingdom, family and genus in rows underneath. This will help organize the information for quick comparison and review.
You could also make use of comparison charts when you're studying literature, setting up different characters in a novel in different columns, with attributes or other information under each. Likewise, information from two different novels might be nicely organized in a comparison table like this.

, Flash cards are generally created using blank 5 x 7 inch index cards and may contain as much or as little information as you wish, though they tend to be most effective for memorizing individual words, or defining specific concepts. For this reason, they're especially effective for studying languages and history.Write 1 key concept on the front of each index card and then, on the back of the cards, write whatever fact(s) you'd like to associate with the key concepts. Cycle through the cards yourself, or have someone quiz you using the cards. To make sure you've really got things memorized, go forwards and backwards, starting with the front of the card, then with the back. This works especially well for foreign language vocabulary.

, Writing up a practice test can be an excellent way to make you analyze the content you'll be tested over from two perspectives: if you think about what would be good to include on the test, you'll be thinking like the teacher, and if you can anticipate those questions, you'll be one step ahead.


Try to find out if you'll be given a multiple choice test, fill-in-the-blank, or required to answer essay questions. Prepare accordingly by writing questions of the sort you'll be tested over.
Many teachers will be willing to provide old versions of the test, if they're available, for you to use as a study guide. Textbooks will often include sample tests that are an excellent way of studying. While it may seem extra-stressful to take the test more than once, it can be a great way of studying, and might even clue you into which questions will be on the test.

, Create a study guide in a combination of formats, using the main concepts and supporting information you pulled from your study materials. You may draft the guides on paper, by hand, or use a computer word processing, spreadsheet or specialized study guide program to organize your information.


Some students find that re-writing notes and organizing the information into hand-written study guides forces your mind to connect more physically with the information, when compared with typing. While rote recopying of notes has no effect on memory, actively reading and rewriting information can help you double-up on the studying: you've read through the info once, when reading, and again, when writing.Alternatively, if you struggle with hard-to-read handwriting, or simply prefer working on the computer, feel free to type out your study guide, make it as graphically-interesting as you want, and print out copies, or read through it on your mobile device.

, The first place to start studying is by talking to your instructor, professor, teacher, or TA, to direction your efforts and attention to the correct place. If it isn't a major part of class discussions, make sure you find out what information discussed, read, and covered throughout class this particular test will include.


Some courses are cumulative, meaning the information and skills in class accumulate over the course of the semester, while some courses wait to test over all the material until the final examination, testing instead over isolated topics or chapters. Make sure to ask your teacher about the specific content on the upcoming exam for which you're studying, and only study that information.
When in doubt about what to study, emphasize studying new information or skills. While teachers' may delight in throwing an old question at you to test your memory, it's more likely you'll only be tested over the most recent chapters, lectures, and information. Most teachers don't want to trick you.

, Depending on the class for which you're studying, the most important source of information is likely the textbook and the associated reading assignments for the class. Many textbooks will have already bolded or otherwise emphasized the most important main concepts, skills, and ideas for you to study, making them excellent resources for study guides.


Re-read materials to isolate the main ideas to include on your study guide. When reviewing, it's probably not necessary to read every word of a particular chapter. Instead, scan for the main concepts to remind yourself and mark this information for inclusion on your study guide. This, in itself, makes for a good first step in reviewing for a test.
Look for chapter review or study questions to guide the content of your study guide. If a textbook lists possible questions or comprehension checks, copy them into your notes to include in your study guide. Even if the teacher doesn't base tests on the textbook, knowing the information extra thoroughly is an excellent way to review for the questions that might be asked.

, Compile all your lecture notes from class, including any handouts or other supplementary materials that the teacher has provided you. Depending on the focus and content of the course, class notes can be just as important, if not more so, than the textbook and assigned readings.


Sometimes, notes taken in class can be messy, confusing, and otherwise difficult to review, making a study-guide more like an all-inclusive and clean version of your class notes. Save a bit of time for recopying, not word-for-word, but taking the main concepts and important ideas the teacher discussed, from your notes. Translate them into a concise set for your study guide.
If you're not a great note-taker, ask a class-mate if you might review their notes, being extra careful to care for them and return them in a timely manner. Return the favor in the future by taking closer notes and letting your friend use them for review.

, Sometimes, for particular subjects, outside research might be helpful, or even necessary. If your notes and the text don't do enough to ensure that you fully understand a concept, skill, or fact, do additional research to clarify important terms that you don't understand. Fully exploring a particular concept will make sure you've got a unique perspective and understanding of it for the test.


If you're studying for a final exam, be sure to collect your previous tests, study-guides, and handouts. These can make for excellent study guides.

, Identify the most important concepts in a particular section or chapter, and make sure you understand those at the cost of more specific, but less important information. Depending on the subject, some specific details like dates, formulas, or definitions may be important, but the skill or topic is more important.



When reviewing for math or science, make sure to have necessary formulas memorized, if need be, but make applying those formulas the more important study-focus. Understand how to use the formula, and when to use it. The concept behind the formula is more important than the formula itself. This goes, as well, for physics, chemistry, or other science courses, in which its helpful to create practical examples that apply the material to real-life situations.

When reviewing for English, make sure you know all the characters names in the book you'll be tested over, but focus more on the plot, the significance of the story, and other themes in the reading, rather than specific details. If you have to refer to ""the main character's sister"" in an essay test, because you forgot the name, it won't matter much if your essay is thoughtful and well-written otherwise.

When reviewing for History, it's common to spend a considerable amount of time memorizing key facts and vocabulary words, but it's also important to understand the themes of the period of history you're studying, and the reason those facts are important. Understand the relationship between all the names and dates, and you'll be in even better shape.

, Condense all of the study materials into manageable sections that will make studying more convenient than looking through the entire chapter. Use bold headings for different sections of information, and consider organizing things into a bulleted list to access it quickly and efficiently.


Identify, explain and demonstrate the relationships between ideas and concepts in sub-steps on your study-guide, or by grouping your study guides into linked packets of info that you can study together. If you're reviewing for a history final, it might make sense to bind all the war sections into one study-group, or all the information on various presidents, to look for the common themes.

, If you make sure that everything you'll need for the test is included in your study guide, you can leave your textbook at home and carry around your handful of papers instead. This is especially important for cumulative exams, in which you'll be tested over a lot of information. Going through all the individually chapters could be overwhelming, while going through your thorough notes will be quick and effective.


Pull out your study guide on the bus, or while you're watching TV, and just flip through it. The more often you do ""hospital rounds"" of the testing information, the closer you'll be to memorizing it.

, If you're having trouble remembering a particular formula, or getting a concept down, highlight it in a designated color, like blue, and continue studying the rest of the material. When you study again, start with everything highlighted blue and make sure you've got it down before the test. This can be an excellent way of reminding you not only what you need to learn, but give you specific goals to accomplish in your studying.

, Some studies show that changing the location of your study can help increase your ability to memorize information. In other words, if you do nothing but study in your bedroom, in may be more difficult to remember the information than if you studied a bit in your bedroom, a bit in the backyard, a bit in the lunch room during school., Create your study guides as early as possible, and set aside enough time to study them before the test sneaks up on you. In the few weeks before the test, divide up your time for all the different subjects and sections of each subject you'll need to study, to make sure you've got enough time to spend on each individual area of information. Don't cram everything in at the last minute.


If you struggle with stress anxiety and tend to panic before tests, it can be an especially good idea to get ahead of the game and set deadlines for particular chapters or topics. If you know that you've got to cover the first two chapters this week, before moving on to 3 and 4 the following week, it means you'll have a whole week to devote to that time, and you won't be able to stress about what's in 3 and 4 until later.
Put your studies in different compartments, and only focus on one at a time. Don't switch back and forth between five different subjects until you've studied for one and completed it.

Define family success through love.,
Reexamine yourself and your priorities.,
Do not compare yourself to others.,
Define personal success in a way that's meaningful to you.",How to Define Success2," Family success is difficult to define as it's so intangible. Breaking down family success into achievable goals can be difficult as, even more so than career success, so much is beyond an individual's direct goal. Instead, view family success in terms of being able to love and love in return.


Setting firm goals for family success is hard. If you want to, say, have 3 kids by the time you're 35 there are many factors that can get in the way. You may not meet a significant other until your older. Your husband, wife, or longterm partner may only 1 or 2 kids. It may take longer to conceive or adopt or whatever process you were looking into. Setting firm goals for your family life means you're setting yourself up for disappointment.Instead, try to cultivate better relationships with those around you. Make goals that are somewhat vague but still important. Success should be a matter of staying open to love by learning to apologize, communicate, and share. Your goals should be to stay close to your family and keep communication strong throughout your life., Continually re-examining yourself and your priorities can help assure personal success. People change all the time and what you wanted at 25 might not be the same as what you want at 30.


What you want out of friendships and romantic relationships is subject to evolve with time. At 22, you may value your independence but, at 28, long for a more committed relationship. It's okay if your definition of success changes just as long as you're willing to change with it.If you find your personal goals, wants, and needs have shifted you might have to change your lifestyle a bit. Say you were always comfortable being slightly overweight but you suddenly want to work on getting a slimmer figure. You may have to change how you eat and your level of physical activity. Be open to change based on any shifts in your values. Periodically take a day to reexamine what you want from life., Measuring personal success is a highly individual and therefore subjective matter. Comparing yourself to others can be toxic to a healthy definition of success. Do not pay attention to how other people in friendships and romantic relationships. What matters is your wants and needs and whether or not you're pursuing them in a way that makes you feel personally fulfilled.

, Much like career success, how you define personal success should reflect your values. There's no wrong way to feel personally fulfilled. Some people see personal success as having 4 kids and being a stay at home parent. Others see success as having no children and having the freedom to vacation for a few weeks each summer. Both goals are equally valid and important. Define personal success on your own terms, based on your own values."

Follow your passions.,
Look at your strengths.,
Consider jobs with solid prospects.,
Just try a job.,

For example, working as a camp counselor may reveal you like working with kids, and maybe should consider education as a field of study.,
It is OK to not ""know what you want to be when you grow up"".,
Resume Builders for the Indecisive.",How to Choose Subjects After High School," ""When you love your job, you will never work a day in your life,"" goes an old saying. Find a job that includes your favorite activities. Maybe it will still be work, but when you love what you do, it is something you are more likely to thrive in. Note that ""dream jobs"" are still hard work, even if you are a rock star or a professional video game player. However, doing what you enjoy is certainly a better route than something you hate.


If you love drawing, think about taking a course on that and joining a club on drawing.
If you love video games, you may want a course on programming.
Love an area of science? If you are interested in a specific area, such as genetics, astronomy, geology, biology, or psychology that may be an area to look into.;
, Everyone comes to the world with certain strengths and weaknesses, and knowing what they are make a difference in figuring where to focus your energies. For example:


A person who finds mathematics easy may be interested in accounting, sciences, or engineering.
If you are excellent with people, you may be a good salesperson, therapist, or teacher.
A risk-taker? Maybe you should consider starting a business or start-up.

, It is easy to get caught up in the idea of having a ""dream job"", and not see plenty of jobs that may not be high-profile, but have a good payoff. Having a future as an electrician, accountant, or welder may not be glamorous, but these skilled workers are always in demand and command good pay. It may not be so idealistic an ideal as pursuing your dream of being a rock band drummer, but you are more likely to have a comfortable lifestyle--and you can always play the drums for fun.

, Sometimes, you just have to start somewhere, and either you find you enjoy it, or not, or a mixture of both. This is valuable feedback on both what you enjoy or do well, and what you do not. It is better to just try something than to do nothing at all. As a young adult, you have to get started somewhere to get experience.

Almost always when you start in the job market, it will be a job that is low-paying, low-responsibility, and you are at the bottom of the chain of command. That is just a hard reality, but this is the adult world and unless you start somewhere, you end up nowhere.
Be on time, be respectful, work hard.

,
Working at a retail store may reveal you do not like dealing with the register, but are really excellent with store displays. Perhaps you have a flair for advertising, or design, or organization.
You hate working at an assembly line. You decide this career route will not work for you, and look into getting your license as a CDL driver.

, As a young adult, often you barely know what you are capable of, and do not have experience with the world outside of high school. It is very difficult to know what to choose when you really do not have the data to make a truly informed choice. Besides, in today's world a worker changes jobs and careers fairly frequently -- not knowing exactly what you want to do means you may be open to many possibilities.

Some young adults know exactly what they want to do--good for them, it does not mean you are inferior in any way. Sometimes people give the impression that if you are not focused and driven, you are a failure. That is simply unfair and untrue. Plenty of successful people start out indecisive, overwhelmed, and feeling unsure.
Many people are working in positions today that did not even exist 10 years ago. Therefore, be assured that you cannot be prepared for all changes in the future.
Career counselors can be a very helpful resource. In some areas, high schools have staff members who can give you personality and aptitude tests, and discuss with you your interests. These are not typically required services, so you have to show initiative in contacting such people.
Colleges, university, and trade schools also often have such services.
Professional career counselors. If you can afford it, a private career counselor can help you find your way.
Also try some on-line resources. While not as good as professional counseling, they are typically free and provide a sense of direction.

, It is not unusual to not be able to envision a future outside of high school, and there are some respectable routes to help you explore your future while building a resume. In general, find an organization with authority and structured learning, (or monitored self-direction). Examples of these include:

College or University. A liberal-arts degree exposes you to many subjects, and there is typically flexibility to change majors. For example, you may start out as a history major, find out you excel in business classes, and decide to focus on marketing. However, schools such as trade schools or art schools are often equally good (if not sometimes superior) if you know you are artistically or trade-inclined, but simply do not know what you want to do with these aptitudes.
Military. In many countries, joining the military can provide an environment in which you gain discipline, learn valuable skills, and sometimes see the world. In many cases you can also get credit for university classes.
Paid humanitarian work. For some people, joining an organization in order to help other people will give you important skills and experience, and maturity. Examples include:

Peace Corps
Missionary Work
Americorps (in America).
""Gap Year Programs"" Some schools and organizations have programs for students who want to go to a higher education program, but not right away. This may involve travel, volunteer work, internships, or other special programs.

Determine the number of seconds you have.,
Divide the number of seconds by 3,600.,
Convert your decimal to minutes.",How to Convert Seconds Into Hours1," This information should be given, or it should be a figure you calculated yourself.

For example, you might be converting 2,400 seconds into hours. 
;
, Note that there are 3,600 seconds in one hour.So, if you have more than 3,600 seconds, your conversion will be greater than 1 hour. If you have less than 3,600 seconds, your conversion will be a fraction of an hour.

For example, 2,4003,600=0.6667{\displaystyle {\frac {2,400}{3,600}}=0.6667}. So, 2,400 seconds is equal to 0.6667 hours.

As another example, 5,6003,600=1.5556{\displaystyle {\frac {5,600}{3,600}}=1.5556}. So, 5,600 seconds is equal to 1.5556 hours.


, This step is helpful if you are working with a number of seconds equal to less than an hour, so that you can gauge how long a certain decimal is. To convert the decimal to minutes, multiply it by 60.For example, 0.6667×60=40{\displaystyle 0.6667\times 60=40}. So, 2,400 seconds is equal to .6667 hours, or 40 minutes.

For your second example, you have 1 whole hour, plus 0.5556 of an hour. So, you only need to convert 0.5556 to an hour: 0.5556×60=33.336{\displaystyle 0.5556\times 60=33.336}. So, 5,600 seconds is equal to about 1 hour, 33 minutes.

Know the state’s requirements for graduation.,
Determine your goals.,
Contact admissions counselors.",How to Create an Unschooling High School Transcript1," Some states require a transcript of high school work while others don’t. However, if you decide to make a transcript, it needs to adhere to the state guidelines where you are graduating. Your transcript should take the work you have done and place them into the correct courses needed for your state’s requirements.Most states have a set number of required credits in English, math, science, social studies, and certain electives. When you are making out your transcript, you can apply your work to the correct required credit.
For example, in Pennsylvania requires high school graduates to have a certain number of credits to graduate, like four in English, three in math, science, and social studies, and two in arts and humanities.Georgia requires a minimum of 23 credits, with four in English, math, and science, and three in social studies and foreign language.;
, Transcripts are most often used to get into college. However, some jobs or internships require transcripts also. Before you make your transcript, determine why you need the transcript and where you will be sending it. Even figuring out what kind of school you want to go to will help you make a better transcript.For example, a community college, a pre-med program, or a science tech school would require different types of transcripts.

, If you want to go to a specific college or program, contact their admission counselors. Talk to them about the guidelines for homeschoolers and unschoolers since many schools have different rules for them. They may want to see your more unique, individualized education instead of a more traditional transcript.Admissions counselors are there to answer your questions about the application and admissions process for getting into their institution. They will be happy to meet with you in person or over the phone to discuss what you need to apply.

Set up a table with two columns and two rows.,
Write the unit rate in the first column.,
Fill in the number of seconds you are converting.,
Determine the factor of change.,
Multiply the number of minutes by the factor of change.,
Convert the number of minutes into hours.",How to Convert Seconds Into Hours2," Label the first row “seconds” and the second row “minutes.”
, A unit rate is a rate with a denominator of 1.In this instance, you are comparing 1 minute to a number of seconds. 1 minute = 60 seconds. So, your unit rate is 60seconds1minute{\displaystyle {\frac {60\;{\text{seconds}}}{1\;{\text{minute}}}}}. To show this in the chart, write ""60"" in the top row of the first column, and write ""1"" in the bottom row of the first column.
, This value should go in the first row of the second column.

For example, if you are converting 9,000 seconds to hours, write “9,000” in the first row, second column of your table.


, In this instance, you are trying to find out how much the number of seconds you are converting changed from the number of seconds in the unit rate. To find the factor of change, divide the number of seconds you are converting by 60, the number of seconds in the unit rate. Note this factor, but do not write it in your chart.

For example, if you are converting 9,000 seconds, you would calculate 9,00060=150{\displaystyle {\frac {9,000}{60}}=150}. So, the factor of change is 150.


, Since the number of minutes is only 1, you really only need to write down the result of the number of seconds divided by 60. This will show you the conversion of seconds to minutes.For example, 1×150=150{\displaystyle 1\times 150=150}. So, 9,000 seconds is equal to 150 minutes.


, To do this, set up another conversion table, using minutes and hours instead of hours and minutes. The unit rate is 60 minutes per 1 hour. Use the number of minutes you are converting, instead of the number of seconds, in this table.

For example, if you converted 9,000 seconds to 150 minutes, you are now converting 150 minutes to a number of hours. In your table, you need to find the factor of change from 60 minutes to 150 minutes. Since 15060=2.5{\displaystyle {\frac {150}{60}}=2.5}, your factor of change is 2.5. Multiply this by 1 hour. 1×2.5=2.5{\displaystyle 1\times 2.5=2.5}. So, 9,000seconds=150minutes=2.5hours{\displaystyle 9,000\;{\text{seconds}}=150\;{\text{minutes}}=2.5\;{\text{hours}}}.

Convert the decimal of an hour to minutes. To do this, multiply the decimal by 60: .4444×60=26.664{\displaystyle .4444\times 60=26.664}, or about 26 minutes. So, 12,400 seconds is equal to about 3 hours and 26 minutes.

You should also include the homeschool’s name, address, email address, and phone number.You may also want to include the name of your parents or guardians.

, Your transcript should include a list of courses or work that you have completed. List each course with a title that reflects the area of study, just like a traditional transcript. For each course, give the credits earned and the year the credits were earned. Most classes are one or half a credit.For example, you may have one credit courses called History: World War II, Business Math, Comparative American Literature, and Earth Science. Half credit courses may include Fine Arts: Acting, Technology: Website Building, and Personal Finance.

, You may want to include a short description of each course that you have listed on your transcript. This is not required, but some institutions will require more information from you about the courses, so this could provide that information. Limit the description to between 10 to 15 words.For example, the description for Early American literature may be ""an exploration of literature, film adaptations, and stage productions of American works from 1600-1850.""
You can ask the admissions counselors if they require any description or additional information about the courses. If they do not, you may not want to include this information.
Some people wait until they are asked to supply this information. You can draft the description while creating the transcript so you will have it in the future.

This may be from community activities, clubs or organizations, or other activities.For example, list if you had lead roles in a play, solos in a chorus concert, or played an instrument in a recital. Provide information about any awards you have received, like science fair awards or prizes for winning writing contests.

, At the very end of the transcript, provide a summary of your work. This summary should align with state credit requirements. List the number of credits in each subject area to demonstrate you have fulfilled everything needed to graduate. You should also include a date of graduation., The last thing you should add at the end of the transcript is a signature from the supervisor of your unschool program. Before the signature, there should be a statement that this is the correct official transcript for you. Then, the supervisor should sign and date it., If you have completed a lot of visual arts, media, or practical objects, you should put together a portfolio. This may include recordings of your playing or singing, art, photographs of your creations, or videos of your performances.This can be done if you did extensive work in drawing or painting, photography, music, drama, dance, word work, sewing, automobile maintenance, or construction.

, If you didn’t get grades for your classes, don’t invent them. Schools will not want fake grades if you did not earn them.

Use current events.,
Include practical arts.",How to Create an Unschooling High School Transcript3," Using some keywords can help you title your transcript courses correctly. A concepts course of a subject area can be a broad survey of a subject where you explore the basic principles of a topic. Appreciation courses cover exploring a topic and trying to understand and appreciate it. Introduction to courses are when you first start learning a subject, whereas advanced courses are your continued learning.This can be used for any subject, such as Concepts of Algebra where you learn problem solving skill through personal finance, grocery shopping, gas mileage in cars, and cost-per-use of household appliances. Art appreciation can be you looking at art pieces and learning more about them.

, You can develop your language arts classes based on what media you have consumed. Books you have read or listened to, movie adaptations you’ve watched, and plays you have gone to can all be used on your transcript.Make a list of everything you have read, watched, listened to, or gone to see. Try to develop themes based on what you’ve explored. For example, if you have read a lot of classical literature and watched movies adapted from classical texts, you can group that together as a classical literature course.

, Don’t neglect the math that you do on a regular basis. Many unschoolers talk about math related topics often with their families, which can be used for a math course. You should also consider how much math you do in your daily life and what type of math that is.For example, research and following the stock market each day is math-related economics. Learning how a mortgage works and the way credit scores are determined is also math.

, Field trips are a great way to get real life, hands on learning experience that you can use on your unschooling transcript. Science museums, zoos, and aquariums can all be included in courses to put on your transcript., Current events can open a door to add learning into just about every subject you need on a transcript. Social studies subjects like civics, government, and politics can be explored through current events. You can connect what’s happening today to historical events, or study important historical events connected to certain days or months.Keep up with scientific discoveries, medical cures or treatments, or space exploration.

, Your transcript doesn’t have to be connected to traditional academic subjects. Your unschooling experience may cover practical skills, like car repair, cooking, sewing, or construction.Make sure to include all skills you have been cultivating and practicing. Those are as important as if you took a high school drama or band class.

Contacting the health department helps them keep track of places where contamination or foodborne outbreaks occur so they can investigate further.In some states, doctors must report communicable diseases, such as foodborne disease outbreaks, to government agencies.;
, Most areas offer two ways to report a foodborne illness. You can call the health department, or you can go to the health department’s website.If you call the health department, you will probably have a 10 to 15 minute interview. They will ask you an array of questions. Before you call, make sure you have all of your information ready. Be as specific as possible.
If you prefer to fill out an online form, go to the community’s health department’s website. They may offer a printable form or a form you can submit online.

, When you report food poisoning, you often will have to state what your symptoms are. This helps public health officials in their investigations if they can find common symptoms or ailments. This also helps them be able to narrow down which foodborne disease may be afflicting people.Include how long the symptoms lasted and when they started.
Common symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms may also include abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, and fatigue. These symptoms may last one to seven days.

, When reporting food poisoning, you will have to give information about where you ate the food. This includes the name of the restaurant or grocery store and the address.You should also include the date and time you ate the food. This can help with the public health official’s investigation.

, One of the most important things you can do when you report food poisoning is to give the details about what you ate. Everything you ate is important, from appetizers, side dishes, main courses, and desserts. You should also include any dressings, condiments, or sauces you had. Include what you drank, too.For example, you might say that you had two pieces of baked chicken with a side of french fries and a side salad with ranch dressing at 7:30 p.m.

, If you ate at the restaurant with other people, you may be required to provide information about them. You may need to state how many people were in your party or how many other people got sick from the meal. You may also have to talk about how many of those people live in the same household., If you went to the doctor, the doctor may have taken stool samples or run tests to determine what disease you had. If you know which foodborne illness you contracted, you can provide this information.Include your doctor’s contact information in case the public health officer needs to contact the doctor.

, If you believe you have food poisoning due to a food that is regulated by the FDA that you purchased in a grocery store, you should contact the FDA. When you report a product to the FDA, you need to provide the names of the people affected and your details. If you were treated by a doctor, provide that information, too.Include a description of the product, including codes or identifying marks on the label or container. State the problem with the product in detail.
Provide the contact information for where the product was purchased, such as the store’s address and the date purchased.
You should also report the food poisoning to the manufacturer.
Don’t report restaurant food poisonings to the FDA.

, Some community health departments may wish to run tests on the suspect food. If you have any food left over, place it in a container, separate from the rest of your food. You don’t want anyone to eat it.Not all communities will want to examine the food, even if you have kept it.

Drive to the window.,
Pay for your order.,Grab your food, or drive forward and pick it up from the next window.",How to Order at a Restaurant Drive‐Through," Naturally, before you even start to order your food, you've got to know which restaurant to go to.
, If you've been at the restaurant before, you'll likely remember the food available there, and know beforehand what food you like and dislike.

If this is your first time going to the restaurant, go inside the restaurant and order there. While it's less convenient, it's a lot easier deciding what you'd like than if you went through the drive through.

, Simply tell the worker what you want and the quantities of each item. You'll be told how much you need to pay (at the window).

Speak clearly. Don't mumble, as they won't understand you. You want them to be sure you want the grilled chicken sandwich and not the buffalo chicken wings.
Don't be afraid to give specific directions on how to make the food, either. If you don't like onions in your burger, or you want an extra ketchup with your fries, say so. They can't magically predict that that's how you like it, so be sure to tell them your preferences.

, You will pay and receive your order there. At some restaurants, you pick up your food at a different window. Some restaurants might make you pay after getting your food., Either way, have some cash or a credit card on hand, so that when it's time to pay, all you have to do is hand it over and be done with it.,"

Purchase white corn for the process.,
Buy 5 to 20 pounds (2.3 to 9kg) of white corn.,
Buy one food-grade five gallon (19l) bucket for every five pounds (2.3kg) of corn you want to malt.

,
Pick up some sterilizing solution to clean your buckets adequately before beginning.

,
Fill your five-gallon buckets with water that is between 63 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (17 to 30 degrees Celsius).You can use hot tap water.,
Dump five pounds of white corn into each bucket.,
Drain the water off completely.,
Refill the buckets with hot tap water again.,
Drain the buckets.

,
Spread the corn out on large baking trays.,
Layer damp paper towels over the top of the baking trays filled with corn.

,
Spray the paper towels with hot tap water to keep them moist, so the corn will sprout.

,
Peel the paper towels back and stir the corn every eight hours.

,
Continue for 5 to 10 days, or until most of the corn has sprouts that are 0.2 inches (five mm) long.

Remove the paper towels.,
Set fans to dry the grain.,
Raise the room or oven temperature to 130 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) the following hour.,
Raise the room temperature to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 Celsius) the following hour.

Place the corn in sacks once it is dry.,
Shake it and sieve it to remove the sprouts completely.",How to Malt Corn," Yellow corn has too much oil content., Most distillers suggest doing 20 pounds at once so that you will have enough for a full batch of corn mash. However, the amount you choose to malt should depending upon your facilities and how much drying space you can find.

,,, Use a thermometer to measure the temperature.

, Submerge it completely. Let it soak for 24 hours.

, Discard any corn that floats to the top when it soaks.

,, Keep it in a thin layer, between 0.8 and 2 inches (two to five cm) deep. Keep the room temperature between 63 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (17 to 30 degrees Celsius)

,,,,, Spread the corn out as thin as you can.

, For the first two to three hours you should not let the temperature exceed 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius). You don’t want to heat the corn too quickly, or you will destroy the enzymes you created during the malting process.

, Continue moving air across the corn with a fan.

,, Bang it against a hard surface to knock off the sprouts.

, Store it in a cool and dry place for up to two months before using."

Set uniform margins on the left and right sides of the document.,
Keep all your paragraphs lined up on the left side throughout your letter.,
Start the body of your letter no lower than midway down your page.,
Leave 2 lines of space between paragraphs.,
Organize your letter so it does not appear repetitive by mixing up your use of paragraph lengths.",How to Create Business Letter White Space," It is suggested that margin sizes be 1-1.5 inches (3-3.5 cm).;
, Do not make indentations unless you are using bullets to clarify a point.


Avoid ""justifying"" or ""align righting"" your letter. These alignments make letters difficult to read. Your right margins should be ragged, not uniform.

, This allows for the correct amount of white space and ease of reading.


Most readers find starting letters or paragraphs near the end of a page challenging. It tends to interrupt a reader's concentration.

, Having these gaps tell the reader you are moving on to the next point or topic of the letter.


This break between blocks of text is also a way to give the person's eyes a break while he or she is reading.

Sample a sour beer.",How to Pair Food and Beer1," These light, clean, and refreshing beers are light to medium in body. Delicate fruit styles, like wheat or cream ales, aren’t especially hoppy or malty and often have a hint of fruit flavor. Malt-accented styles like amber lager or Oktoberfest have a bready or biscuit flavor. Styles that exude a brisk hoppiness like pilsners, have a drier finish with floral or spicy aromas., With aromas and bitterness derived from hops, these beers are intense in flavor and are medium to full in body.

Do not substitute different types of glue.,
Store the whipple cream carefully.,
Make sure children know not to eat the cream.",How to Make Whipple Cream," In order to get your clay to a mixable consistency, you should break it into small pieces. Take out a large chunk of art clay and break it apart. Place the pieces in your plastic bag.There is no set amount of art clay to use. Take out as much as you need for your whipple cream. More art clay will make more cream.
If your clay is very thick or dry, it can help to work your clay with your fingers to soften it before breaking it into pieces.;
, Put some tap water in your spritzer bottle. Spray in a small amount to start. For example, spritz the water 10 times. Then, seal your bag, leaving a small amount of air in the bag, and work the clay with your fingers through the bag. Keep adding small amounts of water at a time until you reach the right consistency.The consistency should be similar to marshmallow fluff. If you've never had marshmallow fluff, this feels like slightly hardened whipped cream.

, Seal the bag and use your fingers to push the clay through the bag. You want all your clay concentrated in one side of the bag. Once the clay is in one side of the bag, cut a hole in the corner where the clay sits., Open the bag again and pour in some school glue. As with the water, add a small amount at first and then more as necessary. You do not want the whipple cream to be too runny, but the glue should loosen it slightly. Add enough glue that the whipple cream is easily squeezed out of the bag.Pinch the open side of the bag closed while you do this to keep glue from running out of the bag.

, You can add a small bit of food coloring the the whipple cream. Then, work the cream together using your fingers until the color is dispersed throughout. If you want a darker color after adding your initial coloring, add a bit more food coloring.Like the other ingredients, there is no set amount to add. You can add a small amount at first and add more if the color is too light.

, Insert the nozzle into the pastry bag by putting it in the bag and pushing it through the opening in the corner. Then, put your plastic bag with the whipple cream in the pastry bag. Push the corner of the plastic bag with the opening into the nozzle in the pastry bag., Things like superglue, industrial glue, or rubber cement should not be used to make whipple cream. You should only use school glue, such as Elmer's glue, as this has the right consistency for whipple cream., Remove the whipple cream from the pastry bag when you're done using it. Twist the end of the plastic bag, removing most of the air, and use a rubber band to secure it in place. You can store your whipple cream in a cabinet until you want to use it again.If your whipple cream dries out between uses, add more water. It should last awhile as long as you keep adding water, but will dry out in a few months. How long whipple cream lasts depends on how often you use it and the temperature of your home.

, If you're using whipple cream for crafts with young children, make sure to make it clear the cream is not to be eaten. Children may mistake whipple cream for food, but it does not contain edible ingredients. Tell children something like, ""I know the whipple cream looks like food, but it's bad for you to eat. Just use it for decoration."""

Visit your doctor.,
Understand that food poisoning may not show for a few days.,
Be aware food poisoning is hard to locate.,
Prepare to lodge your complaint.",How to Report Restaurant Food Poisoning2," If you get food poisoning, it’s important for you to go see your doctor as soon as you can. Your doctor can determine if you do have food poisoning or another illness, if the food poisoning is mild or serious, and advise you on treatment.If you have an emergency, call 911 or visit the emergency room.

, Sometimes, food poisoning can take a few days to surface. Many people believe that food poisoning is due to the last meal they ate, but it may be from a meal eaten a day or two before. When reporting food poisoning, make sure to take into consideration everything you have eaten over the last couple of days.Think about the other people in your home, or other people who ate meals with you. See if they got sick too and if they have similar symptoms.

, Though you should definitely report anything suspicious, it is very difficult for food poison to be pinned on a specific restaurant. Mainly, this is because the contaminated food has more than likely been thrown away and there may not be a way to medically confirm food poisoning., Before you report food poisoning, you must be prepared to answer any questions the health department or agency will ask you. Gather the following information:Type of establishment where the food poison occurred, such as fast food restaurant, chain, bar, or bakery
Name of the establishment, along with the address and phone number.
Date of exposure
Time of exposure, as specific as possible, a.m. or p.m. at the least
Symptoms, including details, dates, times, and duration
Number of people in the party affected and not affected
Detailed list of foods consumed at the restaurant
Any medical treatment or tests your received
Foods you consumed for 72 hours prior to getting sick

Find harmonies between beer and food.,
Pair brown ale with foods that have nutty, toasted flavor profiles.,
Try pairing a stout with oysters.,
Pair an India Pale Ale (IPA) with foods featuring coriander or mango.",How to Pair Food and Beer2," Pairing food with a beer that shares some of its flavor or aroma is a great place to start. Seek out beers and foods with similar elements of aroma and flavor profiles., Foods such as aged Gouda, walnut cake, roasted pork, smoked sausage and cashew chicken will complement the malty flavor of a brown ale., The coffee and chocolate flavors of a stout highlight silky, salty foods such as oysters on the half shell. A stout also pairs well with braised or caramelized meats and sauces., Coriander found in dishes like fajitas or tacos complements the herbaceous flavor of hops in an IPA. Likewise, many IPAs have tropical notes that can be accentuated with fruits like mangos."
"
Contrast beer flavor and aroma profiles with those of food.,
Pair a bock with spicy foods.,
Pair an amber ale with smoked foods.",How to Pair Food and Beer3," Sometimes opposites attract, and this can definitely be the case when pairing beer and food. Consider the richness, spiciness, bitterness, and sweetness of a beer and pair it with foods in a yin-yang sort of way to balance the two.Intensity of flavor in beer can involve malt character, hop bitterness, richness, and the alcoholic strength.
Intensity of food flavors is all about richness, spicing, sweetness, texture, and complexity.
Try matching foods heavy on sweetness or fattiness with contrasting flavors in beers like hop bitterness or roasted malt.

, The flavor profile of a bock is rich and warm with caramel and toasty aromas. Balance this sweetness by pairing a bock with intensely flavored or spicy foods such as slow roasted meats, Cajun food, or jerk chicken., Amber ales are known for their sweet caramel notes and citrusy aroma profiles. This is best contrasted by foods with a smoky flavor profile such as chili.

Cut the heat of a spicy dish with an IPA.,
Calm the heat of spicy food by cutting it with a German Doppelbock.,
Cut the richness of fatty foods with a gueuze or lambic.,
Cut the sweetness of shellfish with a stout.",How to Pair Food and Beer4," Cutting intense heat, flavor, or richness of foods with an equally intense beer can allow strong flavors to mingle and even compete. If you’re not a fan of intense beer flavors and aromas, you can cut the flavor of food with a beer whose flavor profile is on the opposite end of the intensity spectrum., Try cutting the heat and flavors of a spicy dish like Thai green curry with the hoppy bitterness of an IPA. An IPA, with its notes of citrus and pine and rich malt, will cut through the heat of spicy foods, creating an unexpected match made in heaven., The malt sweetness of the beer will calm the burn, cutting through the food’s intensity. Try pairing Cajun foods like gumbo with German Doppelbock, a beer known for its malt sweetness., When the bold flavors of rich, fatty meats or cheeses are creatively cut with the bright sourness of a fruited lambic or beer, the results are surprising. Try pairing Lambic with duck or pork. A gueze will cut the oiliness of fish like salmon or mackerel., A bitter, dry stout will cut through the tender sweetness of shellfish like oysters. This classic pairing is quite pleasing to the palate."

Contemplate pairing food and beer from the same region.,
Pair beer and food seasonally.,
Check craft beer labels for pairing suggestions.,
Get creative.",How to Pair Food and Beer5," While some caution against pairing food and beer that originate from the same region, others recommend it. It may be a personal choice, but in some cases is worth the experiment. Try a Belgian Saison with farmhouse goat cheese or an Oktoberfest with bratwurst and sauerkraut., Food and craft beer are seasonal in nature, so make the most of what’s available to you in any given season. This fall, try your hand at Oktoberfest combinations. In the summer, experiment with pairing a pilsner with summer fare., Many craft beer labels will have suggestions for pairing a particular beer with specific food suggestions. Give these a try. You may be pleasantly surprised by the results.

, Pairing food and beer is a creative endeavor and you don’t always have to follow the rules. Flex your creative muscles and try some pairings that sound like they might have potential. You may win or you may lose, but it’s definitely worth taking the risk. Have fun!

, If your event already has a colour scheme, you can skip this step! If you don't have a colour scheme, black and red are obvious choices being the colours on a roulette wheel and the two colours of playing cards. Add silver and gold and white if you like. Again, ensure everyone is agree on the scheme if applicable so you don't end up with a colour clash., A Traditional favour is a net bundle tied with ribbon containing sweets, nuts etc. To make these casino themed, use chip shaped foil wrapped after dinner mints. Chip as in gambling chip of course, not the potato type! Net could be pricey so consider tissue paper or crepe paper and gift wrap ribbon instead of actual ribbon. A large plain glass vase filled with these bundles in black and red with contrasting ties would make a feature decoration. Guests could then take one as they leave. Or, scatter them on the table.
, Fill these with candy / sweets in your chosen colour scheme and cover with cling film / glad wrap. You could arrange these in a pyramid in the style used for serving real champagne at lavish events., Write, (however you like, by hand, on a PC, printing blocks if you like!) a list of what your guests enjoyed at the event, the music that was played, the food that was served, who came, any social media sites where photos will be available, whatever they will want to recall about the ""do"". Loosely roll the list and tie with ribbon or gift ribbon ready for handing out., For example, miniature or full sized packs of playing cards, miniature bottles of alcohol (spirits or liqueurs), and small boxes of classy chocolates could be placed in gift bags in your colour scheme. Then, instead of packing the top of the bag with tissue paper, use cut out photo copied ""money"", by the hand full, screwed up a little as if everyone has won so much money at your casino event they have to carry it home in bags. Only photocopy Monopoly Game money or other toy money; copying legal tender could get you into trouble., Chocolate coins, since your theme is Casino and gambling is all about money!

Using small shapes and small portions.
Using cute colors. Pastels or very bright colors can be cute when properly matched.
Using faces and happy expressions.
Keeping the designs ""fun"". Fun motifs help to make the food ""cute""; think such fun things as monsters with smiles, winking hearts, baby creatures with huge eyes, grinning hamsters, etc., as designs.
Match the designs for size. While keeping everything small, evenly matched sizing can help create an overall cuteness.;
, Animal shapes are ideal kawaii food candidates as they're easy to replicate using food pieces, with many different forms.


Make food appear like an animal. Many Japanese kawaii food designs turn the food into animals such as pigs, bears, sheep, cats, etc. The chefs tend to use seaweed, tofu, olives, egg, etc. to create face shapes, ears, whiskers, tails, snouts, fur, etc.
Use existing animal shaped items such as chocolate, biscuits, etc., and add these onto food shapes.

, A bento box is a common target for kawaii in Japan. There are so many possibilities for making the entire lunch box look cute, to make it irresistible. As well as the animal shapes described above, some other ideas include:


Adding animal shapes to food pieces, or decorating food with animal designs, such as using frosting.
Cutting or molding food into stars, circles, hearts, flowers, and other cute shapes. You can use biscuit (cookie) cutters or chocolate moulds to make shapes.
Making food appear as if it is a small landscape, such as mini trees, bushes, lakes, etc.
Making tech designs, such as robots, computers, smartphones, mice, etc.

, Find cups, plates, cutlery, etc., with cute designs, such as faces, patterns, animals, etc. for serving the food and dividing into distinct portions.

, There are many possibilities with sweets, candies, cakes, and pastries to make them kawaii! Remember that it is about small size, cute shape, and even cuter decorative designs and faces. Here are some examples:


Candies
Chocolates
Baked goodies

Biscuits (cookies)

You can also use a candy thermometer to monitor the oil’s temperature.;
, For the fries, you’ll need 2 firm apples. Wash and core the apples to remove the seeds. Next, use a sharp knife to cut the apples into ¼-inch (6-mm) thick slices.You can peel the apples to remove the skin if you like, but it isn’t necessary.

, Add 1 cup (128 g) of all-purpose flour to a small shallow dish. Place the apples slices in the flour and toss to coat both sides.If you prefer, you can substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour.

, Once the oil has reached the proper temperature, carefully drop the apples into the pan in batches. Allow the apples to cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side before flipping the fries and allowing them to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes on the other side, or until they are completely golden brown.Be careful when adding and flipping the apple fries.

Get them cooking.,
Bite your tongue.",How to Make a Meal Your Kids Will Like," If 'Tommy' eats all of his chicken, but none of the peas and Sarah is the exact opposite, then maybe that isn't the best choice.;
, If you have lots of options for your child(ren) they will eat more of it! Try making chicken with a choice of peas or rice, don't just say ""we are eating chicken for dinner"" when you could have so much more to 'spice' it up a little.

, Ask them what kind of food they have (had) at school, and whether they liked it or not. Ask them what their favorite food is, or maybe even what they want for dinner. (Make sure to ask them early, so you have plenty of time to prepare/make it!)

, Everyone loves a good change (most of the time)!. Even if you're eating the same foods, try cooking it differently with new recipes. If you had rice and beef yesterday, have beef and broccoli today, or make the beef in a new type of sauce. The possibilities are endless, but try to stay away from the same thing over and over again.

, You don't have to go overboard with this, but finding something the kid(s) like that is healthy is always ideal! Find out what vegetables, fruits, grains, meats, etc they like, and try to mix in one of everything each meal, or every other meal. Say have their favorite fruit one day, and then vegetables the next.

, When you make the food just for you child(ren) and you don't like it that's probably not the right choice and might make a bad example for your child(ren). Make someone the whole family will love! (Like)

, Try offering them something in exchange for trying a new food. Say, ""You can have your (favorite snack) if you try this new food I made. You don't have to eat all of it, but just try.""

, If you can get one child or someone older to try the food, tell your child(ren) ""(Name) is doing it!"" Or, use a little bit of hero worship. ""(their favorite actor/actress/celebrity) eats his/her food!""

, If they don't like a food, try mixing it up and finding what they don't like about it so you can make it differently, or just abandoning it entirely.

, A lot of times, the difference between whether a child(ren) will try/like a certain food is how it looks. If it's grey, black, gooey looking, or has eyes/scales chances are they won't go near it. Try adding some color and hiding the worst features about it by mixing it with other things!


Have fun with the food. As said above, often the deciding factor in getting your child to eat, is how the food looks. Arrange it on the plate in a fun way, make shapes/animals in the food if you can. Anything simple really might get them to try it.

, If your kid(s) are older (or even younger) let them help you out with cooking! If they had a hand in making it, they might be more interested in trying it.

, It can be rather frustrating, you slaved over a hot stove, and your child won't touch the food, but if you try to play the law by saying ""Eat it now!"" chances are they'll only resist more.

Whisk the ingredients together until there are no clumps, and set the bowl aside.For the best batter, use whole or 2% milk.
You can substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose if you prefer.

, Add ⅓ cup (67 g) of sugar and 3 teaspoons (8 g) of ground cinnamon to a separate small bowl. Mix the two ingredients together well to create a topping for the finished fries. Set aside for the moment.If you prefer, you can use approximately ⅓ of cup (70 g) of store-bought cinnamon sugar to dust over the finished apple fries.

, Add vegetable oil to a large skillet until it reaches a depth of 1-inch (2.5-cm). Heat the oil over medium-high heat for 5 to 7 minutes.You can substitute peanut oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer.

, For the fries, you’ll need 3 large Granny Smith apples that have been cored and peeled. Use a sharp knife to cut the apples into ½-inch (13-mm) thick wedges to form the fries.Fuji and Pink Lady apples also work well for the fries.

, After you’ve cut the apples into wedges, use a pair of tongs to carefully dip them into the batter. Allow the excess to drip back into the bowl, but make sure that the apples are completely coated.For the best results, dip the apple fries in the batter right before you add them to the oil.

, Once the apple wedges are coated with the batter, use the tongs to drop them into the heated oil. Fry the apple fries in batches until the edges are lightly golden. Flip them over with the tongs, and cook them for another minute on the other side until the fries are golden brown.Be careful when frying the apple wedges because the oil will be extremely hot. If it starts to splatter, turn down the heat on the stove.

, When the apple fries are finished cooking, lift them out of the oil with the tongs. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate, and allow them to drain for a minute or two., Once the apple fries are finished draining, place them on a platter. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture you made earlier over the fries and toss lightly so they’re coated on both sides before serving.The apple fries pair well with caramel sauce.

Serve the apple fries warm.",How to Make Apple Fries3," To ensure that the oven is warm enough to bake the apple fries, set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) and allow the oven to fully preheat. Next, use a nonstick cooking spray to lightly grease a baking sheet.If you prefer, you can line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat instead of greasing it.

, For the fries, you’ll need 1 medium Fuji apple. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin and then core it by using a sharp knife to cut the apple into quarters around the center stem. Next, use the knife to slice the apple into half moon slices that are approximately ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.You can also use a Gala apple for the fries.
An apple corer makes it very easy to core an apple, so if you have one, you may want to use it instead of the knife.

, Add ¼ cup (25 g) of whole-wheat panko breadcrumbs, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of low-calorie sweetener, ⅛ teaspoon (⅓ g) of cinnamon, and a dash of salt to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are well blended.No-calorie sweeteners that work well for the fries include stevia, erythritol, and xylitol.

, Add 2 large egg whites and ⅛ teaspoon (1 ml) of maple extract to a separate medium bowl. Blend the two ingredients together until they are well mixed., After you’ve mixed the egg whites with the maple extract, add the apple slices to the bowl. Mix the slices in the egg whites to ensure that they’re well coated.Allow the excess egg white mixture to drip back into the bowl so clumps don’t form when you roll the apple fries in the breadcrumbs.

, Once the apple fries are coated with the egg whites, add them to the bowl with the breadcrumb mixture. Toss the apples with the breadcrumbs until they are completely covered on both sides.It may help to pat the breadcrumb coating onto the apple fries to ensure that it adheres properly.

, When the fries are coated with the breadcrumbs, set them out on the greased baking sheeting. Place the fries in the oven and allow them to bake for 10 minutes.Make sure that the fries are in a single layer on the baking sheet so they cook evenly.

, When the fries have baked for 10 minutes, use a spatula to flip them over. Place them back in the oven, and let them cook until they are browned and crispy on the outside, which should take about 10 minutes.While the apple fries should be brown and crispy on the outside, they should be tender on the inside.

, When the apple fries are finished cooking, remove them from the oven. Transfer them to a plate and serve while they are still warm.Your favorite yogurt can make a healthy dipping sauce for these apple fries.

Drink ginger tea.,
Season your food with ginger.,
Make some candied ginger.,
Take ginger supplements.",How to Improve Your Health with Ginger1," One of the easiest ways to include more ginger in your diet is to start drinking ginger tea. You can make ginger tea using a commercial brand of ginger tea or by steeping fresh ginger root in hot water.To make ginger tea, place about one teaspoon of minced ginger into a mug. Then, pour boiling water over the ginger. Let the tea steep for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then strain the tea through a sieve.
You can drink up to three to four cups of ginger tea per day.;
, Adding ginger to food can give you some of the potential benefits of the herb without the risks of taking a concentrated supplement. Some easy ways to add ginger to your meals include:


In dinner recipes. Try adding 1 to 2 teaspoons of minced ginger to a stir fry, soup, or curry recipe.
In baked goods. Include about ½ teaspoon of dried ginger in your next batch of muffins or cookies.
As a garnish. If you like the taste of raw ginger, then you can try adding about ½ teaspoon of minced fresh ginger to a salad or a bowl of soup.

, If you really like the taste of ginger, but prefer it on the sweet side, then making your own candied ginger is a great option. The process is not difficult, but it is a bit time consuming.


Peel and slice 1 cup of fresh ginger root. You can slice the ginger however you want. Just keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to dry.
Combine 1 ½ cups of water and 1 ½ cups of sugar in a small saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.
Then, add the ginger to the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, use a slotted spoon to place the ginger on a wire rack. You will need to let the ginger dry on the rack overnight.
Store the ginger in an airtight container in your pantry for up to three months.

Talk to your doctor first.,
Limit your total intake of ginger.,
Avoid ginger if it interacts with your medications.,
Stop taking ginger if you notice any side effects.",How to Improve Your Health with Ginger2," As with any herbal supplement, it is a good idea to talk to your doctor before you decide to include it. Tell your doctor about the benefits that you hope to gain by using ginger and what (if any) conditions you hope to treat.

have gallstones
have a bleeding disorder
have a heart condition
have diabetes

, Your total daily intake of ginger should not exceed 4 grams per day. This limit includes the amount of ginger that you consume in teas, foods, and supplements combined.Keep track of how much ginger you consume each day to make sure that you do not exceed the 4 grams per day limit.

Buy fresh ginger for teas and food.,
Keep some dried ginger on hand.,
Purchase ginger supplements.",How to Improve Your Health with Ginger3," Fresh ginger is the most potent form and it is easy to find in grocery stores. Look for a piece of ginger root that has smooth skin and a gingery odor. The root should feel firm, not mushy or floppy.


You can store an unpeeled piece of ginger in your refrigerator for up to four weeks. Just keep it wrapped in paper towels or place it in a brown paper bag.

Store peeled pieces of ginger in a plastic bag or container in your refrigerator. Peeled ginger will keep for a few days in the refrigerator.

, Dried ginger powder is also a good way to include more ginger in your diet. You can add the powder to muffins, cookies, cakes and other dishes. If possible, choose a powdered ginger that is organic.


Powdered ginger will keep in your pantry or spice rack until it reaches its expiration date. Check the package to determine when you need to replace your powdered ginger.

, When choosing an herbal supplement, it is important to be cautious. Supplements are not regulated by the FDA, so manufacturers may include misleading claims on their products or even misrepresent the contents of the bottle. One good way to increase the chances that you are getting a quality product is to call the manufacturer and ask some questions, such as:How do I know that this product is safe? What is your quality control system?
What research have you done to determine if the product is effective?
Have any of your consumers experienced adverse effects after using this product? If so, what were they?

Some families will want the house cleaned from top to bottom. You’ll also need to decide whether you expect services that may go beyond standard cleanings, such as wiping down the baseboards or washing the windows.Many services will not clean windows, as they don’t want to create streaks or damage. You may need to turn to a professional for this.;
, Most cleaning services will ask you how big your house is, how many bedrooms and bathrooms it contains, and what kind of routine cleaning you usually do. One bedroom and one bathroom usually takes about two and a half hours to clean, and kitchens take another 1-2 hours. If you haven’t cleaned in a while, these numbers may go up. Preparing this information for the service will help you both decide what you can afford., Depending on your family’s needs, you may only need the service to come once or twice a month. If you have a bigger budget and a busier schedule, you might opt for more frequent visits. You can also create an alternating weekly schedule that directs the cleaners to clean different rooms every other time they visit., Because they’re more expensive, most cleaners will not clean with natural cleaning solutions. If you don’t want chemical cleaners used in your home, or if you have special cleaners you prefer, you’ll likely need to provide these to the service.You may be able to negotiate a lower fee with the service if you provide your own cleaners. Ask potential services if they’d be willing to have this conversation with you.

, Before you start calling potential cleaning services, examine your finances. Make sure you know exactly how much you’re able and willing to pay companies. This will help you say no to companies that are out of your price range while also allowing you to make informed decisions about which services you can afford.

, When you hire a cleaning company rather than an individual, the company takes responsibility for running background checks on its employees, providing worker’s compensation, and dealing with insurance issues. This option is generally better for families who may not have the time and legal knowledge to protect themselves from conflicts with individual employees.It’s a good idea to ask potential cleaning services whether they’ve performed background checks on their employees. Reputable companies will certainly have performed these checks on any new hires.
Cleaning companies may charge more than individuals, but the legal peace of mind they provide will likely be worth the extra cost.

, Reputable services will have a policy that covers damage to your home incurred during the cleaning process, as well as missing or broken items. This can allow both you and the company to feel protected while cleaners are in your home. It is, however, a good idea to inform cleaners of items that may be more delicate or need special care., People who are close to you will know what you need, and they’ll be ready to provide you with honest advice about their past experience with various cleaners. Be sure to tell those who you ask for advice that you plan to hire a reputable service with an insurance policy, as this may affect the options they give you., Most cleaning services will have many reviews online for you to view, particularly if the company is large and has been in business for several years. Read a wide range of reviews. Some companies may receive just a few scathing reports from one disgruntled customer, but will otherwise have a series of five-star ratings., If a company is new to your area or smaller in scale, they may not yet have an online presence. You can ask these companies for a list of referrals from their previous clients. When you call these clients, be sure to ask what kind of cleaning the company performs for them, and whether the client still employs the service., Most companies will have a list of the typical types of cleaning they perform. They’ll also inform you whether they charge a flat rate for each cleaning, an hourly fee, or a room-by-room charge. Be sure you understand what’s included in the company’s base cleaning rate, and what’s not. Ask questions about any cleaning activities the company doesn’t explicitly mention.If your company charges an hourly fee, you can put a cap on the amount of hours the service is allowed to clean to ensure that your cost doesn’t get out of control. Note that this may prevent your house from receiving a complete cleaning, especially on the first visit.

, Once you understand the company’s list of what it typically cleans, ask if they ever perform cleaning services not on that list. Be sure to then ask how much these extra services cost. If there’s something you want cleaned in your home that the service hasn’t mentioned, ask how much it would add to their overall fee., You’ll want to be aware of which cleaning solutions the service is using in your home. This is especially important if you have pets or children, and you’re concerned about minimizing their exposure to certain chemicals. If you have a special countertop or sensitive surface in your home, you should also ask the company if they have the appropriate solutions for those materials., See if the company would be willing to see if the relationship works by having a trial session. They may be willing to provide a satisfaction guarantee that waives the fee if you don’t approve of the cleaning your home receives. Once you’ve completed this trial, you’ll likely be able to feel more confident about spending your money on the cleaning service.

, It’s a good idea to sign a document stating the company’s fees, both of your expectations for what will be cleaned along with any added services, and what’s defined as damage caused by the cleaners. Having a record of this agreement should help avoid future confusion or disagreement over how much the company is owed., Some companies may ask you to remain in the house while your cleaners are present. This policy may be used as a method of protecting the company if something goes missing from your home. Other companies may not have a preference, and you may want to use the time to do something outside the house., Some companies may ask that you either take your pet out of the house or confine them to a specific area. Others may ask that you introduce the cleaners to the pet to ensure that they’re familiar with each other before you leave them alone with the animals. If your pet doesn’t generally like strangers, you may want to stay in the house with them the first few times the cleaner visits., If you aren’t going to be at home when the cleaner visits, you may need to provide them with a key, code, or garage door opener to let them into the home. You can include a clause in your written agreement with the company about safely providing these items to your cleaners without worrying that they’ll be copied or shared., This meeting will let you familiarize the cleaner with the space. You should point out broken appliances or damage in your home that they might need to avoid. This is also a good time to show them any areas that will need special attention or extra cleaning.You can show them children’s rooms that get especially untidy. Or if, for example, you have a china cabinet filled with breakable items that you’d like to dust on your own, be sure the cleaner is aware of this.

, Be sure that the cleaner the service sends is aware of your expectations. This will ensure that you, the company, and the employee are all on the same page. Especially if you have a specialized agreement with the company, this will avoid any frustration over areas that go uncleaned or unexplained charges for areas that you planned to clean yourself., It’s a good idea to deal with general clutter on your own before the cleaners arrive. While cleaners will pick up and fold clothes left on the floor or put toys back in their designated area, this will take up their time and energy. This could mean that your house won’t receive the deep clean it needs.If you’re paying an hourly fee, it’s especially important that you pick up your own clutter.

, You may have questions or suggestions after the first few times your cleaner comes. Discuss any areas of the home you’d like cleaned slightly differently. Be sure to treat your cleaner as a professional who deserves both kindness and respect from you.If you’re unsatisfied with the service, call the company directly. You can explain in detail exactly why you feel something isn’t meeting your expectations. You’ll likely be able to work out a more clear agreement with the company, which will be easier than starting over the process of finding a new service.

, As with most service-based industries, cleaners depend on tips. Check on your company’s policy, as they may roll tips into their overall fee and disperse them individually in paychecks. If not, it’s expected that you’ll show your appreciation of the service by tipping the cleaner directly."

Set out a sheet or newspaper.,
Open the vacuum chamber.,
Check the bag for bulging.,
Remove the bag from its case gently.,
Place the old bag in the garbage.,
Place a new bag in the proper slot.,
Rezip the vacuum body or replace the vacuum lid.",How to Change a Bag on a Vacuum Cleaner1," Laying out some newspaper or an old sheet will help trap any dirt that might burst from the bag during the removal process. This is a useful step for older vacuums, and vacuums whose bags are extremely full.

You may also want to keep your trash can close by to avoid dragging dirt or other debris through the house.;
, Either zip your vacuum’s bag chamber open, or remove the plastic top to access the bag. Most upright vacuums have a zip closure, while most hose-attachment vacuums use a plastic receptacle to house the vacuum bag., To determine how full (and messy) your job will be, check your bag for bulging. If there is no bulge at all to your bag, a full vacuum may not be the cause of your vacuum’s troubles. If there is a slight bulge at the bottom of the bag, or the bag is bulging almost to full capacity, it is time to replace the bag.


If your bag is extremely full, you may need to manually remove dirt and debris from the chamber connecting to your bag.

, The manner in which you do this will depend on your vacuum’s make and model. Most have a cardboard covering that attaches to a small, circular opening. You may need to remove a clip to remove the bag, or you may be able to simply twist the bag free. Check your specific brand’s instruction manual for further instruction.Although newer models usually have a seal that clicks into place once a vacuum bag is removed, old vacuums typically do not. To minimize dirt escaping, you can place duct tape or another adhesive over the bag’s opening.

, Disposable bags should not be emptied and reused, as they are intended for single use and may not hold up under multiple uses. Once you have removed the old bag, place it into the garbage.While it may be tempting to make each bag stretch further, emptying and reusing disposable bags has been linked to a decrease in performance.

, Place a new bag in the exact same place, repinning any clips or switches that were in place when you removed the bag. Some vacuums have a mechanism to keep the bag firmly in place, while others rely upon gravity to keep the bag from moving around., Close up the body of your vacuum, and you are ready to once again get cleaning. If, after replacing the bag, the vacuum makes an odd noise or does not suck as it should, reopen the chamber and make sure you have replaced the bag properly."

Clean up spills from wood floors.,
Keep sink drains smelling sweet.,
Clean hard water stains in toilets.,
Add to laundry loads.",How to Use Baking Soda1," Powdered baking soda can clean sinks, bathtubs, shower tiles, kitchen counters, metal surfaces, or even car headlights. Just sprinkle 2 teaspoons (10mL) onto a damp, clean sponge or rag, and scrub away. Rinse the area well once clean, to avoid a white residue. Because baking soda is non-toxic, this makes an excellent replacement for harsh chemicals in houses with young children.









Never use baking soda on aluminum surfaces. This causes a chemical reaction that weakens the metal.
For stubborn stains, make a paste with water and baking soda. Apply to the stain, leave on for thirty minutes, and wipe away with a damp sponge. Rinse well.;
, Do you have a casserole dish or pot covered in black, baked-on food? Scrape it clean again by scrubbing with baking soda, a mild abrasive.


For seriously burned surfaces, replace the sponge with a square of sandpaper. This will scratch the base of the dish as well, but sometimes you've got to do what you've got to do.

, Leave baking soda in an open container inside the fridge to absorb smells. Replace the baking soda every month or so to maintain the deodorizing effect.

, Baking soda will remove funky odors from your house as well. Try keeping ashtrays full of baking soda, plus essential oils to add a sweeter smell as well.








, Sprinkle baking soda on carpets and let set for about 15 minutes. Vacuum up as usual. The baking soda should absorb unpleasant odors.









Before trying this on an expensive or colorful rug, test this on a hidden location. If there are signs of color change or fiber damage after vacuuming, do not use the baking soda on the rest of the carpet.

, Baking soda can absorb liquids that have soaked into the cracks of hardwood floors. Vacuum and sweep as usual after leaving it there for a few minutes.


Test for damage by applying baking soda and water to a hidden location first . Do this in advance, so you know whether you can use baking soda to clean up a spill when it happens.
This is particularly useful for animal urine and other smelly liquids.

, Add 2 tablespoons (30mL) of baking soda to the drain, then white distilled vinegar. Wait for 30 minutes, then run warm water for a couple minutes.









Baking soda can also clear up a slow sink. Pour 1 cup (240mL) baking soda down the drain, then pour down boiling water. If you have plastic ABS waste pipes under your sink (black plastic pipes found in most modern houses), let the water sit for 5–10 minutes after boiling to cool it to safe temperatures (below 180ºF/82ºC).

, If you live in a hard water area and are tired of the mineral buildup, pour 1–2 cups (240–480mL) baking soda directly into the toilet bowl. Pour 1 cup (240mL) vinegar down fill tube in the toilet tank. Once the bowl stops foaming, scrub the bowl well with a brush.

, Add ½ to 1 cup (120–240mL) baking soda to any load of laundry as a detergent brightener. To remove stains from white laundry loads, submerge the clothes in cold water with 1–2 cups (240–480mL) baking soda and 2–8 cups (480mL–1.9L) white distilled vinegar.

Close the vacuum body.",How to Change a Bag on a Vacuum Cleaner2," Reusable bags are usually stored in the same manner and place as disposable bags. Open the body of your vacuum, whether it is a zip closure or plastic lid to find your reusable bag., Remove the bag from the vacuum chamber, keeping your hand over the hole that attaches to the vacuum itself. This will keep any stray dust from wandering out of the vacuum bag and spreading over the room.

Some companies recommend completing this exercise outdoors to minimize the amount of trapped dust and debris that is released upon opening the chamber.

, Using a kneading motion starting from the bottom of the bag, dump out the bag’s contents, keeping the vacuum bag close to the trash receptacle. Keeping it close will limit the amount of dust that is released into the air, and will direct most of the waste into the trash., If your vacuum uses a plastic chamber to hold its contents, you can wipe it out with a dry or damp rag to remove any lingering dirt or debris. If your vacuum uses a reusable bag, you may be able to wipe down the exterior of the bag with a damp rag, or you may run it through a wash cycle. Refer to your owner’s manual for definitive cleaning instructions.You may also run a plastic canister under hot water to remove stubborn residue.

, Once your bag has dried, replace it in the body of the vacuum, once again placing it into the vacuum the same way it was removed. If there were any parts that needed to be lifted, pressed, or removed, lift, press, and replace them as you install the freshly-emptied vacuum receptacle., Once you’ve finished replacing the bag or plastic bin, close your vacuum and check to make sure it is functioning properly with the clean bag.

Which bag you choose will likely depend on the items being stored.For instance, flat bags are excellent for clothing, whereas cubes and totes are best for larger items, such as blankets.;
, In order to open the bag, grab each side of the zipper. Place one hand on the one side of the zipper, and the other hand on the opposite side. Then, pull the sides apart.Try not to pull so hard that the zipper comes off.

, To pack the bag, you should place it on a bed, sofa, floor, or table. The bag should be kept upright with the fill line facing upwards.

, Space saver vacuum bags can store a variety of soft items, but are most commonly used for clothing and linens.Don't store food, leather, or fur items in these bags.
Don’t store items with sharp corners or ridges because these may puncture the bag.Make sure that all items are dry before packing them into space saver bags.

, Be sure not to overfill the bag. Only place items to the fill line.To maximize the amount of available space, you can fold your items.

, Firmly grasp the sure-zip slider using your thumb and index finger. Then, slide the zipper across the top of the bag. Make sure to slide the zipper back and forth at least twice. Press down a little harder to ensure a tight seal has been made, and no air will leak out.If the sure-zip slider piece comes off while closing the bag, simply slide it back onto the bag. Press it back onto the zipper track over the top of the bag. You should hear it click twice., To ensure that the zipper is completely sealed, slide your fingers along the zipper track and press down. You should be able to feel if any areas are not sealed., Space saver vacuum bags have a valve located on the top of the bag. To open the valve cap, place one hand around the base of the valve and use your other to lift open the cap.If you pull the cap too hard it may come off. You can put it back on by placing the rubber flapper inside the valve base. Then, snap the cap back onto the base.

, Remove all attachments from your vacuum and place the circular hose onto the valve. Make sure to place the hose in the center of the valve. The circular end of the hose should completely fill the valve.


Dust-buster style vacuums will not work.

, Once the vacuum is turned on, you will see the bag begin to shrink as air is removed. When the bag stops shrinking, this signals that you have completed the sealing process. At this point you can turn off the vacuum.When placing down-pillows or down-comforters into the bag, don't empty all of the air from the bag. Only compress the air in the bag to fifty percent its original size, as further compression will damage the down feathers.

, Once you have finished vacuum sealing the bag, remove the vacuum hose from the valve and close the lid on the bag. This will prevent any air from escaping the bag., You can store space saver vacuum bags on a smooth and flat surface, such as a closet, cupboard, or under a bed. This way the bag is less likely to get punctured and ruined. Make sure there are no sharp objects placed near the bags., Heat can melt the plastic bag and/or valve. Even if the bag does not completely melt, heat can weaken the plastic making it more susceptible to punctures and leaks. As a result, you should not store bags outside, or near vents or active electrical outlets., Space saver bags are made from plastic and could become hazardous to children, if left unsupervised. Make sure these bags are stored up high and out of the reach of young children."

Use a sandpaper sponge.,
Trim with scissors.,
Use a shaving razor.,
Use Velcro hair rollers.,
Use a strip of Velcro.",How to Remove Pilling From Clothing1," If you scrub your clothing with this sponge, your pilling will be gone!;
, Depending on the number and size of the pills, you may be able to trim them away with a pair of scissors. Lay the garment on a flat surface. Pull up individual pills trim away with your other hand. You may also put your hand inside the garment in order to pull it taut, and then gently trim away the pills.


Make sure to hold the scissors close to the fabric. Be gentle and slow, so you do not damage the fabric.
Small nail scissors are safer to use. They are duller and more precise, and are less likely to damage the fabric. , Take a disposable razor and lay the garment on a flat surface. Pull the fabric near the affected area taut with one hand. This will prevent you from cutting through the garment. Gently shave upward with the razor in small strokes. Start with the lightest contact possible and increase as necessary.


Once you have accumulated a pile of pillings, use tape to remove from the fabric. Wrap a large loop of packing tape around your closed fingers, sticky side out. Press against the fabric to pick up the accumulated pillings. Replace tape when it becomes full of pills. If you do not have packing tape, small strips of masking tape will also work.
Make sure to use a sharp, new razor. This will most effectively remove the pills. Avoid using shaving razors that have moisture strips or soap bars on either side. This will likely cause more pilling when rubbed against the fabric.

, Hair rollers are very gentle, making them ideal for use on delicate fabrics like wool and cashmere. Lay the garment on a flat surface and pull it taut. Lay the roller flat on the affected area. Gently roll upwards and out until the area is pill-free. The pilling will get caught in the hair roller. Pick it up and move it to another area if the garment is pilled in several areas.

, If you have a piece of Velcro you can also use this to remove pillings. Consider using Velcro found on a shoe or wallet. Apply the Velcro hook-side down to the affected area of the garment. Gently pull up and repeat until the pilling is gone.


This method can damage very delicate fabrics, so do not use on cashmere or wool.

, The dimensions, for the sponge, on a Rubbermaid Sponge Mop is: length - 9 5/8"", width - 2 7/8"", height a - 1 1/4"" and height b 1 3/16"". There is a taper to the shape and the different heights reflect that. The sponge can also be made a bit thicker (1/16"" - 3/16"") for more durability.

, This is a durable type of sponge that is used for heavy cleaning, so it would probably not be found in drug or grocery stores. Make sure the sponge is of the right size (more than 9"" long and 6"" wide so the polyester sponge can be use twice). The sponge mop refill length is 9 5/8"" and sponge bought was 9"" long, but the 9"" sponge is usable because it fits perfectly on the mounting plate which is 8 3/8"" wide.

, If the sponge ""melts"" from the rubber cement, try using a milder rubber cement. These heavy duty sponges are durable and should not melt from the rubber cement. As a general rule, the free running cement will tend to melt sponge more than the thick type.

,, Sharpen your knife first and use a thin bladed knife. Use a good scissors to do some snipping. Carefully make one side of the sponge flat(this is the side that will have the rubber cement sticking to it). The plastic plate, that you will glue the sponge on, may be warped because the cellulose sponges contract when dried, so you may have to shape the sponge to fit the plastic plate.

Look for tightly knit sweaters.,
Turn your garment inside out.,
Wash gently.,
Avoid the electric dryer.,
Use liquid detergent.,
Brush with a lint roller regularly.",How to Remove Pilling From Clothing3," Fabrics made of fiber blends are more susceptible to pilling. Fiber blends combine natural and synthetic fibers, and they are more likely to rub together and form pills. This is especially true for fabrics with three or more different types of fibers. , Check the fabric before you buy. Tightly knit fabrics are less likely to pill, whereas looser weaves or more susceptible to pilling , Turn the garment inside out before washing. This will prevent noticeable pilling as the fabric rubs against itself and other garments in the wash. You can also try storing the garment inside out by turning it inside out before hanging or folding it. , Use a delicate cycle when washing in the washing machine. Delicate cycles are shorter and gentler, causing less abrasion in the garments.


Consider hand washing garments like sweaters that are more likely to pill. This is the gentlest way of washing. Look for detergent made especially for handwashing and wash in a sink or bathtub. , When possible, hang garment to dry rather than using the drying machine. This will cause less abrasion to the fabric and prevent pilling. , Powder detergent rubs against the fabric as it dissolves. This makes it more likely to cause pilling during the washing cycle. Liquid detergents are the most gentle solution for delicate fabrics. , Be sure to regularly brush delicate sweaters with a lint roller or lint brush to prevent pilling. Consistently using a lint roller will prevent pills from accumulating on the fabric. "

Use a lint roller.,
Make a homemade lint roller.,
Roll some wide, packaging tape around your hand.,
Use a strip of tape.,
Consider an electric lint shaver.,
Rub a pumice stone or a ""sweater stone"" against sweaters and fleece.,
Use Velcro to rub lint away.,
Use a clean shaving razor to shave off pills.,
Use a damp sponge or scouring pad to buff away lint.",How to Remove Lint from Clothes1," You can find them in the laundry department of a supermarket, as well as in fabric stores and pet stores. Peel the wrapper off the tube part, and roll it across the garment. Use and up-and-down motion. As you continue to roll, you will notice that the lint roller is become less tacky. When this happens, simply peel off the sticky sheet to reveal a fresh sticky underneath. Keep rolling and removing sheets until there is no more lint.









When you run out of sticky sheets, you can buy a replacement roll of sticky sheets. You can also just buy a whole new lint roller.
You can also buy a re-usable lint roller. These rely on a sticky gel sort of material to pick up the lint. When they become dirty, you simply rinse them off using soap and water, and let them dry.;
, You will need a roll of wide, packaging tape and a rolling pin. Unroll a little bit of tape, and place the end against one of the ends of the rolling pin. Make sure that the sticky side of the tape is facing you, and the smooth side is facing the rolling pin. Carefully wrap the tape around the rolling pin in a spiral, like a candy cane, making sure to overlap each turn. When you reach the other end of the rolling pin, cut the tape off. It should hold together by itself, but it if doesn't, you can use a small piece of tape to stick it down to the pin.









To use this, simply place the rolling pin on your garment. Hold it by the handles, and roll it up and down until the lint is gone.

, Cut a piece of wide tape that is a little more than twice the width of your hand. Hold out your hand with your fingers closed together. Wrap the tape, sticky-side-out around your fingers, and overlap the edges. Lightly pat the affected area with your fingers. When the tape stops being sticky, simply rotate the tape around your fingers until the dirty side is facing you. Continue patting the garment with the fresh side of the tape.








, Find some wide tape, and cut a piece that is a few inches long. Place the tape, sticky-side-down, onto the affected area. Make sure that the tape is going in the same direction as the weave of the fabric (usually up-and-down). Rub your finger across the tape to smooth it down, then pull it off.









The wider the tape is, the more area you will cover. Try to find something that is about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide.

, This is a battery-powered device that you can glide on to your clothes to take care of the lint. Turn on the shaver, and run it gently across the fabric. When you are done, open up the lint compartment, and toss the shaved lint into the trash., This can also remove pilling. Make sure that you are going with the weave of the fabric, and not against it. Also, try not to rub too hard, or go over the same area too much. The pumice stone will take off the top layer of the fabric. If you keep going over the same spot, you may get a hole.









Avoid using this on cotton or wool. You also won't want to use it on delicate or shiny fabric, such as silk or satin.
Most of the lint will be dragged down towards the bottom of the garment. You can use some tape or a lint roller to pull the lint piles off.
Consider working on top of a table or tablecloth; this will make cleaning to lint debris a lot easier.

, Purchase some Velcro and cut a piece that is about the width of your hand. Find the rough side with the hooks and set aside the soft, fuzzy side. Rub the Velcro downward against the garment. If the lint gathers at the bottom of the garment, then pick it off using some tape or a lint roller.








, This is especially effective for lint that is stuck deep into the fabric. Take a shaving razor, and place it near the top of the garment. Gently drag the razor down the fabric a few inches. Lift it off and tap off any excess lint. Continue pulling the razor down the fabric, stopping every few inches to tap the lint off. 








If you do not have an electric lint shaver, a more inexpensive option would be to use a single-blade razor. Hold the razor at such an angle to skim the fabric surface and get rid of the lint, but be careful not to cut into the cloth and ruin the garment.

, Wet a sponge or scouring pad with water, and squeeze it to get rid of the excess moisture. Gently rub the rough side of the sponge or scouring pad against the fabric. Use a downward motion, and work in small sections at a time.

, Make sure the cleaner is turned onto a low power level - you don't want to pull the woven pieces out of their shape.

, Some may just wipe off; others may be permanent and you will only be able to lighten them a little. Picnic hampers are likely to have food stains, which really ought to be cleaned off immediately.

, This is a gentle abrasive that you should use with a soft sponge only (no steel wool or plastic scratchy pads!). Don't rub too hard or for too long. If the stain does not appear to want to lift, leave it and learn to live with it. The bicarbonate mix will have removed any odours and will help to have lightened the stain a little anyway. Wash the bicarbonate mixture off with salt water.

,,, You can use salt water on wicker. Again, allow the whole hamper to dry in the outdoors.

,
Deepen the lines on the metal sheet using the stylus to your preference.,
Fill in the lines with the embossing tool.",How to Emboss Metal,"


Print out or draw your design on a piece of paper. It can be helpful to use a piece of paper that is the same size as your metal sheet.
Tape the edges of your metal sheet to the piece of paper with your template design. Place a piece of tape on all sides to ensure the page does not slip. This will ensure that your lines are true to the design.
Using the stylus, trace over the lines of your template design. Use as little pressure as possible, so that you are not committed to a high relief. This cannot easily be undone, so follow the lines as close to exact as possible.;
,, The harder you press, the deeper the line.

, Again, more pressure yields more relief (negative from the side you're working, positive from opposite side).

Use compound snips to make small cuts in thin-gauge steel.,
Choose a nibbler to make longer cuts in thin-gauge steel.,
Use an angle grinder fitted with a metal cutoff wheel for rough cuts.,
Use a hacksaw for simple, shallow cuts.,
Use a bench shear to easily cut most gauges of sheet metal.",How to Cut Steel1," Compound snips are sometimes referred to as “aviation snips” or “tin snips.” These scissor-like tools allow you to cut through thin steel – 24 gauge or thinner – in the same way you would cut through paper with ordinary scissors. Snips are a good choice if you need to make quick, short cuts on very thin steel. There are three kinds of compound snips, with color-coded handles to make them easy to tell apart.Straight snips have yellow handles and allow you to cut straight lines.
Left-cut snips have red handles and allow you to cut counter clockwise curves.
Right-cut snips have green handles and allow you to cut clockwise curves.;
, Compound snips work great for short cuts, but longer cuts are best handled by a nibbler. Nibblers are hand-held tools. They are relatively inexpensive and make clean, high-speed cuts with minimal distortion and very little noise. They also create no sparks when cutting. Thicknesses vary from brand to brand, but in general a nibbler can cut up to 14 gauge steel.


There are hand-operated, drill-powered, electric and pneumatic versions on the market.Every time the nibbler makes a cut, it punches out a small piece of sheet metal. By the time you’re finished, you’ll have many tiny crescent-shaped steel pieces littered all over the floor.
Definitely clean those up as soon as possible – otherwise, the sharp little edges can get embedded in the soles of shoes and cause injuries., An angle grinder is an affordable handheld power tool that can handle many different grinding and cutting tasks. It can be fitted with an assortment of different blades, which makes it very versatile. The blade you need to use in order to cut through steel is called a metal cutoff blade. You can make fast cuts with the cutoff blade, but the downside is they will be fairly rough.It’s difficult to get perfect accuracy with this tool.


Wear face protection, ear protection (it’s very loud) and thick work gloves when operating this tool. Sparks will fly when the blade touches the metal, so make sure there’s nothing flammable nearby.
Make sure you read the instruction manual carefully and are using the correct blade for cutting steel.

, A hacksaw can cut through sheet metal, but its shape limits the types of cuts it can make. The cuts may also be a bit rough, you won’t be able to maneuver the saw much and its blade can’t cut very deep. However, a hacksaw is great tool to have on hand to take care of simple steel-cutting tasks.


Keep its blade in good condition by rubbing wax on it after each use.
To get a cleaner cut, try using a strip of masking tape on the bottom and top of the sheet metal. This will prevent scratching., Bench shears come in two general types: straight shears and throatless shears. Straight shears make cuts that are straight lines. Throatless sheers can cut inside curves and other complicated shapes, in addition to outside curves and straight lines. They look and operate much like office paper cutters. A lever fitted with a blade is pulled down over the place you want to cut.


To operate, mark the cut line on the piece of sheet metal. Situate the metal under the blade and line the blade up with the cut line.
Pull the handle down slowly with your hand and slice through the metal."

The pad feels similar to the soft side of Velcro. Simply rub the lint brush in a single direction across the fabric. Start from the top of the garment, and work your way downward. If there is any lint leftover when you reach the bottom hem, you can pull it off using a lint roller or a piece of tape.








, The dryer sheet will also get rid of static, which attracts lint in the first place.







, Put on a rubber glove, like the one you would use to wash dishes. Run your hand downward across the fabric towards the hem. The lint and pet hairs will stick to the glove. As you continue to rub the fabric down, the lint and pet hairs will gather in one place. You can wipe them off using the glove, or you can pick them off with a piece of tape or a lint roller.







, Stick your hand into a nylon sock or a pair of pantyhose, like you are putting on a glove. Make sure that your fingers are touching the toe part. Run your hand lightly across the fabric. The lint will stick to the nylon and pantyhose.








, If you take your clothes out of the washer and see that there is lint on them, put them back in and wash them again. Do not use detergent for this second wash. After the cycle is done, take the clothes out, and shake them out to loosen any leftover lint. Dry the clothes in the dryer as you normally would."

It might be a good idea to wash them separately, or at least apart from fabrics you know shed a lot of lint.If you cannot wash the items separately, try to turn the items that attract lint inside out before you toss them into the wash., The vinegar will help remove lint from clothing. It will also help keep the lint from sticking as much.


Vinegar will also help deodorize laundry.

, Items, such as tissues, will deteriorate in the washer and dryer, and cause even more lint. Be sure to check the pockets and take out any scraps of tissue, fabric, or paper., If something has a lot of lint on it, try to remove the lint using a lint roller before you toss it into the wash. If you don't remove the lint, it will just transfer to everything else., Whenever you wash something you know sheds a lot of lint, wipe down the drum of your washer with a towel. If you don't do this, any residual lint may get onto the rest of your clothes during the next wash.







, Take each garment, and give it a good shake before you toss it into the dryer. This will help knock off any lint that may have gotten onto the fabric in the washer.







, You will only need half a sheet for a small load, and a full-sized sheet for a regular load. The dryer sheet will help reduce static, which is what causes lint to stick to clothing in the first place., When you open your dryer, there should be a tray inside the door, or just inside the machine. If you can take out the try, do so, and tap the lint off into a trashcan. If you can't take the tray out, scoop the lint off with your fingers. If you don't do this, that lint may get onto your clothes the next time you dry them.







, Dryers catch a lot of lint, and if they are not clean, they can transfer the lint to your clothes. Air-drying clothing reduces lint. The wind may also help knock off any specks of lint. You can dry your clothes on a clothing line, or on a clothing rack.The sunlight and fresh air will also help kill any odor-causing bacteria, leaving your clothes smelling nice and fresh.

Use an abrasive chop saw for accurate square cuts.,
Use a horizontal band saw.Band saws are fairly economical and can cut thicker steel with more accuracy than the abrasive chop saw.,
Make highly accurate cuts with a cold saw.",How to Cut Steel2," A chop saw is an efficient, heavy-duty circular saw. It is supported by a metal base and mounted on a pivoting arm, making it very easy to use. A chop saw can handle a lot of different steel-cutting duties and is able to make exact, square cuts.It’s an affordable tool, making it more realistic than the horizontal saw or cold saw for a home shop setting. However, it can’t make cuts as accurate as either of those tools can.


Chop saws are high-powered. A great deal of heat is generated during the cut, making the steel extremely hot. Handle freshly cut steel with caution.
Along with heavy-duty gloves and eye protection, you need to use ear protection when operating power saws. They are very loud and can damage hearing.

, They are very easy to use – all you have to do is feed the metal into the saw and the blade does the rest. Make sure you’re using metal-cutting (carbon steel or bimetal) blades with your band saw.There are three main blade tooth patterns – raker, wave and straight. For cutting steel thicker than sheet metal, use the raker pattern. For thinner steel, use the wave tooth pattern.The blades get dull easily and need to be replaced to get proper accuracy.
Band saws cut slowly and you may need to grind minor rough edges off after the cut is made.
Band saws have a higher capacity than cold saws, but they don’t cut as accurately., A cold saw is a very expensive piece of equipment and generally isn’t a realistic choice for a home shop setting unless you plan on using it often. Cold saws make clean cuts that are more accurate than what a band saw can do, but a cold saw’s capacity is smaller. If you’re trying to choose between the two, make your decision based on how much steel you need to cut and how accurate you need to cut it.


The cold saw is circular and its blade has a lot of teeth. The blade itself spins very slowly, but the cut is made quickly.A coolant is used with the cold saw to prevent the steel from heating up. The coolant should be immediately wiped off the steel after the cut is made.

Take the proper safety precautions for torch use.,
Use a plasma torch for metal that is 0.25-inch and thinner.A plasma torch is a relatively inexpensive, high-powered tool that slices through steel using a thermal cut process.,
Use an oxy-acetylene torch to cut through thick steel plates.",How to Cut Steel3," Torches give off intense heat and light. When you use them to cut through steel, they also throw off sparks, which makes them a fire hazard. It’s imperative that you wear gloves and shaded eye protection in the shade range of #7 to #9. Wear a protective jacket used by welders. Don’t wear pants made of natural fibers and make sure they’re not cuffed (the sparks can get trapped in cuffs).Work in a well-ventilated room and, if necessary, wear a respirator.
Make sure there’s nothing flammable in the immediate vicinity, since the sparks could ignite the material., It’s ideal for metal that is 0.25-inch and thinner. These torches won’t warp thin metal, whereas the oxy-fuel torch might. Plasma torches make very clean cuts and are extremely efficient.


A plasma torch can cut through any conductive material, not just steel. The oxy-fuel torch is only able to cut steel.

, Oxy-fuel torches cut through far thicker materials than plasma. Use oxy-fuel to cut through any steel thicker than 1 inch (2.5 cm).It’s possible for an oxy-fuel to cut through up to 48 inches (120 cm) of steel. Steel plates, however, are usually 12 inches (30.5 cm) thick or less.Oxy-fuel torches make cuts with a smooth, square cut surface.


Do not use oxy-fuel torches around oil or grease. High-pressure oxygen tanks can react violently with them.
Acetylene is also a dangerous gas to work with. It is unstable over 15 psi, so try to keep it around 5 psi during use. Always store these tanks upright."

Get the right tools.,
Identify the type of expandable metal you would wish to cut.,
Take measurements.,
Begin the cutting process.,
To cut expanded metal, you will require a cutting tool.,
Cleaning the workshop.",How to Cut Expanded Metal,"

Like any other cutting processes, to cut expanded metal successfully, you have to choose the right tools and equipment which will aid the cutting process. Some of these tools and equipment include:
Cutting tool; there are very many grinders which are available in the market. Choose a grinder depending on the nature and size of the expanded metal to be cut.
Measuring device; you can opt for either a ruler or a tape measure. You will use it to determine the exact length of the metal you would wish to cut.
Clamps; they help to hold the metal in position during the cutting process.
Safety glasses; they protect the eyes from tiny particles of metals which could enter the eye during the cutting process.
Gloves; protect hands holding both the grinder and the wire to be cut.
Do not assume that cutting expanded metal is a simple process and thus safety equipment is not necessary; safety if a priority. Before you begin the process, ensure that all tools are in good working condition.;
,

There are very many types of expandable metals available in the market. Every metal has been designed for a specific application. Some of the most common types of metals include:
The standard or regular expanded metals; these metals are manufactured using a press which cuts and stretches the solid metal simultaneously. This results into strips in diamond pattern. This pattern increases air circulation, distributes weight evenly throughout the metal surface and enhances both strength and rigidity of the metal. They are used in wide range of applications which include security applications such as in warehouse enclosure, safety guards especially when it comes to preventing unwanted objects from entering a particular area.
Flattened expandable metals; the standard expandable metals can be processed further (for the second time) using a cold rolling press. These metals have both smooth and level surface. Cold rolling reduces metal thickness making the metal ideal for ventilation devices, making cages and fencing.
Expanded metal mesh; they are also available in a wide range of gauges and shapes. They are used mainly used for both architectural and decorative purposes. They are also available in a wide range of sizes and shapes. Such metals may require special cutting tools unlike for the case of the standard types.
Expanded metal grating; these types of metals are created using low carbon steel plates and they are of heavy gauge. They are mostly used in making walkways, machine platforms or areas which tend to experience high level of pedestrian traffic. Their design offers durability with better traction and low maintenance costs.
To cut expanded metal efficiently, it is important to know the kind of metal you would wish to cut. These metals also made from different types of metals such as steel, aluminum, copper etc. They vary in strength and other physical properties. Therefore, while choosing the type of cutting equipment, all these factors must be considered. Generally, this knowledge will help to determine the right kind of tool to be used during the process besides designing and appropriate cutting procedure.

,

You need to know the exact size of the metal you need cut. Place the metal on a flat surface and use a tape measure to mark the exact portion of the metal you need.
The measurements must be very accurate to ensure that no or very small portion of the metal goes to waste. Place a ruler and make permanent marks on the metal using a marker pen. *Sometimes, marking tape can also work. These marks will act as the cut line. In most cases, it is much easier to cut these metals along the joints though it’s not critical. The cutting line will depend on the type of the application.
May be you can opt for 1,220 centimeter (480.3 in) by 2,440 centimeter (960.6 in); depending on the nature of the application. The shape can be rectangular, triangular, circular etc.
In any engineering or technical job, the accuracy of the final product will be determined by the accuracy of the measurement which had been taken. The measuring device must be accurate. To achieve these high level of accuracy, you must know how to use the measuring device.
In situations where the expanded metal has been rolled, unroll the metal carefully on a flat surface to obtain accurate measurements. If possible, you can fix one end of the metal. As you unroll the expanded metal to take the measurements. Be sure to wear a pair of gloves to protect your hands from the sharp edges of the metal.

,

This is the most critical part of the entire process. Before you begin to cut expanded metal, clamp it tightly. This will prevent any movement during the cutting process. During the cutting process, the cutting tool (saw or drill) will exert some amount of force on the metal which may force it to move sideways. When tightly clamped, it will be possible to cut the piece of metal along the marks and hence making accurate cuts which will reduce the amount of wastes.
It is advisable to have an apron or any protective cloth to protect the body from tiny pieces of metals; wear safety glasses to protect the eyes, gloves to protect the hands and safety boots to protect the feet. When you are safe, you will be confident and thus, there will be higher chances that you will concentrating on the cutting process. There will be higher chances of making accurate cuts.
The grinding process produces a lot of heat which may make the piece of metal (depending with the size) to turn red-hot. It is advisable to give the surface sometime to cool before touching it. *Furthermore, depending on how you hold the cutting equipment, the resulting surface can also be very sharp and it may also cut your finger or the gloves. Never slide your finger along the edge of the cut surface.
To cut expanded metal more conveniently, place the portion to be cut on a raised surface. This will ensure that you do not cut working surface. Some surfaces such as rocks tend to damage the blades of the cutting tools due to their hard surface.
Some expanded metals may not be strong enough to support their weight when their surfaces have been raised. Place another material near the surface which had been marked, preferably wood since it is soft. Alternatively, you can clamp both sides of the metal such that the marked surface lies between the clamps. Tighten the clamps to make the surface tight and flat to make accurate cuts.
When you want to cut small piece of metal from a larger sheet, begin all your cutting process from one edge of the metal. In most cases, if you choose any section within the center or any point away from the edges, there will be higher chances of wasting quite a substantial amount of metal. Remember, minimizing wastage will be a sure way to reduce expenses.

,

Cutting tools are very dangerous especially if they have not been handled carefully. You must handle cutting tools with a lot of precautions. The very first step is to ensure that the cutting tool is in good condition; it is functioning as desired.
For instance, for the case of a grinder, the grinding disk must be tightened firmly to avoid chances of the grinding disk flying away during the process. The cutting device must be sharp to obtain a good finish.
When you opt for other advanced techniques such as laser cutting, you must also ensure that the entire machine is also functioning as accurately. More importantly, you must know how to operate the laser cutting machine. Most cutting equipment produce a lot of sparks which you must be very cautious about; a reason why you must have goggles and protective clothing.
Unlike cutting other solid metals, expandable metals have so many gaps. Each gap on the extended metal will cause the cutting tool to move forward faster more so when you apply excessive force. Remember to hold the cutting tool firmly and do not apply a lot of force which will make the cutting tool to go off the marked line. Always keep a steady hand as you work down the metal and continue cutting until you reach the final mark. The expanded metal will separate and the job will be complete. You can grind the edges of the metal which had been cut to make the sharp edges blunt since this will also minimize chances of someone else being cut by the sharp edges.

,

Separating the required piece of expanded metal does not mean that the job is complete. Your work area must be kept clean free from small pieces of metal since they may be hazardous. Collect all the unused pieces of metals and dispose them appropriately. The unused section of the expanded metal should be taken back to the store. *Clean all tools and equipment and store them appropriately too. Cleaning tools and equipment will ensure that your cutting tools serve you for a long time.
To cut expanded metal, you do not require a lot of experience since these are very easy and simple steps one can easily follow. However, it comes with quite a number of risks and there are higher chances of getting injured if one happens to ignore any of these precautions which have been highlighted above.

Prime the metal surface with spray-on primer.,
Shake the paint can to mix the paint prior to beginning the project.,
Test your paint on scrap material or an area of your metal project.,
Spray paint onto your metal surface.",How to Spray Paint Metal," Sand the metal surface with a medium-grit sandpaper or use a wire brush to rid the surface of rust or loose paint that would create an uneven painting surface.






;
, Remove dust or other particles with a moist rag. Clean the surface with mineral spirits to remove dirt and other grime.








,









Select an area that is well-ventilated. Spray paint fumes aren't typically harmful, but ventilation is necessary to provide the painter with fresh air.
Position a drop cloth, cardboard, wood pieces or garbage bag to catch any loose particles that fly off while you paint.
Avoid humid conditions. Humidity can affect how your paint dries and adheres. Choose locations and times of day that are less humid.

, Allow it to dry for at least 1 hour. Follow the directions on the can to apply the spray-on primer.








, Turn it from top to bottom in your hand for at least 2 minutes. You will hear the mixer ball rattle in the can. Repeat the mixing process throughout the project as you paint.








, Check to make sure the nozzle is clear. Get used to how the paint flows from your nozzle as you do your test painting.








,









Hold the can approximately 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) away from the metal surface. Getting too close to the surface can cause drips and runs. Painting too far from your surface causes uneven spraying.
Paint with a sweeping motion. The sweeping motion should be from top to bottom or side to side. Overlap your passes with the spray paint.
Pause after each sweeping motion by letting go of the trigger.
Apply thin coats of paint to avoid drips and runs. Thicker applications dry more slowly than thinner coats, and do not dry as evenly.
Allow your painted surface to dry for at least 3 hours.
Spray on a second coat of paint. Most spray paint projects require no more than 2 coats to evenly distribute paint and cover a metal surface. Allow the second coat of paint to dry before handling the object.

Notice the color.,
Touch the piece with a magnet.,
Scratch the metal across a ceramic surface.,
Test the density of the metal.",How to Tell Gold from Brass1," While brass and gold have similar colors, gold is shinier and more yellow. Brass is duller than gold and does not have the same vibrant yellow color as pure gold. However, if the gold is mixed with other metals, this method will be less reliable., Gold will not interact with a magnet. Brass, however, will attract the magnet. Bring a magnet close to the metal piece and observe whether it is attracted to the piece or not. If it is, you have brass. If not, you have gold., Gold is a very soft metal. When scratched across a ceramic surface, gold will leave behind a streak of gold. However, brass is harder and will leave a black streak on the same surface. Simply press the metal to an unpolished ceramic surface and pull it across the surface., The most accurate way to test the density of the metal would be to measure the volume and the mass, then calculate the density mathematically. Luckily, there’s a faster and easier approach. Use your hand to toss the metal lightly up and let it come back down (or you can just lift it and lower it quickly without it leaving your hand). Since gold is more dense than brass, it will feel heavier than you might expect. Since brass has a lower density, it will feel lighter."
"
Look for a karat count.,
Search for the word “Brass.” While brass does not receive a karat count, it is sometimes marked.,
Know the price of the metal.",How to Tell Gold from Brass2," The karat is a measurement used to designate the purity of gold. Higher ratios of gold to other metals in a piece means a higher karat count. Pure gold is 24 karat. A brass piece will not be marked with a karat count. The karat count is typically found in an inconspicuous place such as the bottom or inside of a piece, though it varies from piece to piece., Many brass pieces will have the word “Brass” somewhere on the metal. This word is often stamped or engraved in the metal piece when it is forged. Just like the karat count, the location of this stamp will vary, but it is likely to be on the inside lip or the bottom of an object., If you know what the metal piece sells for, you can easily tell the difference between brass and gold. Gold is quite expensive depending on its purity. Brass is relatively cheap compared to precious metals like gold and silver."
"
Scan for any tarnished areas.,
Test an inconspicuous section.,
Apply acid to the metal.",How to Tell Gold from Brass3," One of the most revered properties of gold is that it does not tarnish. On the other hand, brass reacts with oxygen in the environment. This reaction is called oxidation and it will cause the brass to look tarnished and discolored. If there are any oxidized areas, the piece is brass. However, the absence of oxidation cannot confirm that the piece is gold., When testing the chemical properties of a piece of metal, you should do so in an area that is not typically visible. This will ensure that the piece isn’t ruined by doing the test. Look for a lip or rim with an underside, or a piece of the metal that is otherwise covered or concealed., Apply concentrated acid to the metal. Brass will react with acids and gold will not. If you see bubbling or discoloration where the acid is applied, your piece is brass. If there is no change after applying the acid, you have gold."

Add a gentle detergent to the water.,
Scrub your backpack with a soft brush or rag.,
Rinse your backpack thoroughly.,
Dry your backpack.",How to Wash a Backpack1," You don't want to wash any items in your backpack that could be damaged by water. Turn your backpack inside out and use a small vacuum to clean the hard to reach interior corners of your backpack that might have small particles of dirt and garbage.Once you are finished emptying your backpack, leave the pockets unzipped.


Set all of your belongings from inside the backpack in a plastic bag, so you can put it all back in after you clean your bag. That way, you won't lose anything important.
If you notice that any of your personal items are dirty, clean them now while you are washing your backpack. You don't want to put dirty items back into a clean bag.;
, Use your hands to brush off loose, exterior dirt and dust. Then use a damp rag to lightly wipe down the outside of your bag. This gets off the big, surface dirt, and will help keep your cleaning water as clean as possible.If you pack has some kind of frame, make sure to remove it before trying to wash the bag.
Take off any detachable pockets and straps from the main body of the backpack, and clean them separately. This will ensure that each portion of the bag gets a thorough cleaning.
Cut away any loose threads or fibers close to the zipping areas.This ensures that along with your clean backpack, you will have a backpack free of snagged and stuck zippers.

, Always follow the care instructions for the backpack (if it has any) to ensure that you are washing your bag in a way that won’t damage it. Care labels are usually located inside the backpack along a side seam, most likely in the main zipper compartment. The care labels for backpacks usually have recommended information on washing and drying the bag, to ensure its sustainability.


Certain chemicals and cleaning practices can damage the backpack (its ability to resist water, for example) so it’s best to follow the guidelines that come with the bag.
If the fabric doesn't have a label for care and washing, test a small area of the fabric to see how it reacts to the cleaning agents you want to use.

, Use any pre treatment stain remover of your choice to target dirty spots, but avoid bleach. Use a soft brush (an old toothbrush) to scrub away stain residue, and let the treatment sit for up to 30 minutes. Most of the stain should come off when you actually wash the bag.


If you don’t have any staining pre treatment, you can use your brush dipped in a 50:50 solution of liquid detergent and water.

, You can also do this in a laundry basin or laundry sink. Make sure you have plenty of room to really wash out all the pockets and sections of the backpack.


Avoid hot water, because hot water can cause colors in the backpack to bleed.
If your care label indicates not to fully submerge the backpack, try wetting and cleaning parts of it with a soaked rag.

, The detergent you use has to be a gentle cleanser that is free of dyes, fragrances, and chemicals. This is because harsh chemicals could damage your backpack’s fabric material (by diminishing the efficacy of the layers of waterproofing on the bag fabric), and the fragrances and dyes could irritate your skin., You can either fully submerge your backpack in the water, or use the water to dip your scrub brush or cleaning rag in. A brush will help clean areas that are particularly dirty, and a rag is suited better for general cleaning of the bag.


A toothbrush can be used for getting tough stains out of the backpack material, and getting into hard to reach areas of the bag.
If your bag is made of a delicate material, like mesh, you might want to use a sponge instead of a brush to prevent damaging the fabric.

, Rinse out any soap or detergent with lukewarm water to avoid getting a soapy residue on your backpack fabric.


Wring out the bag to the best of your abilities. You can try laying the bag on a large body towel, and rolling the towel with the bag inside, until it looks like a tube. This helps with absorbing large amounts of water.
Watch out specifically for zippers, straps, and foam areas when wringing out your bag so you don't damage them.

, Allow the bag to dry naturally rather than in a drying machine. If possible, let the backpack hang upside down, with the pockets unzipped while it dries.


You can also try drying the backpack outside in the sun. This will help de-odorize your bag.
Before the next use or storing the backpack away, be sure that it is completely dry. Leaving it wet when in use or in storage can increase the chances of mold growth on the bag.

Wash the backpack.,
Dry your backpack.",How to Wash a Backpack2," Clear your backpack of any items that could be damaged by water while washing your backpack. To help clear out small debris and crumbs in the bottom of the backpack, try turning the backpack inside out and use a handheld vacuum to clear hard to reach nooks and crannies.Leave the backpack's pockets unzipped and open once you are finished vacuuming, so all areas of the bag can get cleaned during washing.


To help keep all of your belongings together, try placing your items in a small plastic bag right away, so you keep everything in one, safe, space.
If any of your bag items are dirty, now would be a good time to wipe those down as well. After all, it doesn't make sense to put dirty items into a clean bag.

, Wipe off any loose dirt or dust from the outside of the bag. After the surface dirt is removed from the bag, use a damp cloth to wipe the bag again, clearing any more dirt or dust still remaining on the bag’s surface. This will ensure that no large, solid dirt mixes in with the water you intend to use for cleaning the bag.Remove any metal frames from the backpack before washing the bag.
Any detachable pockets and straps should be removed and cleaned separately from the main bag. This is because they are smaller in size, and they could get caught in the wash machine, and cause damage.
Cut away threads near the zippers. Threading tends to fray near the zippers, causing snags and rips in the backpack material.

, Almost every backpack has a label with care instructions for cleaning the bag. The care labels for backpacks usually have recommended information on washing and drying the bag, so you can clean your bag in the best way possible for the bag material and attachments, while maintaining its features of sustainability – like remaining water proof. You can find the care label inside of the backpack, normally in the biggest storage section along a side seam.


Harsh cleaning agents and overly rough cleaning practices could damage your backpack, and its capability to repel water, so follow the cleaning guidelines that come with your bag. When in doubt, use gentle cleansers on the wash machine gentle cleansing cycle, or gently wash the backpack by hand.
Most backpacks are made from canvas or nylon which normally makes them machine washer safe.

, Add any pre treatment stain remover of your choice to any stained areas of the backpack, but avoid using bleach. Scrub away stain residue with a soft brush (an old toothbrush), and let the stain treatment sit for about 30 minutes. The stains should rinse right off when you actually wash the bag.


A 50:50 solution of liquid detergent and water can work as a pre treatment for stains if you don't have any pre treatment at the house. Just dip a small toothbrush into the solution and scrub away at the stains.

, Place the backpack in an old pillowcase or laundry sack, and place the pillowcase/laundry sack with the backpack in the wash machine. Add a small amount (1-2 tbsp) of gentle detergent as the washer fills with water. Wash the backpack in cold or lukewarm water, using the washer’s delicate or gentle cycle.Once the cycle is finished, take the backpack out of its covering, and wipe down outside and inside compartments of the backpack.


The pillowcase helps to stop the straps and zippers from getting caught in the machine, and damaging both bag and machine.Alternatively, you can turn the backpack inside out.
The backpack may bunch up frequently during the spin cycle. Be sure to move the bag and spread it out to keep the wash machine from getting unbalanced and lopsided as it washes your bag. Once the bag is spread out, restart the cycle., Naturally dry the backpack outside or hanging up inside rather than drying it in a dryer. Allow the pockets to remain unzipped, so the bag can dry thoroughly and evenly.


Make sure the backpack is completely dry before the next use or storing it away. Leaving the bag wet can increase the chances of mold growing on the bag.

Turn on your washer.",How to Use a Washing Machine," Most clothes are machine washable, but always check the tag for further instructions. Some clothes might shrink if you use warm or hot water to wash. Some might be able to handle bleach and some might not. And some garments can't be washed in a machine, such as certain silks and delicates. Always check the label carefully.


Put aside clothes that are labeled as ""hand wash only"" or ""dry clean only"".
In most shirts, clothing care labels are located on the inside left side of the shirt or inside the neck area.
In most pants, clothing care labels are located on the inside of the back of the pants.;
, Dyes in clothes, especially pieces that are new, lose their colour during a wash. The colour can bleed onto other clothes and damage your entire load. When you sort your laundry by ""colour"", this usually means differentiating them by shade. The most basic way to sort your clothes is to separate your darks from lights and wash them separately. You can even sort them more thoroughly by colour.



Darks include colours such as blacks, greys, dark blues, dark reds, and dark purples.

Lights include pastel colours like whites, pinks, yellows, light blues, light greens, and lavender.

Jeans or dark denims especially bleed their colour and should be washed in their own separate load.

, Additionally or alternatively, you can protect your clothes from wear and tear in the washing machine by sorting heavier fabrics from lighter weight fabrics. Most washing machines spin and toss clothes around, and the extra aggravation from heavy fabrics might ruin lightweight fabrics. As well, if you're washing a delicate or lightweight load, the cycle's settings and temperature will be different from a heavier fabric load.


Delicates like lingerie, pantyhose, and washable silks should be washed separately.Heavy fabrics include items such as heavy cotton pants, bath towels, jackets, or sweaters.
If you choose to sort only by fabric, you can save a lot of energy and money from having to wash multiple colour loads.

, Instead of washing delicates separately, you can place delicates into mesh wash bags to protect them from harsh wear and tear. Mesh wash bags can come in various sizes but generally are used to protect only one or a few pieces of garments. They can be washed together with a normal load.









Mesh wash bags don't protect garments from colours bleeding, so be sure to wash them with similarly coloured loads. In most cases, delicates will not bleed and would be safe to wash with a light coloured load.

, Some stains need special treatment before you can put the garment into the wash. The most popular stains that need pre-treatment are grease and oil stains.









Avoid washing or drying stained clothing in the machine. Certain stains set when heat is added, making them difficult to remove.

, Wash cycles consist of two important speeds: a speed at which it agitates or tumbles the clothes with water, and a speed that spins the water out of the clothes.Depending on what you're washing, the wash cycle you choose should match what kind of fabric you're washing to help maximize cleanliness while also protecting your clothes.



Normal Cycle: This cycle goes with a fast/fast approach -- it tumbles fast and spins fast. It helps with cleaning very dirty and sweaty clothes, and is what you will most likely use on a regular basis. Sturdy fabrics like cotton, linen, denim, towels, and bedding do quite well in a normal cycle.

Permanent or Perm Press: This cycle goes with a fast/slow approach. These fabrics need fast agitation to be clean but a slow spin to prevent wrinkles. Use this cycle for synthetic fibres like rayons, knits, polyesters, and acetates. Synthetic fibres are known to pill, or create small balls of fibre and slow spin cycles help prevent pilling.

Delicate Cycle: This cycle uses a slow/slow approach, reducing agitation and preventing wear and tear. However, the level of cleanliness decreases with its slow tumbling. This cycle is best used for specific or special garments like lingerie, sequinned clothing, laced or loosely woven fabrics, or items made of sheer fabrics like pantyhose.

Special cycles: Newer models of washing machines have special cycles that do things such as sanitize, steam, or claim to protect whites and remove stains. Consult your machine's manual for further explanations on what each special cycle does.

, In theory, the hotter the water, the cleaner the clothes. Hot water sanitizes and kills germs better, dissolves detergents more effectively, and removes built up grime so clothes look brighter and cleaner. However, in some cases, hot water can shrink clothes, fade fabrics, set certain stains in, and can be quite expensive for your energy bill.So choose a water temperature that your fabrics can stand but also what you can afford for the best results.


Use cool water in the delicate cycle for delicate items, items that have dyes that might bleed, or clothes that aren't especially dirty.
Use warm water in the permanent press cycle, dark colours, and moderately dirty loads.
Use hot water for bath and kitchen towels, bedding, sturdy fabrics, or any extremely dirtied items.
Cold water is the most energy efficient way of washing clothes. About 90 percent of energy used in hot washing cycles is used to heat up the water.It is also the most gentlest way of washing your garments.
For some machines, the water temperature is already preset according to what cycle you choose. For example, a normal cycle will most likely use hot water that is 30 °C or 40 °C (85 °F to 75 °F).

, It's important to read your washer's manual and find out what type of detergent your machine can handle and also where to put the detergent. Most machines these days can handle liquid and power detergents, as well as other cleaning agents like bleach.









Front-loading washing machines usually have a drawer to dispense detergent and will have separate compartments to place fabric softener or bleach. Your machine will dispense the detergents at the right moment for you.
Top-loading washing machines require you to pour the detergent right into the drum before you start your cycle. It's best to add your detergents before you load your clothes so the high concentration of detergent doesn't stain or damage your clothes. And in some cases, it's best to turn on the water so the detergent dissolves before you load your clothes in.
The amount of detergent needed varies by brand of detergent and type of washer, so check the back of the detergent box and also look for any labels on your washing machine to find out how much to use.

, This is pretty simple – just dump your clothes in, but be careful not to overcrowd your clothes. You need space for your garments to move and clean themselves. Some machines may even have options to indicate whether your load is small, medium, or heavy. This option adjusts the water levels within your wash cycle according to the size of the load.


Small loads fill about a third (1/3) of your machine.
Medium loads fill half (1/2) of your machine.
Large loads fill three fourths (3/4) of your machine.

, Ah, sweet success, now all you have to do is hit that on button and you're ready to go! But remember to close the door!

Fill a sink with lukewarm water.,
Mix in baby shampoo or conditioner.,
Soak the clothing in your soapy water.,
Wring dry.,
Squeeze extra moisture out between two towels.,
Stretch the clothes out and hold them in place.,
Let air dry.",How to Unshrink Clothes1," Fill your laundry sink or a bucket with at least 1 quart (1 L) of lukewarm water.


Note that knitted clothes, like cotton, wool, and cashmere, respond to this tactic better than fabrics with tight weaves, like silk, rayon, or polyester.
The water should be roughly room temperature if not a little warmer. Do not use hot or cold water.;
, For every 1 quart (1 L) of water, mix in roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of baby shampoo or gentle hair conditioner, stirring it into the water until the water takes on a slick, soapy consistency.








Baby shampoo and conditioner can relax the fibers of your shrunken clothes. As the fibers are relaxed, they become easier to stretch and manipulate, meaning that you will be able to stretch the garment back to an appropriate size.

, Immerse the shrunken garment in your soapy solution, making sure that it is completely covered.









Let soak for 30 minutes or so.
If desired, you can begin gently stretching the garment underwater as it soaks, but this is not strictly necessary.

, Remove the garment from your soapy solution and roll it into a ball, squeezing firmly to wring out excess moisture.








Do not rinse the garment. The soapy water needs to continue actively relaxing the fibers as you work on stretching and re-shaping the garment.

, Lay a large towel out flat and place the garment on top of it. Gradually roll up the towel with the garment still inside.









The clothing should soak inside the towel for about 10 minutes. When done, it should be damp but no longer wet., Unroll the towel and transfer the garment onto a second flat, dry towel. Gently stretch the garment back into its proper shape and hold the shape in place by securing the edges with heavy objects.









For a more accurate gauge of the size and shape your garment must be, you can trace the outline of a similar, properly fitting garment onto a large piece of parchment paper. Place the garment you are trying to ""unshrink"" over this outline and stretch it to fit the marks.
If you have a hard time stretching the clothing out because it seems too stiff, use steam from an iron to make the garment easier to manipulate.
Possible weights for holding the stretched garment in place include paperweights, books, and coffee mugs.
If you do not have any heavy objects nearby, you could use clothes pins to pin the damp clothes to the towel, instead.

, Allow the wet clothing to continue drying flat until the remaining moisture has left.


If you have your clothes pinned to the towel instead of weighed down, you could place your clothes on a hanger and let them hang dry in a sunny, dry location. The gravity can help stretch the garment out further.
If this tactic produces some change but not enough, you could repeat it multiple times until the garment is sufficiently stretched out.

Fill a sink with lukewarm water.,
Mix in Borax or vinegar.,
Soak the clothing in the solution.,
Wring dry.,
Stuff the garment with dry towels.,
Toss the garment around.,
Let air dry.",How to Unshrink Clothes2," Fill you laundry sink or a bucket with at least 1 quart (1 L) of lukewarm water.


This method is generally recommended for wool and cashmere. Other knitted fabrics, like cotton, may also respond to this method, but synthetics and tightly-knit natural materials should not be treated with this method.
The water should be roughly room temperature if not a little warmer. Do not use hot or cold water.

, Add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) Borax for every 1 quart (1 L) of water. Alternatively, mix in 1 part white wine vinegar for every 2 parts water, or 1/2 quart (1/2 L) for every 1 quart (1 L) of water.









Borax is a wool relaxant, so it naturally relaxes the fibers of wool garments, making them easier to manipulate and stretch.Vinegar, too, is thought to have the capability of relaxing cloth fibers. White wine vinegar is generally preferred since it is clear and gentler than white distilled vinegar, but any clear vinegar can be substituted., Immerse the clothing in the soaking solution and let sit for a full 25 minutes.









If your clothing has become severely shrunken, you may want to consider gently stretching the garment while it sits in the solution after the first 25 minutes pass. Gently pull the clothing to begin stretching the fibers, then let soak undisturbed for another 10 to 25 minutes.

, Remove the garment from your solution and roll it into a ball, squeezing firmly to wring out excess moisture.









Do not rinse the garment. The soaking solution needs to continue actively relaxing the fibers as you work on stretching and re-shaping the garment.

, Roll dry towels into bunches and stuff them into the garment until the clothing item is roughly the same size and shape as it originally was.








Use as many rolled up towels as needed to create a smooth outline. If the clothing is lumpy after you put the towels inside of it, the fibers may stretch out in an equally lumpy manner, and the result will be a sweater that has been ""unshrunk"" but one that looks less-than-flattering on you.
The towels will also help absorb the excess water, causing the garment to dry faster.

, Shake or bang the garment around with the bundled towels inside for 10 to 15 minutes to help stretch the fabric further.








, Place a hanger inside the garment and hang it with the towels still inside. Let it finish drying in this manner.


If this tactic produces some change but not enough, you could repeat it multiple times until the garment is sufficiently stretched out.

"
"
Fill the bathtub with lukewarm water.,
Slip your jeans on.,
Step into the water.,
Keep the jeans on for an hour or so.Move around as much as possible to help stretch the fibers out.,
Remove the jeans and hang dry.",How to Unshrink Clothes3," Fill the tub at least 1/3 full, or with enough water to cover your legs when you sit inside of it.


The water should be comfortable enough to sit in. Warmer water is better, but avoid steaming hot water or cold water.
If you do not have a bathtub available to you, you can still stretch out your jeans. Fill up a sink with warm to hot water, instead.

, Put the shrunken jeans on. Zipper and button them if you are able to do so.









If the jeans do not zipper or button, or if the waistband has become too shrunken, place the jeans on and leave them unzipped.
If you cannot put the jeans on, do not have a bathtub available to use, or otherwise plan to use the sink method instead of the bathtub method, do not put your jeans on yet.

, Soak in the lukewarm bathwater with the jeans on until well drenched.









You will need to sit in the bathtub for 10 minutes or so to make sure that the jeans are thoroughly soaked.
Be careful as you get out of the tub to avoid accidentally slipping due to the additional weight of the heavy, wet denim.
If you could not zip up your jeans before hopping in the tub, try zipping them back up while in the tub. If the fibers cannot be relaxed enough to zip while wet, it may not be possible to return your jeans to the way they were before/
If you are using the sink method, let the jeans soak in the sink for 10 to 15 minutes. Take them out and slip them on afterward.

,









Take a walk or jog, dance, stretch, or do whatever you can to stretch the fabric as you wear it. Focus on areas that are in special need of being stretched. For instance, if the waist needs to be ""unshrunk"" more than anything else, make sure that your movements include plenty of stretching and bending at the waist.

, Place your dripping wet jeans on a clothes line or drying rack and allow the jeans to finish drying.


The gravity pulling down on the heavy, wet denim can help stretch the jeans out vertically.

Clean up.,
Wait for the stain to dry.",How to Stain Brick," Splash a cup of water onto the brick. If the water beads up and runs off, your brick cannot be stained.It may have a coat of sealant applied, or it may be a non-absorbent type of brick. See the next step for more information.;
, If the brick surface does not absorb water, you may need to remove a sealant. This process will not always work, and may cause discoloration. Try the following method:Apply lacquer thinner to a small area and let sit for ten minutes.
Wipe off and test with water again. If it is absorbed, use lacquer thinner on the whole area.
If the water is not absorbed, try again with a commercial brick or concrete sealer stripper.
If the commercial stripper does not work, staining is not possible. Paint over the brick instead.

, Saturate the brick with water first, so it cannot absorb cleaning solution. Scrub with a dilute, mild detergent from the top down to remove mildew, stains, and dirt. Rinse thoroughly from the top down, then let dry completely.Heavily discolored bricks may require chemical brick cleaners, but these can damage the brick or mortar, or interfere with the stain. Look for gentle options, and avoid unbuffered muriatic acid in particular.
If you are treating a large surface, hire a trained operator to pressure wash the surface. Unskilled pressure washing can permanently scar bricks.

, If possible, find a hardware store that will let you test samples of the stains before purchasing. If ordering online, find a kit that includes multiple colors, so you can mix them to experiment with the right shade. Choose from the following types:


Water-based brick stains are recommended for most purposes. They are easy to apply and allow the brick to ""breathe,"" preventing water buildup.
Stains pre-mixed with sealant create a watertight coat on the bricks. This can actually make water damage worse in many situations.Use these only for small areas with extreme water exposure, or very porous, damaged bricks., Wear gloves, old clothes, and safety glasses.Use painter's tape to seal off areas you do not intend to stain, such as window sills, door frames, etc.


You do not need to seal the mortar lines between bricks, as long as you're careful during application.
Stay near a bucket of water or a sink so you can quickly rinse spills. If spilled on skin, rinse with soapy water. If spilled on eyes, flush for ten minutes.

, The brick surface should be completely dry and clean. Exterior brick surfaces should not be stained during windy weather, to avoid dripping and uneven drying. Some stains should not be applied in cold or hot weather, as described on the label.


Temperature is usually only a concern at cold and hot extremes. Depending on product, minimum temperatures range from 25 to 40ºF (-4 to +4ºC). Maximum temperature is typically around 110ºF (43ºC).

, Read instructions on the stain container carefully. Typically, the user mixes the stain with water before using. Measure out the amount of water carefully to get a consistent color. Stir thoroughly in a figure eight pattern.


Use a disposable container that you can easily fit your brush into.
When in doubt, add less stain to the water. It's easy to add more concentrated color later, but difficult to lighten a stain once it's been applied.
If you are mixing multiple colors together, record the exact amounts of each color you mix, so you can repeat the recipe for the next batch.

, Try out the stain on a corner of the wall or a spare brick. Let it dry completely so you see how this mixture looks. Refer to the steps below for application instructions.


Repeat this step each time you try a new mixture. Stains are permanent, so it's worth taking the time to find a color you prefer. If you cannot find a suitable color, ask for help from the store that sold you the stain kit.

, Use an ordinary paintbrush, about as wide as a single brick. Dip it into the stain, then press it against the side of the container nearest to you to drain excess stain. Don't use the side of the container opposite you, or splashes could hit the wall.If you are nervous about dripping on the brick, practice the technique using plain water. A water-based stain has the same consistency.
For very large surfaces, use a roller or sprayer instead. These methods give you much less control and will stain the mortar as well.

, For brick-and-mortar structures, run the brush along a single brick in one smooth motion. For brick pavers or other brick surfaces with no material between them, brush on in overlapping strokes, covering each surface twice. In either case, immediately touch up minor gaps with the corner of the brush.


Pull the brush toward the direction of the hand you are using (left to right for right-handed people)., Dip and drain the brush after every 3rd or 4th stroke, or when you notice it's leaving a less even layer of stain. Stir each time to keep the color even.Do not dip the brush partway through a single brick unless absolutely necessary.

, If you stain the bricks in a row, you may get darker or lighter color at one end, when you reach the bottom of your stain container. Make these slight differences look natural by painting bricks in a scattered pattern.

, Drips can leave darker streaks that are difficult to remove once set. Wipe them up with a damp rag immediately. Drain the brush against the side of the container to prevent more drips.


If you accidentally stain the mortar and can't wipe it all off, scrape off the color gently with an old screwdriver or other metal tool., If you plan to stain the mortar, use a narrow brush that can fit inside the mortar lines. Using a different color is recommended for aesthetic reasons.

, Wash all tools promptly to avoid dry residue. Dispose of your stain container and excess stain according to the safety label.

, Drying time varies significantly with temperature, humidity, and product.Good air flow across the brick's surface will speed this up.

Hard boil two or more eggs.,
Use tongs to place the eggs in a plastic bag.,
Mash your eggs into pieces.,
Place your copper objects on a small dish.,
Put the dish inside the bag and seal it closed.,
Check regularly to see if the desired appearance has been reached.",How to Oxidize Copper1," Two or three eggs should be plenty unless you have a large amount of copper to oxidize. Place them with their shells intact in a pot of water and bring to a boil for at least ten minutes. Don't worry about over-boiling them. In fact, that over-done greenish ring and sulfur smell is exactly what you need, since the sulfur will alter the appearance of your copper.;
, Transfer the eggs into a plastic bag, preferably one that can be sealed, such as a ziploc. Use tongs or another utensil to pick up the eggs, since they will be hot. If you don't have a bag that can fit your copper object comfortably, use Tupperware, a bucket, or any other container that can be sealed shut or have a lid placed over it. Large containers will require a large amount of eggs.


Ideally, your container should be transparent so you can check on the appearance of your copper without having to open the container.

, Seal the bag halfway closed before you begin to avoid spraying egg through the opening. Hit the eggs through the plastic bag with a spoon, the base of a cup, or any heavy object. Crush the shell, white, and yolk until it is mashed into many pieces.


Don't seal the bag all the way, or the air pocket will make it difficult to break the egg.

, This will prevent them from coming into contact with the eggs. Besides letting you avoid washing the egg off afterward, this will also prevent spots where the egg touches the metal., Place the dish containing your copper object inside the plastic bag. It does not matter whether it is near the mashed up egg pieces, as long as they are not touching the copper. Seal or tie the bag closed to trap the sulfur fumes inside, or attach the lid if you are using a container. The bag will expand due to the heat of the eggs, but this shouldn't be enough to break most plastic bags.

, You may start to see results as soon as 15 minutes after you put the copper in the bag, but the copper often takes 4–8 hours to reach a dark brown appearance.The copper should grow darker the longer it remains in the bag, and large surfaces will acquire an aged, uneven appearance. Remove when you've achieved the look you were going for.


Wash the copper item afterward to remove any pieces of egg and to see what the item looks like when clean.

Learn the pros and cons.,
Clean the concrete base.,
Cover the floor in plastic sheeting.,
Line walls and pillars with compressible material.,
Reinforce the screed.,
Screed the floor.",How to Screed a Floor1," An unbonded screed sits on top of plastic sheets instead of directly on the concrete below. This protects your floor from moisture in the subfloor, and from settling and other issues in the main structure. However, unbonded screed is more likely to curl. Reinforcing can help with this problem, as described below.


Due to the risk of curling, an unbonded screed should be at least 50mm (2"") thick at all points. This means pouring a layer at least 70mm (2.75"") thick to allow for variations on the sublayer.;
, Remove all dust and grease from the concrete before you begin the project.

, Lay down polyethylene or PVC sheets to separate the concrete from the screed layer. Overlap sheets by at least 20 cm (7.9"") and tape them together. Fold the sheets up 10 cm (3.9"") onto all walls and pillars.

, This protects these surfaces from damage when the screed shrinks. You may use edging foam, 20mm (0.8"") kingspan insulation, or 1 cm (2.5"") polystyrene., Unbonded screed is at greater risk of micro cracks, which reduce its strength. Reduce this risk with one of the following approaches:Mix polypropylene fibers into the screed mix before adding water (or order ready-to-use screed with polypropylene already added).
Alternatively, position crack control steel mesh over your subfloor so it will sit in the top half of your screed.
If you do not plan to reinforce unbonded screed, it's a good idea to make the screed at least 100mm (3.9"") thick.Screed this thick suffers from moisture issues, so consult a contractor about alternative mixes., Once your workspace is ready, skip down to the section below to see instructions for mixing and applying the screed.

Remove the crucible once the silver has melted.,
Skim the slag off of your sliver.,
Pour the silver into the mold, quickly.,
Dump your silver out of the mold.,
Quench your silver.",How to Melt Silver," You need to find some items to melt down. Luckily, although silver is considered a rare metal, it is fairly common in our day-to-day activities. Some of the most common uses for silver are jewelry, although we can still find a substantial amount of silver coins, as well as silver in industrial applications.


Traditional uses for silver include creating coins, jewelry, decorative items and cutlery. These items are most commonly used when melting silver.
Industrial uses of silver include batteries, ball bearings, soldering or brazing other metal items, as an industrial catalyst to create chemicals, and in electronics such as circuit boards, membrane switches, and television screens. Be careful when melting anything that might contain hazardous materials.
Emerging technologies which utilize silver include medical, solar energy, and water purification. Silver minimizes bacterial growth by interrupting the ability of the bacteria to form chemical bonds and is used to prevent the spread of bacteria and to promote healing.;
, A foundry crucible is a container that is used for metal production. Crucibles are made of clay, aluminum, graphite, and silicon carbide. They are extremely heat resistant and will not melt under the same circumstances as the metal you are trying to melt down.


Make sure you get a crucible that is an appropriate size for your project and is in good shape. Avoid old crucibles with cracks or excessive wear.
You will use your crucible to store your silver as it melts and turns into its molten form.
You will then poor the molten silver out of the crucible into a cast or mold.
You can purchase a foundry crucible at a local casting supply store or at many online retailers., Crucible tongs will be used to move your crucible if you need to. These are an important element, because your crucible will be way too hot for you to touch it with your hands or even with gloves. Make sure:


Your tongs are rated to be used with a crucible.
Your tongs are in good working order.
Your tongs are large enough to move your crucible.
Purchase your crucible tongs at local hardware or metal casting stores or online., You should get yourself a good graphite stir rod. You’ll use the stir rod to stir your molten silver and to make sure that it is completely melted before you cast it in a mold.


Make sure you get one that is rated properly.
Make sure you buy one that is long enough for whatever level of melting you’ll be doing.
Purchase your graphite stir rod at a local casting supply shop or online.

, The furnace or torch is what you’ll be using to heat your silver to its melting point. As such, the furnace or blow torch are critical items in melting silver. Depending on the amount of melting you’ll be doing, you can choose between a furnace or torch. Consider:


A furnace might be prohibitively expensive if you are only doing small-scale melting like several ounces every couple of weeks. However, if you're doing projects every weekend or more often, you should consider a furnace.
A blow torch might be inefficient if you are melting substantial amounts of silver.
If you are starting out, you might want to start with a blow torch and then move up to a furnace once you are committed to melting silver.
These items may be purchased from a metal casting supplier, specialty hardware stores, or online., Molds and casts will be the way you shape your molten silver to create a final product. As a result, they are critical for your silver melting operation. Consider:


Molds and casts can be made from wood, certain alloys, ceramic, or clay.
Molds and casts may be one of the most inexpensive of your supplies.
You can make your own molds or casts or buy them from specialty casting stores in your community or from online retailers.
To make your mold: pick a material and like wood or clay. Carve or shape your material to the size and using the detail desire. If you're using ceramic or clay, you'll need to fire them at temps over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit or 537 degrees Celsius., Melting silver, or any other metal for that fact, is potentially very dangerous. You need to get yourself some good safety equipment to protect yourself. Remember to take lots of care when you melt silver, and do not do so unless you are properly protected. Make sure to get:


Industrial-grade goggles that are rated to protect against molten metal.
Industrial-grade gloves rated to protect against molten metal.
Industrial-grade apron rated to protect against molten metal.
Industrial-grade face shield rated to protect against molten metal.
You can purchase safety equipment from metal casting supply shops or from online retailers., Before you even start the process of melting and molding your silver, you need to take out and put on all of your safety gear. Melting any type of metal is a very dangerous activity, so there is no reason to take any chances.


Put on your goggles, your gloves, your apron, and your face shield.
Take out your skimming rod and any other materials you'll need during the process.
Inform family or roommates about what you're doing and lock up any dogs or other pets in an area far from your smelting workshop.

, The first thing you need to do is to put your silver in the crucible and place it on or in your furnace. This will vary depending on the type of furnace you have. You don’t want to heat up your furnace and then place your crucible inside, as this will increase the chance of you hurting yourself.

, The first thing you need to do is heat your furnace to the appropriate temperature. Depending on what type of furnace you have, this might take a little or a lot of time. Consider:


The melting point of silver is 1763 degrees Fahrenheit or 961.8 degrees Celsius.
Monitor the temperature inside your furnace as it heats. Most furnaces include a temperature gauge to help you monitor it. If not, have one installed.
Don’t remove the silver until it is completely melted.
Only use your furnace outside or in an extremely well-ventilated area designed for foundry work., If you’re using a smaller crucible and are melting on a smaller scale, you might have chosen to use a blow torch to melt your silver. If this is the case, take your blow torch and apply it to the silver. Keep your torch on the silver and it will slowly heat the silver up.









Make sure you know how to use your blow torch before you start to melt your silver.
Direct the flame directly at the silver item.
Temperature will be difficult to monitor with a blow torch. However, many blow torches come with a temp. gauge attached. If you don't have one, just wait for the silver to melt completely.
The amount of time it takes to melt the silver will depend, based on the alloy composition, as well as the size of the object.
Break large silver objects into smaller pieces and melt them in small batches to allow a more even distribution of heat which results in a quicker melting process.
For more on melting silver with a blow torch, see: http://www.danielicaza.com/2011/03/first-entry-how-to-cast-ingot-fine.html, Once your silver is melted, you’re going to need to remove your crucible from the furnace (if that’s what you’ve used), and get ready to cast your molten silver. Be careful doing this, as it is potentially dangerous. Make sure to:


Put on your gloves.
Take your heat resistant tongs and grip the crucible.
Place the crucible next to your cast or mold.
Make sure you wear shoes and your other safety equipment.
If you’re using a blow torch, take your tongs and move the crucible next to the mold you’ll be using. , Using your graphite stir rod or another tool, skim the slag off the top of your molten silver. Slag is impurities and other materials that have separated from the silver during the melting process. Slag might be a result of non-silver items being melted with silver, or it may be the result of the silver having impurities in it. Regardless of the reason, always skim and remove your slag before you pour and cast your silver.


Take your rod and gently and evening slide it over the top of the molten silver.
Then slide the flat side of your rod underneath the slag and lift it out of the silver.
Place your slag someone safe, as you might want to melt it again to remove excess silver., Once you’ve removed the crucible from the furnace, and sat it next to your mold, you should quickly pour the molten silver into the mold. You need to do this quickly while the silver is still liquid. Don’t move too quickly, as you don’t want to spill the silver or hurt yourself. If the silver does begin to firm up into solid state, just put it back into the furnace to heat it back up.









Melted silver can be poured directly into molds, or casts, to create a number of items including jewelry, decorative items, cutlery, tableware, and containers.
Pour very carefully and slowly so that you get all of the silver into the cast or mold and that you get the proper shape and angles that you want.
Depending on the size of your silver casting project, you may need to utilize centrifugal force to allow the silver to reach all areas of the cast.
Wait for your silver to cool and harden., Wait a few minutes for your silver to cool. This could take from 2 minutes to 20 minutes depending on the size and depth of your silver. Ultimately, judging when to dump your silver is an art and depends on a number of factors including the type of mold. In the end, you'll learn by trial and error, but consider:









Depending on your mold, it might be better to wait longer and having to break your mold instead of recasting the silver.
Once the silver appears dry, give it another minute for the interior to cool off a little more.
When dumping your silver, make sure you are wearing hand safety mitts, your apron, and even head gear. This will protect you from splash back if you do empty the mold too early.
Pick up your mold and bang it on a hard surface. It should come right out., After you've dumped your silver out of the mold, you'll need to quench your silver. Quenching is the process in which silver is cooled and hardened by being submerged in water. This is the final stage of smelting silver.


Take your tongs and pick up the silver bar or item.
Slowly submerge the silver in clean/distilled water.
As you submerge it, the water around the silver will boil and will produce steam.
Leave the silver submerged for several moments -- until the boiling and steam have subsided.
Remove your silver from the water and enjoy!"

Scrub the copper item with an abrasive pad and water.,
Clean the copper piece with a mild dish detergent and rinse the soap off thoroughly.,
Prepare a solution according to the color you want to achieve.,
Place your copper item outdoors or in an indoor area with good ventilation before treating it with the solution.,
Spray the copper piece at least twice a day.",How to Oxidize Copper2," Stroke the copper item in a linear motion to give the metal an even grain so the patina will be smooth and not patchy. You may skip this step or experiment with cleaning portions of the copper if you are trying to create an art piece with a contrasting new and aged appearance.

, Remove soap, oils and film from the copper. Wipe and pat the copper item dry with a soft cloth.

, There are many possible solutions you can use to oxidize copper, depending on the final color you are trying to achieve. Several are listed here using common household items or items available at a drug or grocery store.


Warning: always wear rubber gloves and work in a ventilated area when handling ammonia. Safety glasses and a respirator mask are recommended. Be ready to wash your skin or eyes with running water for fifteen minutes in case of spills.
To create a green patina, mix 2 cups (480 mL) white vinegar, 1.5 cups (360 mL) pure non-detergent ammonia, and 0.5 cups (120 mL) salt. Mix in a plastic spray bottle until the salt dissolves. Use less salt to reduce the amount of green in the patina.For a brown patina, mix baking soda in a spray bottle full of hot water until additional baking soda will not dissolve.You may buy a commercial antiquing solution and follow the instructions on the packaging to achieve the desired color. Liver of Sulphur is commonly used for copper., Spread newspapers underneath it to protect the surface it is standing on from spills.

, Spray the copper with the solution and wait an hour to see if it develops. If it has, you can continue to spray hourly, focusing on portions where the patina didn't hold. Otherwise, spray twice a day until the patina becomes visible. Leave it outside during this time to speed up the oxidization.


If you want to have more control over exactly where and how the patina forms, scrub with a scotch brite pad, brass brush, or cotton swab after spraying.Wear gloves and safety glasses for this if your solution contains ammonia, acids or other dangerous chemicals.
If you are in a low humidity area, place a plastic bag or sheet over the item to keep in moisture. Use a frame or drape it between larger objects so the plastic does not come in contact with the copper."

Understand bonded screed.,
Roughen the surface of the concrete.,
Remove all dust and grease.,
Apply a bonding agent to the concrete.,
Screed the floor.",How to Screed a Floor2," Bonding screed to the concrete base reduces the risk of cracking or curling. The concrete must be strong and uncracked.This approach is best for thin layers of screed:A screed layer 35mm (1.4"") thick is ideal, if the concrete base is flat enough to ensure the screed is at least 25mm (1"") thick at all points.
If the concrete is not flat to those tolerances, add screed 40mm (1.6"") thick instead.
Increasing the thickness beyond this requires modifications to the mix to prevent debonding.

, You must expose the aggregate in the concrete so it can bond with the screed. You can do this by hand using a chipping hammer or pick, or rent a floor scabbler or shot blaster.Make sure the entire surface is roughened, and no paint or other material remains on the surface.


Wear respiratory protection to protect against silica dust., Vacuum up all dust and debris, sprinkling with water to reduce airborne particles.Remove grease stains if present.

, Two common options are a slurry made from PVA glue, water, and cement; or SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber), which is recommended for areas that will be exposed to water.Follow instructions on your product label to prepare the concrete and apply. Alternatively, you can make your own cement bonding agent. This doesn't require any special ingredients, but it can fail to bond if you don't work quickly and accurately:Dampen the cement the day before and let stand at least four hours. Remove all excess water, then wait until the surface looks dry.
Mix sand-cement grout (in a 1:1 ratio). Add enough water to form a slurry the consistency of PVA paint.
Stir continuously and apply within 30 minutes of mixing.
Do not delay before adding the screed. If the grout dries, the screed will not bond.

, You are now ready to mix and add the screed. Continue on to the next section below.

"
"
Purchase or mix your screed.,
Divide your floor into sections.,
Apply a compact layer of screed to the farthest section.,
Level the screed with a straightedge.,
Repeat until the floor is complete.,
Finish the concrete.,
Cure the screed.,
Wait for the floor to dry.",How to Screed a Floor3," Many people choose to order ready-to-use screed mix, which contains additives that slow down the setting so you do not have to work as quickly.If you would prefer to mix your own, try this simple recipe:


Select clean sand with a variety of grain sizes.
Combine 4 parts sand with 1 part Portland cement.(A standard Type I or Type II A cement is fine.)
For greater strength, replace 1 part sand with aggregate.Avoid grain sizes above 10mm (0.4"") to reduce cracking.Add water slowly until you can form the mix into a ball, then break it into clumps without water escaping., Professional sometimes make their own dividers using the screed mix itself, but it's much easier to use a timber batten for a DIY project. Use the straightest battens you can find, and cut them to the eventual height of the screed layer. Follow these steps:Lay down about 3 cm (1.2"") of screed to keep the battens in place.
Wet the batten so you can remove it more easily after screeding.
Set the battens down to divide the room into strips 3 to 4 meters (10–13 ft) wide. The length of each strip is not important.Use a spirit level to confirm that each batten is level along the top, and level with adjacent battens in the room.

, Dump screed onto the section farthest from the entrance, using enough to fill about 60 cm (2 ft) length of the strip.Spread it out with a trowel, compacting as you go by ""chopping"" it down with a screed board (straightedge), and by tamping the edges with a hand tamper.Poor compaction is one of the most common problems with a home screeding job.For best results, rent a vibrating screed board or other compacting tool.
Apply each batch of screed within 45 minutes of mixing., Once you have laid enough screed, place a screed board or a very straight piece of lumber over the battens. Push the straightedge across the surface of the screed in a side-to-side sawing motion. Tilt the lumber slightly so the corner forms a cutting edge to make the screed level.

, Trowel on, compact, and level the screed in stages until the first section is filled, then move on to the next. Once you have two sections filled, remove the batten between them and fill in the gap. Continue until you have screeded the whole floor.


If you cannot screed the floor in one day, install day joints at the edge of the screed.

, It's a good idea to bull float the screed right away to remove imperfections. Float a second time once the concrete has stopped bleeding and excess water has evaporated (or after you have removed it).For final finishing instructions, refer to your flooring manufacturer or use these suggestions:To create a textured finish, swirl a wood float in an arced motion across the surface. This works well under ceramic tiles and carpets.
For a smooth finish, use the same motion with a steel trowel instead, held flat against the surface. This works well under vinyl tiles.

, One way to cure the screed is to place it under polyethylene sheeting, sealed at the edges. Leave the screed undisturbed for at least 7 days, or longer if average temperatures fall below 10ºC (50ºF) in a 24 hour period., Even after curing, your screed will need time to dry. Avoid vehicle traffic and do not install floor for at least three weeks. As a rough rule of thumb, the screed takes one day to dry for each mm (0.04"") of depth.If you are bonding ceramic or stone tiles, terrazzo, or synthetic resin floor to the screed, cut stress relief joints every 5–6 meters (16.4–19.7 ft), in straight vertical lines halfway through the screed. You can do this with a trowel now, but it may be easier to align with the tiles if you wait until the screed hardens and cut joints with a saw (within 3–4 weeks)."

Consider the chance of lead.,
Check for nails and staples.,
Rent a drum sander.,
Install coarse grit sandpaper onto the sander.,
Practice on a hidden area.,

Sand at a slight angle to the grain.,
Move constantly as you sand.,
Continue until most of the floor is sanded.,

Finish certain floors with 100 grit paper.,
Use an edge sander.,
Start with 36-grit.,
Sand in a clockwise zigzag pattern.,
Repeat with finer sandpaper.,
Vacuum up the dust.",How to Sand Hardwood Floors," Many older homes contain lead in the floor finishes. This practice ended in 1978 in the US, the 1990's in Canada and Australia, and the 1920's or earlier for most other Western countries.If your house was built before the ban in your country, consider hiring a floor finisher with lead certification to test your floor and refinish it safely. If you do decide to sand an old floor yourself, take these precautions:Cover vents, doorways, and light fixtures with plastic sheeting. This is not a bad idea for any sanding job, to make dust cleanup easier.
Attach a HEPA-filter vacuum to the sander. A ""dust free"" setup is not actually dust free, but it helps.
Wear a HEPA-filter respirator and old clothes. Do not wear the clothes outside the work area.
Keep pregnant women and children out of the house until the day's work is done and the area has been vacuumed with a HEPA-vac or wet/dry vac.;
, Hammer in any nails that are sticking up. Remove any staples or metal fasteners from old flooring. These can tear the sandpaper on your machine., Ideally, find a rental store that will teach you how to use it. Check that the drum sander's rear wheel is tight, and that the drum stands flat or nearly flat on the floor. Blow out any dust from the machine before adding sandpaper.If your floor is flat with no noticeable warp, you may use a standing orbital sander instead (not a handheld one). This is easier to use without damaging the floor, but it tends to take longer., Load the coarse sandpaper around the drum so it is perfectly aligned, securing the trailing end of the paper, then the leading end.Some sanders secure this with screws, while others have a snap bar and may require sandpaper shims. For most floors, 36-grit sandpaper is a good place to start. If your floor does not have serious damage and only has a thin layer of finish, you may be able to skip this step and start with 60-grit sandpaper instead.


You'll often need to even out the sandpaper by putting sandpaper shims in the drum's loading slot.
Cloth-backed sandpaper is more expensive, but less likely to tear on the drum machine., Choose a closet floor, or a spot that's normally covered by furniture. Lift the drum sander off the floor, and run it until it reaches full speed before lowering it.It will move immediately, so be prepared to start walking. Move at a steady pace, then lift the sander before you turn it off. Get the hang of this before you move to the rest of the floor. Turning the machine off or on while it is on the floor will leave a mark on your floor.


If you get dust clouds, stop and make sure the dust bag is properly attached. A respirator or at least a dust mask is a good idea in any case.
Eye and ear protection is also recommended.
If you see a tight repeating pattern of marks — ""chatter"" — there is likely something wrong with the machine. Make sure the sandpaper is loaded flat, the belt is not worn or compressed, and the parts are tightly assembled., Most machines are set up so one side of the drum is slightly lower than the other, and sands more aggressively. If this is the left side, start on the left wall. If this is the right side, start on the right wall.

, For the first stage of sanding, you can move at a 7 to 15 degree angle to the direction of the boards. This will help level slight variations in the floor. It also minimizes the chance of ""dish out"" or ""waves,"" when a loose or uneven floor gets sanded more in some spots than others., Sand the whole area at the same angle. Do not stay in one place, or the sander may eat through deeper than you intended. This coarse sanding should remove the old seal and level out uneven parts of the floor. Start at a brisk walking pace. If this doesn't seem to get through the old finish, slow down to a moderate pace.


This is not a major concern with orbital sanders, which are not powerful enough to cause immediate damage when they stop in one spot.

, When you get to the wall, move the sander back to your starting point and slightly to the side, overlapping your first pass. Walk to the wall and repeat until the whole area in front of your is sanded. If you need to go over one spot more than once, lift the lever for a moment as you reverse direction. This will briefly raise the drum off the ground, avoiding a mark on the ground where it reversed.If you are sanding a large room, you will likely need to replace the sandpaper at least once.
A drum sander cannot reach the edge of the wall. Just leave the edges unsanded for now — you'll use an edge sander for those areas later.

, There is now an unsanded area at one end of the room, where you stood at the beginning of each pass. Turn around and sand this area moving along the same angle as before.

, Let the dust settle, then clean it up with a professional vacuum designed for fine dust. When choosing a machine to rent, look for one with soft wheels that won't leave a dent in your unfinished floor.


Keep your respirator on until the dust is clear.
Empty the sander's dust bags when they get half full.

, By now your floor will be free of the old finish, but many scratches may still be visible. Load 60-grit sandpaper onto your drum sander to deal with this problem. Ideally, use aluminum oxide (ALO) sandpaper loaded with medium tension.Never skip directly from coarse sandpaper to fine, such as 36 to 80. This can leave deep scratches in your floor.

, At this stage it can be difficult to see how effective the sanding is. Try drawing light, zig-zag pencil marks across your floor. When the pencil marks have disappeared, you know you've sanded that area.You may use this technique on any of the finer grit sanding steps below as well.

, On your first pass you did a ""long run"" followed by a ""short run"" to fill in your starting point. Start from the opposite wall this time so your new ""long run"" and ""short run"" don't have the same dividing line. If you use the same pattern as before, that line may become visible, especially if you plan to stain the floor., Do not sand on the same diagonal path as the first sanding job, or you may end up with stripes on your floor. Sand directly along the boards instead. As before, vacuum up dust once this stage is finished.


Remember, never turn your sander on or off while it is in contact with the floor.

, This is easier and more effective with a floor buffer, but you can use a drum sander. This will remove the 60-grit scratches. Vacuum the floor again once you're done.

, This is only necessary if you plan on staining the floor, or if your floor is made from maple or birch. The 80-grit scratches are more noticeable on these surfaces., These handheld tools allow you to reach right against the edge of the wall.


If using an orbital sander, you probably already reached the walls. In this case, you can skip this section, and remove the finish at the corners with any handheld sander.

, For this small remaining area, you may be able to skip some of the steps you used on the whole floor. That said, you will need to start with a coarse grit to remove the old finish.

, Move the edge sander back and forth along the wall in small triangular movements. This is less likely to leave marks than a side-to-side motion. Most tools are designed so moving right (clockwise) along the wall is easier than the other direction., You can now skip straight to 80-grit sandpaper. Sand carefully until the edge matches the rest of the floor.


If you want to finish with 100-grit sandpaper, you'll need special techniques to avoid burning the floor and paper. You'll need a sander with a slow speed setting, and preferably an ""open coat"" sandpaper., Your floor is now ready to be stained and/or waxed. Try to keep dirt, abrasives, and heavy objects off the floor until it is finished.

Make your copper green and blue with Miracle Gro.,
Bury copper in white vinegar.,
Create a bright blue color using ammonia vapors and salt.",How to Oxidize Copper3," You can use concentrated Miracle Gro plant fertilizer to oxidize your copper quickly. Mix approximately one part Miracle Gro with three parts water for a bluer patina, or with red wine vinegar for a greener one.Apply with a spray bottle or rag, doing so unevenly if you want to create a more natural, aged appearance. It should develop a patina within 30 minutes, and reach a more permanent state within 24 hours.

, White vinegar can produce a green or blue patina on copper, but requires another material to hold the moisture close to the metal. Let the copper soak in a mixture of white vinegar and salt, or bury it in sawdust or even crushed potato chips, then soak the mixture with vinegar.Place in a sealed container for 2–8 hours, checking on the color regularly, then remove and air dry. Use a soft brush to gently remove solid materials.

, Fill a container 1/2 inch (1.25cm) deep with pure non-detergent ammonia, outdoors or in a well ventilated area. Spray the copper with saltwater, and place it above the level of the ammonia, on top of a wooden block. Cover the container and check back every hour or two until the copper is dark brown with blue hints.Remove from the bucket and air dry until a bright, blue color develops.



Warning: always wear gloves and safety glasses when handling ammonia. Do not use the container that held ammonia to hold food or water.
The more salt you use, the more noticeable the color will be.

Examine your home for signs of insect infestation.,
Place a suet woodpecker feeder near the outside of your home.,
Plant fruit trees and berry bushes.",How to Get Rid of Woodpeckers1," If woodpeckers repeatedly drum on your home, chances are they're doing so for good reason. Your home may be harboring an insect population, such as bees, ants, or termites, and providing an inviting atmosphere for woodpeckers. Taking action to remove the food your home is providing is the first step to getting rid of woodpeckers.


Go to your attic or the area of your house closest to where the woodpecker has been pecking. Look for dead insects lying on the windowsills and in corners. Check for bees' nests in the rafters. Look for loose, rotting wood both inside and outside the house. These are all signs of an insect infestation.
If you see signs of an insect infestation, take measures to get it treated right away. Use a natural method to get rid of the insects or call an exterminator to take care of the problem.;
, Woodpeckers like to feed on suet, which is made from the fat of a cow and is available for purchase at wild bird or pet stores. Hang the feeder well away from the ground so the suet doesn't get eaten by other creatures.
/images/thumb/8/81/Get-Rid-of-Woodpeckers-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Woodpeckers-Step-2-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/8/81/Get-Rid-of-Woodpeckers-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Rid-of-Woodpeckers-Step-2-Version-3.jpg









Place the feeder close to the place on your home where the woodpeckers tend to drum. They'll notice the suet and start feeding there instead.
Gradually move the feeder away from your home, a few feet each day, until it's well away from your house. Hopefully you will have trained the woodpeckers to feed on the suet, rather than drumming on your house.
Suet can melt in hot weather and coat birds' wings, damaging their plumage. Don't use suet during the hottest days of summer.
Keep the suet available throughout the fall, winter and spring months, when food is most scarce.

, Woodpeckers are attracted to sweet fruits, so strategically planting fruit trees and berry bushes around the perimeter of your yard, rather than close to your house, might attract them away from your home. On the flip side, make sure no fruit or berry bushes are planted too close to your house.

Deter starlings from eating livestock feed.,
Adapt bird feeding techniques to smaller birds.,
Limit standing water levels.,
Spray food sources with anti-bird spray.",How to Get Rid of Starlings1," Farms often attract starlings, but the birds can eat your livestock feed and spread disease to your animals. Using feed and feeding methods that do not attract starlings can help keep the birds off of your farm.


Provide either granular feed or large pellets (at least 0.5 inch in size) that are more difficult for starlings to eat.
Do not put animal feed directly on the ground.
Use bird-proof feeders. Many of these will make “clanging” noises periodically or have covers that birds cannot penetrate.
Feed animals in a covered area, such as a barn.
Feed animals in the evening or after dark.;
, If you use bird feeders to attract songbirds to your yard, you may be annoyed by starlings eating all of your bird feed and scaring off other birds.Place wide netting or a cage around feeders. Smaller songbirds will be able to penetrate the holes, but starlings will not.
Cut perches very short so that only smaller birds can perch on your feeders.
Try a feeder that requires birds to feed upside down: starlings do not like to eat upside down.
Do not put birdseed directly on the ground.

, Standing water should be drained or limited to depths containers in which the water level is at least six inches below the edge of the container and the depth of the water is at least three inches., Different types of spray that are safe for humans are available. This is a particularly good option if you have a crop that starlings like to eat, like grapes or berries.


Try spraying methyl anthranilate, a grape flavoring, on food sources.
Garlic oil may also deter starlings. Applying it to bird seed “bait” or spraying it on or around potential food sources may encourage them to relocate."

Place deterrent items that move or sway in the wind on the high points of the boat to keep your boat bird-free.,
Place visual clues such as reflective items around the boat.

,
String a monofilament fishing line or cable above the masts and spreaders to deter birds from landing.",How to Keep Pest Birds off Your Boat," Birds prefer the high points on a vessel, but will also land on a protective canvas. Birds rely heavily on visual clues in their environment helping with flight, the detection of predators, food sources, etc, and moving, flapping objects will discourage birds from flying near or landing. Items called the Bird Spider, spikes, Scare Balloon, flash tape or a solar bird repeller. Simply placing a decoy of a bird-of-prey (such as an owl) on your vessel has been known to be an effective deterrent in keeping other birds away. If your vessel has a ""Windex"" style wind-direction indicator at the top of the mast, be sure to use the ""bird spike"" piece of hardware included to prevent birds perching on (and breaking) your Windex.;
,, The birds do not like the instability of landing on the wire, and so they move on to a more inviting perch.

Use visual deterrents.,
Keep woodpeckers away with noise.",How to Get Rid of Woodpeckers2," Woodpeckers are easily scared off by the sight of predators, shiny materials, and anything out of the ordinary, especially if it moves. Try affixing the following visual deterrents to your house in the area where woodpeckers have caused damage:


Hang aluminum pie plates, foil strips or reflective tape on your home. The pieces of aluminum should be long enough to dangle and move in the wind, which scares woodpeckers away. Aluminum flashing, a material sold at hardware stores, can also be nailed to your house to protect it from woodpeckers.
Hang pieces of string or colorful rope in the areas where woodpeckers like to hang out.
Place a hawk, owl or eagle figurine on your rafters close to where you've seen woodpeckers.
Hang a flag or decoration near the area for a more visually appealing solution. A windsock or windmill that moves quickly when the wind blows works well to scare woodpeckers away.

, Woodpeckers are scared by the sound of their predators and other unfamiliar noises. Install one of the following sound deterrents hear the area where woodpeckers drum on your home:

Purchase an ultrasonic recording of a woodpecker in distress, along with predator sounds, and put it in your attic window or somewhere close to the top of your house. Program the device to go off periodically day and night to keep woodpeckers away. More expensive sound systems can be programmed to make the predator sounds when a woodpecker comes close.
Place several wind chimes on and around your house. The noise from these chimes may discourage woodpecker visitors.

Use putty to fill the woodpecker holes as soon as you find them.
Paint over the putty when it dries with polyurethane or oil-based paints, which deter insects from using your home as a nesting site. Fewer insects means fewer woodpeckers.

, Secure hardware cloth, plastic netting or bird netting to the damaged areas of your home. This will prevent the woodpeckers from doing more damage to the area.

Remove the previous finish.,
Ensure you have enough stain to cover the whole area (plus 10% to be safe).,
Prepare your rags.,
Start brushing the stain on in one far corner.,
Start ragging on the stain thickly.,
Moving along the boards, brush against the back wall, another 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) before dipping the ""ragging on"" rag in the stain and staining that area the same 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep as before.,
Go back to the other side and start a new row.,
Finish up the last area.,
Give the stain plenty of time to dry (as indicated on the tin).",How to Stain a Wood Floor by Hand," Before we start staining we need to make sure ALL of the previous finish has been thoroughly removed. Make sure the floor has been sanded to a fine grit and that there are no longer any scratches from the rough grit sanding. (This is beyond the scope of this article). Hoover the floor thoroughly including going round the edges with the pipe.;
, If you have 2 or more cans of stain, make sure you shake the cans and pour them into a bucket to mix them together. Sometimes there are variations in the color from batch to batch. If you pour a can in halfway through that is from another batch, you will see half your floor a different color. Not a big issue just be aware.

, You need roughly 2 rags for every 10 square meters (110sq ft). Each rag should be around tea towel size (not much more than a fist full). You have a rag for dipping into the stain and wiping it on (ragging on) and then another rag for drying the excess off the surface. You'll want to replace them both after 10 to 15sq m (110 to 165sq ft) as they get too full of stain.

, Give the stain one last stir with a brush. Start in one corner brushing along the back edge of the floor into the corner, then across the adjacent edge by no more than arms length (18 inches is best).

, Roll one of the rags into a ball and dip it into the stain (don't go dunking it in, just dip). Then fill in the area you have just brushed a border round with that rag of stain. Then use the other rag to wipe over that area you have stained to dry the surface. That is, to remove the excess stain from the surface. This is key.

, Now it should be clear that we are staining the floor from one side to the other, a couple of boards at a time starting from one side and moving to the other.

, Once one full length is done, you can go back to the other side and brush along the adjacent wall again, up to 24 inches (61.0 cm) this time. Keep ragging on and ragging off, from one side of the room to the other until you have covered most of the room, with maybe 24 to 36 inches (61.0 to 91.4 cm) left.

, With this last section of the floor you have to brush round the edge, then rag on a small area, rag it off, move back, brush, rag on, rag off, move back, brush, rag on, rag off. Edging your way backwards towards the door.

, Once dry, hoover and apply protective coating. Water-based polyurethane is a good choice.

Mix castor oil with a carrier.,
Use castor oil as a carrier.,
Obtain a prepackaged insect repellent that contains castor oil.",How to Use Castor Oil As an Insect Repellent1," Mix 10 drops of castor oil with two tablespoons of a carrier like olive oil, rubbing alcohol, sunflower oil, vodka, vinegar, or witch hazel. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and use it to coat your arms, legs, and other exposed areas in order to repel insects.When creating a homemade insect repellent with castor oil, the final product should contain no more than 5-10% castor oil. The rest of the solution should be rubbing alcohol or a carrier oil.
You could also use water as a carrier. Just mix 1.5 tablespoons of water with one teaspoon of castor oil, 10 drops of lemongrass essential oil, 10 drops of thyme essential oil, and five drops of geranium essential oil. Pour the mixture in a small spray bottle and shake before using.;
, Castor oil itself can function as a carrier oil. Combine one fluid ounce (two tablespoons) of castor oil with 10 to 12 drops of an essential oil of your choice. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle, shake it just before use, then spray it on the exposed areas you wish to protect from insects. The essential oil you choose to utilize will impact how useful the insect repellent is. For instance, you might use:lavender essential oil, which repels ticks
neem essential oil, which repels mosquitoes
lemongrass essential oil, which repels ticks and fleas
citronella essential oil, which repels biting flies and mosquitoes

, Many artisanal insect repellents contain castor oil. Use castor oil as an insect repellent by obtaining such a product at your local natural food store or online.Specific directions for use vary. Generally, however, you will simply spray or dab the premade product on the exposed area of your skin in order to dissuade insects from bothering you.
Always read manufacturer directions before using a bottled or prepackaged insect repellent.

Make your patio less attractive to geese.,
Remove anything attracting the geese that can be easily removed.,
Use visual scare devices.,
Try roost inhibitors.,
Implement taste aversions.,
Use sonic repellers.,
Try ultrasonic disruptors.",How to Keep Geese off Your Patio," The underlying problem in any situation where a bird or animal encroaches in an area it is not welcome is that the area is attractive to bird or animal. There are numerous humane and economic products that make an area unattractive to birds. They fall into several categories:;
, If you have pet food for your dog or cat on your patio, remove it! Feed Fido or Kitty in the front yard not on the patio then the geese won't visit to steal an easy meal. Empty the kids paddling pool and put the pet water bowl out of sight unless your pet is using the patio so thirsty geese aren't tempted to drop in.

, These are things such as fake owls, coyotes, and other predatory organisms that are designed to scare the birds away. The problem with a lot of scare devices is that the birds get used to them too quickly.


If you have a fake owl, try moving it every day or every other day.
There are some visual scares like the Terror Eyes balloon and Irri-Tape that are designed to combat birds adaptive nature. They change constantly to make sure that the birds never get used to them. Search the internet for examples.

, Geese are unlikely to roost on a patio but you can try this. Anything that stops a bird from roosting on a ledge, outcropping, or other surface. This includes spikes, sticky chemicals and others. These are very effective if you are worried about getting bombed from overhead or are bothered by birds roosting in a tree.

, These are used to make grass or other plants taste awful to birds. They require some re-application over time, but a high quality taste aversion such as BirdShield are micro-encapsulated to minimize the frequency of re-applications. Taste aversions from Bird-X, Inc. are food-grade and made out of Concord grapes, a taste that birds cannot stand.

, The big guns of bird control. High quality sonic repellents emit the distress cries of the target species and the hunting cries of that species' natural predators. They range in size and cost but are designed to be very random and frightening to birds. Search the internet for examples.

, These work on birds and bats. They emit an ultrasonic sounds that most humans cannot hear but drive birds and bats crazy.

Cover orchards or nest areas with netting.,
Thin trees in densely forested areas.,
Block any openings bigger than 1” wide.,
Install deterrent spikes on roosting areas.,
Install angled boards over ledges.",How to Get Rid of Starlings2," Netting that is too small for starlings to penetrate will prevent them from entering your orchard while still allowing sunlight and less invasive birds through.


The practicality of this approach may vary depending on the size of the area that you wish to cover.
Maintaining the netting is important—holes may allow the starlings to get through.
The areas may need to be covered only for a limited time. Once the starlings move on to a new area, they may not try to return, or you may be able to continue prevention with less extreme measures.

, Starlings prefer to nest in areas where the trees are dense and close together. For a long-term solution to deter the birds, consider thinning the trees on your property.

, Sometimes thick or commercial grade material such as metal flashing or industrial vent/chimney covers may be necessary., Metal spikes along ledges and other areas that starlings have started to roost will help drive starlings away to other areas., Boards or other materials set at a 45 degree incline along ledges and other roost areas will deter starlings due to the uncomfortable angle.You may be able to remove the boards once the starlings have moved on to new territory.

"

Use sound machines to frighten the starlings.,
Use visual effects to frighten the starlings.,
Spray the birds with water.,
Combine different repellents together at the same time.,
Target attacks in the evening and morning hours.",How to Get Rid of Starlings3," While ultrasonic sound systems are available for purchase, their efficacy has been debated. Instead, old fashioned (preferably outdoor/waterproof) speakers seem to work best.


A variety of sudden sounds such as alarms, distressed bird recordings, and explosions are most effective.Play the sounds erratically, not in a predictable pattern.
Move the speakers’ direction, or adjust the fading and panning from the receiver system, to vary the directionality of the sound.
The sound of a gunshot may also frighten the starlings away., Using a variety of visual scare tactics is most effective. Some things to try are balloons, balloons with predator eyes painted on them, flashing lights, shiny/reflective items that move, and models of predators such as owls, hawks, and foxes.Be sure to move the visual scare devices frequently so that the birds do not become acclimated to them.

, Sporadically spraying the birds with water is a humane way to frighten the birds away.Like the audio and visual attacks, water sprays should be sudden and not patterned so that the birds do not adapt to the timing of the water.

, The best scare attack is one that combines multiple methods of making the birds’ roosting habitat undesirable. The more undesirable or inconvenient a habitat is, the more likely the starlings are to move on to a safer place.

, The bulk of your scare tactics should be applied when the birds are preparing to roost in the evenings. You can also launch a “reminder” attack in the morning as they are leaving their roosting areas."
"
Remove nests.,
Trap the birds.,
Hire a professional to use pesticides.,
Shoot the birds.",How to Get Rid of Starlings4," While the best option is to close off any areas that the starlings may build nests before they happen, you may discover nests and decide to remove them.Check on your state’s laws about disturbing birds’ nests, particularly those with eggs in them. While the starlings are usually an unprotected species, other birds are protected. Be sure you know it is a starling nest before disturbing it.

, Remember that you will need to have a plan for what to do with the birds after you trap them. You will need to either release them a significant distance from the trap site or euthanize them humanely. Consider hiring a professional pest control expert to help eliminate the trapped birds., There is a pesticide that targets starlings, but it can only be used by a licensed professional. Call a pest control company to inquire about pesticides.


This approach should probably be used after other tactics since it involves using a poisonous substance on your property., Be sure to check the hunting/shooting ordinances for your city and state. Often, shooting just a few birds with a shotgun will make the remaining population decide to find a safer environment. The noise of the gun may also frighten the birds away.This may be considered an extreme measure and should be used as a last resort.
This method is likely not a safe or legal option in urban areas.

Smooth the surface.,
Repair any cracks.,
Vacuum the floor.,
Scrub the floor clean.,
Consider etching the floor.,
Tape off the area.,
Mix the stain.,
Work from back to front.,
Spray the stain using random motions.,
Spread the stain.,
Let dry.,
Test the color.,
Apply additional coats as needed.,
Allow the stain to dry completely.,
Clean the floor.,
Apply the sealer using a roller brush.,
Wait several days before use.",How to Stain Concrete Floors," Work across the floor using a sander, mechanical buffer, or floor grinder equipped with diamond bits. Focus on areas covered by visible imperfections.


This may not be necessary if the concrete floor is relatively new, but you'll need to follow this step if the concrete has any paint stains or similar spots on it.
Likewise, if you removed tile flooring from the concrete before starting, you'll need to use a floor grinder to remove any stubborn bits of mortar from the floor.;
, Check the floor for any divots or deep cracks. Fill in these areas using pre-mixed concrete patching.


Unless the floor has been severely damaged, you'll only need a small bucket of pre-mixed patch.
Scoop a small amount of patch onto a blunt trowel, then slather the patch directly over the crack in your concrete. Use the edge of the trowel to smooth the patch into the crack.
Continue smoothing the patch until it lies flush with the rest of the floor. Allow the patch to set before continuing.

, Work across the entire concrete floor with a shop-vac. Pick up as much solid debris as possible.If you don't have a shop-vac, pick up the largest pieces of debris using a heavy broom and dustpan. Follow up with a standard vacuum cleaner to pick up smaller dust bunnies and particles.

, Prepare a bucket of soapy water, then use a mop or rag to wash the floor. Allow the surface to dry completely before continuing.


Neutral floor cleaner works best, but an all-purpose cleaner can be used, as well.
If the floor seems especially oily, you may need to use a degreaser instead of a standard floor cleanser.

, Some stains work better if you chemically etch the floor before application. Doing so creates small imperfections in the concrete, making it easier for the stain to sink in.


Check the stain label before etching the floor. Even though some stains do require this step, others advise against it.
If you purchased a concrete stain kit, the etching chemical might be included. Follow the instructions to mix and apply the chemical.
If an etching chemical has not been included, use TSP (trisodium phosphate). Combine 1 cup (250 ml) TSP with 3 quarts (3 L) warm water. Scrub the floor using this solution and a rigid floor brush, then allow the concrete to dry before continuing.

, Cover the bottom perimeter of the wall with painter's tape. You should also use tape on any areas of concrete you do not wish to stain.


Concrete stain can be very difficult to remove. If it does accidentally coat an area you do not wish to stain, you will likely need to paint over that area to hide the mistake.

, Combine one part stain with one part water inside an all-plastic pump sprayer.Follow the package instructions on the stain while mixing it. This ratio is fairly common, but some types of stain may require slightly different proportions. Stain kits will usually have pre-measured proportions for you to use.
Concrete stain is best applied with a pump sprayer. If you choose to apply it with a roller or brush, however, you'll need to mix the stain in a plastic bucket.

, Regardless of how you apply the stain, you'll need to work from the back of the room to the front. Start at the corner furthest away from the door and gradually move toward the doorway.


If you don't apply the stain in this manner, you'll need to walk across the concrete before the stain can dry. Doing so can ruin both the stain and your shoes.

, Apply the stain to the floor in a continuous spray. Make random motions with the spray wand to prevent any lines from developing.


If you choose to apply the stain with a brush or roller, consider working in fan-shaped strokes to help prevent lines from developing. Overlap each previously stained area as you apply more stain to further prevent these lines.
No matter how you choose to apply the stain, only apply enough to just barely cover the floor. Do not allow puddles of stain to form on the concrete.

, Use a heavy shop broom to spread the wet stain over the concrete floor. Try to spread it evenly so that no area seems notably darker or lighter.


Alternatively, use a rag to spread the stain instead of a broom. Doing so may prevent bristle marks from showing up in the stain. Work the rag and applied stain around the floor using circular motions.

, Allow the first coat of stain to dry before testing the color or applying additional coats. The color will look different after it dries.


Typically, you'll need to wait roughly 90 minutes in between coats. Check the product label for more precise drying guidelines, however.

, Apply a small amount of water over the dried stain. Doing so will give you an idea of how the stain should look after you apply the sealer.


Dry the water quickly after you check the color.
Note that the dry stain will look much more faded than the finished product, which is why you should test the color in this manner before determining whether or not you'll need to apply additional coats.

, If the stain is too light or if you can see application lines, you may need to apply one or two additional coats. Mix the stain and apply it in the same manner as before.


Apply each color in the opposite direction to help minimize the appearance of stroke lines.Check the color after each coat to determine whether or not additional coats are still needed.

, The stain must be given enough time to dry and set properly. You may need to wait as long as 12 to 24 hours.


Since each stain requires a different amount of time, you'll need to consult the product label for more precise instructions.
Even if the floor appears dry, the chemical reaction caused by the stain will continue until you wash the floor. Giving the stain enough time to set will help you to achieve the best possible result from this reaction.

, Prepare a solution of all-purpose cleanser and water. Scrub the floor with this solution, then allow the concrete to dry.Check the label instructions for your stain. For some stains, you may need to add baking soda to the solution to help neutralize the chemical reaction.
If the area is too wet after you wash it, you can mop up some of the excess water with a dry rag or dry/wet shop-vac.

, Pour an appropriate sealer into a paint tray, then work the sealer over the stained concrete floor using a low-nap roller brush.


For best results, use a sealer recommended by the manufacturer of your particular stain.
Indoor concrete floors are typically sealed with wax, but in high-traffic areas, urethane-coated epoxy sealers might work better.
Regardless of the sealer you use, you should apply it to the floor in thin coats. Allow the sealer to dry completely in between separate coats.

, Wait at least one to two days before removing the painter's tape and using the floor. The sealer must cure completely before you walk across the floor or move furniture onto it.


Check the sealer label for more precise instructions on curing time.
Once the sealer cures, the process is complete and the floor should be ready to use.

Apply a second coat of varnish.,
Remove drop cloths, painter’s tape and other materials.

",How to Stain Stairs," Pick up a corner of the carpet with pliers. You can use a pry bar if the pliers aren’t doing the trick.


Rip up carpet, padding, wooden carpet strips, and staples. Discard them.
Remember to wear heavy-duty gloves and work clothes when removing carpet.;
, This process will create a lot of dust, and you will want to seal off the area as completely as you can.

, Affix it with masking tape. Lay down drop cloths on nearby floors or carpets.

, The sanding and staining processes both require good ventilation.

, Hammer them in thoroughly, so that they are even with the stair.

, Apply the tape to the wall, so that you have full access to the stairs.

, If it is thick paint or heavy stain, you may need to use a chemical stripper. Apply it according to package directions, remembering that ventilation is important.


Chemical strippers are usually applied to the surface with a brush and then scraped off with a putty knife.
If you don’t have a heavy stain on the stairs, move on to the next step, sanding.
Wipe the stripped stairs with a clean rag before you continue. You will need to sand the stairs lightly with fine-grit sandpaper to remove chemical residue.

, You can use an electric random orbital sander for surfaces; however, corners and other areas may require a finishing sander, sanding blocks, or just plain sandpaper.


A small wood chisel can be helpful to remove the finish from the edges or corners of the stairs or risers.

, If your stairs were recently installed, you may only need to give them a light sanding. Your aim is to entirely remove the old finish, rather than change the shape of the stairs.

, Then, vacuum the stairs and surrounding areas with a shop vacuum. Run damp tack cloths over the surface of the stairs.

, Choose an inconspicuous area and apply two to three coats. Repeat this step until you find the perfect color.

, Water or oil-based stains require a paintbrush, while gel based stains require a rag for application. Read the directions on the stain container well before starting.


Start at the top of the stairs and work your way down. Be sure that no one will need to walk down the stairs for the next day or so.
Allow the stain to penetrate the wood for 5-15 minutes, depending on the color you desire.
Wipe off the excess stain with a clean, dry cloth after allowing the stain to soak in. Make sure not to allow any stain that has not penetrated the wood to dry on the surface.

, Then, apply a second and possibly a third coat, wiping the excess off after allowing it to penetrate the wood. The stairs should look slightly darker with each coat of stain.

, Stairs are high-traffic areas, so sealing them is essential.

, Wipe up dust with a tack cloth.


Most floor-grade polyurethanes do not require sanding between coats, especially if the second coat is applied within 12 hours of the first coat.

, Allow it to dry for at least 24 hours before walking on them.,"

Simply spray some warm water onto the grout, then scrub it with a stiff-bristled brush using a circular motion. This might be enough to get rid of light surface dirt, and reveal the white grout underneath.


For heavier stains, add a few drops of dish soap into the warm water.
Try to get a brush made specifically for cleaning grout. If you can't find one, an old toothbrush or a manicure brush will also work. Don't use a wire brush, however, as it can ruin the grout.;
, Fill a spray bottle with 1 part white vinegar, and 1 part warm water. Spray this mixture onto the strained areas, wait 5 minutes, then scrub it off using a stiff-bristled brush. If needed, rinse the area with warm water.


Don't use this if your tiles are made out of vinegar or other natural stones. Vinegar can damage these materials.

, Mix enough water into some baking soda to form a thick paste. Spread this paste onto the affected area. Scrub the area with a stiff-bristled brush, then rinse with warm water.You can also spray the baking soda paste with a mixture of one part water, and one part white vinegar mixture. Once it stops fizzing and foaming, scrub the area using a stiff bristled brush.

, You can spray hydrogen peroxide straight onto the stained area, or you can made a paste using baking soda.Once you have the hydrogen peroxide on the grout, wait a few minutes, then scrub it using a stiff-bristled brush. Rinse the area using water when you are done.Hydrogen peroxide works great on blood.

, Look for products that say they will work on grout, or that say ""oxygen bleach"" on them. Turn on the bathroom fan or open a window, and put on a pair of rubber gloves. Use the product according to the instructions. Most will need to sit on the grout for 10 to 15 minutes, and scrubbed using a stiff-bristled brush. When you are done, rinse the cleaner off using warm water.


Common brands include: Biokleen Oxygen Bleach Plus, Clorox, OxiClean, and OxiMagic.

, Begin with the steam pressure set to the lowest setting, and work up to a higher setting if necessary. Use the brush attachment for stubborn stains.


Steam cleaning does not use any cleaners at all. Instead, it uses steam and pressure to ""blast"" dirt and grime away.

, Turn on the bathroom fan or open up a window. Put on a pair of rubber gloves, safety goggles, and some old clothes. Next, fill a spray bottle with 1 part bleach and 10 parts water. Spray the mixture onto the dirty grout and wait 2 minutes. Scrub the area using a stiff-bristled brush, then rinse with water.


Use bleach with care if your bathtub is made from porcelain. Bleach can cause porcelain to turn yellow or become pitted., Mix 2 parts baking soda and 1 part bleach to make a thick paste. Spread this paste onto the dirty grout and wait 5 to 10 minutes. Scrub the grout using a stiff-bristled brush, then wait another 5 to 10 minutes. Once the time is up, rinse the paste off using water.While mixing bleach with other chemicals is a bad idea, mixing bleach with baking soda is considered safe. Many people find that this actually helps improve the cleaning properties of both the bleach and the baking soda.

Wear protective gear when cutting cans.,
Collect some empty soda cans.,
Cut the cans.,
Squash the cans.,
Glue the ‘flowers’ to a wreath.",How to Recycle Cans to Make Garden Decor1," For this project, and others listed in this article, you will cut soda cans and turn them into lovely garden ornaments. However, these garden ornaments can turn deadly if you are cut by the sharp edges of the can. Because of this, it is important to wear sturdy work gloves when you cut cans.


You will also need heavy-soled shoes.;
, Consider using different kinds of soda cans to make your metal flowers more versatile and colorful.


However, in a pinch, working with the same sort of cans can look just as nice.

, Use a box cutter (which is also known as a craft knife) to make vertical slits down the side of the can. Leave about three-fourths of an inch in between each slit.


Make the slits all the way around the can, being sure to leave space between each slit.

, Wearing heavy-soled shoes (work boots work well), squish the top of the can down to the base. Doing this will form the slits you have made into flower petals.You should end up with a squashed can that looks like a flower.

, Your wreath can be a circle made of wire, or an actual wreath purchased at an arts and crafts store. Use a hot glue gun to glue the metal flowers to the wreath.


If you don’t have a wreath, consider getting a pool noodle at the dollar store. Bend it so that is forms a circle and then connect the two ends with duct tape. Wrap a ribbon around that section of the pool noodle to hide the duct tape.

Check the label for instructions on how much detergent to add, or add about ½ cup (118.29 ml)., Place the wool garment into the bucket of soapy water and dunk it to completely wet it. Then use your hands to gently swish the wool item around in the water for about a minute.This gentle swishing mimics the motion of a washing machine and allows the soap to pass through the wool and remove dirt or impurities.

, After about a minute of swishing the wool item around in the water, let the garment sit and soak in the water for about ten minutes., After ten minutes, take the wool garment out of the water. Roll the wool item from one corner to another into a ball and squeeze the balled garment to press out excess water, then place the garment aside., Empty the bucket or tub entirely of the soapy water. Then fill the tub back up with clean, tepid water so that you can rinse the wool again., Place the wool garment back in the tub of clean water, then swish it around just as you did before. Swishing the garment will wash the remaining soap out of the wool., The one wash in clean water should have removed all of the laundry soap. However, if the water is extremely soapy and it seems like there is still soap ingrained in the wool, pour the water out, fill it back up with clean water, and repeat the process of swishing the garment around in the clean water."

Wipe off excess grout paint from the tiles using a damp cloth.,
Wait until the paint dries before applying a second coat.,
Let the paint cure, if needed before using the area.,
Consider sealing the grout using a grout sealer.",How to Whiten Grout2," You may also find it labeled as ""grout colorant."" It usually contains epoxy, and is very durable. Grout paint is not the same thing as grout stain, which is usually translucent and does not come in white.


Depending on the color of your grout, white grout paint may look a little dark once it cures.
If your tiles are very dark, white grout might look too bright. Consider getting a grout paint that is light grey or an off-white instead.

, Fill in any chipped areas with grout, and let it cure. If you need to seal your tiles, do so now, but take care not to get any sealer on the grout itself. Sealers may prevent the grout paint from sticking. You also want to make sure that the grout is clean, and free of any oil, food, soap, or grime.


If you washed the tiles, make sure that they are completely dry before you move on.

, The brush should be small enough to slide down the grout lines. You can even use an old toothbrush. A cheap paint brush from the hardware store also works great for this. You will also need a paint pan, or any other small container to pour the paint into.


If you are worried about the paintbrush shedding, use a foam brush instead. Make sure that it is the same width as the grout line.Consider trimming the paintbrush bristles down a little so that they are stiffer. This will give you more control over the brush.

, Pour out less paint than you think you might need. You can always pour out more paint later. If you pour out too much paint, it can dry out before you use it all.

, Carefully run the brush along the grout. Be careful not to get any paint onto the tiles. It is possible to remove it, but the less cleanup you have to do, the better.


Grout paint will only stick to grout, and can be easily removed from tile. If you are still concerned about this, mask off the tiles using painter's tape., If the paint has dried on the tile, scrape it off using your fingernail.You can also use a pallet knife or an old spoon to scrape the paint off.

, Depending on the brand, this can take 1 hour or more. Refer to the label for more specific drying times. The paint must be completely dry before you apply a second coat., Depending on the brand you are using, you might need to let the paint cure first before you can use the tiled area. Some paints only need to dry.

, This will help your paintwork last longer. It will also help keep the grout clean longer and make it easier to clean later on.

Consider attaching the flowers to garden canes.",How to Recycle Cans to Make Garden Decor2," These can be food cans with their lids removed. The size of the can is up to you. Just remember to wear sturdy work gloves, as these cans have a tendency to be very sharp.

, Use aviation snips to make vertical slits down the side of the can. Start at the open rim and cut the can down to the base. Repeat this process all the way around the can.


Make sure to leave 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between each cut.

, Using the aviation snips, trip the ends of each of the metal strips so that they are round and petal-like. Again, use caution, as these cans are very sharp. Bend the petals out so that the can looks like a flower.


Consider painting the ‘flowers’. If you do not know how to paint metal cans, refer to Method 4.

, To give the flower a stem, you can attach it to a garden cane. Punch two holes in the center of the flower and run a bit of wire through the holes.


Loop the wire around the garden cane and secure it to the back of the cane.

Add some material to the bottom of the can to help it drain.,
Plant your cans.",How to Recycle Cans to Make Garden Decor3," Large cans used by restaurants can make great planters. However, be sure to clean the can thoroughly to remove any traces of oil or food products.

, You can file the edges of the cans down, or you can pinch the metal at the edge of the can so that it becomes flat; use metal pliers to do this.


You can also put silicon sealant along the sharp edges.

, Most plants do not like soggy roots, so it is important that your can planters have some drainage holes. To make them:


Use an electric drill, or a hammer and sharp nail. If you use a hammer and nail, turn the can upside down so that the sharp sides of the holes you make face inward.
Consider painting your can. If you do not know how to do that, see the next section.

, In addition to making drainage holes, you should also lay some gravel at the bottom of the can before you put the soil in. The grave will help to improve the can’s drainage.

, Fill the can with soil and pick out plants to fill your can planter with. The plants you choose are up to you; just keep in mind that you should pick out a soil that the plants will do well in. If your plants like acidic soil, make sure that the soil you buy is acidic.

Wash your can before painting.,
Use steel wool to soften the metal.,
Apply a primer intended for metal such as Rust-oleum and let it dry.",How to Recycle Cans to Make Garden Decor4," Make sure to wash your can with soap and water before you paint it. This will help to remove the label and any residual food or oils. Let the can dry completely once you have washed it.


You can also wash your can with diluted vinegar to remove any persistent oil residues.

, Purchase a piece of steel wool and rub it against the can. This will help to roughen up the metal, which in turn will help the paint to stick to the otherwise slippery metal surface.

, After the primer has dried you can paint the can with acrylic paint. Try to mix some all purpose sealer into the base coat. Apply several layers of paint.


After the last paint layer has dried, apply a coat of clear acrylic sealer to make the paint last.

Only machine wash the garment if it is recommended on the tag.

, Put the wool item in a mesh delicates bag to protect the wool material from snagging inside the machine. Though it isn’t absolutely necessary to use a mesh bag, it can protect the delicate fibers of the wool item from damage., Most washing machines have a wool setting that is set up specifically to wash wool garments. If your machine doesn’t have a wool setting, set the washing machine to coldest setting, which will protect the wool from shrinking.Some machines have a hand washing setting, which you can also use as it is quite gentle.

, Add a laundry detergent formulated for wools or delicates, using its label to approximate how much you will need., After you turn on the wash settings and have added the soap, place the wool item in the machine. Close the machine and wash the garment until the cycle is over."

Stretch the wool if it has shrunk.",How to Wash Wool3," Lay a clean, dry towel out on a counter or other flat surface, then lay the wool garment on top of the towel. Roll the towel from one corner to the other with the wool item inside.The clean towel will help to absorb the excess water from the wool so that it will take a shorter time to air dry.

, When the towel is rolled completely, gently squeeze the roll from one end to another. Don’t twist or wring the rolled towel, as this can damage the fibers of the wool., Unroll the towel and take out the wool item. Lay out another clean towel, then place the wool garment on top of the clean towel to air dry. To speed up the process of drying, place a fan or dehumidifier in front of the drying wool.Do not hang up the wool garment on a hanger to dry, as this can cause the item to stretch and become misshapen.

, Exposure to water sometimes has the effective of shrinking a wool garment. If your garment looks smaller than it was before washing, stretch it while it is still damp, starting by stretching it from top to bottom, then working up the garment while you stretch it side to side. Also stretch the sleeves if your garment is a shirt or sweater.


You can also stretch the garment and pin it in place to the towel with sewing pins so that it dries stretched out, but this should be a last resort since it sometimes warps the pinned areas."

Verify the kicking is complete once you're done.,
Verify your work is correct.,
Carefully cut any excess carpet at the bottom of the steps.,
Staple each step through to the wood.",How to Carpet Stairs," Before you do anything else, you'll need to have a clear idea what the size of your staircase is. The includes the length, width and height of each stair, as well as the number of stairs itself. In most cases, the number of steps is the most important trait to know and the easiest to figure out, as it will let you know how many sets of tackless strips and pads you'll need for your carpet.The standard stair is 30 inches wide. If your stairs follow the standard dimensions, it will be much easier to measure and lay your carpet, as carpet runners designed for the standard dimensions will be easy to find.
Assuming you have standard-sized stairs, and allowing for 3 inches on either side to display the wood, you need 24 inches for each stair step and riser.
Rise (height) and runs (width) can vary in size, so be sure to measure closely.;
, Before moving into the practical stage of setting the carpet, you should go out and consult with a sale associate who specializes in carpets. Talk to him about your project, specifically the size and scope, and the general expectation you might have for an end result. Chances are this associate will be able to lend you some specific and helpful advice, as well as point you in the direction of some carpet types that might suit your goals. Consider taking pictures of your stairs as they are to give the sales associate a kind of visual references to keep in mind while he helps you.
If you are trying to calculate the amount of carpet material you'll need from the sales associate, remember to keep the stair's nose (or rounded front-section) in mind, giving a couple more inches than you would otherwise to compensate for it.

, At the end of the day, laying a carpet runner along your stairs adds comfort and purpose, so it's good to keep your creative side in mind while making your stair decisions. Choosing to carpet just the step and not the riser, as well as different widths (leaving wood visible on either side, for example), colors, and textures will yield different results for your stairs and home.


Some carpet designs come with a design woven into it. If this is the case, you'll want to respect the properties of the design pattern while placing the carpet. Ideally, you should aim to give the staircase as much visible symmetry as possible. This may make working with patterning irregularly-sized staircases very tricky, as most carpet runners are made to fit a certain kind of stair.

, The most important ingredient you'll need in your home improvement concoction is obvious the carpet runner itself. Unless you've already calculated an accurate measurement of how much you'll need (keeping the height and noses in mind), you should go by the word of the carpet professional helping you. If you do not have the necessarily supplies yet, the following is a list of things you'll almost certainly need:


As much carpet as is required to fit the stairs, leaving an extra couple of feet to account for cuts and possible errors.
Tackless strips to hold the carpet and padding down. You'll need at least three for each step.
An industrial stapler and staples, for securing the carpet.
A hammer and nails.
Two strips of padding for each step -- one of the step itself, and one for the rise.
A carpet knee-kicker, to help stretch and fasten carpets. With stairs you want to stretch it into the inner corner of each step.

, Measure two inches on either side from the stair tread and trace straight lines from the front to back of the stair. This will give you a visual outline of where to place the tackless strips and the carpet itself, when the times comes.


You can mark your outline in blue masking tape for nice lines, then simply peel it off when you are finished.

, Tackless strips are what keep your carpet rooted to the ground. Cut them 1.5 inches narrower than the width of the steps to be carpeted. This will make sure you don't get any misplaced strips protruding once the carpet is set. For example, if the stair is 30 inches wide, your carpet runner will measure 26 inches wide, so your tackless trips must measure 24.5 inches wide.


Carpet tackless strips are almost always strips of Douglas fir wood, usually 4 feet long by 1 inch wide, with very sharp nails protruding through them at 60 degree angles and tacks or brads partially sunk in the strip.

, Having a visual cue as to the true center of your tackless strips will make them easier to accurately place upon each step. Next, do the same for the steps themselves. Use a ruler or meter stick for each.


As always, an HB pencil is best for this, as the line will be clear and visible.

, Align each tackless strip centre line to the line on each itself. With the strips now where you want them, it's time to nail them in for good. Hammer several tack nails to each strip, and be sure to evenly dispersed throughout the length of the strip. This will make sure it has the highest possible stability.


One or two strips per step is enough, so long as you leave a strip for the height of each step to install horizontally. Install one for now, closer to the rise; that way, you'll have an easier time gauging the center for the horizontal strips.

, Adding another set of tackless strips to the heights of the steps will make the carpet fit far more snugly into the frame of the stairs. Add them to the centre and evenly disperse 3-5 nails along each of them.


With the tread strips in place it will be much easier to properly aim and gauge the center,

, The third and final set of strips should be much easier to work on now that you're used to it. While it seems like it would make most sense to do this third set when you did the first, it's good form to give yourself stepping room for installing the horizontal strip, so it's good to leave this one for last. Work your way from the top to the bottom. That way, you'll maximize the stepping space and comfort you are afforded while you work.

, Before you move on to the padding and carpet laying, you should verify your progress there isn't anything you have overlooked or erred on while working. It will be far more difficult to fix if you realize you have to fix something a few steps down the road.

, Carpet pad is what gives the carpet it's pleasant feeling of cushion and softness, as well as protecting feet from possibly protruding tacks. Cut every piece to be the same length as the tackless strips, not the carpet runner itself. This will give the carpet a nice tapered end on either side when it's done. , With all of your pieces ready, it's time to put them in place. Lay each sheet of padding down and take care to align it properly with the tackless strips. Apply industrial staples at three inch intervals throughout the length of it.


This time, it's a good idea to start from the bottom and work slowly up. That way, you'll be able to stand firmly on the padding while you're stapling subsequent steps.

, Taking the stair padding and tuck it under the nose of the step. Horizontal padding should be easier to accomplish now that you have the basics handled. Try to line up the staples on the heights' padding with the ones you've made for the treads.The nose is the part of the step that extends slightly past the drop, or height. The height, then, is the vertical part of the step.

, At this point, you shouldn't see any more of the tackless strips. They should be covered instead by the padding, both on the treads of the steps and the heights. All of this will be virtually invisible when it finally comes time to lay the carpet runner, but a single mistake here could make future steps impossible, so it's imperative you fix any potential issues before getting around to the carpet. If you're satisfied with your current work however, you may begin laying the runner.

, That way, you'll have gravity on your side, and it'll be much easier to cut any runoff carpet at the end.

, If you traced the carpet outline at the beginning of the project, it should be an easy matter of getting the carpet situation between the two as close as you can. Take care to press the carpet under the nose and tug the rest out to make sure you're getting just as much carpet as you need. Work down to the last step; when you're done, the carpet should be covering the expected ground, but the outline of the steps may not be fully visible.Make sure each step is as good as it can get before you move down to the next-- any mistake will cause a load of undue strain later on once the project is supposedly complete.

, A carpet knee-kicker will get the carpet planted firmly in areas that may be otherwise difficult to reach. Place the front edge of your carpet knee-kicker on center of the runner about two inches from the riser and apply pressure until the carpet is locked in. They can be remarkably satisfying to use, and will give your stairs a much tighter look than if done without. Lean on the front knob of the kicker with one hand, and use the other hand to keep the kicker's shaft level.You can also use a carpet chisel. The dull edge helps tighten up corners and is easier to use on stairs or in tight quarters.

, As with previous steps, the last part of using the knee-kicker should be making sure you got the job done to your satisfaction.Without kicking in properly, you may have too much carpet or too little, and it'll require uprooting or even destroying the progress you've made.

, Before you move on, you should ensure that the carpet is being snagged by the tackless strip at the far end of the tread. If the tackless strips aren't properly clinging to the carpet, it could result in the carpet getting bumpy a few years down the road. Using a chisel or other thin tool, press the angle between the step's height and tread to make sure it's getting hooked in. , At the bottom, there should be a little bit of runoff. From here, it's just a simple matter of cutting the excess carpet away with a carpet knife.


Feel free to do what you will with the remainder of the carpet. Some people are quick to throw them out, while others like to find practical uses for them.

, Having a powerful stapler designed for home improvement is necessary to finish things off and get your carpet snug and perfect. When stapling, push stapler through the carpet pile and against the backing before pulling the trigger.

Staple on the underside of the step noses, and nearest the angle between the tread and height. Staple at three inch intervals for optimal stability.
Alternatively, you can use carpet glue instead of staples.
Make absolutely certain that the carpet is exactly where you want it to be before you staple. After you staple, it will be next to impossible to correct any mistakes.

Check the rug's label.,
Vaccum and tend to the carpet regularly.,
Keep your rug out of direct sunlight.,
Test to see if your carpet is colorfast.,
Move your furniture around occasionally.",How to Clean Oriental Rugs1," Lift the corners of your rug to reveal the rug's label. Usually, on the label, it will have instructions on the safest way to clean your Oriental rug. Rugs can be made of silk, wool, cotton, or synthetic material and each requires a certain degree of finesse when cleaning. Cotton and wool rugs are generally more durable and easier to clean.


If you have a silk rug, consider taking it to a professional instead of cleaning it yourself in the case of severe stains.;
, Vacuuming your rug at least once a week will lift recent debris and dirt from it and keep it smelling and looking new for a longer time. Vacuuming also prevents the wool fibers in your rug from becoming packed down.Do not frequently vacuum antique or silk oriental rugs as it can damage them and reduce their value.

, Oriental rugs can be prone to sun damage, so keep it away from windows if you can. Keeping an oriental rug in the sun will cause the colors to fade over time.If your rug has to be in direct sunlight, rotate it at least once a month. While the colors are still likely to fade, at least they will fade evenly., Some carpets are colorfast and won't bleed when wet, while others will. If the rug's label reads ""dry clean only,"" then there's a good possibility your rug is not colorfast. If you want to test your rug, saturate a small corner of the carpet with room temperature water, then press on it with a clean white cloth. If there is dye on your rag, then your carpet is likely to bleed if you clean it yourself.


In the case that your carpet is not colorfast do a light cleaning but avoid getting your carpet wet or using chemical cleaners on it.
If you need to deep clean a carpet that is not colorfast, your best option would be to bring it in to be professionally cleaned.

, Heavy pieces of furniture that sit on top of your oriental rug can work down the fibers and damage your carpet over time. To prevent this, rearrange your furniture every six months. This will even out the wear and tear on your rug and increase its longevity."

Spot clean your rug.",How to Clean Oriental Rugs2," Use a broom with straw bristles or a carpet sweeper to do the initial cleaning of your rug.Sweep in one direction from end to end. Don't rub your broom back and forth because you could end up damaging it. Once you're done sweeping the entirety of the rug, repeat the cycle and go over it a second time.


Electric carpet sweepers use static electricity to pick up dirt and are the safest method for quickly cleaning an antique oriental rug.

, Lay out your rug in an empty area and vacuum over the rug slowly to remove excess abrasives, hair, and dirt that can damage your rug over time.Repeat this process three or more times to get all the dirt and debris from the rug.Avoid the rug's fringes because they can become stuck in the vacuum's sweeper.Once you're done vacuuming, flip the rug over and repeat the process on the other side.


When cleaning an expensive or antique rugs, make sure to use the carpet tool because a revolving brush can damage your rug and hurt its value., If you can pick your rug up, you can take it outside and shake it to remove embedded dirt and other particles. If your rug is too big to shake, hang it on a clothesline and beat it with your hands. You should see the dust and dirt come off of the rug as you do this., It's best to tend to spills as soon as they occur because if they dry it will be much harder for you to get the stain or smell out of your rug. As soon as the spill occurs blot up as much of the liquid as you can, with a paper towel or clean rag.Once you've soaked up the spill, dampen a rag and use cold water to blot the stain again.


Do not rub back and forth on the spill because you could end up rubbing the stain deeper into the carpet.

After you vacuum, shake the rug to remove any additional dirt or debris.


You can also use an electric sweeper if your vacuum is not effective., Soak the entirety of the carpet on one side then flip it over and spray the other side with water. You should only have to do this for a few minutes on each side for your oriental rug to become saturated with water., You can use a mild liquid detergent or dish soap to clean your rug. Fill a bucket with one gallon of cold water and three tablespoons of your mild soap. Mix the solution together in your bucket.You can also use a mild shampoo for oriental rugs that are made from wool., You can use a long haired brush or a non-shedding sponge to clean your carpet.Dip your sponge or brush into your water and soap solution until it's saturated and lightly go over a small part of the rug. Wait up to ten minutes to see if the cleaning solution has an adverse effect on it before proceeding to the next step.


If the cleaning solution is changing your carpet's color or making the colors bleed, stop cleaning it and take it a professional.

, Lather your rug in the direction of the nap, or so that the fibers lay down, opposed to sitting up.Lather your carpet enough to create suds on the surface of the rug.

, Rinse the remainder of the cleaner off with the garden hose. Once you're done doing one side, flip the rug over and rinse the other side of it. The suds on the top of the rug should be washed off thoroughly before drying.

, Wet rugs can build mildew over time and create a bad odor. Once you're done rinsing your rug, it's important that you allow it to dry before putting it back to where it belongs. Use a squeegee to squeeze the rest of the water out of your rug, then allow it to dry flat on the ground. Remember to flip your rug over so that both sides can dry.If drying is taking too long try pointing a fan on to quicken the process.

Use talcum powder to remove unwanted odors.,
Use vinegar, water, and detergent to remove pet or coffee stains.,
Consider contacting a professional rug cleaner.",How to Clean Oriental Rugs4," After vacuuming your rug thoroughly, sprinkle some talcum powder on the surface and allow it to sit on the rug overnight. The powder will absorb unwanted odors left by pets or smoke. The next day, use your vacuum to lift the powder from your carpet.You can purchase talcum powder at many different department stores.

, Mix 1/4 cup (59.1 mL) white vinegar and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) liquid dishwashing detergent with 2 cups (473.17 mL) of room temperature water in a bucket and use it to remove harder stains.The vinegar's acidity prevents the colors in your carpet from running and can eliminate unwanted odors.

, If your rug is expensive, made of material like silk, or has sentimental value, it may be a good idea to take it to a professional rug cleaner rather than trying to do it yourself. Carpet cleaners have years of experience working with different types of rugs and will know the best course of action for your problem. While it will cost money, it may be worth it so you can avoid repairs in the future.

Use an enzyme neutralizer.,
Pour club soda on problem areas.,
Rent a carpet cleaning machine.",How to Deodorize Carpet1," There are many products, such as Nature’s Miracle and Simple Solution, that were created to target pet odor. Purchase an enzyme neutralizer at a pet store and make sure to follow the directions on the label exactly. Completely cover all affected areas of your carpet to get the best possible result., Get a liter-sized bottle of club soda and carefully pour it onto the carpet and let it fizz. Once the fizzing has subsided, use bath towels or paper towels to blot up all the liquid and open the windows so that the carpet can air dry. Try repeating this regimen a couple of times if the odor is still lingering., Especially if you’ve already tried other options, you may need to clean your carpets with a machine to get rid of pet urine smells. You can rent a carpet cleaning machine from a home improvement store.


Don’t use a steam cleaning machine because hot temperatures may permanently set the odor."

Draw a diagram of the room you want to carpet.,
Draw lines on the diagram to make an oddly shaped room into shapes that can easily have areas calculated such as rectangles, squares and triangles.,
Measure the sides of the room using a measuring tape, and write the numbers in on the diagram where they belong.

,
Calculate the areas of the individual shapes you divided out, making sure you use the same unit of measurement with all of them, and then add them together.,
Convert square feet into square yards by dividing by 9 if you live in the United States.,
Round your number up if you feel any doubt because it would be better to have extra scraps to use in closets and on stairs than to come up short.

,
Decide which direction the carpet is going to unroll and be seamed together across the room.",How to Measure Area for Carpet,";
, If your room is a simple rectangle already, then you do not have to worry about this.

,, Or you may just calculate the area of your simply shaped room.


Multiply the length measurement by the width measurement to find the area of a rectangle or square.
Multiply the length measurement by the width measurement and divide by 2 to find the area of a rectangle.

, Carpet rolls come in square meters if you live outside the United States.

,, Use this information added to your area calculations to help you know how much carpet you will need.


Divide the length of the room that the seams will run perpendicular to by the width of the carpet roll you have chosen. This will give you the number of times the roll will need to be cut, moved over and unrolled again.
Multiply the length of the wall parallel to the strips of carpet by the number of strips of carpet that will be across the room. This will give you the length of 1 long carpet roll. Divide this number by the length of the carpet rolls you have chosen to find out how many carpet rolls you will need. If there is a remainder, then you will need an extra roll.

Start with a sharp knife.,
Place the tip of the knife against the carpet.,
Drag the blade along in a straight line.,
Replace your knife blade as needed.",How to Cut Carpet1," This will be the most important (and possibly the only) tool you’ll need to cut carpet. A standard utility knife is preferable, though something like an X-Acto knife or razor can also do the trick. Whatever you use, make sure the edge is nice and sharp.If you’re using a utility knife with a removable blade, take a minute to insert a new one before you get started.
You might also use a handheld electric carpet cutting tool. These tools feature durable edges and automated cutting action, which can help you sidestep the difficulty of doing it manually.;
, Grip the knife in your dominant hand so that the angled edge of the blade is pointing away from you. Point the blade downward and touch the tip to your starting point on the carpet. Then, press down just enough to pierce the carpet’s tough backing.


Cutting carpet is mostly a matter of getting through the backing, which is the hard, flat side that lays flush against the floor.
Don’t jam the blade into the carpet too deeply. You might blunt or break your knife, or even mark up the underlying flooring.

, Once you’ve got the tip through the carpet, pull back on the knife using a slow, smooth motion. You should be able to feel the backing give way beneath the blade. Use a straightedge to guide your movements, and pause every two or three feet to reposition before you continue cutting.Keep your wrist fixed to avoid making sloppy or uneven cuts.
If you don’t have the benefit of a straightedge, try feeling for one of the seams in the underside of the backing. Following a seam will help you make straight, steady cuts.

, Your original blade will quickly lose its edge after slicing through multiple feet of tough backing material. To keep the project moving along, be sure to have a new blade on standby. Working with a dull blade will only slow you down.It may seem like a hassle to have to keep stopping to change blades, but it will save you considerable time and labor in the long run.

Vacuum your rug regularly.,
Brush pet hair out.,
Shake small rugs out.,
Use a steam cleaner every 6 months.",How to Clean a White Rug1," Keep your rug looking pristine by vacuuming it regularly. Dust and dirt can easily build up on a white rug and foot traction on stuck-in sand can actually wear a wool rug out. Assess how much traffic your rug gets and stick to a vacuum routine:


For high traffic areas, vacuum your rug daily.
For medium traffic areas, vacuum twice a week.
For low traffic areas, vacuum once a week.;
, Get rid of stingy pet hair on your white carpet by brushing it out. Choose a hair brush with stiff metal or plastic bristles. A rubber broom can work well at picking up pet hair also.Try an extra sticky lint roller for pet hair on the surface of your rug.

, If your rug is small enough to bring outside and shake, you can remove trapped dirt and dust better than some vacuum cleaners. Throw your rug over a rail and beat it with a broom or buy a traditional rattan rug beater., To deep clean your white rug, it’s important to use a carpet steam cleaner every 6 months to a year, depending on how much action the rug sees. Hire a professional carpet cleaner to take care of it, or clean it yourself if you have a steamer at home.


A family of four with a white rug in a frequented area should deep clean every 6 months.
A rug in a less frequented area can be cleaned once a year."

Run your hand along the rug to get the direction of the nap.,
Push a carpet sweeper in the direction of the nap.,
Sweep the fringes with a broom.,
Use a mild dish soap to clean spills.,
Spot clean with white vinegar, water, and dish soap.",How to Clean a Viscose Rug1," The nap or pile is the natural direction that the rug's fibers run. Running your hand across the surface of the rug will give you an indication to how the rug's fibers lay.Agitating the rug against the pile can loosen the rug's fibers and distort your rug.;
, High power vacuum cleaners and vacuums with beater brushes can damage the fibers in a viscose rug. Instead, use a non-electrical rug or carpet sweeper and run it along the direction of the rug's nap or pile. This should lift up any remaining crumbs or dirt stuck in the rug.You can go over the rug several times if it's still dirty.

, Do not go over the fringes on the rug with a carpet sweeper or vacuum because you could detach the fringes from the rug. Instead, use a broom or brush and brush the dirt and debris from out of the fringes. Use a dustpan to collect and dispose of the leftover dust., Test the dish soap on a small part of the rug before using it. If you notice discoloration or staining, don't use it. If there is a larger area that you need to clean, mild dish soap and water is a good solution. Saturate a rag with cold water and a drop of pH neutral dish soap, then rub the rag in the direction of the nap. When you're done, blot over the area with a dry rag until it's dry.Do not use detergents because they can stain and alter the color in your rug.

, Cleaning spills as soon as they happen will cut down on the size and severity of the stain. For especially tough stains, try spot cleaning the area with a mixture of water, white vinegar, and mild dish soap. Mix the solution together and skim the bubbles on the top of the solution with a rag. Use the rag with the bubbles on it to wipe down the stain then immediately remove the solution with a clean, damp rag.Do not oversaturate the rag in the solution or you may damage your rug.
You can also spray a fabric softener on the rug after spot cleaning it to keep it soft.

Sprinkle your carpet with baking soda to get rid of smoke smells.,
Dry out mildewy carpet.,
Clean mildewy carpet with a vinegar solution.,
Put an onion in your basement.",How to Deodorize Carpet2," Baking soda is a great tool to use for deodorizing any carpet, but it’s especially good at removing smoke odors. Fill a measuring cup with baking soda and pour it into a colander while you walk on your carpet to provide an even dusting. Let the baking soda sit for 30 minutes to an hour and then vacuum it up., If you suspect that moisture is causing the odor issue, first dry out the carpet by placing a dehumidifier in the room and by setting up floor fans and angling them downward. Sprinkling cat litter on the carpet may also help in soaking up the moisture., After drying, mix two cups of warm water (473.18 ml) with one cup of vinegar (236.59 ml) and lightly spray the solution over the carpet to sanitize and improve the smell. Let the carpet air dry. Be careful not to saturate the carpet too much, or mold and mildew may be encouraged to return., Because of the moisture surrounding them, basement carpets can carry an especially dank odor. Cut an onion open, put it on a plate, and set it in the basement overnight to draw out that wet smell.Dispose of the onion in the morning and repeat this process each night until the musty smell subsides.

Keep your home well ventilated.When possible, keep your windows open to create good air flow throughout your home.,
Vacuum often and stay on top of other cleaning tasks.,
Don’t smoke inside.If you or your guests want to smoke, head to the front or back porch.,
Address spills, stains, and pet accidents immediately.",How to Deodorize Carpet3," This keeps bad smells from being trapped in your home and settling into the carpet.


Keeping your home ventilated will also limit the humidity, which is important for preventing smelly mold and mildew from growing in your carpet.

, Make sure to take out the trash, wipe surfaces with disinfectants, and most importantly, vacuum weekly. Regular cleanings keep bad smells from forming and sticking around. This is especially important if you have a pet, whose presence can often create a bit of wear and tear on your carpet., When smoke is kept inside a room or a building, it has no way to dissipate properly and as a result, it gets absorbed into carpets, walls, and furniture.

, Timing is vital when taking care of spills and pet urine. The quicker you run to the liquid with a roll of paper towels and begin extracting as much as possible from the carpet, the less odor there will be to soak in and linger."

Measure your work area.,
Work a few feet at a time.,
Make your cuts on the backside of the carpet.,
Cut carefully around corners, contours and openings.",How to Cut Carpet2," Use a tape measure to find the length and width of the room you’re carpeting. This will give you an idea of exactly how much carpet you’ll need. It will also make it easier to cut each section to the proper specifications.Most rolls of carpet come in widths of 12 feet, so be sure to take this into account when plotting out the best way to cover the floor.To find the inner area of the room, multiply the length of the room (in feet) by the width.

, The key to installing professional-looking carpet is to take your time and give each section the same amount of care and attention. Unroll the carpet as you go, separating it into more manageable strips. Cut two or three feet, then scoot back and resume cutting from a comfortable position.


The roll itself can serve as a convenient reference for tracing straight lines.

, Whenever space allows, fold the carpet roll over and run your knife directly over the backing to achieve a cleaner cut with less struggle or guesswork. The backing is hard and flat, which means you won’t have to fight your way through the thick piling.Mark the backing with a pencil or permanent marker to indicate where you need to cut, or simply use the intersecting seams as a handy visual reference.
Folding the carpet will also create a more secure cutting surface, preventing you from scarring the flooring underneath., For some layouts, it may be necessary to leave space for a fireplace, a section of tile or some other piece of detailing. Measure these areas first so you’ll know how much carpet you need to trim. If you’re worried about making a mistake, you can lightly score the carpet on the first pass before committing to the cut.It may be helpful to perform a mockup of the cuts you intend to make on a scrap piece of cardboard first.Complex cutouts may be best left to the professionals.

Use the tip of the knife to open up a hole in the carpet.,
Pull up on the loose carpet with your free hand.,
Continue cutting the carpet as you pull it up.,
Pry up the outer edge of the carpet.,
Dispose of any remaining materials.",How to Cut Carpet3," Begin with a section a few feet away from the wall. Make a slit approximately 4-5 inches long—it should be big enough to easily slip your hand into. Cutting the carpet every few feet will be useful for large or oddly-shaped rooms where you’re unable to remove it in one piece.

, Reach into the slit you just cut and lift the carpet away from the floor. You can now finish cutting without your knife ever coming into contact with the flooring.If your carpet is tacked down with staples or adhesive, it may take a little effort to get it started by hand. Use a putty knife to chip away at one edge until there’s enough to grab hold of.

, The combined action of lifting and slashing should allow you to cut away large strips in very little time. After every few feet, move back and take a new grip on the loose edge. When you’ve cut all the way across a given section, peel it back, roll it up and set it aside somewhere out of the way.Since you’ll be throwing the old carpet out, there’s no need for precision or delicacy here.
Don’t get into too big of a hurry—that’s how accidents happen.

, Pull the carpet free from walls and corners later using a claw hammer, pry bar or pair of pliers. That way, it won't snag on anything or provide resistance when it comes time to carry it away. Once you've gotten the edges started, go around the perimeter of the room and loosen the rest of the carpet by hand.If you're having trouble, use your utility knife to separate the carpet where it connects to the baseboards.
Once the carpet has been cut and unfastened, you can simply roll it up, carry it out and dispose of it.

, Before you call it a day, inspect the flooring beneath the carpet closely. Dig out any staples or dried clumps of adhesive you see with a floor scraper, then vacuum to clear the area of debris. After you’ve cleaned up, you can go on to install new carpet, hardwood, tile or laminate.Unless you’re planning on repurposing your old carpet, it can simply be thrown away once the project is complete. Dig out any remaining staples or dried clumps of adhesive with a floor scraper.
A shop vac is the best way to collect dust, stray threads and other materials that are left lying around after removal.

Blot spilled liquids immediately.,
Try to get rid of stains with water first.,
Use white vinegar and club soda on water-based stains.,
Use rubbing alcohol to remove ink and oil stains.,
Use a commercial stain remover when all else fails.",How to Clean a White Rug2," The quicker you address spills the better, so they have less time to absorb into carpet fibers. Scoop any semi-solid accidents and blot liquids up immediately with a white rag or a plain, white paper towel. Don’t use anything with prints, because it can bleed on your white rug., Many spills can be cleaned with plain water if they don’t have time to set in. Try to remove stains with water on rugs like wool first, because wool naturally deters liquids from absorbing and harsh cleaners can wear the fibers out. Rub spots with a water dampened sponge., For spills like coffee, juice or--yikes--red wine, mix together equal parts white vinegar and club soda to rub on the stain. Dip a clean rag into the solution, blot and rub it on the stain a little bit at a time until the spill disappears. Sponge a bit of water on the area afterwards to remove the vinegar and soda., Rubbing alcohol can clean up oil-based spills, like milk or cooking grease. Plus, it works its magic on ink spills. Dip a clean, white rag into alcohol a small amount at a time. Blot and lightly rub the alcohol onto the rug stain. Use a solution of one teaspoon dry dish detergent to one pint of water to flush the alcohol out and further remove the stain., A store-bought stain remover may have stronger chemicals in it that may be rough on your rug’s fibers, but it may be worth it if you’re dealing with tough stains like animal feces. Make sure you blot up as much liquid from the accident as possible before you apply a foam or spray-on stain remover.Follow directions given by the stain remover's manufacturer.

Fill a bathtub with warm water and 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) mild cleanser. Lightly agitate the sheepskin in the water for five minutes and roll it up to squeeze out the water. Put it in your washing machine on the spin cycle to further remove excess water and lay it out to dry for the day.


Lay the sheepskin out to dry away from direct sunlight.
Use a metal brush to comb out the wool after it dries., To eliminate odors and freshen up fur and sheepskin rugs sans water, sprinkle unscented talcum powder or baking soda on your rug. Leave the powder on for a few hours, shake and brush out, and repeat as needed., If your rug is small enough to put in the washing machine and the care instructions do not advise against it, throw it in there. Adjust the washing machine cycle to gentle first, place the rug in a pillowcase or mesh bag and tumble dry on low.

Inquire about the rating of the carpet.,
Consider wool carpet.,
Man made carpets would be the best choice for heavy traffic.,
Polyester is another good carpet as it is easy to clean and repels water based stains.,
Color consideration.",How to Choose a Good Carpet," If you plan to put a carpet in the bedroom, then it won't have as much ""traffic"" as a carpet in the living room.;
, This is something to think about with any carpet, especially carpets that are going to be used in a dining room or play room area where there will be a steady stream of food or possibilities for spills.

, Indoor carpeting is normally rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. Carpets with a 5 rating are considered the best for heavy traffic areas. Rating of 4 are considered outstanding and recommended for heavy traffic areas of your home.

, The highest quality of carpet you can buy is a carpet made out of wool. Wool carpets are very expensive, but greatly out perform any other man made carpet.

, If you have a high traffic area, then nylon would be an ideal choice due to the durability. Nylon is stain resistant as well, and repels mildew.

, Polyester is known for the look and feel of wool, although it is much less expensive.

, Light colored carpets create an effect of a larger space, although they do tend to show stains more easily. Dark carpets on the other hand tend to absorb light, giving a room what many know as the ""cozy feeling"".

Pull up staples left from the padding.,
Clean the floor.,
Prepare for the new flooring.",How to Take Out Carpet,"


Do you want to save what's underneath the carpet? Some older houses have ugly, old carpet right over hardwood floors. Pull up a corner of the carpet and see what's underneath if you haven't yet.
Will you put down new carpet, or hire someone to do so? If so, you may wish to leave the tack strips in place if they are in good condition. Ask the installers you will hire what they prefer.
Will you lay tile, vinyl, wood, or another hard floor?;
, Carpet may cost money to dispose of, so shop around.


If you want the installers of the new floor to haul away the old carpet, make sure they know in advance and figure it into your price. Also, make sure that they know not to charge you for the time to tear out the carpet or move furniture.
Call the dump where you usually take or send your trash and find out what they charge for disposal. Some may charge a different rate for carpet, so be sure to mention that it is carpet.
Make sure you have some way to haul away the carpet you will discard. Hauling services are often available, as are rental trucks. Check out your phone book and see what you find.

, You will need access to the entire floor. Remember that you have to put that furniture somewhere, so decide where you can put it. You may be able to move it to adjacent rooms where you are not yet carpeting; place it outside (cover it if there is any chance of moisture); or rent a storage area temporarily.

, This step is optional, but it will help to cut down on dust as you pull up the carpet.

, Wear heavy work gloves, since you will be working around staples, tacks, and rough carpet edges. Also, wear sturdy, thick-soled, close-toed shoes that will protect your feet if you step on a tack strip or staple.

, Use pliers to grip the fibers if you need to.

,


If you are trying to salvage the floor underneath, make sure you do not cut grooves in the floor with the knife. One way to do this is to lift the carpet away from the floor as you cut. Another way is to remove the carpet in larger pieces and cut it up somewhere else.
Know what a manageable strip is. The roll you produce must be something you can lift and move, and it must fit in whatever vehicle will be used to transport the old carpet away.

, In most cases, the carpet padding will also need to be replaced or removed. It should be replaced if it is old or stained or has gotten wet. Carpet padding is usually just stapled down. Pull it up, cut it into smaller strips if necessary for handling, and roll it as you did the carpet.

,, Wedge a flat bar (pry bar) underneath of the tack strip (the strip with nails coming through to the top). Make sure you have gloves and eye protection, because it can pop up and puncture skin.

, Pliers and a flat-bladed screwdriver will help get underneath.

, Sweep or vacuum as necessary to remove debris left from the old carpet

, This is a golden opportunity to repair squeaks and repair damage.


Drive long wood screws into the sub-floor and through to floor joists anywhere the floor squeaks.
Apply a stain-blocking primer to prevent old stains from coming up through new carpet.
Level the sub-floor and replace any water-damaged wood, as needed.
Touch up paint on baseboards and around the bottom of door frames. Be sure to allow ample time for paint to dry before installing new carpet.

Position both pieces together.,
Melt the tape with a seaming iron.,
Make the seam look neater.",How to Seam Carpet," You should plan the seam so that it falls out in an area that gets very little foot traffic. For instance, placing it an area that will be underneath furniture is better than placing it in the center of your room.


Hiding the seam also makes it less noticeable. Even a good seam may still be seen from time to time, so hiding it will make your room look more professional and neat.;
, The two pieces of carpet should overlap by 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) when you lay them down.Each piece of carpet you seam should be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) wide.
Make sure that you match the nap on the pieces of carpet being seamed together. Similarly, if the carpet has a pattern on it, that should also be matched.

, Use white chalk to mark a line along the back side of your top piece of carpet. This line should be about half the width of your overlap.


In other words, the line should be 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.75 cm) from the edge of the carpet, depending on how much overlap you have.

, Use a sharp blade to cut along the chalked line.


This edge will be the new edge of you top piece, so cut as straight a line as possible. Using a straightedge, like a yardstick or meter stick, may help.
Do not cut into the bottom piece while trimming the top.
Ideally, you should use a special carpet knife to make this cut. In the absence of a carpet knife, a standard utility knife might work, but it will not be as easy or practical to use.
Angle the cutter slightly, by about 5 degrees, to cut away a bit more backing than fiber.

, Press the top piece firmly against the bottom piece and make a series of 2-inch (5-cm) cuts into the bottom piece along the edge of the top. Using these cuts as a guide, trim the edge of the bottom piece down completely.


The guiding cuts should be 2 to 3 feet (61 to 91 cm) apart.
Use a straightedge and carpet knife to trim the bottom piece. You may want to use scissors to cut from the edge of the carpet to the center of each guiding cut, however, to help you find the guiding cuts more easily when trimming the overall edge.

, The two pieces should fit together perfectly now. Carefully lift up one edge and use chalk to mark a line on the floor along the other edge.


This is not entirely necessary, but if your carpet gets bumped as you work, you can use this line to help match up the edges again.

, Place a wide strip of double-sided tape on the floor, centering it between both edges of both pieces.This tape should be centered over the chalk line you drew on the floor earlier.
Keep both edges folded back during this step. Do not lay them back down until instructed to do so.
With both pieces of carpet out of the way and the tape perfectly centered between them, carefully peel off the protective paper on top of the tape.

, Lay one edge of the carpet down, pressing it firmly on the double-sided tape.


Do not lower the other carpet piece yet.

, Spread a thin, consistent line of carpet seam adhesive along the edge of your flattened piece. Make sure that the adhesive is as close to this edge as possible.


Use enough adhesive to form an even line all the way down the edge. You need more than a few small beads, but you should not apply the adhesive in globs, either.

, Carefully let down the other piece of carpet, flattening its edge against the edge of the first piece and into the seam adhesive.


Wiggle and butt the edges together as needed to join them together evenly. If the two edges buckle, press down on them until you can smooth it out.
Keep the nap stays out of the adhesive. Only the back of the carpet should be cemented in place.

, Clean off any adhesive with a damp rag while the adhesive is still wet. You should also pass over the seam with a rolling pin or seam roller to fix it in place more securely.


When the adhesive dries, use a carpet brush and brush the fibers along the seam. Doing so will help mask the seam.
This completes the process if you are using seam adhesive.

, Seam ironing is an alternative to seam adhesive. You will still need to follow the same preparation and positioning steps, however.


In other words, follow the steps listed in the ""Positioning the Seam"" section but skip the steps mentioned in the ""Applying Seam Adhesive"" section.

,


Make sure that the sealer stays on the bottom portion of the carpet and does not work its way into the fibers on top.
The sealer will help prevent the carpet from unraveling.
Work quickly. The sealer needs to remain wet throughout the rest of the process.

, Lay a piece of seaming tape down the chalk line on your floor. The tape should be 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and extend the entire length of the seam.


Since seaming tape is not double sided, you may need to hold the edges down with a weight or board to prevent the tape from moving as you work.

, Unroll both edges, starting with the sealed edge and ending with the unsealed edge. Firmly press the edges together on the floor.


Note that the seam between the two pieces should be centered over the seaming tape.
The seam sealer you applied to the first edge should get on the second edge during this step, thereby preventing the second piece from unraveling, as well.

, Use a special seaming iron and press the carpet into the seaming tape. Work your way down the entire seam.


The adhesive on the tape melts and becomes stickier as you heat it. Make sure that you push both edges into this hot adhesive as you work.
After working your way down the carpet, gently tug on the pieces. If the seam appears loose at any point down the shared edge, go back over that point with your seaming iron.

, Clean up any residual sealer you see using the cleaner recommended on the sealer label. Once the adhesive dries, you should also brush the carpet with a carpet brush to help mask the seam.

This step completes the process if you are using a seaming iron.

Clean the rug.,
Moth-proof the rug after cleaning.,
Take care of humidity.,
Roll the rug for storage.,
Consider wrapping the rug in plastic or canvas cloth to protect it from dust.",How to Store Rugs," If any part of the rug is soiled, it needs to be cleaned. Whatever is left on a rug can attract vermin, insects, or simply cause deterioration on its own account. If you are not sure how to clean the rug, read its label or seek professional advice.


Always vacuum a rug before storing; this will remove dander, flea eggs, dust mites, etc., prior to storage. Use an appropriate setting on the vacuum so as not to damage it. If it cannot be vacuumed, at least beat the rug outdoors and leave it to air in sunshine for a day before storing.






See the Related articles for a range of cleaning help for different types of rugs.





;
, There are a couple of choices here: either moth-proof the rug professionally using a commercial treatment, or use your own moth-proof treatments that you'd use for any stored fabrics in the home. The value of the rug should be accounted for when deciding which method to prefer.

, Humidity can cause a rug to curl at the edges, especially when humidity levels are constantly changing. Try to keep the storage space as dry and cool as possible. Keeping the storage temperature as even as possible is also very important.


If the rug has curled, try pinning it down to the floor with double-sided tape for a way (heavy-duty). If not, then try steaming it back into shape.







, If you fold the rug, it will gain permanent crease lines that are very hard, if not impossible, to remove and the fibers will be weakened at all bend points. Tie into a roll gently using twine or similar item.

, Do not use plastic if temperature changes will impact the storage space, as this will cause condensation. A canvas cloth or sheet will do an excellent job of keeping off dust, cobwebs, and the like.

Look closely at the pulled loop of carpet.,
Place one knitting needle, screwdriver, or other long, thin tool through the snagged loop of carpet.,
Using another knitting needle, screwdriver, or other long, thin tool, pull up the next loop in the carpet so that the snagged loop is pulled back down.,
Repeat this process, weaving the yarn through the backing, each time making the new pulled-out loop of carpet just a little smaller than the previous one.,


,
Alternately, if the berber yarn has pulled more than just a few loops, the row(s) can be cut out and a new section of yarn can be fastened back into the area needing repair.,
Either way, use a new, sharp utility knife and cut out the backing of the area that needs repairing.,If small snags are noted anywhere in berber, use sharp tool and gently press snag to where it is level with surrounding yarn.",How to Repair a Snag in Berber Carpet," Identify where the yarn is woven into the backing material and where it comes out to form the next loop. You may need to pull on the snagged loop to identify where the yarn goes next.;
, This will prevent you from pulling the loop all the way through the backing.

, This may take some force. Leave the original snagged loop just slightly larger than the surrounding loops of carpet, so that the newly pulled-out loop is slightly smaller than the original snag.

, Eventually you can work the snag back into the fabric of the carpet. The amount of time and number of loops this will take depends on how big the original snag is.

,, This can be accomplished if you have some left-over berber from when the carpet was originally installed. If not, a small closet can be used for ""donor"" material.

, Cut close to the good rows of yarn without cutting into them. Take your donor carpet and match the pattern to the repair area. Cut a patch to fit the repair area, test fit, remove, put blob of hot glue in area of repair, place piece back into repair. Make sure repaired section is level with surrounding berber.

, Use duct tape to outline a square section to be removed. Check the position of the tape with the measurements taken previously to make sure the inside edge of the tape matches those dimensions.


Try to farm the replacement carpet from an inconspicuous area, such as inside a closet or underneath a bed. Be sure that the place you farm the replacement carpet from isn't going to be visible.
You can also keep extra carpet in your attic or storage for repairing damaged areas.

, Use a utility knife or a carpet cutting tool to gently cut along the inside edge of the duct tape. Apply just enough pressure to cut through both the surface of the carpet and the backing, but not enough to damage the underlying layer of padding. Once the section is completely cut, lift it off the carpet surface.


If working with a carpet cutting tool, use the tool to first make an imprint. Once an imprint has been made, attach the cutter blades and the pivot screw and make your incision, rotating as many as two or three times in order to remove it.

, Turn a carpet remnant face down and measure a patch for the carpeting, using the measurements obtained earlier as a guideline. Mark the lines of the patch with the pencil, and then use a utility knife or carpet cutter to cut out the patch.

, Neutralize the disk temporarily by putting a small amount of water on it. Lift the edges of the carpeting around the hole and slide the adhesive disk underneath, with the adhesive side facing upward.


Make sure that the adhesive disk is significantly larger than replacement patch: you want the disk to hold onto all of the replacement patch, especially the corners, as well as some surrounding carpet.
When the patch becomes sticky again, in about three to five minutes, press down on the outer edge of the carpet to secure it into place.

, Groom away any loose carpet fibers from the edge of the hole. Check the fit before applying any glue. Then, put down a thin layer of carpet glue along the edges of the adhesive disk. Place the patch into the hole, taking care to make sure the fit is snug and even. Press lightly to allow the backing on the patch to come into contact with the underlying tape and adhere properly.


Align the patch so that the direction of the fibers in the patch match the direction of the fibers in the rest of the carpet.
You have about 15 minutes to position and align the patch perfectly before the glue sets, permanently anchoring your patch in place. Work quickly.

, Depending on the type of pile, this may be accomplished by brushing the fingers around the perimeter of the patch, or using a carpet brush to train the pile on the patch to move in the same direction as the rest of the carpeting pile.


You can also vacuum the section with an agitator attachment to lift up the pile.

Rectangular patches can be cut using a utility knife, while circular patches can be cut using a circular carpet cutter.

, Use a utility knife or a carpet cutting tool to gently cut away the carpet. Apply just enough pressure to cut through both the surface of the carpet and the backing, but not enough to damage the underlying layer of padding. Once the section is completely cut, lift it off the carpet surface.


You may want to save the damaged section in case you need to patch a smaller area that can be cut from this section.

, Turn a carpet remnant face down and measure a patch for the carpeting, using the measurements obtained earlier as a guideline. Or remove a piece of carpeting from an inconspicuous area, such as the inside of a closet. Mark the lines of the patch with the pencil, and then use a utility knife or carpet cutter to cut out the patch.

, Carpet patch pads are used to iron on specially made adhesive disks that activate with the help of heat. Your carpet patch pad may be aluminum-sided on the top and contain a previous material on the bottom. Wet your carpet patch pad under water and wring out the excess; the pad should be damp but not dripping.

, Make sure the adhesive pad is adequately bigger than the patch, specially made for heat-application, and centered for even distribution. Smooth out any wrinkles if necessary

, Go over the patch with a carpet brush to remove loose fibers. Make sure that the direction of the fibers on the patch matches the direction of the fibers on the carpet.

, Make sure the patch pad is centered and you know where the patch is underneath.

, Press down on the iron so that the heat transfers from the patch pad, through the carpet, to the adhesive pad underneath. Remember that the adhesive pad activates when subjected to heat.


You should hear a light sizzle when you touch the iron onto the patch pad. This is the water reacting to the heat, not the carpet burning.
If the patch is big, go over different spots the patch with the iron — enough to cover the entire patch. You don't want to fail to activate the head beneath the patch.

, The glue on the adhesive pad won't fully dry until the carpet is cool. Go over the patch with a carpet brush and remove any loose fibers from the edge of the carpet.

There's nothing expensive required, and everything should be available at any hardware store:


Heavy duty leather gloves with a padded palm are essential to keeping you hands safe. You might encounter sharp nails or tacks while pulling up carpet, and a good pair of gloves will also help you grip the carpet. A dust-mask is also a good protective barrier to use, especially if you have asthma or other respiratory problems.
To pry up the carpet and tacks, you'll need a pry bar, pliers, and a hammer. While you can start ripping the carpet up with your hands, getting it started and tearing it free will require some help.
To keep the job clean, it's also good to have a roll of duct tape to roll up the carpet and move it after you've cut it loose, as well as a utility knife to cut strips of carpet.;
, Obviously, you'll need to move everything on top of the carpet out of the room and off the carpet before you start pulling it up. This can actually be more time-intesnive of a process than pulling the carpet up, which shouldn't take more than 45 minutes or an hour to remove with the right technique.


Find temporary homes for beds, chairs, bookcases, and other furniture in the room that's having carpet replaced. Move the furniture carefully into the new space. Don't worry about pushing it over the old carpet and ruining it, since it's coming up anyway.

, You need to get anything out of the way that will keep the corners of the carpet from coming up easily. Take off any molding or other edging that might be found between the wall and the floor.


For the most part, carpet shouldn't be caught beneath the molding or the baseboard, because it's not usually installed that way. If you're replacing it you should probably remove it anyway, before you start with the carpet, but if you're going to keep it, it's best to leave it on.

, If you’re remodeling an entire room, it’d be silly to put in brand new carpet before you paint the walls. Using the old carpet as a drop cloth to collect all the paint drippings before you move forward can be a real time saver. In most remodeling projects, it's best to replace the carpet as the final step in the job.

, Old carpet can be a real dust trap, and you’ll make it a lot easier on yourself by cleaning it up a bit before you tear it out. Don't wrestle with damp, dusty, or super-dirty

, For most jobs, it's recommended that you start in the back corner and move toward the door, but anywhere is fine. Corners are the easiest places to work the carpet up, because you've got a nice little edge to grab onto.


If the carpet is already coming up anywhere, start there. Sometimes carpet will start to peel at the edges, or pets will dig at it and make your job a whole lot easier. Start wherever makes your job the most convenient.

, When you've selected your starting point, grip onto the carpet with your pliers and tug upward firmly. Don't jerk too hard, or you may rip the carpet and have to start over. Once you get a good chunk of it up, you can use your hands to start pulling backward.

, From the corner, work the pry bar along both edges, helping to ease the carpeting up and away from the floor. There will likely be carpet tacks that will be quite sticky, making it a lot easier to use the pry bar. Continue pulling and using the bar to separate the carpet from the floor as evenly as possible.


Remove the carpet tacks as you find them. Look for tacks that might be attached to the bottom of the carpet. Use a pry bar and run it across the bottom of the carpet to ensure they come off before you roll it up.

, Follow the carpet down one wall and then another until the carpet has been pulled up and is loose in a large, flag-shaped portion. Keep pulling and folding the carpet back on itself until you've got a big manageable strip that you can carry.Don't try to pull all the carpet up at once, or you'll have a mess on your hands. To keep it clean, it's best to take off substantial, but manageable pieces at a time. A good eyeball estimate is no more than two or three feet deep, when the carpet is folded over. In other words, pull up six feet of carpet, times the width of the room. That'll be plenty heavy for you and a helper.

, When you fold the carpet back, use the utility knife to cut that section of carpet away and roll it up as evenly as possible. Even if it's a misshapen section of carpet, try to roll it up into a little bundle so it will be easier to carry. Use duct tape to secure the end of the roll, then have an assistant take one end and you take the other end, and discard the carpet.


Eventually, you’ll work through the entire carpet in this basic way. Pull up a section, cut it into a strip using a utility knife, and roll it up. This will make it easier to remove from the room and dispose of.

, Carpet pads are vapor barriers that are installed under some types of carpeting. Some floors might not have any carpet pad at all. If there is a pad, it should be lighter and easier to remove than the actual carpet, but you can use the same basic technique if necessary. Start at one corner, pull up the pad, and cut it into manageable strips.

, For the most part, you can dispose of old ratty carpet at any garbage drop site in your town. Different areas have different rules about putting carpet out on the curb, though, so you'll want to check with the local authorities to find out about garbage pick-up where you live.


Carpet American Recovery Effort (CARE) is an organization that collects old carpeting to recycle and use as the foundation for a variety of products, including new carpet padding and even lumber.It's available in 26 states in the US and makes for a good alternative to throwing it out.
When you replace your carpeting, consider purchasing from Mohawk, Shaw, Miliken, or Flor, which are all carpet dealers that incorporate recycled materials into their new products.

, If you're not going to reinstall carpet on the new floor, pull up the tackstrips by hand. They should come up relatively easily, as long as you're wearing your heavy gloves. Use the pry-bar if necessary.


If you are going to reinstall carpeting, inspect the tackstrips for wear and determine whether or not they're reusable. If they're dull, loose, or otherwise worn out, consider pulling them up and replacing them anyway.
It's also a good idea to keep an eye out for any extra carpet nails, screws, or tacks that might be on the floor after removing the carpet. Sweep them or gather them up by hand and throw them out. Sometimes there'll be a lot of staples, which can be a pain to remove. Use your pliers to pull them up, and make sure you get them all.

, Carpeting uses different types of adhesives, and some require a simple scraping while others will require a more thorough cleaning. Clean up the sub-floor as best as possible.


Look for a floor cleaner that removes adhesives, if scraping doesn't the glue off like you want. You can find it in your local hardware store.

, It's very important, regardless of what you want to do with the room next, that you inspect the condition of the subfloor and make any repairs necessary while you've got the carpet off. It'd be a shame to install $800 worth of new carpet over a squeaky floor, or a floor showing signs of mold.


Walk around the sub-floor and bounce on it. Subfloor panels should be attached to the wood joists with screws or nails, and if you find some panels that squeak, you can secure it to the joist with ring shank nails. These are grooved nails with more secure gripping power, decreasing the chances that this squeaky area will ever squeak again. About two or three inches from the previous nail or screw, hammer in a shank nail and you'll be set.
If your carpeting was damaged or wet, it might have impacted the subfloor. Look for signs of rot or mold. If you see any signs of serious damage or rot, you need to have these panels replaced before installing new flooring.

, Once you're done making your repairs, sweep or shop-vac up the remaining debris and glue-scrapings from the job before moving forward with installation. Once you've removed old carpet, you can install new carpet, laminate, or other types of flooring.

Dangers from carpet removal include injury by nails or tacks, inhalation of dust and contact with mildew or mold. If you have a sensitive respiratory system or you suspect mold, wear a breathing mask.

,, Go to the corner of the room and pull up at the edge with the pliers. It is likely that you will be removing the carpet from tack strips that help to pull the carpet and hold it down at the corners.

, This will loosen the carpet and allow you to take off entire lengths of it.

, This will allow you to roll it up from the end and carry it out in manageable strips. Carpet is extremely heavy, so it is a good idea to remove it in pieces unless you plan on saving the entire piece.

, Use force to pull up as much of the foam as you can. There will be little pieces of foam stuck to staples that you will remove later.

, These are very securely attached to the ground in 2 to 4 foot (0.6 to 1.2 m) sections.


Place the small pry bar under a corner or edge of the tack strip. Tap the pry bar with the hammer to insert it further underneath. In most cases, the nails will come out of the flooring as you bring up the tack strips. Continue going around the room to remove all the tack strips with the pry bar.
If you want to keep the quality of hardwood floor beneath a tack strip, place a small piece of wood beneath the pry bar to avoid dents and scrapes.

,, You will need to carry a container to place the staples in, so you do not leave them on the ground.


Use a flat head screwdriver or a pair of pliers to yank out the staples 1 by 1. This is a fairly tedious job in large carpeted areas.

, The light should flash on metal surfaces. Sweep the floor to ensure you get up any pieces of metal before you start your cleaning process.

Unroll the carpet in direct sunlight.,
Roll it up in the opposite fashion.,
Leave it back-rolled for a few hours.,
Just give it some time.,
Weigh your carpet down.,
Have the carpet professionally steamed.",How to Make a Carpet Lay Flat1," For the most exposure, unroll your carpet outside as long as it’s sunny and within 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 29 degrees Celsius). If that isn’t possible, choose an area within your home that has adequate floor space and receives direct sunlight. Adjust your thermostat to keep the temperature between 70 and 85 degrees F. Let your carpet sit for at least four hours (or better yet, as long as daylight lasts).The absorption of heat and light will help reduce the carpet’s tension, which will make further steps more effective.;
, This is known as “back-rolling” or “reverse-rolling.” Roll the carpet back up after it has sat in the sun for a few hours. Only this time, roll it so that the side that originally faced outward (usually the carpet’s underside) is now on the inside of your roll. As you do:Work slowly. Keep an ear out for any cracking noises as you roll. If you hear any, quit right away. This indicates damage to the carpet’s skeleton.
Don’t roll it as tight as before. Keep your reverse roll fairly loose. This will reduce the chance of cracking and the creation of new creases and curls. If you heard any cracks during your first attempt, try again with a much looser roll.

, Give the carpet some time for its tension to relax. Then lay it out again and see how well it worked. If needed, redo your reverse roll and repeat., If you're not in a particular rush for a perfect looking carpet, just lay it out as is for the time being. Give it a few days or even weeks to relax itself on its own. You can also try laying it upside down or alternating between the two positions., Set a piece of furniture or any other suitably heavy object(s) on both corners of one end of your carpet. Then pull the carpet taut by its free end to stretch it out. Inspect the area in between for creases and curls. Smooth them out by hand and place weights on them, as well. Pull the carpet taut again by its free end before weighing down both of its corners, too.To make life easier, ask a partner for help. This way one person can keep the carpet pull and relax the carpet as needed while the other deals with creases and curls in the middle.
For small carpets, you can probably just use a few strategically placed piles of heavy objects like books, potted plants, or actual weights.
For larger carpets, use large furniture with a large surface area, like overturned coffee or end tables, to cover more area.

, Bring the carpet into a local rug store that offers steaming services, rather than hire a cleaner to do the job at your house. Though there might be exceptions, expect at-home cleaners to only be familiar with how to clean a carpet. So bring it to a store that specializes in rugs instead, where the staff should be able to assess and treat the problem with your particular carpet.For example, steaming should work just fine if the carpet was simply rolled up for an extended period. However, if the carpet won't lie flat for some other reason (like poor construction) that steaming won't fix, a rug specialist will be able to spot this and say so before you waste money on the service.

,, Use a utility knife to cut out the shapes, pressing firmly. You may have to make 2 passes with the knife.

,, Trace it with a felt tipped marker.

,, Work from the underside of the rug, pressing the cut out pieces firmly into the base.


You will probably have a lot of carpet fibers showing on the underside of the rug. They can be integrated into the rug by taking a flat head screwdriver and running it around the edges where the carpet pieces meet.

, You can also use duct tape.

, Lay down a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) line of carpet glue along the edges of the rug.

, Allow to dry thoroughly.

Learn how to deal with carpet cleaning and care problems with these great tips.;
, The humble doormat does wonders to reduce the amount of sand and dirt tracked into the home. Invest a few dollars in doormats to expand the life of your carpet and keep it clean longer.

, Yes – daily. If you have difficulty getting to the daily task of vacuuming, then consider purchasing an inexpensive robotic vacuum like those made by iRobot. Daily vacuuming helps pick up dirt and debris before it sinks deep into the carpet. Less dirt expands the life of your carpet.

, Not only will a quick clean reduce the rate of absorption but it also helps reduce the bacteria and other problems associated with a spill.

, A lot of products on the market claim to remove stains, spills and odors but simply mask them or drive them deeper. The stains eventually re-appear looking worse than ever. Don’t spend your hard earned money on inferior products when for just a little more money you can have your carpets professionally cleaned with top quality products.

, Deep carpet cleaning is essential to remove deep set dirt, dust, pollen, and other pollutants but don’t add to the problem by allowing the use of harmful chemicals. Instead, search for a company that uses environmentally friendly “green” carpet cleaning solutions.

, Even when a carpet looks clean it can harbor harmful bacteria that give off unpleasant odors. Ask about enzymatic cleaning products capable of eliminating – not masking – odors.

, Over time carpets tends to become impacted due to constant traffic and dirt so it is a good idea to have the carpet raked and groomed after a deep cleaning. You might be surprised to find out how good your carpet looks after it has been professionally cleaned and groomed.

Lay out your carpet’s padding first.,
Install tack strips.,
Lay out your carpet.,
Start “kicking” one edge into the place.,
Work toward that wall’s corners.,
Repeat with each wall.,
Use a lever-activated stretcher if needed.",How to Make a Carpet Lay Flat2," If you’re installing wall-to-wall carpeting, clear the area of all furniture, plus the floor covering to be replaced (if you have any). Then cover the subfloor from wall to wall with carpet padding. Staple the padding to the subfloor to secure it in place., These are generally an inch (2.5 cm) wide, but may be as long as four feet (1.2 m), so saw or cut them to length as needed. Place each strip end-to-end on the floor, leaving about a half-inch (1.25 cm) of space between the strips and the wall. Nail them into place through the padding until you’ve lined all of the room’s edges.For heavier carpets, you may wish to add a second row of tack strips. If you do, place these on the first row’s farthest side from the wall.
Always leave a half-inch gap in between the wall and the nearest strip. You’ll need to keep this space clear in order to worm the carpet’s edges underneath the baseboards.

, Unroll it over the carpet padding. If the carpet is one solid color, simply line up its corners with the room’s. If it’s patterned, double-check its orientation to make sure it’s lined up the way you want it. For instance:Say you’re using the same carpeting in this room and the hallway outside. For a more seamless look, orient it the same way in both areas. So if the pattern incorporates, say, pine trees, arrange the carpet so the treetops all point in the same direction.

, Choose a wall to start working along. Once you do, start in the middle of that wall. Set the head of a knee kicker on the carpet, roughly four to five inches (10 to 13 cm) from the baseboard, at a 90 degree angle to the wall. Then:Hold the kicker firmly in place by its handle with your dominant hand. Kneel on your opposite leg’s knee and support yourself with your other hand.
Drive your dominant side’s knee into the base of the knee kicker to drive the carpet toward the wall. Repeat until the edge of the carpet slightly overlaps the baseboard.
Press the carpet in that area into the tack strip below to secure it into place.

, Once you’ve secured the middle of your first edge to the floor, move a couple feet to either side. Set the knee kicker’s head on the carpet, about four to five inches from the wall. This time, however, set it so it’s at a 45 degree angle with the wall, with the base pointing toward the center of the room. Except for that one difference, drive and secure the rug into place in the same fashion as before.Depending on the length of your wall, repeat every couple of feet until you reach the corner. Then switch to the other side from where you started and continue until you reach the other corner.
Setting the kicker at a 45 degree angle to the wall as you work toward the corners will help stretch out any creases toward the center of the carpet.

, Start with the opposite wall to keep the carpeting aligned with the others as you work. Secure its edge along that wall as you did with the first. Then do the same with the other walls. Check your carpeting for creases as you go along. If the knee kicker isn’t doing the job of stretching them out on its own:


Detach the carpet from the tack strips so you can do it over with the extra aid of a lever-activated stretcher., If you have to do the job over, repeat the knee-kicker steps along one wall. Only this time, don’t press the carpet down into the tack strip once you finish with that. Instead, use a lever-activated stretcher to pull the carpet even tauter toward the wall before securing it in place.


The principle of a lever stretcher is the same. The only difference is in its operation. With these, you pump a lever up and down instead of using your knee.These are also a good alternative if you have a very large project or prior knee injuries. The repeated force of impact when using a knee kicker extensively can lead to physical trauma.

Inject glue along the edges.,
Work your way inward.,
Press into place.,
Reinforce contact while the glue dries.",How to Make a Carpet Lay Flat3," First, purchase a container of carpet seam sealer large enough to address the amount of floor area in question. Additionally, pick up a food syringe. Remove the sealer’s cap and draw an adequate amount into your syringe., First, locate the bubble. Feel with your fingers to estimate its circumference. Once you have an idea of where its edges are, grip its center with a pair of pliers. Then puncture the center with the syringe’s needle., Continue lifting the bubble up by its center with the pliers. As you do, angle the syringe’s needle toward the edge of the bubble. Push the needle farther in as needed in order to reach the edge. Then push down on the syringe’s plunger to line the subfloor with glue along the bubble’s edge. Rotate the syringe as you work in order to apply a circular line of glue., Continue applying glue in the same fashion. As you do, start drawing the needle out of the carpet. Create concentric circles of glue underneath the carpet spiraling in toward the center of the bubble., Once you have drawn the needle all the way out, set the syringe aside. Starting from the center of the bubble, use your hands to push the edge into the subfloor. Ensure the glue makes contact with the carpet’s underside while spreading it out at the same time for wider contact. From there, continue outward toward the bubble’s edges., Use a rolling pin to smooth the carpet even further once you’ve finished pressing the bubble down into place with your hands. Then set weights over the area to keep the glue in contact with the carpet until it sets. Check the glue’s instructions regarding drying times. Leave the weights in place for at least that long."

Set down a runner.,
Layer rugs over carpet.,
Arrange your rugs to create a sense of organization.,
Create contrast with different types of rugs.,
Draw attention to other furnishings.,
Provide eye-catching texture.",How to Layer Rugs," A couple rugs can make a welcome addition to lifeless gaps that disrupt a room’s furnishings, like the vacant area in the middle of the living room or the foot of the bed. By adding rugs to these places, you can tie the room together and prevent negative space from becoming visually jarring.Start with a basic layering scheme—neutral texture on bottom, fancy colors and patterns on top.
Use rugs to cover awkward bare patches in front of couches, hearths and entryways.;
, Elevated pieces like coffee tables, bakers racks and wire shelves can look isolated when set apart by themselves. Rugs provide a useful foundation that roots floating decor with a base of delightful color and texture. The right pairing will let the eye transition seamlessly from the floor upwards.Choosing bright hues and eye-catching designs can help you refocus attention to the important parts of the room.
Double up extra large rugs to go under an entire seating area., Stacking up your rugs can offer function as well as fashion. If your home is outfitted with high-risk flooring, such as light-colored carpet or hardwood, it could likely benefit from a defensive barrier. A dual layer of rugs will safeguard easily-damaged floors from spills, scratches and other accidents.Opt for rugs with dark colors and short, neat fibers. These are generally easier to clean and won’t show stains as readily.
Spare hardwood and tile from from being marked up by sliding chairs or barstools.

, The difference in size will leave a portion of the underlying rug exposed, producing a harmonious framing effect. This is probably the simplest way to layer rugs, and one of the most pleasant and effective from a design standpoint.Top elaborately patterned rugs with neutral colors in rooms in need of a modest infusion of flair.Make sure the rugs are made to the same basic dimensions. Otherwise, concentric layering can end up looking lopsided., If your goal is to make a given room look a little more relaxed, leaving the rugs slightly askew will help you achieve this. Uneven layers will also allow you to switch things up in areas with overly linear organization and fill oddly-shaped nooks.For a more effortlessly casual style, drape the rugs in a more or less random manner.
You can also offset rugs at regular intervals, keeping the edges and corners lined up, to add depth without making the setup look sloppy.

, An oblong or rectangular rug stretched over a broader covering performs the same function as a traditional table runner, only from below. Position a long, narrow patterned rug in the center of a wider neutral one serving as a base. You can reserve a space for a combination runner under a dining table, inside an alcove or down the middle of a short hallway.Layered runner rugs tend to look best when they’re the same length but differ in width.
Assemble your own custom runner by connecting several smaller rugs., Disrupt the monotony of plain, dull carpeting with an array of attractive rugs. For instance, a bold solid color draped over an intricate woven pattern can lend a much-need jolt of personality to a basic beige carpet. A good rule of thumb is to look for layers that fall at the opposite end of the design spectrum of your base, such as bold or dark colors on top of lighter ones, or vibrant designs that offer a place for the eye to wander above neutral carpets.As an added bonus, these rugs can be swapped out at any time, giving you a nearly unlimited number of decorating options.Use a rug a that’s close to the carpeting, but not an exact match, to highlight subtle textural shifts.

, Layered rugs can be used to separate or define individual areas within a single room for an orderly, compartmentalized layout. This will not only make a smaller room look bigger, but will also make large rooms appear more put together. In this case, it's best to configure individual rugs in neat, precise angles.Look for rugs in various shapes and sizes to find one that’s just right for the space you’re trying to fill.Keep the rugs close together in their separate zones to keep your floor space from becoming too chaotic., There’s little sense in using more than one rug if they all do the same job. While selecting the rugs themselves, go with designs that are complementary in shade and pattern yet still visually distinct. The result will be an elegant contrast that adds extra depth without throwing the room out of balance.Contrast can come from color, texture, size or pattern, meaning you have an abundance of styles to choose from when personalizing your quarters.
Experiment using rugs with mismatched shapes, like a fuzzy fur thrown over a flat area rug, or a circular rug extending from the corner of a square one., Rather than serving as focal decoration themselves, layered rugs can be strategically configured to lure a visitor’s eye to a particular spot. Situate the rugs near another piece or fixture you want to show off, such as a unusual vintage settee, flower arrangement or well-stocked bookshelf.A well-placed rug arrangement makes a good method of presentation for impressive decor.
Alternatively, you could attract attention by placing the rugs opposite the intended focal point for a kind of mirror-image symmetry.

, For more modern living spaces heavy on smooth, solid finishes, a few rugs with lush grains can keep the overall atmosphere from coming off as sterile. Similarly, if your home is filled with detailed surfaces like natural wood, marble, flat, smooth rugs will help pull the room in the other direction. There’s a rug (or three) for every home.Thick, plush rugs invite onlookers to relax in comfort, while rugs woven out of natural materials like leather, seagrass or rattan hint at contemporary style and sophistication.Faux animal hides are a versatile choice when other types of rugs don’t quite suit their surroundings."

Secure the seams.",How to Relay Carpet," Using a pair of pliers, grab a corner of your carpet. Gently lift the carpet up and towards you, away from the corner. Pulling too hard and fast will only tear carpet fibers from the carpet.If you’re having trouble getting your carpet up with pliers, use a knee kicker to loosen the carpet. Place the knee kicker on the carpet about four inches (eight centimeters) from the area of wall you wish to peel back. Drive your knee into the knee kicker with moderate force. You should see the carpet bunch up against the wall. Grip the bunched-up section with pliers and peel it back.
Once your carpet is loose, continue pulling until you’ve removed the area you wish to re-lay. Don’t pull the carpet past doorways or you risk breaking a seam.;
, Use a utility knife to slice the carpet into smaller, more manageable sections. The strips should be about one meter (three feet) wide. Mark each strip with a number or letter so that you know how they fit together when you re-lay them later., If you decide that the pad is in good condition, you’ll need to use a flathead screwdriver and pliers to remove all the staples. Pry the staples up with the pliers, then drive the flat edge of the screwdriver beneath them to pop them out. Use care so as not to tear the pad.Do not try to pull the pad up without removing the staples. The pad will rip.
Signs that your carpet should not be laid again include an uneven surface, wrinkles, and a crinkling sound when it is walked on.If your carpet pad was installed over concrete, it will likely be glued in place and impossible to re-lay in another space. If you still want to remove it, pull away as much as possible and use a flooring scraper to remove any bits that stick to the concrete.

, If the tack strips are not damaged, you can reuse them, too. Remove tack strips that you cannot use again by wedging a pry bar beneath them, then pulling up on your end of the bar.If the tack strips are lodged in concrete and you wish to remove them, you will have to pull the tack strip up through the concrete nails. Once the tack strips are removed, strike the concrete nails with a hammer from the side to break them off.
To protect your hands, wear heavy protective gloves before attempting to remove tack strips.
Cracked or deteriorating tack strips should not be reused. If the tack strips have been down for 10 years or more, it is probably best to replace them.

, Consult your carpet’s care instructions (often available on the manufacturer’s website) for information about how you can clean the carpet. If you don’t want to clean it yourself, consult professional carpet cleaning services about whether it would be possible to get your carpet cleaned., Tack strips hold the carpet in place and prevent it from moving. Place the tack strips around the edges of the room where you want to re-lay your carpet. They should be placed about one centimeter (half an inch) from the wall. Position them in such a way that the tacks are angled slightly toward the wall and facing up, then secure them by hammering the pre-started nails that come installed in the tack strip.You’ll likely need to cut the tack strips at some point to accommodate the size of your room. For instance, suppose you have three tack strips that measure four feet each and you’re trying to lay them along a 10-foot wall. Starting from one end of the wall, install two tack strips, then cut the third in half.
If you want to fasten your carpet even more securely, you can install a second strip of tack strips in front of the first.

, Carpet pad usually comes in strips that are about three feet (one meter) wide. The size of the pieces you cut the pad into depends on the size of the area in which you wish to re-lay carpet., Sweep the subfloor to remove debris. Mop the area or scrub it with a sponge if it’s visibly grimy, then allow it to dry., Place the carpet pad within the boundaries of the tack strips. The outer edges of the carpet pad should touch the inner edges of the tack strips.When laying carpet pad on wooden subfloor, staple the pad to the floor along the edges of each individual piece of pad using a staple gun.
When laying carpet pad on a concrete subfloor, use a carpet and floor adhesive to secure it. Directions for use vary according to the carpet and floor adhesive you choose to utilize. Generally, however, you can apply a line of adhesive along the edge of the tack strip where the pad will lay, then put the pad in place. Tamp it down gently with your foot.

, If you’re re-laying the carpet in a new space, cut it to an appropriate size and discard excess. The carpet should, in this case, be a bit longer on each edge than the perimeter of the room in which you want to re-lay it. You can discard excess carpet later., It’s nice to have assistance when re-laying carpet. This allows you to have an extra set of eyes on the carpet to evaluate whether it is sufficiently snug against walls and corners. An extra pair of hands is also helpful for carrying and rolling heavy carpet out., Once your tack strips and carpet pad are laid, and your carpet has been sized appropriately, you’re ready to install it. For now, just lay it down in approximately the place you want it., Once the carpet has been laid down, use a knee kicker to secure it. Place the claws of the knee kicker about two inches (5 centimeters) from one wall. Use one hand to steady and secure the kicker, then drive your knee into it.After you strike the knee kicker, push down with your free hand against the portion of the carpet between the kicker and the wall. This will push the tacks of the tack strip into the carpet.
Continue along the entire length of the wall in this way, using the kicker at intervals of three inches (seven centimeters) or so.

, After you’ve secured the carpet about 25% of the way along the wall, go to the area of the carpet directly opposite the area you just secured and do the same. Switch back and forth between these two opposing areas each time you secure about 25% of the carpet to the floor.Once you’ve secured the carpet along the first two walls, repeat the process along the other two walls.

, If you’re re-laying carpet in an area that is smaller than the area you initially had the carpet in, then you’ve already cut the carpet once to more closely approximate the size of the room. However, the area of the carpet is still slightly larger than the area of the room, which means you’ll need to cut away the excess.Place a carpet trimmer against the baseboard of your wall. Run it along a few feet of the wall.
Pull away and discard excess, and use a putty knife to push the trimmed edge down under the baseboard.

, If you are re-laying carpet in strips, you will need to line it up perfectly to hide the seams. If possible, keep seams away from main traffic areas. Hiding them beneath furniture is the best option.It’s okay if carpet seams intersect pad seams below them, but they should not line up directly.

, Locate the seam and lift one edge of the carpet up. Slide a strip of heat-activated seam tape halfway beneath the opposite piece of carpet (the one that’s still flat on the floor). Run the seam tape along the entire length of the seam, then lay the folded-back piece of carpet back down so that it is snug against the opposite piece., Allow your seaming iron to warm up. After about five minutes, slip it between the seam. Starting at one wall, slowly move the iron along the entire length of the seam. Have a friend follow behind you with a seaming weight to press down on the seam, ensuring the carpet will adhere to the seam tape.It is recommended that you get a professional carpet installer re-lay your carpet if you’re dealing with a carpet that will need seams aligned."

Decide which side of the rug will be the top and bottom.,
Prepare the rug for a casing to be sewed along the back.,
Measure the length of material against the back of the rug.,
Measure the width of the material against the rod.,
Hand sew the band to the back of the rug.,
Paint the rod.,
Attach the rod mounts to the wall.,
Hang your rug.",How to Hang a Rug on a Wall1," No matter how you put up your rug, you need to figure out the rug's orientation on the wall. For some rugs, it will not matter which side you put up. For others with an irregular pattern, the placement on the wall is very important.;
, A casing is a long, banded strip of fabric that will secure the rod when the rug is mounted. Use a sturdy fabric, such as heavy cotton, linen, or cotton twill rug binding, for the mounting strip.This method evenly distributes the weight of the rug, and provides one of the most secure and safe ways to display your rug. Hanging this way can work for any size or height rug, but is best for heavier rugs., The mounting band should cover most of the length of the rug. Allow enough space on each end of the rug for the edge of the rod.


The amount of space left on each edge of the rug will vary depending on the size of the rug, but it should be at least one or two inches.

, Lay the rod along the top edge of the back of the rug. Place the material for the mounting band over the rod, fitting it snugly against the rod. Mark the sewing line on each side of the band with pins or ink.


Make sure the rod has room to slide in and out of the band; otherwise, the rod will not be able to be inserted.
The width of the band shouldn't be very large. The mounting band should fit snugly around the rod.

, Try to catch at least two warp threads in each stitch to ensure a good support for the rug.Warp threads are ""stretched vertically on the loom and are therefore made of stronger, coarser fibers than the weft threads.""Warp threads are the ones found tightly stretched lengthwise on a tapestry.Heavy cotton button-hole thread should be used when sewing the casing to the rug.
Make sure you sew the band in a level line across the back of the rug. A little variation won't hurt, but severe uneven sides can cause the hanging to the crooked. Additionally, having an uneven casing can cause sagging, which can damage your textile.
You can sew one band across the entire length of the rug, or you can sew multiple bands as short as two feet along the back. Just make sure they are level and close together.

, Before you slip the rod into the newly sewn mounting strip, paint the wood or metal rod. This step prevents the rod from damaging the casing or rug with acids or rust.

, The rod should come with a mounting kit that includes hooks and screws. Drill the screws into the wall.


Determine where the rug will be mounted. Since you are drilling into the wall, you want to make sure the placement is correct to avoid unnecessary holes.
Measure the length of the rod on the back of your rug. The rod should be mounted at each end.
Use a tape measure to measure the space on the wall that corresponds to the length of the rug you measured earlier. Mark each end on the wall. Before drilling the mounts into the wall, use a level to make sure the two hooks are even.
If your rug is heavier, you will probably need a sturdier hook to hang it on. When hanging a heavy rug, you need to place the hooks along the studs in the wall for added support. You can easily find the studs in your wall with a stud finder. After detecting the studs, center the rug along two studs. Attach the hooks to the studs.

, The rug should slip easily onto the hooks and rest securely on the wall. If you are attaching the hooks to studs, you may need to sew multiple canvas strips into the back of your rug, leaving a small exposed space for the rod to rest on the hook since the hooks may not be at the end of the rod.

To install carpet properly, you need to start with a piece that overlaps the edge of the floor by 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm).,
If your room is wide enough that you're going to need another piece of carpet, follow the same process with the second piece - measure, mark and trim.,
Where the carpet pieces will join, overlap the two pieces, and then using a utility knife or a rented seam cutter, cut through both pieces of carpet, ensuring the edges will match exactly.,
Use a knee kicker to attach the carpet along one edge.,
A carpet stretcher will finish attaching the carpet.,
Work your way around the room stretching the carpet over the tackless strips, and trim the carpet near the wall with a utility knife or a wall trimmer.








,
Using a stair tool, tuck the carpet down into the gap between the tackless strips and the wall.,
That's it.,
Finished.








",How to Install Carpet," Start by removing the moldings around the floor and take the door off the entrance, so you can get the old carpet out and the new carpet in easier. Give the old carpet a good vacuuming so you won't be breathing in dust, and then use a utility knife to cut the carpet into strips about 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) wide (most cities require that for pick up)






;
, Some people feel that you can reuse the existing underlay, but in most cases it will be worn out just like the carpet, so you're better off getting rid of it as well.








, This is a good time to check your sub-floor and securely fasten any floorboards that may be loose so they won't squeak under the new carpet (use 1 1/2"" screws into the underlying floor joists).








, Leave a space of about 1/2"" between the strips and the wall, and be sure the pins or tacks face towards the wall. (They're called tackless strips even though they have two or three rows or very sharp tacks, because using these ""tackless strips"" means you don't need to ""tack"" carpet down.) At corners, make sure the tackless strips are butted tightly against each other.








, Butt the strips against each other - don't overlap them - then staple the underlay down along the inside edge of the tackless strip. Trim the excess underlay along the inside of the tackless strip and use duct tape to seal the seams. a small bead of glue can be used on concrete floors to hold the pad in place.








, The overlay can then be trimmed so the carpet fits properly. To cut your first section, measure the room at its longest point and add 6 inches (15.2 cm) to that measurement. Mark the back of your carpet on both edges with that measurement and join the two marks with a chalk line.









Fold the carpet over on itself, and using a straight edge and a sharp utility knife, cut through the backside of your carpet. Be sure to place a piece of scrap board underneath your cut line to protect the underlying carpet.

, Be sure the carpet pile is running the same way in both pieces, and that the carpet piece is large enough to overlap the wall by 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm), as well as overlapping the first piece of carpet by 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm). (Try to layout your carpet pieces so the seams won't be in noticeable areas, but obviously sometimes that just isn't possible.)








, After cutting the carpet, center a piece of seaming tape on the floor underneath where they join, adhesive side up. Use the seaming iron to activate the adhesive (the iron goes on the tape, not on top of the carpet), and then butt the edges together and seal the seam with a rolling pin or a carpet roller.








, A knee kicker is a solid metal tool about 18"" long with ""teeth"" that will grip the carpet on one end, and a heavily padded ""butt"" on the other. Place the toothed end of the kicker about 3"" from the wall and drive your knee forcefully into the padded end of the tool. This will stretch the carpet over the tackless strip where the tacks will grab it and hold it firmly in place.








, A carpet stretcher is similar to knee kicker, but much longer. Put one end of the carpet stretcher against the wall where the carpet is already attached and place the other end about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the far wall. The carpet stretcher also has teeth to grip the carpet, and when you push on the activation lever, it will stretch the carpet over the tackless strip near the far wall.








,, At the doorway, trim the carpet so the edge is centered under the closed door and install a door edge strip. Finally, cut any vent openings and install the molding on the baseboards.








, Stretch your back, check to see if your knees still work, and then take some time to admire what all your hard work has accomplished.

Clean your floor to ensure that the tiles will lay properly.,
Make two chalk lines across the diagonals of the room.,
Make four chalk lines around the perimeter of the room.,
Draw two chalk lines, each connecting two parallel walls.,
Identify the direction you want to lay your tiles.,
Place your first tile in the center of the floor.,
Continue placing all your tiles.,
Secure your corners with the FLOR dots.,
Maintain your carpet tiles with regular vacuuming.",How to Install FLOR Carpet Tiles1," Clean your room of debris and residue to make sure that there is nothing that will interfere with your tiles. Each tile needs to lay perfectly flat to install properly, so even small bits of dust and junk can throw them out of alignment.


Sweep and dust the area thoroughly.
After, if there is highly resistant dirt or grit, it's a good idea to mop or clean the floor with some kind of solvent.;
, Connecting the two sets of opposite corners of the room, create a chalk ""X"".


The center of ""X"" is the perfect center of the room.

, Once you have drawn these four chalk lines, measure them. Divide these measurements in half, respectively.


The resulting number will identify the midpoint of each individual wall.
This can vary because each wall can be a different length, but generally, there will be two matching sets of measurements.

, Using the midpoints you found on the walls, connect each midpoint to its opposing midpoint in order to create a cross through the center of the floor.


Now, you should have a four-sided box, with two diagonal lines connecting the corners and creating an ""X"" in the middle, and two perpendicular lines connecting the midpoints of the four individual sides and creating a cross shape in the middle.
These lines will ensure that your tiles remain on course and straight as you lay them.

, On the backside of each tile there is a a directional arrow. You need to choose which direction you want your tiles to face, based on the pattern you wish to achieve.


If you don't lay your tiles with the arrows facing the same direction, you may inadvertently alter the final pattern created by your tiles.
You can choose to lay your tiles on a left right axis or forward back axis.
If you want to intentionally change the look of your pattern, you can, but do so only after understanding that it will look different than advertised.

, Take your first tile, and lay it at the intersection of your chalk lines.


Make sure two sides of the first tile, forming a right angle, fit flush with the vertical line and horizontal line.
The exact corner of the tile should touch the center point of the floor.

, Lay out all your tiles, taking care that the edges of your completed carpet are equidistant from the walls.


Each time, position the tiles along the lines. Keep putting down the tiles until you reach the edges of the room.
Once you get close to the wall, you can use your carpenter’s square, sharpie, and a razor knife to cut the tiles to fit perfectly flush against the wall.
Although not essential for proper installation, an equidistant look is aesthetically pleasing.

, With your installation kit, you received a package of FLOR dots. These are one-sided adhesive circles that are meant to connect the floor tiles to one another. Raise the corners of each adjacent tile to get a corner of the tile attached to its dot.


Each tile's corner should cover 1/4th of a dot, to make sure there is room for the other three connecting tiles.
If it's only two tiles being connected, you can move the dots inward to hide the edges from view.
These dots are meant to adhere to each tile, not to the floor.
Once you’ve got them connected, gently press down and step on each corner to make sure the adhesive is sticking properly.
You have a few hours to make sure everything is put down correctly, during which you can still remove and reposition the tiles if you have to.

, Your FLOR tiles do not require any special treatment, beyond what you would do for regular carpet.


However, an advantage to FLOR tiles is that if you stain one permanently, you can simply buy one new tile instead of throwing away the whole carpet.

Consider the cost and effort.,
Choose the right carpet dye for your carpet.,
Find a retailer that sells custom carpet dyes if you are trying to dye your carpet to the original color, or to match walls, drapery or other décor.,
Remove all furniture from the room.,
Purchase or rent a carpet steam cleaning machine.,
Clean your carpet thoroughly.,
Allow the carpet and pad to dry thoroughly before dying.",How to Dye Carpet1," A good idea might be to show the carpet by a professional first just to see how much it might cost. Use the figures quoted to you by a professional as the numbers to keep in mind while you judge the cost of doing the job yourself. If it isn’t much more expensive and you aren’t totally confident in your ability to do it yourself, it might be worth it to hire the professional. It is also very difficult. , Only dye your carpet if you are sure it is wool or nylon. Read the dye packaging carefully to make sure it is safe for use on these materials. Some local fabric, carpet and home supply stores, as well as a variety of online retailers, sell carpet dye in an assortment of standard colors. Some online sites offer a large variety of common colors, in addition to an array of unique carpet colors.


In general, home carpet dying is more effective when you choose a color that is darker than the original color of the carpet. If the carpet is heavily stained with dark colored stains, a color darker than the stain produces best results. You cannot dye a carpet to a lighter color.

, Some companies offer coloring matching. You can bring or mail in a small piece of the carpet left and they will mix a customized carpet dye for you. Be wary, as this might be more expensive. Paint swatches from paint stores, curtain tiebacks, and other color samples can also be effectively color matched. , This is definitely necessary if you are dying a wall-to-wall carpet and you’re going to need to do a deep cleaning regardless so you might as well get the furniture out of the way.

, Both Walmart and Home Depot rent steam cleaners, so you can go to one of these stores or a local shop and just rent the cleaner for the day. You shouldn’t need it for longer than that. Rug Doctor also offers renting services.

, Be sure you are following the direction on your specific carpet steam machine. They can be dangerous and you want to make sure that it is doing a good job cleaning too. Make sure that you go over every spot on the carpet at least twice. A ‘lawn-mowing’ approach is a good idea – go up the width of the carpet and then continue as you cover all the dirty areas.

, If the carpet is wet when you try to dye it the process will be much more difficult. Use paper towels or sponges to pad it dry. It doesn’t need to be 100 % dry, but it can’t be wet either. A little damp is okay. "

Determine which way the rug will be mounted.,
Prepare your cloth hooks.,
Fold the pieces of fabric in half horizontally and sew the ends together.,
Mark the hook locations on the back of the rug.,
Hand sew the hooks into the rug.,
Fit the rod into the hooks.,
Mount the rod hooks onto the wall.,
Hang the rug on the hooks.",How to Hang a Rug on a Wall2," The placement of the hooks depends on the orientation of your rug. Determine which edge of the rug will be the top.

, The hooks should be made with strong fabrics, such as heavy cotton, linen, or cotton twill rug binding. Cut the fabric into rectangles. The width should be about 2/3 wider than the width of your rod.To find the length of the hooks, wrap the fabric around the rod. Press the fabric snugly around the rod with your finger. There should be an inch or two between the top of the hook and where the fabric fits snugly against the rod.
Fold the pieces of fabric vertically into thirds.

, This is the hook for the rod, so the rod should be able to slide in easily. At this stage, the hook will be loose around the rod.


Now that the rod is in the hooks, press the fabric snug around the rod. Mark this line on the hook with a pen or marker.

, These locations will be where the hooks are sewn into the rug. Make sure to place them close enough together that the rug is adequately supported on the wall.


Use straight pins to hold the hooks into place on the rug until you sew it into the rug.

, Make sure to only sew into the back of the rug, so that the stitch doesn't show on the front of the rug.


The hook should be towards the top of the rug, while the sewn edge should be towards the interior of the rug. When the rug hangs, the hook should not be folded over itself., One by one, slide the rod into the newly sewn hooks. The rod should easily fit into the pockets, though they may be snug.

, Most rods come with mounting hardware that can be attached to the wall with a couple of screws. Determine where you want the rug to be hung in the room before you place the hooks.


Measure the length of the rod on the back of your rug. You want the rod to be mounted at each end.
Mark the placement of one of the rug mounts. Use a tape measure to measure the length of the rug you found earlier. Mark that location on the wall. Before drilling the mounts into the wall, use a level to make sure the two hooks are even.
If your mount attaches to the wall using screws, use a drill to attach the mounts.

, The rod should easily fit on the rod hooks.


If you would like to secure the bottom of the rug, follow the same steps to sew hooks into the bottom of the rug and attach the rod mounts to the wall.

Prepare four tack strips.,
Attach the tack strips to the wall.,
Nail the rug to the tack strip.",How to Hang a Rug on a Wall3," Each of these tack strips should be cut to the length of each side of the rug. Use a tape measure to determine how long each side of the rug is, and then cut the tack strips to the appropriate length using a small handsaw or wood snips.Tack strips are generally used in carpeting. They are thin boards with sharp tacks sticking from them. Tack strips are designed to hold carpet in place.
Coat the tack strips in a clear finish or with paint and let dry. This ensures that no acid from the wooden tack strips can damage the back of the rug once it is hanging.
Tack strips can be purchased from most home improvement stores.

, Using a level to make sure the tack strip is straight, hold the strip where the top of the rug will hang and hammer in the nails along the tack strip. Repeat this process for the remaining tack strips, making sure to measure where each one should go.


If hanging a heavy rug, these nails should line up with studs behind the wall. Studs in the wall can easily be found using a stud finder.

, Lift the rug against the top tack strip and press it firmly against the strip. Use two upholstery nails to secure each corner of the rug, and then use a third nail to secure the middle. Nail through the rug and into the mounted tack strip. Hammer the upholstery nails into each edge, starting with the sides first and saving the bottom last.


The upholstery nails are both functional and decorative. They secure the rug to the tack strip and can look very fancy depending on the upholstery nails that are chosen.

Maintain your carpet tiles with regular vacuuming.",How to Install FLOR Carpet Tiles2," Measure across the width of the hallway, and divide it in half to find the midpoint of the hallway's width. Then, measure across the length of the hallway and divide it in half to find the midpoint of the hallway's length.


Draw a chalk line from each parallel midpoint to divide the hallway in half, both lengthwise and widthwise.

, On the backside of each tile there’s an arrow. You need to choose which direction you want your tiles to face, based on the pattern you wish to achieve.


If you don't lay your tiles with the arrows facing the same direction, you may alter the final pattern created by your tiles.
You can choose to lay your tiles on a north-south axis, or an east-west axis.
If you want to intentionally change the look of your pattern, you can, but do so only after understanding that it will look different than advertised.

, Take your first tile, and lay it at the intersection of your chalk lines.


Make sure two sides of the first tile, forming a right angle, fit flush with the vertical line and horizontal line.
The exact corner of the tile should touch the center point of the floor.

, Start laying tiles from the center line that you drew, until you get towards the end of the hallway. This will allow you to see if the tiles are equidistant from the wall or not.


If for some reason they aren't even, you may have to adjust your chalk line to where the distance on each side of the tiles looks acceptable.

, Hallways don’t usually need cuts, because they are open at both ends.


If you do need to cut the hallway tiles for some reason, use your carpenter’s square, sharpie, and a razor knife to cut the tiles perfectly.
Although not essential for proper installation, an equidistant look is aesthetically pleasing, especially in a hallway where the carpet will act as a runner.

, With your installation kit, you received a package of FLOR dots, one-sided adhesive circles that are meant to connect the floor tiles to one another. Raise the corners of each adjacent tile to get a corner of the tile attached to its dot.

Follow the instructions on the dye package to prepare the dye.,
Wear the correct clothing.,
Test the dye on your carpet in an inconspicuous area before beginning the job.,
Apply the dye to the carpet.,
Let it dry.",How to Dye Carpet2," It’s different for every dye, so it’s hard to be specific here but most carpet dyes require you to mix them with hot water and a chemical. Mix the dye according to manufacturer's suggestions.

, You won't want to wear your nice khakis or your favorite dress. The odds are pretty high that you will get some of the dye on your clothing. You'll also want to wear protective eye wear, and maybe gloves.

, The corner might be a good spot for this, or some part of the carpet that normally rests under the table. Test it and give it a few hours to dry, because the immediate color might not be the same color once it is no longer wet. The manufacturer should have a listed drying time. If you’re happy with the result, you can continue dying your carpet. Proceed with your decision to dye your carpet only if there are no adverse effects to the look or feel of the carpet and you are happy with the color.

, Start the dye application in the furthest corner of the room and continue working your way towards your exit door so you do not have to step on the wet dye. Many manufacturers want to you spray the dye onto the carpet. This is easy enough, all you'll have to do is take an empty sprayer that you have lying around and pour the dye into it. Be careful not to spill the dye - pouring it into a cup first and then into the sprayer might work better. An empty Windex sprayer or something of that nature will work. Scrub the dye into the fibers of the carpet after spraying it on. Use a stiff bristled brush and work in a circular motion. Take your time to ensure that all carpet fibers are evenly covered when you look at them from all angles. If you scrub carpet - the fibers will untwist. Raking with a carpet rake in a single direction is the only way to agitate dyes and not harm the fibers.

, Keep children and animals out of the room and give your carpet ample time to dry. The dye manufacturer should have an estimated drying time, and it’s always safe to wait a little longer after that. Hopefully your carpet will look great!

Hire a local carpet cleaning company to die your Carpet.,
Get a warranty that covers the results.,
Set up a dying time and a date either over the phone or in person.",How to Dye Carpet3," Many local carpet-cleaning companies offer dying services at reasonable prices. Invite some of them to your home so they can see the job, provide options and offer quotes.


Only contact companies that offer only carpet dyeing services. Hiring a carpet cleaner who has no carpet dying expertise could result in the carpet being poorly done. Make sure that whoever you are hiring is a professional and that they have dyed carpets before.

, Even if even if you hire professionals, you don’t want to be on the hook for an expensive carpet that has been ruined by a sloppy job. Especially if you paid them to do it! Be sure to read their contract before you hire them. That way you have covered your back.

, Make sure that you won't need to use the room that the carpet is in during that time. The professionals will take care of the rest.

Vacuum the back side of the rug with a beater bar type vacuum cleaner.,
Vacuum the surface of the rug thoroughly.

,
You will need a liquid cleaner specially made for woolen fabrics, such as Woolite, a small bucket, a scrub brush with nylon bristles and warm water.,
Scoop up a brush full of the suds with a small amount of water and begin to scrub the wool pile in the direction from bound edge to bound edge in approximately one foot strokes.,
After you have washed each square foot of your carpet, use the suds free scrub brush to comb the pile straight in the direction you would pet a cat.,
Let the rug air dry on a flat, clean surface.,
After the rug is completely dry, vacuum the rug thoroughly in the direction from bound edge to bound edge to remove any soap sediment.",How to Hand Wash an Oriental Rug," This loosens dirt and sand that has penetrated the rug’s pile and is trapped near the foundation.;
,, Mix the cleaner with warm water to produce a sudsy combination.

, Try to wash one square foot at a time.

, Then go on to the next area to be washed until you complete your rug washing project.

, You may use a fan on the rug to speed the drying time. This may take at least two days.

, You should notice the highlight colors in your rug more vivid and the pile has a lustrous appearance now that the wool is free from grime.

Spread towels over the area of wet carpet.,
Vacuum the wet carpet.,
Encourage the moisture to evaporate.",How to Dry Wet Carpet1," You'll then need to walk up and down the toweled area until the towels are completely saturated. Take those towels away and replace them with dry towels in the same area.


Keep doing this until the area of the carpet is dry.
You should still check underneath the carpet to make sure the carpet padding and the floor aren't sopping wet, as well.;
, Do not do this with a regular home vacuum. You need a vacuum that is made to soak up water. Most vacuum cleaner sold for home use are for dry cleaning only and are extremely dangerous if used on wet carpets. Do not use your household vacuum cleaner unless it is approved for wet vacuuming.









Vacuum the carpet with the wet vacuum cleaner until you get no more water. The wet vacuum cleaner removes water from the carpet itself, but it may not be able to remove it from the padding if the water has wicked through the carpet backing or soaked in under the edges.
Keep an eye on the fill tank and make sure you dump it before hitting overflow. Depending on the amount of water in the carpet, you may have to dump the tank several times.

, You should use this along with the other two options, because it takes some time to achieve. Grab some ceiling fans, hairdryers, household fans, even a dehumidifier, if you have one.









Keep them pointed towards the moisture until the water begins to dry up.
Again, you'll need to check underneath the carpet to make sure that the floor and carpet padding are not still sopping wet.

Spray the affected carpet areas with vinegar and water.,
Let the cleaner sit on the carpet for 10-30 minutes.,
Blot up the liquid with a towel.,
Scrape the carpet with the edge of a spoon.,
Allow the carpet to dry before you walk or put anything on it.",How to Fluff Up Carpet1," Mix equal parts of water and vinegar in a spray bottle. Thoroughly spray the dented or flattened area of carpet. Make sure to cover the whole area with liquid, but don't saturate the carpet so that it’s soaking wet.Make sure the spray bottle is clean and free of other cleaners or chemicals before you use it.;
, Give the mixture time to work on the fibers of the carpet. Depending on how deep and flat the dents are, adjust how long you let the mixture work. Give it at least ten minutes, or wait about half an hour for deep impressions.


Vinegar is often used as a cleaning solution, so the area you spray may end up cleaner than the rest of your carpet.

, Grab a clean, white towel and gently press it into the wet carpet. Blot at the carpet until the majority of the liquid has been soaked up. Don’t press too hard or you’ll flatten the carpet out again.


It’s important to use a white towel so that you don’t bleed any color onto your carpet.

, Hold a spoon so the edge is against the area of carpet you’re fluffing. Pressing the spoon into the carpet, scrape it across the carpet in straight lines. This will cause the carpet fibers to spring up straight again.If a spoon doesn’t give you the results you hope for, try combing the carpet with the tines of a fork.
Also try a brush with stiff but non-metal bristles to even the carpet out when the dent is gone. A boar's hair brush works well.

, After you’ve fluffed the carpet, make sure you don’t walk on it before it is dry. Also be sure not to put any furniture back on the spot while it is wet. This could take 2-3 hours or more depending on the size of the area.

Choose an oversized floor mat.,
Use an appealing logo or brand name on the floor mat.,
Choose an irregularly shaped floor mat.,
Use high quality prints.",How to Design Custom Floor Mats to Promote Your Business," Be aware of what your target market wants and what they are most interested in. Aim to evoke positive emotions from your advertising messages, to help them remember your brand.;
,, Design it carefully to ensure that you present the company's purpose to the right target market through the right marketing material. Custom floor mats are promotional items that can play a role in encouraging buying behavior of your customers.

, Will you be using advertising mats as entrance mats, interior mats or giveaway mats?

, Custom floor mats are an enhancement to your visual merchandising strategy. For example, if you owned a clothing line dominated by red and black colors, you would choose a floor mat containing the same colors. Or, choose safe colors like black or brown, to create a sense of formality or professionalism.

, Since the purpose is to let your brand get noticed, choose an oversized doormat so that people will notice it.


If you will use the floor mat in front of display, you can print on it ""50% discount"", ""discounted products"" or ""limited stocks only"". Get those bargains walking out the door!
If you intend to use the mat as a promotional giveaway, choose a size that is just enough for a standard sized door entry. People will want it to be useful, not in their way.
Add some contact details, such as the company's website or phone number.

, Ensure that the logo is consistent with your other advertising strategies. Keep it simple and easy to recall.

, Usually you can see rectangular shaped floor mats. But if your target market is kids, then, you can use irregularly shaped ones for the fun factor. For example, mats with curvy edges, animal shapes or favorite item shapes, such as a crayon or car.

, Custom floor mats tend to be placed in high traffic areas. People will step on it hundreds of times. Therefore, use high quality prints to prevent early fading.


Choose high quality materials. Custom floor mats can be made of rubber, nylon, or Palmyra.
Check the edges of the mat because it is where wear-and-tear starts.

Move furniture off the wet carpet.,
Remove as much of the water as possible.,
Check amount of water beneath carpet.,
Raise carpet off floor.,
Blow air between carpet and padding.,
Call in the professionals.",How to Dry Wet Carpet2," You want to do this so that you can lift up the carpet and check the pad and the floor underneath. It's important to remove the furniture as quickly as possible so that you can get started on the carpet.









Leaving the furniture on the wet carpeting can damage both the furniture and the flooring.

, You probably won't be able to take up the entire floor, but you are going to have to check beneath the carpet, so keep that in mind. There are several different ways that you can get rid of the water.








Rent a vacuum capable of removing water. Do not use a regular house vacuum, because a regular house vacuum can't handle vacuuming up water. Vacuum until you get no more water.
Alternately you could rent a hot water extraction unit. Check with a local carpet cleaning company to see if you can rent theirs. This helps suck the water from the carpet, although again you will have to check beneath the water.

, Getting rid of the water on top of the carpet is only the beginning. You'll need to get rid of the water along the floor and in the padding beneath the carpet, otherwise the floor could buckle.









Walk across the carpet. If there's a sopping/squelching sound when you do, then there's definitely still water beneath the carpet.

, Start in a corner. Using pliers and a pair of work gloves, start separating the carpet from the padding and the floor. You're going to need to dry the floor beneath the carpet, otherwise it could cause floor buckling. Avoid cutting the carpet, because it will be incredibly difficult to put back together attractively.









You can also lift the carpet up pulling it off of the installation strips at one of the corners. You can also do this on a carpet's side or edge if you have a short side that is easy to access and work with.
Fold the corner or side of the rug over so you can see the carpet pad.

, You're going to want to try to dry the pad without removing the carpet, especially if the pad seems to have only gotten a little damp and the subfloor seems dry.









A dehumidifier in a closed room will pull out water fast, and can be rented from rental companies.
Keep the corner or side of carpet that you have lifted raised and use a fan to blow air under the carpet unto the pad. Turn up the heat and open the windows to aid in the drying.
Attach a vacuum hose (for vacuuming up wet things) to the exhaust of a vacuum then put the hose under the carpet, placing the carpet back over the hose. The hot air will cause the carpet to float over the pad and speed up the drying process.

, In the end, one of the best ways to deal with a wall-to-wall wet carpet is to call in someone who knows how to deal with it. It's important to do this as soon as possible so the company can salvage as much of the carpet, floor, and padding as possible.









Make sure the service is guaranteed and look for a company that promises to dry the carpet, the pad and the floor if necessary.
Check with your homeowners or renters insurance. Depending on the cause of the wet carpet, it is possible your policy may cover the cost of the carpet cleaning.

Set ice cubes on the dent.,
Allow the ice to melt completely.,
Blot the water up with a clean, white towel.,
Fluff the carpet with your fingers, a spoon, or a fork.",How to Fluff Up Carpet2," Grab some ice from your freezer and set it in the dents in your carpet. If you have multiple dents, like from the four feet of a couch, place at least one ice cube in each dent. If the dent is more than two inches (5cm) wide, place more than one piece in the dent., Once the dents are covered with ice cubes, leave them alone long enough for the ice to melt. Depending on the temperature of the room and how much ice you put in each dent, this might take 20 minutes or up to an hour or more., When all of the ice in each dent has melted, use a clean towel to soak up all of the water. Press the towel gently so you don’t dent the carpet again. Make sure the towel is clean and white, so you don’t transfer color onto the carpet., Rub the previously dented area with your fingers until the carpet stands up as it should. If this doesn’t fluff the carpet enough, try scraping the carpet with the edge of a spoon or combing the carpet with the tines of a fork.Use a soft brush to even out the carpet once the fibers are fluffed back up.

Lay a wet cloth over the area you want to fluff.,
Steam the towel with an iron on medium heat.,
Fluff the carpet with your fingers.",How to Fluff Up Carpet3," Grab a white washcloth or hand towel from your linen closet. Wet the towel with warm water. Lay it over the dented or flat carpet. If you need to fluff up a large area, you may need to use more than one towel or repeat the process a few times., Plug in your clothes iron and set it to the medium heat setting. Hold it a few inches above the towel and move it around in a circular motion. Do this for 30 to 60 seconds, then check the carpet.Do not put the iron directly onto the carpet or the towel as you might damage the carpet fibers.

, After heating the area, set the iron off to the side where it won’t burn anything. Remove the cloth from the area, being careful not to burn yourself. Rub the carpet with your fingers so the fibers spring back up. Apply the towel and heat it again if necessary.


For more stubborn carpet fibers, scrap the carpet with the edge of a spoon or comb it with a fork to fluff it more.
Brush the carpet afterward so it has an even look.

Blow dry the carpet.,
Fluff up the carpet.",How to Fluff Up Carpet4," Find a new spray bottle or thoroughly rinse out an old one. Fill it with warm water from the faucet. If your faucet doesn’t have very clean water, use bottled or distilled water instead. Don’t use extremely hot water, which could damage some carpet fibers.

, Make sure you cover the dented or flat area completely, but don’t spray it so much that you soak the carpet. Spraying too much water can end up ruining your carpet over time., Grab a hairdryer and plug it in near the area of carpet that you plan to work on. Set the dryer to a low heat setting. If the dryer has a high fan setting, it’s okay to have the fan high. Hold the dryer about six inches (15cm) from the carpet and move it back and forth across the area., When the carpet is mostly dry, rub your hand back and forth across the area to straighten the fibers up again. If the carpet doesn’t fluff the way you want it to, grab a brush with stiff but soft bristles and brush the carpet a few times.

Don’t wait.,
Determine where the leak is coming from.,
Remove as much water as possible.,
Check the padding under the carpeting.,
Remove all carpeting.,
Dry the carpeting separately.,
Replace the carpets.",How to Dry Wet Carpet3," Mold can grow within 24 hours and cause lots of problems. You'll need to dry the carpet in your car as quickly as possible. This will not only make sure that you avoid the mold, but it means that water won't get into electrical places that it shouldn't.







, Only dealing with the carpets in your car without locating and stopping the leak isn't going to do you much good. You'll have to keep on drying your carpets constantly.








, Use a shop vacuum that can remove water, or a dehumidifier (or both). These are easily rented. Use them to remove as much of the water as you can, especially from carpeting that can't be easily removed.









Leave the dehumidifier in the car until the water seems to be gone.
Make sure that you also sop up water with rags on the non-carpeted areas of the car.

, Water has a tendency to pool in the padding under the carpet. Not dealing with this can create mildew and mold problems. Always start by peeling up the carpet from a corner using pliers and work gloves.









Avoid cutting the carpet as this will be incredibly difficult to fix later on.

, It's really important that you remove the carpeting from the car, especially if the problem is an ongoing one. Peel it up carefully and put it somewhere that it can dry.








, Once you've removed the carpeting from the car you have to work on drying it completely. You've already gotten the worst of the water out of it, but you need to make sure that it is completely dry otherwise mildew can form.









Place towels over the carpeting and walk over them to get the water to soak up into the towels. Replace with fresh, dry towels as they get wet.
Use a hairdryer and position it over the wet towels. Keep doing this until they are completely dry.

, Sometimes the absolutely best thing you can do is replace the carpets, especially if you or anyone in your family is sensitive to mold. It doesn't take long for mold to grow and once it's there, it is very hard to get rid of.









Discuss this with a professional before you do a complete overhaul of your car's carpeting, because this is a drastic measure, but it is important to consider.

Do not get your cowhide rug wet.",How to Clean a Cowhide Rug1," Include the rug in part of your regular cleaning routine. It's safe to vacuum your cowhide rug as you would any other rug in your home. Vacuuming the rug can help keep it clean and prevent dirt or stains from building up in the first place. It's easiest and safest to use the hose attachments on your cowhide rug.
Always vacuum in the direction of the hair.
Make sure the brushes are not spinning on your vacuum.;
, It can be a good idea to take the rug outside and shake it off once in a while. Although your vacuum may get a lot of dirt and dust out of the rug, shaking it off outside can knock loose anything that might have been stuck deeper in the rug. Shaking the rug off is a simple method that you can use to keep your cowhide rug clean and lasting longer. Try to avoid beating the rug to break dirt loose.
Shake the rug with only enough force to remove dirt.

, If your cowhide rug is placed on the floor, it will be subjected to gradual wear and tear over time. If you never change its position on the floor, it may wear unevenly. This can cause your rug to look off-balance or make it look more worn out than it should be. Always remember to reposition the rug to keep any wearing spread out and even., Your cowhide rug can benefit from regular brushing, helping to keep it clean and looking great. Brushing can be a good method of removing dirt from all areas of the cowhide rug, cleaning places that a vacuum might miss. Try to include brushing your cowhide rug in your regular cleaning routine to help keep it looking its best.You can use a brush or broom with hard plastic bristles.
Try to brush with the direction of the hair, instead of against it.

, Although you may use a slight amount of water to steam clean the cowhide rug, you should never get it wet. If your cowhide rug is ever soaked in water, it may be severely damaged. Always keep exposure to water at a minimum when cleaning your cowhide rug to help keep it in great condition.Sun or air dry your rug if it does get soaked in water.
Never put your cowhide rug into a drying machine.

Roll rugs for moving and storage.,
Use diluted white vinegar to restore carpet color and shine.,
Sprinkle Borax on the rug to remove any insect infestation.,
Clean spots or stains as soon as they appear.,
Blot the spillage and remove any solid debris by scraping.,
Treat the rug according to the spill.,
Use a fan to dry the rug.",How to Clean a Rug," To maintain an area rug, at least once a month flip it upside down and vacuum the back of the rug. Vacuuming the back with the beater bar/rotating brush helps push dirt trapped deep down toward the top of the rug. Flip it right side up and vacuum the dirt. Use only suction on the front of wool rugs, for synthetic rugs you can use the beater bar/rotating brush on the front and back.


Do not vacuum fringe or tassels. They are delicate material, and easily tangled in the vacuum’s beater bar or ripped by the suction. Fluffing them by hand is all they need. Anything else can cause damage to them.
Vacuum wool rugs only a few times a month. Vacuuming more often can pull out the fibers.;
, Foot traffic patterns can beat tracks into the pattern and fibers of a rug. This can be prevented by rotating your area rug regularly so as to avoid the formation of this unsightly wear. If your furniture is resting on a rug, consider moving your furniture regularly to avoid impressions or uneven fading on the rug. You can also turn your rug every other month to even out wear.

, Keep the roll as tight as possible. This prevents creases and folds from forming in the rug. It is also significantly easier to break down, move, and store the rug when it is rolled. If you are transporting the rug for steam cleaning or dry cleaning you will need to roll the rug beforehand.

, Dilute the vinegar, 1 part to 3 parts water, and blot slowly and in the direction of the carpet pile with a sponge. Do not soak the carpet, merely dampen it. Allow it to air dry while avoiding exposure to the sun, which can bleach colors.

, Steam cleaning and shampooing are ineffective at controlling insect colonies.Borax naturally coats and degrades the exoskeletons of insects and destroys larvae and eggs. Sprinkle on the rug, wait approximately 20 minutes, and vacuum. Make sure there are no pets near the rug that could potentially inhale the Borax, which is a mildly toxic irritant. , Always test your rug with a damp white cotton towel to make sure the colors will not run or bleed. Never allow your rug to dry on the floor, as this can cause damage to the floor and lead to permanent water damage.


Avoid carpet shampoo on wool rugs. Carpet shampoos are usually made for synthetic wall to wall carpet and not wool area rugs. Always check the label before using any spot cleaners or rug shampoos. After using a spot cleaner or shampoo, make sure you rinse it all out. If there is any soap residue left in the rug it will attract dirt.

, Blot using a clean white 100% cotton dry towel. Press down very hard from the outside towards the middle. Do this repeatedly, turning the folded towel over and over until you have absorbed as much moisture as possible. When you blot the spot move the towel in straight lines. Do not rub in a circle, as this can damage the fibers and construction of the rug.

, Mud and mild stains can be treated simply by blotting dry and vacuuming. More complicated or serious stains require some chemical intervention, normally in the form of a mild acid to remove the dyes staining the carpet, a light detergent to remove any debris and disinfect, and ammonia in non-wool rugs to the same effect.


If the rug is soaked, use a shop vacuum to suck up the moisture. Dry it as well as you can and take it to a cleaner’s. Water damage cannot be reversed or treated at home without significant expertise, care, and hardware.
If the spillage is perishable, care must be taken to rinse the area thoroughly with mild detergent and water to prevent souring of the residue. Using liquid dish soap diluted 2:1 with water will help remove and disinfect the spillage. Apply to a white cotton towel and blot until as much of the spill as possible is absorbed.
For stains that require treatment with ammonia, take valuable rugs to a professional. Do not use ammonia or harsh detergents on wool rugs as the fibers will shrink and degrade with every water treatment. Take your rug to a professional cleaner to minimize cleaning-associated damage.
For spills of perishable items, do not use hot water. Blot with a sponge, and treat with three parts acid, one part mild detergent, and one part water. If the rug is not wool, add a part of ammonia for disinfecting and cleaning.
Neutralize odors from urine accidents and remove stains by mixing 1 part white vinegar with 3 parts water and 1/3 part detergent and blot with white towel or clean sponge. Repeat the treatment for stains if the rug is discolored.

, Expose as much of the affected area as possible to the air stream to aid in evaporating moisture. Do not allow the rug to dry in the open sun, as photobleaching can ruin the colors in the rug and cause degradation of fibers. Do not allow the rug to dry on the floor, instead, place it on a drying rack.

Work out the color and texture.,
Choose for durability.,
Consider price.,
Compare the benefits.",How to Choose Between Jute or Sisal Rugs,"


Sisal has a natural color which is off-white and creamy. It comes from the long green leaves of the cactus plant agave sisalana and is stronger than other natural fibers. Because of its strength, it's used to make rope as well as being used in cat scratching posts. It's also a popular choice because of its durability.
Jute is a soft and waxy vegetable fiber which is taken from the stalks of the Corchorus plant. Generally beige or golden in color, the natural variation in shades means that once woven, each jute rug is distinctively different. Because the fibers are left to soak and soften up in water for many days before being processed, jute feels soft to the touch, like cotton.
Woven jute looks chunky and can be used to great effect to add texture to a room. It complements hardwood floors and looks fabulous with smooth leather sofas. It's also a great choice for a vacation beach house.
Sisal has more of the appearance of textured yarn and with its coarse, slightly scratchy feel, is ideal as an area rug for a high-traffic area. If you're planning on walking on your rug with bare feet, then jute is likely to be the better choice.;
, When compared to synthetic rugs, jute rugs are very durable but they are not a good choice for areas of heavy traffic. They are better for dining rooms or bedrooms, where footfall is considerably lighter. Sisal rugs are better for busy entrance ways or halls which experience heavy footfall, as well for in a living room.

, Jute is generally cheaper in price than sisal, which is higher quality and lasts longer. Both types of rug require very little maintenance since they don't absorb dirt, and need little more than a quick shake or gentle sweep.

, Jute rugs are eco-friendly since they are a renewable source and are also biodegradable. Sisal area rugs are flame retardant, anti-static, and absorb sound, which makes them a great choice for kids' playrooms.

Assess your intended use for the used carpet.,
Determine your budget.,
Search for used carpet in the appropriate venue.,
Buy the amount of carpet you need and arrange to pick it up.",How to Buy Used Carpet," Used and discarded carpet can be repurposed for many applications. Your intended use will affect the amount you need to buy, what condition will be acceptable, and where you should look when purchasing.


Small scale repurposing projects can include using carpet scraps to move heavy furniture, make a scratching post for a cat, or create impromptu sound insulation for a home recording studio. These projects will only require small amounts of carpet, and the carpet can be in fairly poor condition.
Larger projects might include reconditioning carpet and installing it as flooring. These types of projects will require larger amounts of carpet in fairly good condition. Used carpet is best installed as flooring if it has hardly seen any use and wear, or if the application is one where aesthetics are not a high priority.
The largest scale application for purchasing used carpet is recycling the nylon in the carpet for other uses. If you are interested in running a carpet recycling business such as this, you will need to look towards large businesses that are interested in discarding entire buildings worth of carpeting at once.;
, What you are willing to pay for used carpet will affect your ability to obtain it from certain sources. Your budget should depend on the amount of carpet needed and the condition desired.


For small projects, you may be able to find used carpet scraps very cheaply or even for free. For larger pieces of carpet in better condition, expect to pay more. For large scale recycling operations, factor in costs not only for acquiring the carpet, but also for other operational costs such as hiring trucks and drivers to load and haul the used carpet.
To establish a frame of reference, you may want to check the prices for new carpet at several home improvement stores. When buying used, you will want to pay significantly less than the price when new.

, There are several places you can look to find used carpet for sale. Some venues are better suited for buying small quantities, while others can be used to obtain large quantities of used carpeting.


For small amounts of carpet scraps, search online classifieds sites like Craigslist and Freecycle. Many people give away discarded building materials for free on sites like these to avoid discarding them or to avoid paying to have them hauled away.
If you need larger amounts of carpet, you can try browsing at building supply stores. Stores that specialize in carpeting may not have used carpet available for sale, but they may have low-priced overstocked or discontinued carpet. Some building supply stores specialize in selling secondhand materials; these stores often stock used carpet at very low prices.

, Once you have found used carpet that fits your needs, you'll need to arrange the purchase. If buying from an online classifieds site, you will usually need to pick the item up yourself at the seller's home or business. If you are picking up a large amount of carpet, this may mean renting or borrowing a truck. Building supply or carpeting stores may be able to arrange delivery for you for a fee.

, Any food or liquid spills need to be absorbed immediately using a paper towel or undyed cloth. Dab the area with the towels to remove as much of the liquid as possible., In a small bowl, add a small amount of a neutral dish detergent, such as Dawn, to an equal amount of lukewarm water. Stir the mixture until it is soapy.Avoid using laundry soap and other cleaners, as these can change the rug’s color.
Another option for cleaning seagrass rugs is commercial cleaner such as HOST Dry Cleaner. Follow the directions on the label to treat the spill.

, Dip a sponge or a brush into the detergent mixture. Apply small amounts of the cleaner onto the outside of the stain, working towards the center. This will help get rid of food, drink, and pet stains.


Dissolvers such as Tetra and petroleum solvent for oil and acetone polish remover for nail polish can be substituted to combat specific stains. Apply sparingly the same way you would detergent., Again, only use paper towels or undyed cloths to avoid staining the rug. Use these to remove excess moisture before it gets absorbed into the rug.

, When the stain persists, you may still be able to remove it. Add more of your cleaner and apply it the same way you did before. Follow it up by blotting off the excess using paper towels or undyed cloth. Do this a few times.

, Once the stain is treated, it is important to remove the moisture before it is absorbed by the rug. Apply a heat source, such as that from a hair dryer, that can focus heat onto the wet area and dry it quickly., Quickly apply paper towels or white, undyed cloth on top of the spill. Pick up as much moisture off the rug as possible.

, In a bowl, combine a half-cup of water and a tablespoon of ammonia. Stir the mixture as thoroughly as possible., Use an undyed white cloth or paper towel. Dip the cloth into the ammonia solution, wringing out excess moisture before patting the stain with the cloth. Cover the area with as little cleaner as possible to avoid damaging the rug.

, Get a clean, undyed cloth or paper towel. Dip it in clean water, not the cleaning solution. Wring out the cloth to remove excess moisture, then blot the ammonia-treated area to pick up any ammonia left on the rug.

, In a clean bowl, add ¼ cup white vinegar to ¼ cup water. Stir the mixture thoroughly. The vinegar solution will remove the smell of urine. Vinegar is for removing the smell of urine, so it is only necessary when the scent lingers after normal spot cleaning., Use another dry, undyed cloth or paper towel. Dip it into the solution, wringing out excess moisture before patting the stained area.

, Only use a clean, undyed cloth or paper towel. Dip it into clean water, then wring out the excess moisture before dabbing it over the treated area. This will remove the vinegar on the rug., Once the ammonia or vinegar is washed from the rug, remove excess moisture by blotting the treated areas on the rug with a paper towel or undyed cloth. Another option is to dry the rug quickly such as with a hair dryer.

, Add a cup of chlorine bleach to a bowl. Dilute the bleach with six cups of water. Stir the mixture thoroughly to minimize the rug’s exposure to the bleach., Since adding too much bleach to the rug can discolor it, you can’t apply it directly. Instead, get a spray bottle from the store. Pour the bleach into the bottle and you’ll be able to mist a thin coating on the moldy areas.

, Spray as lightly as possible, covering the rug in an even coating. Do this only on the rug itself, not the binding. You may want to test the spray in a single area first to see if it discolors the rug. If it does, add more water to the mixture.

, Allow the bleach mixture to work on the mold for ten minutes. When the time is up, take paper towels and blot the rug to remove moisture. Make sure you pick up as much of the bleach as possible.

, While you can allow the rug to air dry, it is a good idea to dry it quickly using a hair dryer. A quick heating ensures that none of the moisture or bleach soaks into the rug, minimizing damage from treatment.

, Natural rugs must not be washed regularly, since they absorb moisture. Instead, use a suction brush to pass over the rug. Pass over it several times, moving in a different direction each time. Do this when dirt starts to accumulate in order to prevent staining., In dry climates and low humidity areas, a very light coating of water can extend the life of the rug. First, make sure all the dirt is vacuumed, then spray a very fine coating of water evenly over the rug. You may also sprinkle the water, use a clean mop, or a brush dipped in water., As a last resort for a soiled rug, find a machine that has a spray-extraction setting. Set the machine to the lowest moisture setting. In this method, the machine applies liquid cleaner and then quickly removes it."

Determine what kind of Turkish rug to purchase.,
Consider whether you prefer a handmade or manufactured Turkish carpet.,
Determine what size Turkish carpet you prefer.,
Set a budget for your Turkish carpet purchase.",How to Buy Turkish Carpet1," There are 2 basic kinds of Turkish carpets: a kilim or a knotted carpet.


Choose a kilim for a less expensive alternative. A kilim is a flexible, woven rug that can be folded. It has no backing, and can be used as a furniture covering, blanket, wall hanging or rug. Kilims often are made from cotton fibers using a flatweaving technique.
Choose a hand-knotted carpet for a higher quality rug. Made of wool or silk, handwoven Turkish rugs are single or double knotted onto a firm backing.;
,


Choose handmade Turkish rugs for the high quality weaving and unique story each carpet offers. Artisans create rug designs that share part of their own life stories. Handmade rugs are hand-knotted and, depending on the size, can take years to complete.
Choose commercially manufactured Turkish rugs for design control. Customers can dictate the colors, styles and patterns displayed in commercially manufactured rugs. If you are tied to a particular color palette or design, consider purchasing a commercially made Turkish carpet.

, Before shopping for a Turkish rug, measure the room or area where the rug will be displayed. In most cases, the measurements should allow for a border of flooring to show along the perimeter of the rug.


Consider several different sizes for each room. Areas like dining rooms, hallways and entryways may not allow for many sizing options. However, in living rooms and bedrooms you may be able to utilize several carpet sizes based on different furniture arrangements in the rooms. The more sizes you are willing to consider, the more choices you will have when purchasing a Turkish carpet.
Understand the typical Turkish rug dimensions. Handcrafted Turkish rugs vary in size. However, many rug weavers use the following carpet dimensions: Yastik is 60 by 90 cm (23.6 by 35.4 inches); Ceyrek is 90 by 135 cm (34.5 by 53.1 inches); Kisa Yolluk is 70 by 200 cm (27.6 by 78.7 inches); Seccade is 120 by 180 cm (47.2 by 70.9 inches); Saf 110 by 230 cm (43.3 by 90.6 inches); Karyola is 150 by 230 cm (59 by 90.6 inches); Kelle is 300 by 200 cm (118.1 by 78.7 inches); and Taban is 6 m x 6 m (19.7 x 19.7 feet).

, Turkish rugs can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. The carpet's size, age, design and quality factor into the sales price. The higher the quality, the more expensive the carpet.

Evaluate the preferred size of the Moroccan carpet.,
Research the 2 types of Moroccan carpets to determine your preference.,
Determine a budget for your Moroccan carpet purchase.",How to Buy Moroccan Carpet1," Before shopping for a Moroccan carpet, measure the room or area where the rug will be displayed. The measurements typically should allow for a border of flooring to show along the outside perimeter of the rug.


Consider several different sizes for each room. Areas like entryways, hallways and dining rooms may not allow flexibility with sizing. However, bedrooms and living rooms usually allow you to consider several Moroccan carpet sizes based on various furniture arrangements in the rooms. The greater the range of possible rug sizes, the more choices you will have when purchasing a hand-woven carpet.;
, Moroccan carpets typically are classified as either urban rugs or rural rugs.


Consider urban rugs for sophisticated weaving patterns influenced by trade exchange with Mediterranean vendors. Urban rugs, like those from Rabat, have a stiff backing and are usually woven with wool and cotton yarn. Urban rugs often contain animal or floral designs, and feature large central areas with decorative woven medallions. Urban rugs can be custom-ordered in specific designs, colors and sizes.
Consider rural rugs for carpets woven as expressions of Moroccan tribal tradition. Rural rugs are usually made in the Marrakech and Atlas Mountain regions. Because these areas had little exposure to Mediterranean influences, the weaving designs represent authentic Moroccan traditions. Rural rugs have no backing, and the back of the rug displays the intricate knotting and weaving of the carpet. Possessing a tribal look, the design, colors and motifs of rural rugs are chosen by each artisan. The textures and weaving materials of the rugs vary by region; and can feature high pile, loosely knotted wool weaves in colder climates, or low pile, tightly knotted cotton weaves in warmer climates. Typically, rural rugs can not be custom ordered because they are woven according to family or regional tradition.

, Moroccan rugs are available in a wide range of prices, from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Factors like the rug size and weaving materials affect the price. Urban rugs usually are more expensive than rural rugs.

Measure the room to be carpeted.,
Bring any drape or paint samples to the carpet dealer for comparison.,
Prepare for the dealer's questions.,
Select a carpet that will stand up to the concrete.,
Decide on a style of carpet.,
Completely empty the room.,
Check the room for moisture problems.,
Air out the carpet out before installation.,
Remove any doors for ease of installation.,
Lift any baseboards.,
Fill in any cracks or imperfections in the surface.,
Use a leveling product to flatten any low spots in the slab.,
Clean the concrete thoroughly, using the appropriate cleaner for the stains you find.,
Control the temperature in the room.,
Lay the tack strip.,
Lay padding strips.,
Cut carpet to size, allowing approximately 6 inches (15.2 cm) excess all around.,
Lay carpet out and use a rented knee kicker to force the carpet into the far corner.,
Finish the edges.",How to Install Carpet on Concrete (Basement)," Take these measurements to your carpet dealer to make sure you get an ample amount of carpet for your job. Be sure to tell them that you are carpeting over concrete since that requires different carpet material as well as slightly different tools than carpeting over wooden surfaces.;
, If you've already painted the walls or planned for any other decorating in the room, take in some samples of the colors so you can make an informed choice at the store.

, Typically, you'll be asked some basic questions about the room and your intended use for the room. These questions are designed to help you pick the most appropriate carpet, and are good questions to ask yourself anyway. It helps to give some thought beforehand so you don't have to make a hasty decision.A dealer may ask:


Are there a lot of windows in the room?
Will there be heavy or light traffic in the room?
Do you have kids or pets?
Is there direct access from outside?
How large is the room?
Dealers will also typically try to sell you on Stainmaster, Teflon, and Anti-Static technology at various levels of expense to you. Remember, the decision's up to you. Get something that'll serve your purpose, but don't get pushed into expensive options you don't want.

, Make sure the entire carpet is constructed of synthetic products only. Some carpet is backed with jute, which is too absorbent to use on concrete. If you're not going to install your carpet on a subfloor, you'll need to make sure that you're picking a kind of fiber that will stand up to concrete's tendency to collect moisture.


Consider carpet made from olefin face fiber. A chemical-resistant fiber that will stand up to aggressive cleaning solutions like bleach, this might not be the softest or most attractive carpet, but it will last., You can choose between patterned or solid carpet, as well as a light or dark color. You can also choose tight or loose fiber loops and pick between a solid or mesh subsurface.


Typically, the carpet rule of thumb is that light carpet can seem to create more space in a smaller room, while a darker shade of carpet can add coziness to a bigger space.

, Remove all furniture as well as anything else that rests on the carpet.

, Any drainage issues in the room you're planning to carpet need to be addressed before carpeting. Ignoring the problem now could result in a costly and expensive project down the road, especially if you end up with harmful mold and end up having to tear out the carpet and repeat all your hard work.


Rent or buy a moisture reader to test the humidity yourself.
You should do this a week or more prior to carpet installation day to allow plenty of time for the waterproofing to be done.

, Carpeting is a chemical soup full of solvents. Allowing it some time to air out will cut down on fumes when you install it.

, You might have to sand down, or use a saw to undercut, the bottom of the doors and trim door jambs to ensure smooth closing after the carpet installation.

, You may need to remove the baseboards in order to install your carpet. Alternatively, the carpet may fit under the baseboards; in that case you can leave them in place.

, Before the surface dries, fill in any holes or cracks, making sure the top of the repair is level with the rest of the concrete surface. Small cracks and fractures can be fixed using a cement based, waterproof filler (e.g., Armstrong 501).

, Be sure to let the product dry, then sand and smooth the surface.

, Follow the washing with a mold and bacteria killing solution of 1 part household bleach to 15 parts water. Rinse thoroughly with clean water.

, For about 48 hours prior to and after installation, the temperature should stay between 65°F and 95°F (18°C and 35°C) and humidity between 10% and 65%. By observing these conditions, your carpet installation should go smoothly.

, Cut a piece of tack strip the length of one wall, and attach it to the floor with masonry nails. The tack points should be facing the wall. You should also use a liquid nail glue along with the nails for a secure fit. Leave a gap the thickness of the carpet's pile between the gripper strip and the wall. This is where you will tuck the edges of the carpet during installation.


Tack strip is also known as gripper rod (UK), carpet gripper, Smooth edge (Can), tack strip, and gripper edge.Alternatively, you can use glue-down carpet, rather than tack strips.

, Cut padding strips the length of the room, and place them side by side across the room. Keep your rows abutted, and cover seams with duct tape. Trim any excess with a utility knife. Apply glue to the corners as well as to various spots throughout the body of the padding.

, Patterns have to match in length to hide seams. Place seam tape, adhesive side up, where pieces abut. Use a steam iron to activate the adhesive and join the pieces together.

, Using the power stretcher, stretch the carpet across the room to the opposite wall. Hook the carpet onto the tack strip. Continue this until the carpeting is smooth and flat.Generally, you'll work from the centers of each wall toward the corners.
As a novice, you might want to avoid using a power stretcher, since they can overstretch or even rip carpet. They are hydraulic, heavy, and very expensive.

, Cut off excess carpet, and push carpet behind tack strip, using a wide blade putty knife if necessary. Cover edge of carpeting at doorways with metal door jambs and replace doors. Finish off with baseboards of your choice.

Allow new grout to cure for 48 to 72 hours before sealing.,
Tape off baseboards and other nearby surfaces to prevent unintentional staining.

,
Apply sealer using a foam paint brush, paint pad or a small roller.,
Wait 5 to 15 minutes to allow the first coat to soak into the grout.,
Wipe off the tiles with a dry cotton cloth to remove excess sealant after the two coats are applied.,
Allow the grout sealer to cure for the amount of time listed on the product can.,
Test the grout sealant.",How to Seal Grout1," Existing grout should be cleaned and dried before resealing.


Make sure grout lines aren't cracked, chipped, or otherwise compromised before treating with a sealant.If they are, touch up grout and wait the requisite 48 to 72 hours before sealing.;
,, Coat the grout lines, making sure you cover the grout joints completely. Try not to get the sealer on any tiles; if you do, it's not a big deal — just wipe the sealant off with an old rag.

, Apply the second coat and wait another 5 to 15 minutes.


Some sealers need more time between sealer coats. For these sealers, wait 5 minutes and then wipe off the tiles to remove grout sealant that got on them.

,


Use water and a white nylon pad to scrub residue from dried grout sealant on tiles. Dry the affected tiles with a clean cotton cloth.

, Walking on the area is usually allowed within 2 to 4 hours. A full sealer cure is usually achieved in 24 to 48 hours.

, Test the effectiveness of the grout sealant by flicking a few drops of water onto the grout line. An effective grout sealant will cause the water to puddle on top of the grout. Try this at various locations on the grout lines.

Purchase a Turkish carpet from a carpet cooperative.,
Look for a reputable rug dealer who is an expert in Turkish carpets.",How to Buy Turkish Carpet2," Workers at Turkish carpet cooperatives will take you on a tour of the work areas, share a cup of tea with you, and then present various carpets according to your preferences. Carpet cooperatives, which typically represent the work of hundreds of artisans from dozens of villages, do not necessarily have the cheapest prices, but they offer high quality, authentic Turkish rugs.

, If you aren't planning a trip to Central Asia or Turkey any time soon, seek out an expert dealer locally. A Turkish carpet expert can provide information about the fiber content and quality. Reputable dealers will provide comparisons between different carpets and won't try to pressure you to purchase a specific rug. Some dealers may allow you to take Turkish carpets home so you can evaluate how they look in your home before purchasing them.


Inquire about where each Turkish carpet was made. Although rugs are made in more than 750 villages and tribal areas, each area is known by its own designs, symbols and styles. An educated carpet dealer can provide insight into the origin of the rug by evaluating its design.

"
"
Determine if the Turkish carpet is hand-knotted.,
Evaluate the knots per square inch (KPSI).,
Ask what material was used to make the Turkish rug.,
Determine whether natural or synthetic dyes were used on the Turkish carpet's fibers.",How to Buy Turkish Carpet3," Authentic Turkish carpets are hand-knotted, and can take months or even years to complete.


Understand the 2 types of knots used in Turkish rug weaving. The double knot, also called a Gordes knot or Turkish knot, provides the most durable carpet. In a double knot, a strand of yarn encircles 2 threads. The single knot, also called a Sennah knot or Persian knot, encircles 1 thread.
Examine the underside of the rug for imperfections. The underside of a hand-knotted rug will show some imperfections in the knots. If the back of the rug is perfect, it probably was made by a machine, not a person.

, The higher the KPSI, the higher the quality. Approximately 150 KPSI is considered average, while fine Turkish rugs may have KPSI counts of 500 or more.


Examine the design on the underside of the rug. The greater the number of knots, the more distinctive the design will be on the back of the rug.

, Turkish rugs and flatweaves are made from 5 materials: sheep wool, goat hair, silk, floss silk and cotton. Select rugs made from natural materials, which are more durable than synthetic materials.


Consider Turkish carpets made from wool. Wool carpets are the most traditional type of Turkish rug, and are woven by hand in countryside villages. Wool quality varies by region and climate, with the higher quality wool coming from sheep found in cooler and higher elevations. The wool typically is hand-spun using a drop spindle, called a kirmen, and spinning wheels.
Evaluate silk Turkish carpets. The silk used in Turkish rugs comes from silk cocoons. When unrolled, the single thread from a silk cocoon can stretch up to 25,000 meters (82,021 feet). The silk fibers are strong and can be twisted easily. Because of the fine fiber, silk rugs can feature about 625 KPSI. Large silk Turkish carpets can take up to 6 years to complete.
Consider floss silk Turkish rugs. Often referred to as art silk, floss silk is mercerized cotton that has a sheen similar to silk. It is used primarily in rugs woven in Kayseri.
Evaluate goat hair carpets. While historians believe that Turkish carpets were originally woven with goat hair, very few rugs today are made with goat hair. Occasionally, goat hair will be used in the bindings of Turkish carpets.
Consider cotton Turkish carpets. Cotton is usually considered more resistant and less elastic than wool, so tighter knots can be achieved. Cotton is used primarily for creating flatweave Kilim rugs, although it can be used to create hand-knotted Turkish carpets as well.

,


Evaluate natural dyes. Authentic Turkish carpets are made from natural dyes extracted from vegetables, roots, flowers and insects. Natural dyes provide greater authenticity and will increase the rug's value. However, natural dyes will mellow over time.
Evaluate synthetic dyes. Synthetic dyes are available in a wider range of colors than natural dyes. However, unlike naturally dyed fibers, synthetic fibers don't hold dye throughout the entire fiber. A closer examination of a Turkish carpet created with synthetic dyes will reveal that deeper fibers don't have the same color as fibers closest to the surface. Synthetic dyes usually hold their color better over time than natural dyes.

Seek out a reputable rug dealer who is an expert in Moroccan carpets.,
Look for a Moroccan carpet dealer who specializes in hand-woven Moroccan rugs, and provides a large selection of rugs available in the store.

,
Ask each prospective rug dealer about where the rugs were made.",How to Buy Moroccan Carpet2," An expert dealer can provide information about the quality, fiber content and region of origin for each rug. A reputable dealer will provide comparisons between different rugs and won't try to persuade you to purchase a specific rug. Some dealers may allow you to take Moroccan carpets home to evaluate how they look in your space before purchasing them.

,, There are approximately 45 Moroccan tribal groups that make rugs, and each tribal group has its own distinctive design and weaving styles. An educated carpet dealer will be able to provide insight into where the rug was created by evaluating the rug design.

"
"
Determine if the Moroccan rug is hand-knotted.,
Consider the general categories of Moroccan carpet quality.,
Request information about the material from which the rug is constructed.,
Inquire whether natural or synthetic dyes were used on the Moroccan carpet's fibers.",How to Buy Moroccan Carpet3," Authentic Moroccan carpets are hand-knotted. It can take months for a Moroccan artisan to complete 1 hand-knotted rug.

, Rugs are made in several density categories. The higher the knots per inch, the finer the weave of the rug. Intricate designs require higher knots per inch.


Select standard quality Moroccan rugs for basic wool and cotton blend yarns. Standard quality Moroccan carpets typically feature 20,000 knots per square meter (3.3 feet). Because of the looser weave, the rug designs are not as intricate as higher quality Moroccan carpets.
Choose high quality Moroccan carpets for better quality wool and cotton blend yarns. High quality Moroccan carpets typically feature 90,000 knots per square meter (3.3 feet), and have a crisper look to the rug designs than those classified in the standard quality category.
Purchase extra high quality for premium wool yarns. Extra high quality Moroccan carpets typically feature 160,000 knots per square meter (3.3 feet). Because of the dense knotting of the rugs, the designs are the most intricate.

, Most rugs are made of wool and cotton blends.


Choose 100 percent wool rugs for the highest quality product. Wool is the most durable fiber, but there are many grades of wool. For the softest grade of wool, look for rugs crafted from live wool, which is sheared from a live sheep.
Select wool and cotton blend Moroccan rugs. Wool and cotton blend rugs are the most popular type of Moroccan carpet. The rugs are durable, and the blended materials allow for design flexibility.
Avoid rugs made synthetic materials. Because they are hand woven with natural materials readily available in the local geographic area, authentic Moroccan carpets are rarely made with synthetic materials.

,


Purchase a rug made with natural dyes for greater authenticity. Rural rugs are typically made with all natural dyes. The natural dyes from from indigo plants, poppy flower and saffron provide rich colors. However, the natural dyes may fade over time.
Buy a rug made with synthetic dyes for a wider range of colors. Some urban rugs contain synthetic dyes, especially those custom ordered in specific shades. Often, synthetic colors can appear harsh on a hand-woven rug, so ensure the color palette is pleasing before you purchase the rug. Synthetic dyes tend to hold their color better than natural dyes.

Allow the sealant to cure.",How to Seal Grout2," Turn the can around and point the nozzle at the grout line to be sealed.

, Follow each grout line.

, The cloth can be dampened with warm water to remove dried sealant. Unlike liquid grout sealers, spray grout sealers can be removed right after application.

, Apply another coat of sealant if the water is absorbed into the grout.

, The treated area can be walked on once the sealant is dry to the touch. A full cure is usually achieved in 24 hours.

Do your homework.,
Visit your local carpet store, carpet warehouses, carpet and rug outlets and some of the larger stores that carry flooring, like Home Depot, to compare carpet offerings.

,
Watch for carpet sales.,
Think about carpet color.,
Consider durability when you buy carpet.,
Take your favorite carpet samples home.,
Ask about carpet padding.,
Make your purchase.,
Be sure you receive and understand your carpet warranty.",How to Buy Carpet," It's important to like what you buy. Carpet can be a big purchase, and it's not something you will replace every year.


Measure the area or room that you plan to buy carpet for. If the carpet is wall to wall, be precise with your measurements. Depending on where you buy your carpet, the retailer may send an installer out to recheck the measurements before finalizing your order.;
,, Carpet sales are hit or miss. There is no special time of year that carpet goes on sale. Generally, outlets and warehouses offer discounted quality carpet any time of year.

,


If you will be installing the carpet in a heavily traveled area, such as a hallway, you may want to buy carpet that is darker in color or a multi-colored carpet. Both work well in hiding dirt and stains.
On the other hand, if you are putting your new carpet in the master bedroom you may want to go with a lighter color to keep the room bright and cherry.

, What is the level of activity for the room? How long should the carpet last? Do you have children and pets, and if so, will the carpet be a good selection for them?


For high-traffic areas you may want to consider something that will wear well and withstand heavy traffic, such as a looped Berber or a twist friezes carpet.

, See how they look with your furniture, curtains, drapes and especially your lighting. Be sure to open the curtains or drapes to see how the carpet looks in natural sunlight.

, There are 3 different types of padding on the market, fiber, sponge and foam rubber. Have the salesperson explain the differences between all 3.

, Once you're satisfied that you have found the perfect carpet, ask a salesperson to order it.


Determine what payment method works best for you to pay for your carpet. Many stores offer an in-house financing program. You can also pay by check, cash or a low-interest credit card.
Give a deposit. Carpet companies require a deposit before they will place any orders. The deposit will vary depending on the company.

Get the necessary tools.,
Cover the surfaces of the appliances you are planning to keep.,
Don protective clothing before starting the grout removal process.,
Make the center incision.,
Remove the grout.,
Finish the edges.,
Remove tape and clean grout lines.,
Clean the tile.",How to Remove Grout," There are a number of tools which you can use to remove the grout. Those you choose will depend on how much money you wish to spend, how much and which type of grout you need to remove, and how often you intend to remove grout.


You can use power tools. There are a variety of tools, called grout removal tools or re-grout tools, which will help you remove grout quickly and with much less effort. These are helpful if you have a large amount of grout to remove or remove grout often.
You can use manual tools as well. If you for some reason cannot use power tools but find that you have a reasonable amount of grout to remove, use a manual grout removal tool. This will look like a small trowel.
If you only have a small amount of grout to remove or it is something soft like rubber grout, you can use a standard razor blade, like an exacto knife or a utility knife.;
, As the grout is removed, flying debris can cause damage. Drape a large blanket or drop cloth over the appliances, making sure they are fully covered. If necessary, use tape to secure the edges of the protective covering and make sure to cover drains completely. If you are planning to keep the tiles and removing just the grout, cover the edges of each tile with painter's tape.

, This should include safety glasses, dust mask and cut resistant gloves.For the purpose of comfort, consider wearing knee pads, as it can take a while to remove grout. Make sure to wear pants and boots as well.

, Make an incision down the middle of each grout line using a grout saw, preferably one with a carbide blade.Do this to all the grout lines that you want to remove.

, Remove the grout from between the pieces of tile with a grout scraper, using the incision as a starting point. Insert the triangular tip of the grout scraper into the incision you made with the grout saw. Apply firm pressure and drag the scraper along the grout line about the length of one tile, but be very careful to avoid scraping the tile. Lift out the grout scraper, return to the starting point and repeat the process until you have removed all the grout in that area.If you do not have a grout scraper, use a small, cold chisel and hammer or a knife blade. Angle the chisel away from the edge of the tile and tap if with the hammer until the grout is freed from the floor and edges of the tile.

, Clean up the edges of the tile by chipping out any remaining grout remnants. Hold the chisel so that it is parallel to the floor and the cutting edge of the chisel is touching the edge of the tile. Lightly tap the end of the chisel with the hammer until the grout is loosened. Sweep up the broken pieces of grout from between the crevices using a dust broom or a shop vacuum.

, Peel off the painter's tape from the edge of the tile, then wash out the grout lines with soap and water. You may need a scouring pad to scrub away any remaining grout from the edges of the tile. Gently scrub the edges of the tile until the grout has been completely removed.

, Wipe down the tile immediately if you are planning on keeping it, and then buff the area out a few times. Grout residue can quickly harden onto the tile, making it difficult to remove without damage. Fill a spray bottle with half vinegar and half water. Spray the tile and allow the solution to sit for a couple of minutes before wiping it away with a clean cloth.

Determine the ideal size of the rug.,
Decide whether you prefer traditional or modern rug designs.,
Set a budget for your handmade rug purchase.",How to Buy a Handmade Rug1," Before shopping for a handmade rug, measure the room or area that the rug will cover. In most cases, the measurements should allow for a border of flooring to show around the perimeter of the rug.


Consider several different sizes for each room. The greater the range of sizes, the more choices you will have when purchasing a handmade rug. Rooms like hallways, entryways and dining rooms may not allow flexibility with sizing options; however, living rooms and bedrooms typically enable you consider several rug sizes based on different furniture arrangements in the rooms.;
, It is helpful to determine your design preference prior to shopping. Traditional rug designs generally display symbolic associations, or they may utilize curvilinear designs from paintings or other artwork. Contemporary designs are available in a wide range of styles, and typically display bold patterns.

, Handmade rugs are available in a wide range of prices, from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Factors like the rug size and quality affect the price.

Seek out a reputable rug dealer who is an expert in handmade rugs.,
Look for a rug dealer who specializes in hand-knotted rugs, and provides a large selection of rugs available in the store.

,
Ask each prospective rug dealer about where their rugs were made.,
Avoid ""going out of business"" sales and traveling rug dealers.",How to Buy a Handmade Rug2," An expert dealer will educate you about the craftsmanship of the rugs, and can provide information about the fiber content, quality and country of origin for each rug. A reputable dealer will provide comparisons between different rugs and won't pressure you to buy a specific type or design of rug. Some dealers may even allow you to take rugs home to evaluate how they look in your space before purchasing them.

,, Several countries violate child labor laws and force children to weave rugs in poor conditions with little pay. A reputable rug dealer won't sell rugs made with child labor.

, Although the prices may be cheaper, the rugs sold by these dealers typically have been rejected by handmade rug importers.

"
"
Examine how the rug lies on the floor.,
Ask the rug dealer about the materials from which the rug is constructed.,
Determine if the rug was hand-knotted.,
Evaluate the rug density.,
Ask the rug dealer whether natural or synthetic dyes were used on the rug's fibers.",How to Buy a Handmade Rug3," Some irregularity is expected in handmade products. However, a quality handmade rug should lie flat on the floor and have an even shape.

, Most rugs are made of silk and wool.


Choose silk rugs for their luxurious look and feel. However, they are not ideal for high traffic areas.
Choose wool rugs for their durability. Wool is the most durable fiber, but there are many grades of wool. The wool from the neck and belly of young sheep is the best quality for handmade rugs. Make sure the wool was sheared from a live animal, as wool from dead animals typically feels rough and scratchy. Ask if the wool was spun by hand or by machine. Because of the way dye is absorbed, hand-spun wool provides more variegation in the fiber colors and is usually valued over machine-spun wool.
Avoid rugs with synthetic materials. The synthetic materials will degrade over time.

, Hand-knotted rugs are the highest quality handmade rugs available; and therefore, are the most expensive. It can take months or even years for an artisan to complete 1 hand-knotted rug.


Consider hand-tufted rugs or flat-weave rugs. Hand-tufted rugs, which involved threading yarn into designs through the back of the rug, are less expensive than hand-knotted rugs. Flat-weave rugs are the lowest quality handmade rugs, and the least expensive option.

, Rugs are made in several densities, ranging from 30 knots per inch to 290 knots per inch. The higher the knots per inch, the finer the weave of the rug. Intricate designs with smooth and graceful lines require higher knots per inch.

,


Purchase a rug made with natural dyes to maintain the rug's value over time. Natural dyes from indigo plants, bark, fruit and insects can fade over time when exposed to light, but the faded effect usually enhances the rug's natural beauty. Natural dyes add almost 30 percent more to the cost of the rug.
Buy a rug made with synthetic dyes for a wider range or shades and colors. Synthetic chemical dyes usually are made with either an acid dye or a chrome dye. If you choose to purchase a rug made with synthetic dyes, make sure the finished look is not too bright and harsh, or alternately, too washed out. Synthetic dyes tend to hold their color longer than natural dyes with exposed to light.

Apply final sealer.",How to Regrout Tile," This is dependent on the size of your grout's joint (the space between the tiles where the grout lies). There are 2 types of grout for regrouting tile: sanded and non sanded. If your grout joints are larger than 1/8 inch (.3175 cm) use sanded grout to fill in the space; if your joints are going to be less than 1/8 inch (.3175 cm) use non sanded grout to fill in your joints as it is more compact.;
, If necessary, remove the existing grout before preparing to lay down new grout. This will keep the appearance clean and even, as well as prevent mold contamination. (Tools for this include a utility knife, a ceramic chisel, a hammer and for caulk removal from the facing of the tile use vice grips with a utility knife blade set in like a scraper), Apply a tile sealant over the surface of your tiles if they have become porous so the grout does not sink underneath the surface when regrouting your tile. Do this by using a tile sponge, a roller, or simply wipe the tiles with a coat of sealant and allow to dry for 24 hours.

, Mix the grout in one of the 5 gallon (19 L) buckets using your margin trowel.


A margin trowel is a small, hand-held tool used in masonry for laying pasty materials on tile, counter tops, and flooring.

, Apply a generous amount of grout to your grout joints along your tile floor using the rubber grout float. Be sure to distribute extra grout into the grout joints in order to fill them completely. Grout all areas of your tile floor except the expansion joints; these are the areas between the floor tile and bathtub, wall, door, and cabinet or sink area.


The rubber grout float is a rectangular, flat tool with a steel handle and rubber surface used to distribute grout. Hold the rubber grout float at a 30 degree angle and distribute grout across the surface of the tile floor.

, Remove the excess grout from the tile floor once every grout joint has been filled. Do this by going over the tile with the rubber grout float, only this time use it at a sharp angle and move it diagonally across the tile floor in order to scrap the excess grouting material off.


Moving diagonally avoids detaching recently laid grout from the grout joints.

, Let grout set for approximately 10 minutes. While the grout is setting, fill your second 5 gallon (19 L) bucket with water and grab your tile sponge in order to clean the tile floor.

, Dip the tile sponge in the bucket of water and wring out any excess water leaving a damp tile sponge.

, Wipe all grout residue off of the tile using the damp tile sponge in a diagonal motion. Clean the excess grout from the expansion areas using the margin trowel to leave those areas completely clean for caulking.

, Rinse tile sponge and repeat the previous step until all of the grout residue is removed and tile is completely clean of grout haze.

, Allow grout to cure for 24 to 48 hours before stepping on it to ensure its stability and that it is completely dry.

, Caulk the expansion joints using a caulk color that matches your grout. Completely fill these expansion joints then smooth and concave using your finger.

, Apply a penetrating sealer using either a sponge or spray bottle to the grout joints once the grout has completely cured. Wipe off excess sealer from the tile immediately as it will stain the tile.

Dry your bathroom after every shower or cleaning.,
Clean bathroom tile and grout weekly with a pH neutral cleaner.,
Clean the tile and grout occasionally with a mild alkali cleaner.,
Remove mold or mildew with a stronger oxygen bleach mixture.,
Seal bathroom grout with a latex penetrating sealer after installation, and again every year.",How to Protect Bathroom Grout," Use a squeegee, towel or cloth to dry all tiles after they get wet. Make sure you have a bathroom fan or window that can suck the excess moisture out from the air.


If you do not do this, grout will absorb excess moisture, which will turn into mold and mildew. It will stain and breakdown the structure of the grout, causing it to crumble prematurely. In extreme cases, the water and mold can get behind the grout and into the tiles.;
, Many multipurpose surface cleaners are pH neutral, so check on the bottle before you buy and use it.


A neutral cleaner means that the pH, or ""potential of hydrogen"" is not acidic or alkali. The potential of hydrogen is judged on a scale of 0 to 14, with 0 to 6.9 being acidic, 7 being neutral, and 7.1 to 14 being alkali. Water is also neutral, at a pH level of 7.

, The frequency of deep cleaning grout depends upon the amount of traffic the bathroom gets. Deep clean every month, if it is heavily used, with 1 of the 2 methods below.


Mix 1/2 cup of powdered oxygen bleach into a gallon of water. Use a spoon to stir it until it is completely dissolved. Pour the mixture all over your dry bathroom grout. Reapply after the solution soaks into the grout, or about every 15 minutes for vertical surfaces. After 30 minutes scrub the tile and grout with a nylon brush, or a toothbrush for an extra thorough cleaning. Rinse well with warm water and dry with a towel or squeegee. The more you reapply the oxygen bleach on your tile and scrub it, the cleaner your grout will become.
Wet the surface of your bathroom tile. Fill an empty salt shaker with baking soda. Sprinkle baking soda generously all over the grout. Let it sit for 10 minutes and then scrub it with a nylon brush. Rinse well with warm water and dry immediately.

, Make a paste with a small amount of water and apply it directly to the affected areas. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Scrub the grout with a toothbrush, and then rinse and dry it.

, A penetrating sealer is important for bathroom grout, because it is absorbed into the grout's pores and protects it from mold and mildew. Some of these sealers can be expensive, but it is a good idea to choose based on quality rather than price.


Allow your tiles to dry. It will take approximately 5 days for the moisture behind the tiles to evaporate. Do not use your bathroom during this time.
Apply the sealer to a sponge. Wipe it over the tile and grout of the entire bathroom surface you want to protect. Leave the sealer on for the time indicated by the product's directions.
Wipe the excess sealer off the surface of the tile with a damp cloth or paper towels. The directions may suggest you use a pH neutral cleanser first and then rinse off the tile with a damp cloth.
Apply a second coat, if it is recommended by the product. Allow the last coat of protective grout sealer to sit overnight before you use the bathroom.

Sort your clothes into piles.,
Read the ‘care tag’ on your clothes.,
Know what water temperature to select.,
Know what size load to select.,
Know what washing cycle to select.,
Add the right kind of washing fluid and close the door.,
Move your clothes to the dryer and select the right cycle.",How to Wash Your Clothes1," When washing clothes, there are two main things to keep in mind: what the color of the clothes are, and what material they are made out of. Not all fabrics can handle the same amount of water pressure or level of tumbling.


Separate light and dark colored clothes. When you wash your clothes, especially new clothes, some of the dye used on the fabric will run out of the clothes (that's why older clothes have a more faded color than bright, new clothes.) Any clothes that are white, cream, or a light, pale pastel color, should go in the ‘whites’ pile, while all other colored clothes should go in the ‘dark’ pile. If you don’t separate, your new bright blue shirt might dye all of your white clothes blue.
Separate your clothes based on the fabrics they are made out of. Some fabrics, like denim or thick cloth (like a towel) need to be washed on a heavier wash cycle than your silky lingerie (which gets washed on a delicate setting.) You should separate your clothes by the sort of wash cycle their fabrics are meant to be washed in.
Remember, towels and sheets should not be washed together. The top load washing machines should be used for towels, and sheets should be washed in front load machines (They are less harsh on sheets so they come out with fewer wrinkles).;
, The cloth tags are not just sewn into clothes to make your neck itchy when they rub against your skin--they’re actually there to help guide you through the washing process. When in doubt about how to wash an item, check the tag. The care tags tell you what fabric the item is made of, how it should be washed, and how it should be dried.


Some clothes need to be dry cleaned or washed by hand (see Method Two for how to do this.) The care tag will tell you if either of these things are necessary.

, Washing machines have different temperature settings because some fabrics and colors require different levels of heat to be washed thoroughly.


Use hot water for light colors, particularly light colors that are especially dirty. The heat will scald the stains right out of those white items.
Use cold water for dark colors, as cold water reduces the amount of dye that runs from these clothes (so your clothes won’t fade as fast when you use cold water.) Cotton items should also be washed in cold water as they are less likely to shrink in cold water.

, Most washing machines have a knob that you must turn to select the right size load for the amount of clothing you have (generally either small, medium or large.) If your clothes fill up one-third of the machine, you should select small. Two-thirds of the machine means you should select medium, and if you fill up the whole machine, you should select large.


Never squish clothes down so that you can fit more in. You should just run another load with your extra clothes or else you could risk jamming the machine or damaging it in some other way.

, As with temperature, washing machines also have different types of cycles, as different kinds of clothing require a different level of washing.Regular/Normal cycle: Select this when washing white clothes. It will leave your white items crisp and fresh.
Permanent press: Use this for your colored clothes. This cycle washes with warm water and ends with cooler water, which keeps your colors looking bright.
Delicate: As you might guess, anything that is relatively delicate (bras, dry-fit wear, cotton sweaters, dress shirts, etc.) Always make sure that your delicates do not require you to dry-clean or hand wash them (check the tag to make sure.)

, Washing fluid includes detergent, bleach, and fabric softener. You can either add your clothes and pour the right washing fluid on them, or keep your clothes out of the washer, fill the washer ⅓ of the way with water, add the washing fluid, and then add the clothes.








Detergent: The amount of detergent you put in your washing machine is determined by how large your load is. Generally, detergent lids act as cups that have marked off amounts. Generally, ⅓ of the cup should be filled with detergent for a small load, ⅔ for a medium load, and a full cup for a large load. However, read your specific detergent bottle for instructions on how to use that detergent--some detergents are more concentrated than others, meaning you don’t need to use as much.
Bleach: Bleach is used when you want to get tough stains out of clothes, or you want your whites to be really, really white. There are two kinds of bleach. Chlorine bleach is good for really making your whites white but should never be used on any colored fabric. All-fabric bleach can be used on colored fabrics.
Fabric softener: This is used when you like your towels extra fluffy. Fabric softener should be added during the rinse cycle. Some machines have a dispenser where you can pour the softener when you begin the wash cycle, and it will add it to the rinse cycle at the right time.

, Keep in mind that there are some clothes that should be air dried. Check the tag--if it says not to dry it, hang these items somewhere they can dry. Like the washing machine, the dryer also has settings that you have to wade through to dry your clothes. Add a dryer sheet and close the door.








Regular/heavy: White clothes are best dried on the regular/heavy setting. White clothes are generally pre-shrunk and can handle the more intense and higher heat drying system (unlike colors which fade under high heat.)
Permanent press: This is better for regular colored clothes. The medium heat and pressure makes sure that your clothes don’t fade.
Delicate: Any clothes that you washed on the delicate setting should be dried on the delicate setting. This setting uses close to room temperature air and slow cycle so that no damage comes to your delicates.

If you're re-grouting an old tile surface, remove the old grout.,
Pick a color of grout.,
Choose between sanded or unsanded grout.,
Wait for the thinset mortar to cure.,
Mix the grout according to the package directions.",How to Grout a Tile Floor1," You can remove the old grouting compound with a grout saw or a grout removal bit in a rotary tool.Make sure this is fully removed before proceeding.






;
, The color of the grout will affect whether the eye notices the beauty of the individual tiles, or to the overall pattern of the tiles. Light grout tends to accentuate the individual tiles by blending in, becoming ""invisible,"" while dark grout tends to accentuate the pattern of the tiles, their overall structure on the floor.








Choose a color that matches the tile if you want the floor to have a continuous appearance. If you installed the tile yourself and the grout lines aren't perfectly straight, a matching color of grout can help conceal these imperfections.
Choose a color of grout that contrasts the tile color if you want the individual tiles to stand out. If you installed tiles with an irregular edge, a contrasting color of grout will enhance this feature of the tile.
Choose a dark color for high traffic areas. White or light-colored grout will be difficult to keep clean.

, Sanded grout is stronger than unsanded grout. Sanded grout is needed when the grout lines are greater than 1







, Thinset is used to adhere the tiles to the floor during installation. The exact drying time varies by brand, so read and follow the thinset packaging carefully. You usually have to wait at least a day to grout a tile floor.








, You only want to mix as much as you can apply in about a half hour, as it will begin to dry out.









Dump the powder into a large bucket, and add only 3/4 of the recommended water, mixing thoroughly with a trowel. Afterwards, mix in the remaining 1/4 of water and mix again. It should be the consistency of thick batter; too much water will prevent it from hardening properly.

Mix your grout.,
Apply the grout.,
Remove any excess.,
Allow it to begin to set.,
Clean the surface.,
Allow the grout to cure completely.,
Finish expansion joints.,
Apply a sealant.",How to Grout," There are three main types of grout: sanded, unsanded (or wall), and epoxy. They each have different benefits and downsides but it mainly comes down to how big the gaps (called grout joints) are that you are filling. Grouts contract as they dry, so using the correct one to minimize this effect is important.


Sanded grout is used for joints that are 1/8"" or larger. Sanded grout should not be used on polished marble or other easily scratched surfaces.Unsanded grout. Unsanded grout is for joints 1/8"" or smaller, although once you're above 1/16th it's best to use sanded grout if at all possible.
Epoxy grout is much harder to apply because it dries so much faster but it lasts much longer and does not stain. This is a better type of grout to use, for example, with kitchen countertops. If you want an epoxy grout, it may be better to hire a professional.;
, Seal your tiles before grouting them if they are a porous material, like natural stone or certain types of ceramic. Your local hardware store should be able to advise you if you are unsure.

, Mix the grout according to the manufacturer's instructions using a margin trowel or other acceptable tool. The best way to do this is to start with the 2/3-3/4 of the water already in your mixing container, add the grout compound, mix it, and then add the rest of the water a little at a time until the consistency is correct.It is at the correct consistency when you can roughly form it into a ball.


There are also many additives that you can buy and mix into your grout. These can help combat staining, prolong the life of the grout, or have other helpful benefits. Talk with your local hardware store about what is available to you.
Giving the grout (after it's been mixed) about 10 minutes to cure and then remixing it can help reduce problems with shrinkage. You'll have less time to work with it though, so plan ahead.
Epoxy grout dries incredibly quickly. If using epoxy grout, leave out only a small amount and put the rest in the freezer. It will freeze, but it should thaw quickly when removed.

, Using a hard rubber float (found at your local hardware store), hold the float at a 45° angle and spread the grout across the surface of your tiles. Move the float in angled arcs to work the grout into the gaps.


Do not try to cover the whole area at once; instead, work in an area roughly between 4-9 square feet (2x2' or 3x3'). Once you've finished applying it in that area, move to the next area. Just don't allow too much time to pass before you do some cleanup work.
Do not apply grout to any expansion joints. These are the gaps at the edge of a floor or wall, and especially at spots exposed to water, such as the edge of a bathtub.

, Using a squeegee or your rubber float set at a hard angle, wipe the excess grout from the surface of the tiles. Be careful not to remove it from the joints, and be especially careful at the corners.


Another option is to use a sponge designed especially for grout. Get it damp, and gently wipe the excess away, cleaning the sponge after each short wipe.

, Give the grout a couple of minutes to begin to set.

, Clean the remaining grout off of your tiles. Use a grout sponge, get it wet (but not dripping), and wipe over the whole work surface.


If your grout is particularly stubborn about cleaning up, after one or two rounds of basic sponge cleaning go over the tiles with a low pile towel. Use a lightly damp sponge to get the tile surface just a little wet and then finish it off with the towel.

, Allow your grout to set completely, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Give it a little more time than they recommend, to be safe.

, Use caulk to fill the expansion joints, using your finger to achieve the necessary rounded shape., It is a good idea to apply a grout sealant once the grout and tiles have sat, completely dry, for at least 24 hours. This can help prevent mold growth.

Fill a bucket with water.,
Add a mild detergent.,
Dip your clothes in the water.,
Rinse your clothes.,
Let your clothes air dry.",How to Wash Your Clothes2," Generally you want a large bucket (roughly five gallons) filled with one to two gallons of water.


If you do not have a bucket, you can use a plugged sink. Make sure the sink is fully plugged and then fill the sink with warm water.

, This is not the same kind of detergent you would use in a washer machine. Regular detergent is too concentrated and will make your hand-wash only clothes feel grimy. You can purchase delicate detergent in the same isle as regular detergent in your grocery store--just make sure it says mild or delicate on the bottle.







, Swish them through the water so that they are fully saturated. You can even let them sit for several moments so that they fully absorb the detergent.








, You should rinse your clothes with warm, clean water. You can run your clothes one at a time under the faucet you used to fill up the bucket (or the sink.) Rinse the clothes until they are no longer sudsy and the water that runs off them is clean and without bubbles.








, You should not hang these clothes to dry, as hanging them could cause them to stretch. Instead, lay these delicate clothes flat to dry. This will ensure that they do not stretch, and will minimize the amount of wrinkles formed in the drying process.

Scoop some grout onto the tile floor with a trowel.,
Spread the grout over a small joint.,
Remove excess grout.,
Verify the grout color is what you want.,
Continue with grouting if you are satisfied with the color.,
Clean up the grout haze once everything is dry.,
Wait for the grout to cure before sealing it.",How to Grout a Tile Floor2," Begin in the corner farthest from the doorway and work backwards.








, Hold a grout float at a 45-degree angle to the floor to press the grout into the joint. Move the grout float at a diagonal angle to the grout lines for a smooth finish. If you wipe parallel to the lines, the edge of the grout float can end up gouging out the grout.








, Your floor is full of muddy grout, which isn't a lovely sight. After applying, wait about 15 to 30 minutes for the grout in the joints to set. Then start cleaning:









Fill two buckets with the water.
Dip a large sponge with rounded corners into the first water bucket and wring it out.
Wipe in a circular motion or at a diagonal to the grout lines to remove excess grout from the surface of the tiles.
Rinse the sponge in the second bucket and repeat until all grout is removed from the surface of the tile.
Wait three hours before repeating the process again.
Make a final pass along the grout lines with the damp sponge to make sure the grout lines are smooth.

, Use a hairdryer to quickly dry this small area of grout, so you see how the color looks against the installed tile. Now is the time to make a last-minute change, as grout is nearly impossible to remove once it's dried.








, Keep working in small areas at a time, so you can remove the excess grout before it has a chance to dry. If you have a helper, one can grout and the other can remove the excess.








, No matter how effectively you cleaned the excess grout from the tiles, you're likely to have a ""grout haze"" covering your tiles after your job is done. To clean up the grout haze:









Take a dry towel or used rag and wipe at the haze until it begins to cake off. An old sock will work well: you can wear the sock on your hand while you scrub.
Brush up the residue with a broom.

, Read the manufacturer's directions to determine how many days to wait. To seal grout:









Crack the windows to get good ventilation in your room.
Pour a small amount of sealant on the grout and work it in with a sponge, using small, circular motions.
Wipe the sealant off after about 5 to 10 minutes, although the time may vary. Check the sealant label to be sure.
Re-seal the grout every six months to a year if possible.

Clean the tiles and grout.",How to Darken Grout1," Pour liquid dish soap onto a damp sponge. Gently scrub the surface of the grout lines to remove any dirt or dust that has not absorbed into the grout. Rinse with a clean, damp sponge. Allow the grout to dry for at least 3 hours, or until it is completely dry to the touch. Grout stain will not adhere well if the grout is damp.;

Hang dry your clothes.,
Do not leave workout clothes in your gym bag.,
Wash gym clothes immediately when possible.",How to Wash Your Workout Clothes," Before you wash your work out clothes, turn everything inside out. Sweat, oil, and other bacteria come from your body. Therefore, they tend to accumulate inside your clothing. To get your clothing as clean as possible, turn it inside out first., Mix one part vinegar with four parts cold water. Soak your clothing in the sink for about 15 to 20 minutes. This will help remove some of the unwanted scent from your clothing.You can also add a splash of white vinegar to the wash for the best results.

, Some work out clothing must be hand washed. If the tag says hand wash only, wash your clothing in your sink or bath tub with some laundry detergent. Rinse the clothing thoroughly after hand washing and then hang it to dry., Fragrances can actually be harmful to work out clothing. Fragrances can clog the fibers of work out clothing. This can make them hold onto more odor. Scent free detergents work best for work out clothes.You may be able to find sports washes in the laundry detergent section, which are specifically designed to remove odor from clothing.

, Work out clothing tends to shrink in hot water. Always wash your work out clothing in cold water. Select the coldest option for water on your washing machine when washing your workout clothes., Work out sneakers can actually be washed in a washing machine. Wipe off any caked on mud or dirt and remove the shoe laces before adding your sneakers to the wash.Place the sneakers in a pillow case and then tie it shut.
Wash the sneakers with dark clothing to keep them from bouncing around too much.
Used the coldest setting possible to wash your sneakers.

, Sports bras can be washed in the laundry machine as long as you use a non-chlorine detergent. You can wash them in hot or cold water, but should always allow them to air dry. If you have a lingerie bag, place sports bras in this before throwing them in the wash. This will prevent them from snagging., Socks can be washed with your regular clothing. However, you should avoid fabric softeners when washing socks. These can make your socks less resistant to odor., Jock straps should be washed with care to prevent damage. Hand wash your jock straps or wash them on a very gentle setting on your washer. You should always air dry your jock straps., It's always best to allow work out clothing to air dry. They are less likely to stretch out this way. You should also hang dry your clothing if you don't have time to do laundry after a work out. Sweaty clothing should be hung up somewhere in your home.If you don't already have one, invest in a clothing rack. This is important if work out frequently, as you'll need somewhere to hang dry your clothes.

, The longer you leave your work out clothes sitting in a bag, the worse they will smell. This will make washing them more time consuming. As soon as you get back from the gym, remove your work out clothes and hang them up somewhere in your home.Leaving gym clothes buried can be just as bad as leaving them in a gym bag. Always hang sweaty gym clothes instead of leaving them bunched up on the floor.

, The longer work out clothes are left sitting in the dryer, the worse they'll smell. Whenever possible, wash your work out clothes immediately. This way, they're less likely to build up a bad smell."

Leave the grout alone for 5–10 minutes.,
Remix and apply.",How to Mix Grout," Sanded grout has been mixed with fine sand, which helps keep it in place across the entire joint instead of shrinking. Choose sanded grout when filling gaps ⅛ inch (3.2 millimeters) or wider.Sanded grout is not ideal for narrow lines, as the sand can take up too much of the width and weaken the structure.;
, Non-sanded grout, also called ""unsanded"" or ""wall grout,"" is typically recommended for lines under ⅛"" (3.2 mm) wide, but some prefer to reserve non-sanded grout for lines 1/16"" (1.6 mm) or smaller. Non-sanded grout will shrink significantly as it dries, but the more narrow the line, the less noticeable this is.


This grout is also stickier and easier to work with than sanded grout, especially on vertical surfaces., If you are applying the grout to polished stone, test sanded grout on an inconspicuous corner first to check for scratching from sand particles. If the stone does end up scratched, use non-sanded grout instead. If the grout joints are considerably larger than ⅛"" (3.2 mm) wide, consider epoxy grout instead.


Highly reflective polished stone is more likely to be scratched than honed stone, with a matte appearance.

, Epoxy grout resists grease, acid, and wear much better than ordinary grout, and can substitute for either sanded or unsanded grout.It provides serious protection for kitchen countertops or other areas with high spill risk, but dries much faster and is much harder to apply than other forms of grout.It also tends to be considerably more expensive. It’s usually only needed in commercial kitchens, such as the ones in restaurants.


Epoxy grout can discolor some porous, unglazed, stone materials. Seal the stone first before you apply the epoxy grout., Caulk creates a more flexible seal.Use it instead of grout when filling the gap between a wall and a floor, or another joint between two different planes.


If you’re concerned about matching throughout, you can also purchase either sanded or unsanded grout caulk, which is a mixture of the two.

, The safest choice is an unobtrusive grout that matches the material you'll be joining, but you can try for a striking contrast if you're certain you like the look. Because white grout turns dirty yellow or off-white over time, light grey or light brown are generally better options, especially in humid or wet environments. If you do not plan on sealing your grout, a darker grout may be a better option.Dust from black, green, and red grout tends to be more difficult to clean off surrounding materials, so make sure to wipe the excess grout away thoroughly if you choose one of these colors., A polymer grout additive increases the grout's durability, but read the grout's label first, as it may already contain an additive. If it does not, you may purchase an additive and follow the instructions on its label while mixing, replacing some or all of the water as directed. Otherwise, the process is the same as described below.

, Epoxy grout products typically consist of two or three components, and the mixing proportions between these vary depending on the brand. For more traditional grout products, the steps below should work, but check the label first in case of unusual instructions.

, You'll need an empty bucket, a container of water, and a sponge. Find a pointer trowel, margin trowel, or a mixer paddle drill bit to use to mix the grout and apply it. Finally, pull on a pair of gloves.

, Measure out all of the grout powder required for the quantity of grout you’re producing and pour it into the bucket.

, Check the grout label to find out how much water you need for the amount of space you'll be covering. Pour ¾ of the amount of water required in with the grout powder.


If you have a large area to cover, consider mixing half the grout at a time, so the grout in the bucket doesn't dry out before you're done.

, Use your trowel to mix the powder into the water, until you've made a thick paste with no dry lumps. Tilt the bucket toward you slightly, rolling it on its edge as you scrape off any dry grout from the sides.If you have a mixing drill and attached grout paddle, you can use that instead. Stay below 150 rpm to avoid weakening the grout with excess air bubbles.

, Add water one squeeze at a time from a sponge, mixing it thoroughly into the grout. Aim for a smooth ""peanut butter"" consistency, with no lumps.


If the grout gets watery, pour in a little bit more powder.

, Allow the grout to ""slake,"" or strengthen through chemical reactions.Leave your trowel on newspaper or other surface to prevent a mess.

, Briefly mix together the grout again, as it will become slightly stiff during slaking. Use immediately, as most grout sets within 30–60 minutes.


If the grout has already hardened, you'll need to discard it and make a new batch. Adding more water after slaking will not be effective.

You can buy any scent of dish detergent that you would like.
You can also try adding your own scents with things like lavender oil.;
, You will need to gather up some dirty laundry to wash, just as you would normally when doing the laundry. Select whichever clothes you want to wash and put them into the washing machine. Keep some of the following standard tips in mind to help keep your clothes looking great:Don't mix light and dark clothes.
Heavy clothes, like jeans or towels, should be separated from lighter clothes.
Do not wash brightly colored clothes with white laundry.

, While the dish detergent won't have an effect on the temperature settings, you will still need to select them correctly. Higher temperatures may clean your clothes better than cooler temperatures. However, high temperatures can damage clothes easily. Here are some basic tips to help you keep your clothes safe during the wash:Delicates and permanent press clothes should go on cold wash and cold rinse.
Durable colors can go in on a warm wash and cold or warm rinse.
Durable white clothes can be set to hot wash and cold rinse.

, Choosing a cycle for your laundry will help your clothes stay clean and prevent them from unnecessary wear and tear from the wash. Longer cycles are great for heavily soiled items, but they can also wear out delicate clothing. Shorter cycles are good for lightly soiled or delicate items. Here are some basic tips to help you pick the right wash cycle:Quick washes are great for clothes that aren't very dirty or items that you want to wear again soon.
Pre-wash can add an extra soak to help break up dirt.
Permanent press settings will help maintain presses in any clothing items that have them.
Heavy duty will be a long cycle that will aggressively clean heavily soiled items. This setting is not recommended for delicate clothing.
Delicate setting is used for fragile items that are easily damaged in the wash.
Extra rinse will add another rinse cycle at the end of the wash, ensuring the clothes are clean.

, Don't add the same amount of dish detergent as you would when using laundry detergent. If you add too much dish detergent, it will foam up and spill out of the machine. Always add the correct amount of dish detergent when using it for laundry to prevent a big mess.Add 1 teaspoon for small loads.
Add 2 teaspoons for medium loads.
Add 3 teaspoons for large loads.

, After the dish detergent is added, let the washing machine do its thing., After the washing machine has finished its washing cycle, it's time to dry the clothes. Drying your clothes can be done just as you would normally do when taking them out of a laundry detergent wash. Enjoy your fresh, clean clothes and the money you've saved by using dish detergent to do the laundry."

Treat stains with a spray stain remover while the slipcover is still on the couch or chair.,
Remove the slipcovers from the couch, cushions or chair


If you are cleaning a couch slipcover, separate the cushion covers from the slipcover for the body of the couch.,
Wash the slipcover in your washing machine.,
Remove the slipcover from the washer and place it in the dryer for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Take the slipcover from the dryer while it is still partially wet.,
Put the damp slipcovers back on the couch or chair and allow them to dry overnight.",How to Wash Slipcovers," Pre-shrunk slipcovers are very common. If it has not been pre-shrunk, it is a good idea to take it to a dry-cleaning service, or the cover may be too small after washing.;
, This will allow you to identify them more quickly.


If you have an extremely tough stain, cover it with liquid dish-washing soap and water, and then lather and rinse. Then, apply the spray-on stain remover.

, Most conventional washing machines are not big enough to wash an entire set of slipcovers.

,


Set it to the permanent-press or gentle cycle, since these settings avoid premature aging of the fabric.
Use warm water for light-colored slipcovers and cold water for dark-colored slipcovers, to avoid fading.
If you do not have these settings or just want to be extra careful, turn the slipcovers inside out before putting them in the washer. You should not do this if it is stained.
Use the Extra Rinse option while you wash your washing machine to ensure all detergent is removed from the thick fabric. If you do not have this option, wash your slipcover again without detergent.

, Choose the permanent press setting for the dryer as well. This will help to avoid too many wrinkles.

,


Iron any large wrinkles after the damp slipcover is removed from the dryer. Do not iron the entire slipcover or it may shrink.

, Placing them on the couch will help to avoid shrinkage and wrinkles.


Smooth out any wrinkles while the cover is still damp.
Do not place the cushions back on the sofa. Instead, you should find a place for cushions to lean during the night so that most surfaces are in contact with the air.

, Be sure to check along the seams. If there are any rips or tears, you will need to sew them back up.

, This will help things balanced inside the washer.If you are unable to fit the pillows in the drum, squeeze them first to get the air out.Try not to use a top-loading washer, as the agitator may damage the pillows. If you do not have a front-loading washer, consider visiting a Laundromat; they should have one available that you can use.If you must use a top-loading washing machine, put the pillows in vertically instead of horizontally. That way, they won't get tangled in the agitator., This will prevent any buildup or residue. Also, try to use liquid detergent instead of powder one. Powder detergent is more likely to cause buildup and residue.This can lead to skin irritations and allergies. Pillows are bulky, so they do not rinse out well. The less soap you use, the less you will have to rinse them.

, If you can, try to use hot water. This will help kill any dust mites that might be living inside your pillow.Keep in mind, however, that hot water may also damage the feathers. If you are worried about this, use warm or cool water instead., This will help get any soap residue out. The extra spin cycle will help get rid of any excess moisture.

, Place the pillow between two towels, and press down on it. The towels will help soak up any extra water. Repeat this step for the other pillow. Do not wring or twist the pillows., Use a delicate cycle, with either a low-heat or no-heat setting. Using low-heat will help the pillows dry faster, but it may damage the feathers inside. Using the no-heat or air-only cycle may take longer (and two to three cycles), but it will be the safest for the feathers.Be sure to fluff the pillow between cycles. Do this by taking it out of the dryer and beating it. This will also help break up any clumps inside the pillow.
If you are using a low-heat setting, consider using the air-only setting towards the end of the cycle. This will help keep the pillows from overheating and getting ruined., If you do not have any dryer balls, you can use some clean tennis/canvas shoes instead; be sure to put them inside a clean pillowcase first, however. You can also stuff a tennis balls into a clean sock. This will help keep the pillow fluffy as it is drying.You can also add a thick towel into the dryer. This will help soak up any water that might be left in the pillow., Even with dryer balls, there may still be some clumps inside the pillow. Hold the pillow by two corners and shake it up and down for a few minutes. Repeat this step for the other side.

, Do not use your pillows if they are still damp. Doing so can lead to rot and mildew.

, Set the washing machine to a ""soak"" cycle. Add the hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar directly into the drum. Once the soak cycle has finished, add the detergent., Add it directly to your detergent.Baking soda may also help get rid of stains.

, White vinegar may also help get rid of smells.

, This will give the pillow a nice, subtle scent. Try something soothing, such as lavender, rosemary, or vanilla., These are padded pillowcases that you put over the pillow. You can then put a fabric pillowcase over these. Pillow protectors will help keep the pillow clean longer, and keep it from getting stained.

, The sunlight, heat, and fresh air will help kill any odor-causing bacteria. It may also make your pillow smell fresher.

, Towels tend to absorb colors of other clothing, shed lint, and trap smaller clothes items, which results in a less effective wash.While it's fine to mix loads if you'd like to save money, time, or energy, be aware that a separate towel load will produce best results.


You may wish to wash your towels separately if you used them to clean up a particularly filthy mess, so you don't expose your clothing to stains or germs., White and light colored laundry items will become discolored if washed with dark colored items, while the dark items will fade over time. Towels are especially absorbent, so if you want to maintain their appearance you should only wash them in separate light and dark loads. This is especially true of new towels.


Colored towels should only be washed with the light load if they are faint pastel or pale yellow in color. Otherwise, wash them in the dark load.

, Wash them before using to remove special softener that manufacturers use to improve appearance, since that substance makes the towel less absorbent.Because new towels are especially likely to lose their color, use half the usual amount of detergent and add 1/2 – 1 cup of white vinegar (120 – 240 mL) onto the towels to minimize later color bleeding.If you wish to be especially careful, use this vinegar method the first two or three times you wash a towel.

, Too much soap can damage towels and make them less fluffy. If your load only contains towels, use half the amount of detergent recommended by the manufacturer.If you are washing luxury or extra delicate towels, be sure to use a detergent labeled mild. Detergent typically goes into a tray labeled for this purpose, or is poured directly into some top-load washers.


Use an ordinary amount of detergent when washing towels in a load with tougher clothing, or if the towels are heavily soiled.
Instructions should be included on the packaging of your detergent. Many liquid detergents have a cap that can be used as a cup, with a line indicating the recommended quantity to use for a typical load.

, Most white and light-colored towels should be washed in hot water. Most dark towels should be washed in warm water, as hot water can make them bleed.However, if your towels are linen or have a decorative trim or delicate fibers, a cold wash will preserve them best.You may still need to wash delicate towels on warm instead of cold if they become heavily soiled. The hotter the water, the cleaner and more sanitized the towels will be.

, Fabric softeners are optional additions to your laundry load that are typically added in a special tray, separate from your detergent. While they make your clothing supple and soft, they will decrease the absorbency of your towels. Only use fabric softener if you are willing to sacrifice your towel's life span for greater fluffiness, and only do so once every three or four washes.Consult your washing machine manual if you cannot find the fabric softener tray.

, Add 1/2 cup (120 mL) white vinegar to the detergent once every few loads to keep your towels free of odors and mildew. For a more heavy-duty sanitation, you can use 3/4 cup (180 mL) non-chlorine bleach instead, making sure to use color-safe bleach if your towels are dark in color.


Bleach should be placed in the tray labeled for this purpose. If your top-load machine does not have a bleach compartment, mix the bleach with 1 quart water and pour into the machine 5 minutes after the load began.
Vinegar is best added during the final rinse when used for this purpose.Pour it into the fabric softener tray, or simply open a top-load washer near the end of the wash and pour it in directly., When you remove your towels from the wash, give them a small shake to keep the surface fibers fluffy and absorbent. See the Drying section below for instructions on how to dry your towels.

, Even if you only used a towel lightly, you should hang it up to dry in an area with good air flow, away from steam. Spread it out so there are no bunches and each part of the towel dries evenly. Proper drying after uses reduces the chance of mildew and increases the towel's life span.


Do not hang one towel over another if either of them are still damp. Each towel needs to be fully exposed to air for proper drying.

, The longer you let your towels sit around wet, the more chance mildew has to grow on your towels. Dry the towels immediately after you're done washing them to keep them clean. Note that hanging up a towel to dry may take several hours in humid or cold conditions, but as long as they are spread out in an area with good air flow they should be fine.

, Most towels are made from cotton and should be dried at high heat. Linen towels and towels with a fragile decorative trim should be dried at a cool setting when using a machine.


Always remove lint from the lint trap before starting your dryer. A build up of lint could cause a fire.
You do not need to sort towels by color when using a dryer. You may include them in a dryer load with other items, but there's the possibility a towel will trap a piece of clothing and prevent it from drying.

, Keeping towels in the dryer after they are already dry will damage the fibers and weaken your towel.Check on small loads before the cycle is finished, simply by opening the door. If they're already done, cancel the drying cycle and remove the towels.


If your towels are slightly damp at the end of a drying cycle, it may be more economical to hang them up to dry as described below instead of running your dryer again. If you do start another drying cycle, check on it halfway through to see if the towels are dry.

, Dryer sheets are used to soften your clothing. Much like fabric softener, dryer sheets will create a waxy finish on your towels that interferes with their ability to absorb water. If you still want to use dryer sheets for softer, fluffier towels, limit yourself to using them once every three or four loads.

, If you don't have a dryer, or your towels came out slightly damp from the dryer, you can spread them out over a clothes horse, on a clothesline, or on any clean surface with enough room. If you are used to dryers, air dried towels will initially appear stiffer, but will soften immediately when they touch water.


Air flow will help dry your towels faster. Pick a breezy location outside or near an open window, but be sure to fasten your towels securely against wind with clothespins.
Direct sunlight is best for drying towels and reducing germs.If no sunlight is available, put your towels in front of (but not on top of) a heater. You could also place them above a heating vent.

, Do not iron towels made of cotton, or other fluffy towels. Linen hand towels may be ironed if you would like to make them smooth and crisp.After ironing, they may be folded and stored like any other towel.

, There should be no hint of dampness when you touch a dried towel; if there is, you may want to hang them up to dry for another hour or so. When they're ready, fold them several times until they fit comfortably on a shelf without bunching up or getting wrinkled.


Consider using your towels in rotation to avoid wearing them out more quickly. Alternatively, save your nicest towels for guests and use the rest for everyday purposes.

, Washing towels by hand saves money, uses much less energy, and doesn't wear them out nearly as quickly as a washing machine. However, while hand towels are relatively easy to wash in a sink or bucket, large towels will become quite heavy when they absorb water, and will take a large amount of work and time to clean.For large towels, the equipment mentioned below is recommended, especially the agitator. However, instructions for washing using only your hands are also included.

, Depending on how large your load of towels is, you'll want to use one of these containers. First, make sure the container is clean by scrubbing with plenty of soap and hot water. When you put the towels in, make sure they are all spread out and not knotted or bunched together.


A kitchen sink or heavily used bathtub may require stronger cleaning methods. Allow bleach or other cleaning products time to do their work, then rinse off thoroughly before using the container as a laundry tub.

, You can use cold or warm water; there is no need to make it scalding hot.Add a small amount of mild detergent. A typical 5 gallon (20 L) bucket requires about a tablespoon (15 mL) of detergent, while a bathtub may require 4 tablespoons (60 mL). Use your judgement and add more detergent if the towels are particularly dirty.


Use eco-friendly detergent if you will be dumping the water outside.
Always use mild detergent to protect your hand if you don't plan on wearing gloves. Try to use it whenever washing towels, since they tend to be easily damaged by harsh detergents.

, Borax will soften your water and make it easier for the detergent to do its work.It is safe and easy to add to your hand washing session, although you should keep it out of reach of pets and children.


Try adding one tablespoon of borax per gallon of water (15 mL borax for every 4 L water). You can increase this amount if you are having trouble removing stains, but it's wise to start with a small amount so there is no chance of staining or damaging delicate items., A large or muddy load of towels should be left to soak for 40 – 60 minutes, while a lightly used load that fits in a bucket may be ready in a few minutes.This soaking will save you a lot of effort by removing a portion of the dirt.

, Heavy towels are difficult to agitate by hand, and most easily done using a storebought manual agitator. You can also make your own by purchasing a brand new plunger and cutting holes in the rubber for water to squeeze through. Using your agitator, spend about two minutes (roughly 100 strokes of the agitator) squeezing the towels and pushing them against the walls of the tub.If you are washing hand towels, you may be able to imitate this process by hand. Wearing rubber gloves, squeeze the towels together and against the side of the tub. Large cotton towels will be difficult to wash this way, and if you do not have an agitator tool you should expect to spend much longer than the times listed here to get them fully clean.

, If you own a clothes wringer, you can put each towel through it and wring it by turning the handle with as much pressure as you can. Otherwise, twist each towel by hand in both directions, trying to squeeze as much of the water out as possible.


Use rubber gloves if you want to keep your hands clean.

, You can either move the towels to a new bucket of cold water, or empty the container and fill it again with fresh cold water. Rinse the towels in the running water as you fill the bucket. Let soak five minutes before continuing.

, Again, you'll spend about 2 minutes or 100 strokes of the agitator pressing the towels against the walls and base of the container and pushing them around. The water should get less dirty this time around, and contain fewer soap bubbles.

, Repeat the process just as you did after the initial agitation. Rinse the towels under running cold water. Wring the towels dry by twisting and squeezing them by hand or in a wringer. Soak them in a fresh bucket of cold water for five minutes. Agitate them for about another two minutes. One more round should be sufficient for most towels, but heavy or heavily soiled ones may take several more sessions.


When the towels are ready, the water should be free of dirt and soap suds. Leaving soap suds on the towels will make them stiff, starchy, and bad at absorbing water., When the towels appear clean and completely free of suds, twist them through the wringer or using your hands. Do this several times to remove as much water as possible.

, See the section on Drying Towels for information on how to dry your towels using air, skipping the dryer steps. If you need them dried quickly, you can of course follow those instructions in the same section for using a dryer machine.

Hand wash leather for basic maintenance and deep cleaning.,
Make a soapy water solution with castile soap.,
Dip a soft, lint-free cloth in the cleaning solution.,
Wipe the leather with the cloth to remove dirtiness.,
Remove soap film and remaining dirtiness with a clean rag.,
Let the item air dry.,
Treat the item with leather conditioner.",How to Wash Leather1," Hand cleaning is great for spot treating scuff marks and dirt, but it’s also an effective way of deep cleaning leather.Although if your item is expensive or made of hard leather, a professional cleaner might be the safest cleaning method.;
, Pour a small amount of castile soap into a bowl of distilled water.Agitate the solution with your hand or a whisk to distribute the soap and create bubbles.









For even better leather protection, use a soap specially formulated for cleaning leather. These kinds of soaps are available at many general retailers, hardware stores, and craft stores.
If you don’t have castile soap or a specialty leather cleaner, you can use a mild soap, like dish soap, as a substitute.Always test your cleaning solution on an out of sight spot on the leather before using it to clean more visible parts., A normal dishcloth will do if you don’t have better options, but a microfiber cloth will work best. Avoid using any kind of abrasive material, like a scrubbing pad, as these may scratch leather, creating cloudiness in its finish.









Generally speaking, harsh cleaners should be avoided when cleaning leather. These can cause a negative reaction the deforms the leather’s surface.

, Follow the grain of the leather with your cloth as you wipe. In areas where there is caked-on dirt or a tough-to-remove spot, rub using a light, circular motion to remove the debris.








Avoid completely saturating the leather with water as you clean, which can damage the leather. You may want to allow the leather to dry a bit if it becomes too wet while cleaning., You should be especially careful to remove all soap when you're done, as it can dry the leather out and cause it to crack. Take a fresh lint-free rag and dampen it with clean water. Wipe all cleaned leather surfaces thoroughly.







, Arrange the item as it would rest normally on a hanger or suitable surface (like a chair or drying rack) until it air dries completely. Avoid exposing leather items to direct sunlight, as this can dry out the fabric and cause it to crack.







, This last step will restore the leather's smooth texture and keep it protected. Always follow the conditioner’s directions for the best results, but generally, buff conditioner into the fabric with a clean, dry, lint-free cloth.








Over time, oil that keeps leather supple and resilient disappears from the fabric. Cleaning, especially, can leave leather brittle if you don’t replenish these oils with leather conditioner.When cleaning finished leather, avoid products such as mink oil and leather waxes. They can destroy the polish and appearance of finished leather products.

Wash your hemp by hand.,
Wash your hemp garments a few times if you need to soften them.,
Air or line dry hemp clothing.,
Eliminate wrinkles from the wash by giving your hemp a hot iron.",How to Wash Hemp1," Hemp is a durable and long-lasting fabric, but it's most effectively washed by hand. Machine washing and especially drying has a tendency to weaken hemp more quickly, losing the texture and strength that many people love about hemp clothing and other items.


If you plan to wash your hemp fabric by hand, use a gentle, all-natural detergent and make sure to rinse thoroughly. Tom's soap works great for washing hemp items.
Residual soap can leave cellulose, which oxidizes and leaves large brown spots on hemp, making it very important to soak hemp items in clean water thoroughly for a while after washing them.;
, Hemp will get softer the more you use and wash it. If you need to get it softened faster, you can use a commercial softener, or just soak the hemp to let the fibers soften over time.


If you want to soften hemp quickly, throwing it in the washer and dryer is perfectly fine. Use hot water to slowly ease open the hemp fibers and tumble dry it a few times to get it feeling soft quickly. Hemp should come out of the dryer soft and fluffy as any fabric.

, To get the most life out of hemp, it's recommended to air dry or line-dry it as often as possible. If your intention is to soften the hemp quickly, the heat dryer is fine to use a few times on a gentle cycle, but it's good to air dry hemp long term. Hemp clothing can be one of the most long-lasting and durable fabrics if treated properly and air-dried gently., Once your hemp piece is dry, you can use an iron on hot to flatten it out if it is wrinkled or creased. It is best to iron the hemp when it is still slightly damp, so you can take it off the line while it's still a bit damp.


Stretch the article to its natural shape and size and then iron it normally. For hemp that is colored, use an iron on the underside only.

Pick an item that isn't too expensive.,
Buy or make castile soap.,
Pour ¼ cup (59 ml) of soap into the detergent dispenser.,
Add the leather item and wash it with a gentle cycle.,
Run the wash cycle.,
Restore the item's shape.,
Let the item air dry.,
Apply leather conditioner to the item.",How to Wash Leather2," It's important that you know from the outset: there's no guarantee that machine-washing your item won't do damage to it. Durable items, like boots or jackets, might be the best candidates for machine-washing.Don't wash leather that is brightly colored, as color may fade in the washing machine.
Avoid washing leather items that have delicate seams or lots of detailing, unless you're comfortable risking damage to these features.
If an item is expensive and needs to be cleaned, like a fancy pair of boots or a nice suede jacket, use a spot cleaning method or a professional cleaning service., This gentle soap is relatively easy on leather, which can be damaged by soaps that are more abrasive. Any type of castile soap will do. If you can't find it at the store, you can make your own., Castile soap is used in the same way you'd use regular laundry detergent. Add the soap to your laundry machine in the fashion your machine requires and turn the water setting to “Cold.”







, To prevent your leather item from taking too much of a beating during the wash cycle, you may want to throw in a few other black items to absorb some shock. Use the gentlest setting your washer has.









Turn your leather item inside out, if possible, and then zip all zippers and fasten all fasteners. This process may help “flush” stains out while protecting the visible parts of the leather from damage., Keep an eye on the leather item as it washes. You’ll want to snag it from the washing machine as soon as the cycle is finished, so it doesn't get a chance to dry in there.








Leather that is dried crumpled, creased, or misshapen could cause it to permanently deform in these ways.

, Lay it out flat or hang it up. Smooth out the wrinkles and folds that formed in the wash. In some cases, you may be able to get some additional length out of the leather by pulling in it firmly to stretch it out while it’s still wet.









Be careful when stretching the leather. There’s no guarantee it won’t rip, and if it does it won’t be easy or cheap to fix., Avoid letting leather items dry directly in the sun. The sunlight can bake out important oils necessary to keep your leather supple.Hang the items to air dry out of the sun in a room. Open the windows to increase airflow and decrease dry times.








Don't use a hair dryer or any type of directed heat on your leather item.
If you use the dryer, make sure it's the ""low"" or ""no-heat"" setting., Leather conditioner will help restore the leather to its previous texture and protect it. Generally, conditioner is applied by being buffed into the leather with a paper towel or soft, lint-free cloth. After the conditioner is applied, the item is ready for use.








If you don’t have a commercial leather conditioner, try substituting a light application of olive oil. Apply the olive oil as you would a conditioner – by lightly buffing it into the leather."

Identify unfinished leather.,
Remove dirt with saddle soap.,
Use a soft bristle brush for severe dirtiness and crevices.,
Wipe away remaining lather.,
Air dry the leather item overnight.,
Treat the leather.",How to Wash Leather3," Items with unfinished leather will have a rough-looking surface. You’ll find leather like this most commonly on items that generally have some wear and tear, such as construction boots, horse saddles, and baseball gloves., Pour a quarter-sized amount of saddle soap onto a clean, damp cloth. After you’ve worked up a good lather of soap on the surface of the leather, flush it clean with water. As per usual, avoid oversaturating the leather with water.








If you notice the leather becoming waterlogged, take a short break and let it air dry for a little while to prevent damage., Your cloth might not be enough to clear crevices or bust up severe dirtiness. Be sure to use a very soft bristle brush, like one made from nylon, to protect damage to the surface of the leather.








To prevent accidentally damaging the leather, before using a brush, first test it out on an inconspicuous spot of the leather first., Dampen a clean, lint-free cloth in water. Wring out excess moisture then use this cloth to wipe away any remaining soap or dirtiness. Be thorough! Leftover soap will dry out and harm the surface of your leather.







, Unfinished leather has a tendency to take on water a little more easily than finished leather. Because of this, you should give unfinished pieces at least eight hours to dry, or an overnight period.







, Pour a leather preservative, such as mink oil, onto the dried item. Using the remaining unused cloth, work a generous amount of oil onto the object, especially into any cracks and areas that look worn. The item is now ready to use.

Read clothing labels prior to washing.,
Sort your items based on color.,
Separate your clothes by fabric type.,
Turn dark clothing inside out.,
Wash dark clothes in cold water.,
Select the right detergent.,
Measure detergent carefully.,
Take special considerations when washing delicate clothing.,
Hang dry dark clothes.,
Do not wash dark clothes too often.,
Use bleach with caution.,
Make sure your detergent comes with fabric softener.",How to Wash Dark Clothes," This is always a good precaution, regardless of what clothes you're washing. You want to make sure your clothing is machine washable. Not all clothing is.Expensive clothing may be dry clean only. This means you'll have to take it to the dry cleaners. A dark business suit, for example, may be dry clean only.
Other clothing, like wool clothing, may be hand wash only. You will have to gently wash these items in a sink or tub with a small amount of detergent, rinse them, and then hang them or lay them flat to dry.;
, You do not want to throw in dark clothing with light clothing. Dark clothes, black clothes especially, can bleed onto lighter shades in the wash.Go through your dirty laundry piece by piece. Have one pile for dark clothes, and one pile for light clothes.
Take into consideration how dirty each piece of laundry is. You should not wash very dirty clothes with clothes that only need a light wash.

, Just because all your items are dark does not mean they can all be thrown in together. Fabric type affects the kind of wash a piece of clothing needs.Heavier fabrics, like jeans and towels, should be washed separately from light to medium-weight fabrics, like t-shirts.
Put delicates, like lacy underwear and bras, in their own pile. They should be washed separately.

, The wash cycle can agitate dark fabrics. This can result in a faded appearance. While all dark clothing fades over time, you can extend the shelf life of your dark outfits by turning them inside out prior to the wash., Dark clothing is particularly susceptible to losing color during a wash cycle. Cold water helps the fibers in dark fabrics stay intact.Set the machine for the coldest setting possible. If your clothing is very dirty, use the soil setting, but set it at the lightest possible level.
Always use the shortest cycle possible. The less time dark clothes are in the washer, the better. This will help them maintain their color.

, You want to stick to a basic detergent without additives like bleach. Look for a detergent that does not have any additives advertised on the package. This should be safe for your darker clothes.Some items may be labeled as ""color safe"" or ""color safe bleach,"" but do not use these on darker clothes. Such detergents are better used on light colored clothing.

, Read the package to see how much detergent to add. Every detergent is slightly different, so there is no set amount to use.However, if your clothing is very soiled, you can add a little extra detergent to the wash. This can help you get the job done the first time. Remember, washing dark clothing always causes some fading, so an efficient wash is best.

, Delicate fabrics, like those found in lacy underwear, require a gentle wash. Use a delicate cycle when washing these clothes. Be extra vigilant about reading labels when it comes to delicates. Many kinds of lingerie and expensive bras are hand wash only.However, if you don't have time to do an extra load, you can place these items in a mesh bag and wash them with your other clothing.

, Tumbling around in the dryer is not good for dark clothes. It can cause them to look faded. After removing your dark clothes from the wash, hang them out to dry in your laundry room.Do not hang sweaters, however. Sweaters should be laid on a flat surface to dry.
You should also avoid drying dark clothing in the sun. This can cause it to fade.

, Every time you wash dark clothes, they lose some color. With denim especially, black dye will wash away during the wash cycle. Only wash clothing that is very dirty or starting to smell.Small stains can usually be treated without a washing machine. You can blot out stains with a white cloth and a mixture of water and dish washer detergent. You should use half a cup of water, and a teaspoon of detergent.
After blotting out the stain, rinse the area by blotting the area with plain water.

, In some occasions, you may need bleach for stubborn stains that do not respond to other treatments. Only use bleach when absolutely necessary, and make sure to choose a quality bleach.Choose a bleach labeled ""all fabric bleach."" This should be safer on your dark clothes than ""color safe bleach.""
Your washing machine may have a bleach dispenser. Follow the instructions for use. If you do not have a bleach dispenser, you will need to dilute the bleach on your own. Refer to the package label for instructions.
Only use bleach after running out of other options. Dark clothing should be bleached infrequently, if at all.

, Many detergents come with fabric softener, so you may assume yours does. However, some do not, so always check first. If your detergent does not come with added fabric softener, it's a good idea to throw some in. This is especially important if you're washing something like a towel, which you will want soft.You can buy a fabric softener at the grocery store or a supermarket. Follow the instructions for how much to add to your wash.
Some laundry machines may have a separate dispenser where you add fabric softener.

Use the gentle cycle.,
Wash hemp at any temperature.,
Air or line dry hemp clothing.",How to Wash Hemp2," Put your hemp garments and linens on the gentle or delicate cycle and use a soap that is mild, made of all-natural, and gentle on fabric. Delicate hemp pieces may be placed in a lingerie bag before putting them in the washing machine to help protect them.

, It's fine to wash hemp that's already been washed before at any temperature in the washing machine. If it's been dyed, it's probably a good idea to wash it in cold water to avoid any color leeching.


You may add a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to help remove all traces of soap and to soften the hemp. Vinegar also removes any smells from the hemp, leaving it smelling clean. It will not leave a vinegar smell once it has dried.

, After washing hemp, it's a good idea to air dry it. If you must heat dry it, avoid using the highest heat setting and remove it before the item has been thoroughly dried.


Line-drying in the sun can have a tendency of lightening hemp slightly, which can be a desirable thing in some items, or you might want to maintain the natural color of the hemp. Depending on what you want, you might want to make sure that it stays out of the sun too much.

Don't use chlorinated bleach on hemp.,
Avoid high-heat.,
Don't dry clean hemp.",How to Wash Hemp3," The chlorine in bleach will immediately stain hemp fabric. If you need to get a stain out of a hemp item, spot treat it with gentle natural soap and try to bleach the colored area in the sun after drying it.


Sun-lightening can help with stained or otherwise discolored hemp. If you've got a stained hemp item, wash it thoroughly, then air dry it in the sun for a long period of time to help naturally ""bleach"" the stain.

, Drying hemp items in high heat will shrink them very quickly if you put them wet into a very hot dryer. It's fine to use the dryer sometimes, but it's important to avoid high heat and to mostly dry the items on the line.


In general, most hemp items will dry extremely quickly compared to other fabrics. You can usually get away with not needing to worry much about drying them, especially on high heat.

, Dry cleaning hemp draperies, upholstery, slip covers and other home furnishings will shrink and ruin the items. It's usually recommended that you dry clean fabric that is used for home furnishings and high end garments, reducing the risk of shrinkage, but the opposite will be true with hemp. Wash upholstery as you would clothing and other items described above."

Hand wash anything that needs to be washed by hand.",How to Wash Clothes That Are Brand New," There are a few clothing items that don’t require washing before you wear them. Swimsuits, outerwear (jackets, etc.), and event wear (formal dresses and tuxedos), for instance, don’t need to be washed before you wear them.Jeans, likewise, should never be washed when brand-new.Anything else, however, should be washed even if it’s brand new.
, Clothes that are brand new often sport two kinds of tags – label tags that describe the product and/or brand, and security tags. Label tags are easy to spot and remove, since they hang off the clothing item and are affixed with a small plastic clip. Security tags are often hidden behind pockets or other areas of fabric. Check your new clothes carefully for all tags before washing them for the first time.Use a pair of scissors to remove any price tags on the clothing. Don’t forget to slip the plastic clip out of the clothes, too.
Set the tags aside in a safe place. That way, if you wish to return a piece of clothing, you won't have to dig around in the trash can for the tag later.

, Before washing anything, carefully read the washing instructions on the item’s care label. This label will provide guidance regarding exactly how to clean the clothing. For instance, some types of fabric might require you to hand wash and/or hang dry them. Other clothes can be cleaned in washing machines, but may need cold or warm water., Garment care instructions are written in order to prevent you from causing your new clothes to lose color when washed. Most of the time, determining if clothes are likely to leach dye is as easy as consulting the care label. However, if your new clothes do not have a care label, ask the salesperson who sold them to you what the garment is made of, and whether it is likely to leach dye.Cotton, wool, and silk are more likely to leach dye than synthetic materials like polyester, nylon, and acrylic. Wash clothes of these materials separately on the gentle cycle in cold water.

, If you cannot consult the salesperson who sold you the new clothes, or if the salesperson is ignorant as to the material your new clothes were made of, you can test the clothing yourself. Dip a white cloth in a bit of the laundry detergent you intend to use to wash your clothes that are brand new. Dab an inconspicuous portion of the garment (for instance, an inner seam) with the white cloth. Check the cloth intermittently as you dab the garment. If any color comes out, wash the new item separately in cold water on the gentle cycle.Set the dye. If you suspect or know that your new clothes will leach dye, you can purchase a dye fixative from your local tailor or clothier. Specific directions for use will vary according to the product you’ve selected. Generally, however, you can simply wash the clothing along with a small amount of the dye fixative on a cold water cycle., If you’re planning on washing clothes that are brand new along with clothes that are not, or planning on washing several items of brand new clothing, you will need to segregate your clothes into appropriate categories. These categories are determined by the information on the care tags.For instance, you typically should not wash light clothes with dark clothes. Other brand-new clothes need to be washed separately because they are delicate.
Consult the care tag(s) on your brand new clothes to determine how to best separate your clothes.

, If you’re washing brand new clothes that are colored along with other clothes (whether they’re brand new or older), turn your brand new items inside out. This will prevent the dye from running, and will reduce the chances of staining other garments even if the dye does run., If you’re washing any brand new clothes that are buttoned, unfasten the buttons. This will prevent the clothes from rending during the washing process., If you have any brand new clothes with zippers, zip them up. Unzipped zippers might snag other clothes as they tumble about the washing machine., Cold water is appropriate for washing brand new clothes that are delicate, such as sweaters, lacy tops, mesh jerseys, and the like. It is also the best option for washing clothes that might shrink. Finally, if you have a piece of brand new clothing that is colored or features both light and dark colors, wash it in cold water to prevent the colors from running., Warm water is an acceptable way to wash brand new clothes that are light-colored or white. Warm water – when mixed with detergent – will effectively lift soil and stains, as well as remove bacteria., If your laundry load fills the washing machine to about three-quarters of its capacity or more, you will need to select the “large” setting on your washer. If your washer is filled about halfway with new clothes, you should select the “medium” setting. If your washer is filled to about one-third of its capacity or less, you should select the “small” load setting.Choosing the right load size will prevent wasting water and get your clothes washed faster.

, Washing machines can spin at different speeds. Higher speeds should be reserved for more durable clothes. Gentle or delicate cycles should be reserved for brand new clothes like women’s lingerie, sweaters, and other items that could be damaged by rough handling., High-efficiency washing machines use less water than traditional washing machines, and specialized high-efficiency laundry detergents must be used when washing clothes in such a machine. However, most high-efficiency detergents can also be used in traditional washing machines, too., Cold water laundry detergents are specially designed for use in cold water. If you are washing new clothes that are colored, you’ll need to wash them in cold water to prevent color bleeding.Cold water detergents generally work best in water between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius). Adjust your washing machine’s water temperature to the appropriate temperature range, if possible.
Washing your brand new clothes (or even your older clothes) in cold water can save energy, which means you save money.

, Powdered detergents are best in cold water. Liquid detergents mix better with warm or hot water.You might have to hunt a bit to find powdered detergents. They are becoming increasingly rare., Traditional detergents often contain chemicals that could be discharged into local waterways, affecting aquatic life and, potentially, the communities that use those waterways. Fortunately, there are many environmentally friendly detergents that use nontoxic alternatives or, at the very least, fewer chemicals. Choose one of these to reduce your negative environmental impact.You can often identify an environmentally friendly detergent by its name. Look for detergents with names preceded by the prefix “eco” or “bio.”

, Place your clothes that are brand new in the washing machine. If you’ve separated your brand new clothes into more than one load – for instance, whites and colors – remember not to throw them all in together. Add detergent according to manufacturer recommendations., After all your temperature, load size, and other settings are appropriately selected, you’re ready to get started. If you are unsure of how long the washing cycle will take, ask someone more familiar with the machine or consult your washing machine’s user guide. If you’re washing your brand new clothes at the laundromat, look for an indicator on the machine that will tell you how long the washing cycle will last., Wet clothing is more likely to color bleed. Therefore, take your brand new clothing out of the washer as soon as the cycle is completed (usually it will take about 20 minutes).Hang your clothes on the line or place them in the dryer per care label instructions.

, If the care label on your brand new clothes indicates that you must wash something by hand, do not attempt to wash it in the washing machine. Instead, fill a sink basin with cool water and mix in a bit of dishwashing liquid until the water is sudsy. Soak your clothes that are brand new in the water for 10 minutes. Drain the sink and rinse your clothes in cold water.Just as you did with brand new clothes that you washed in the machine, separate clothes you wash by hand according to their color.
Lay hand-washed clothing flat on a clothing rack or towel to dry.

Read the label.,
Touch the yarn and feel how soft or coarse it is.,
Look for a hairy texture.,
Note the price difference.",How to Tell Wool Yarn from Acrylic Yarn1," It sounds obvious, but this will be the most reliable and accurate way to find out. The label will tell you what the yarn is made out of: wool, acrylic, cotton, and so forth.;
, Wool yarn tends to be much softer than acrylic yarn. Acrylic yarn tends to feel a little coarse. This is easier if you have another yarn that you know is wool or acrylic to use as comparison.


The touch test is not very reliable. Many acrylic yarns can feel soft and silky. A soft and silky texture can also indicate silk or rayon, instead of wool.

, Acrylic yarn may feel rough, but it won't look hairy. Wool yarn may have some longer fibers sticking out of it. Keep in mind that acrylic-wool blends may also have some hairy fibers. Yarn made from other natural fibers may also have a hairy look to it.

, If you can't find what the yarn is made out of on the label, look at the price; it may be a good indicator of whether or not the yarn is real wool. Acrylic yarn tends cost much less than wool yarn. Keep in mind, however, that some factors may increase the price of acrylic yarn, such as thickness, added sequins or tinsel, or blended fibers.

A hand held pump up sprayer (it does not need to be chemical resistant)
A mop of some kind to remove the slurry you will create (or a wet/dry vacuum)
The proper alkaline or acid grout cleaner. Do not try to get the most aggressive acids or alkaline chemicals. Find an approved cleaner, perhaps at a local janitorial supply house.;
, Stainless steel appliances need to be masked with plastic and taped. Carpet needs to be protected.

,, If you want to truly do your best you will use both an acid and an alkaline. If you have heavy grease use the alkaline first, if not use the acid first.

, Use plenty of solution and let it dwell for at least 10 minutes, but do not let the solution dry. Add more if it is drying too fast, but keep it wet for 10 minutes at least. Your biggest advantage - beside using the correct supplies, is to let the chemical dwell. Dwell time is your friend.

, You may also use a wet vac to remove slurry. Additional agitation with grout brush may be necessary. We suggest using microfiber mops. Repeat process if you are using alkaline as well as acid cleaners.

, We recommend a water based sealer as they are easier to work with when applying to a grout joint. Take care not to get sealer on the tile as it can form a sticky residue that will attract soil to the tile. If it is not really clean we don’t recommend you seal it because you will be essentially sealing the soil you couldn’t get off under the sealer, and if you are able to get it cleaned professionally in the future it will hamper that person's effort. Do not use a topical, acrylic, mop n glow or any product designed for vinyl. Find an application tool to apply the sealer, and apply it to the grout only.

Lint fibers can become attached to your corduroy, making the garment dingy and dull. Separate clothes made with any of these fabrics into their own laundry load. Do not wash corduroy with such materials., The dye in corduroy fabric can run, so it is important to wash dark colored items with like colors, or by themselves. Separate your laundry by color., If you stuff too many clothes into your washing machine, you run the risk of crushing and damaging your corduroy. To best protect your fabric, keep your laundry loads to small or medium-sized., Some corduroy clothing items may have specific instructions. For instance, some items may be dry clean only. Before washing your garment, be sure to read over any fabric care instructions, and follow them accordingly., In order to protect your garment from damage during washing, completely zip and/or button the garment. Don't forget any buttons on collars and cuffs., To further protect your garment from damage, turn your garment inside out before washing. The helps to prevent snags, and also helps reduce fading., Before starting your load, select the gentlest cycle available on your washing machine. This may be called ""delicate,"" ""gentle,"" or in some cases ""permanent press."", If you have the option on your washing machine, select a shorter spin cycle. Sometimes this can be accomplished by choosing a shorter wash cycle (or ""quick wash"").If your machine has one, select the ""reduced crease"" setting.

, The dye in corduroy fabric (even light colors) can run and fade a bit faster than other types of fabric. In order to protect your garments and slow down this fading process, wash your corduroy clothing in cold water., If you have a top loading washing machine, start the wash cycle and add your detergent before adding your clothes to the washing machine. If you have a front loading washer, simply add a bit of water to your detergent before pouring it into the washing machine. This helps to dilute the detergent in water, which reduces the risk of detergent stains on your clothes. Be sure to add the appropriate amount of detergent for the size of your laundry load.Any standard laundry detergent is fine as long as you use the proper amount.
Add 2-3 Tablespoons of salt to dark-color loads to reduce the effects of fading and color-bleeding.

, Once you've selected right settings, added your detergent (and salt, if needed) it is time to add your clothes. Remember not to overfill your machine with clothing, as this can crush your corduroy., The best way to prevent damage to your corduroy clothes is to avoid putting them in the dryer. Instead, hang your clothing outside on a clothesline, or place them on hangers from your shower curtain rod.If you are not able to hang your clothes, you can dry them on the low-heat setting.

Cut two pieces of yarn that are several inches long.,
Untwist the first few inches of each piece of yarn and separate the loose threads into two, even groups.Yarn is made by twisting thinner pieces of yarn together.,
Shorten one set of threads on each piece of yarn.Each piece of yarn will have one long set of threads, and one short set of threads.,
Overlap the long threads on both pieces of yarn until the short threads touch.,
Dampen the long threads.,
Rub and roll the overlapped long threads between your fingers until the yarn dries.,
Judge the results.",How to Tell Wool Yarn from Acrylic Yarn2," Make sure that both pieces of yarn come from the same skein. In this method, you will be ""felting"" the yarn. If the yarn fuses together easily, it is made from wool. If it does not fuse together easily, it is made from acrylic.

, In order to felt the yarn, you will need to untwist it. Gently roll the yarn back and forth between your fingers until the threads loosen, and pull them apart into two, even groups. For example, if the yarn has 6 threads, separate it into 2 groups of 3 threads. Do this for both pieces of yarn.

, You will be twisting the longer threads together to fuse the yarn together.

, Lay the two pieces of yarn down on the table so that frayed ends are facing each other. Move them towards each other until the long threads overlap and the short threads touch.

, You can do this simply by dipping them in water, or misting them lightly with a spray bottle. You can also lick them.

, As you roll, the long threads may come together. Don't worry if they don't come together easily or at all. This is part of the test!

, If the two pieces have fused together easily, and are difficult to pull apart, the yarn is made from wool. If the two pieces did not fuse together easily, and they come apart, the yarn is acrylic.Felted wool may look dull and feel a little stiff, especially if it was soft and silky to begin with."

Find a sink to work over.,
Create a flame.,
Cut off a piece of yarn.,
Use a pair of tweezers to hold the yarn above the flame until it burns.,
Blow the flame out and let the yarn cool before examining the end.",How to Tell Wool Yarn from Acrylic Yarn3," This way, you will have water handy in case the flame goes out of control. Make sure that there is nothing near by that can catch on fire, such as curtains, towels, or detergents.If you can't work over a sink, try to work over a bowl of water.

, You can do this simply by lighting a candle or starting a lighter.

, The yarn should be about the length of your finger.

, Take note of how the yarn burns, and what it smells like. If the yarn smells like burning hair, it is wool. If the yarn smells like chemicals or burning plastic, it is acrylic.Wool yarn will burn quicker than acrylic yarn.

, Take a look at how the yarn looks like. If the yarn is wool, the burnt end will have turned to ash. It may crumble and turn to dust if you touch it. If the yarn is acrylic, the end will have melted and turned hard. It may look black or dark brown."

Cut a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) long piece of yarn.,
Place the yarn into a small glass jar.,
Add 1 tablespoon (30 milliliters) of bleach into the jar.,
Close the jar tightly and wait a few hours to overnight.,
Check the jar and examine the results.",How to Tell Wool Yarn from Acrylic Yarn4," The color of the yarn does not matter. The bleach will dissolve real wool, and it won't do anything to acrylic., Make sure that your jar has a lid, as you will need to seal it in order for this to work.

, The bleach should completely cover the yarn. If you are using a larger jar, you may need more bleach. Keep adding bleach until it covers and soaks the yarn.

, You may notice a slight fizzing after a few minutes. Don't worry. This is normal, and an indicator that the yarn is made of wool, or another natural fiber.

, If the yarn has disappeared, it was made from wool. If the yarn is still there, take a closer look. A 100% acrylic yarn will be mostly unchanged, although it may have faded a little. Yarn made from an acrylic-wool blend will appear somewhat damaged. It may be faded, ragged, or thinner than when you first put it in."

Get a wool-specific soap.,
Fill a basin with soap and warm water.,
Soak your wool for 3-5 minutes.,
Rinse with warm water.,
Squeeze out excess water.",How to Wash Merino Wool1," Merino wool requires a very gentle washing liquid that will prevent bleeding of its color or damage to its fine fibers. Pick a shampoo, soap, or detergent that’s especially formulated for wool, like Woolite or Laundress Wool & Cashmere Shampoo.Never use fabric softeners or products with bleach in them on wool.
In a pinch, you can use a mild soap with a neutral pH, like a clear, fragrance-free dishwashing fluid for sensitive skin.;
, Measure out your wool wash soap according to the guidelines on its packaging. Add it to a basin with enough warm water to cover your garments.The water should be between 30 and 40 degrees C (about 85-100 degrees F).
If you have a really large Merino wool product, consider washing it in your bathtub or using a “soak” setting on your washing machine so that you have a big enough basin.

, Completely submerge your Merino wool garment in the water, and let it soak for 3 to 5 minutes. Then, swish the water through the wool garment slowly and gently for about one minute.Don’t let your wool soak for more than a handful of minutes since doing so can warp the fibers.

, Rinse your wool several times with a gentle stream of warm water to get the detergent out. Keep rinsing it until the water runs mostly clear of suds.Make sure that your rinse water is the same temperature as the water in which you soaked your Merino wool.

, Take the garment and squeeze it to get as much water out as possible.Do not twist or wring your Merino wool to drain the water.

Wait a day for the grout to set.,
Use a cheesecloth.,
Try a wet terry towel.",How to Clean Grout Haze1," Grout haze often appears soon after the grout and tiles have been installed. If you are cleaning grout haze off of tiles that have recently been installed, wait a day for the grout to set. This will allow the grout to firm up so it is not damaged when you are removing the grout haze. This is key if you have smooth tiles made of glazed ceramic or porcelain.Talk to the professional floor installer to find out the setting time for the grout. Most cement and ready-mixed grouts dry within 24 hours.;
, Start with the least aggressive method of removal first so you do not damage the tiles or the grout. Get a cheesecloth that is designed for cleaning grout haze at your local hardware store or online. Rub the surface of the tiles with the dry cheesecloth to remove the haze.You may need an extra pair of hands to help you rub the tiles with the cheesecloth, especially if you are removing grout haze off a large area.

, If the grout haze is too hard to remove with just the dry cheesecloth, try using a damp terry towel. Wet the terry towel and wring out as much water as you can before you use it. This will ensure excess water does not get on the grout. Then, rub the damp terry cloth over the tiles to remove the grout haze.You can aso try swiping a damp terry cloth over the grout haze to wet it. Then, use another damp terry cloth to remove the grout haze once it is wet.

Wash smaller garments in the washing machine.,
Wash with like colors and fabrics.,
Turn garments inside-out.,
Use a wool-specific washing liquid.,
Pick the right cycle.,
Set the right temperature.,
Remove from the machine immediately.",How to Wash Merino Wool2," It’s best to avoid washing larger garments, like sweaters or leggings in a washing machine. However, smaller Merino products, like hats, socks, or mittens, will be able to hold their shape better., Prevent any potential damage from your Merino wool bleeding by washing it with similarly colored garments, such as darks, brights, or lights. It’s also a good idea to wash it with clothing of similar weights or harder fabrics, like canvas or denim, for the sake of minimizing the pilling of the wool fibers.To be completely safe, consider washing your Merino wool by itself. Keeping it separate from other laundry will preserve it and your other garments for longer.

, To help keep your Merino wool from pilling or getting fuzzy on the outside, wash it inside-out., Merino wool necessitates a very gentle soap that will minimize bleeding or fiber-damage. Wash it with a shampoo or soap that’s especially formulated for wool or with a mild detergent that is free from bleach and fabric softeners., You want to select a gentle, delicate, or knit cycle so that the rotation of the machine will not damage the wool fibers or shape of your garment.Note: if you cannot control the speed and/or temperature of your washing machine, stick to washing your Merino wool by hand.

, You want to wash your Merino wool at a consistent warm, low, or cold temperature. Warm (about 30 degrees C or 85 degrees F) is the usually the best bet, but be sure to check the care instructions of your garment’s tag to ensure you have the right temperature guidelines for your particular product.Never change temperatures for your rinse cycle. To avoid shrinkage and felting, you need to keep the temperature of your entire wash cycle constant. Either do all warm water or all cold water, never a mix of the two.
Never use hot water since high temperatures can seriously shrink your wool.

, As soon as the washing cycle is complete, take your Merino wool out of the machine and dry it according to the care instructions. Leaving it wet in a pile of other laundry will stretch and misshape the fibers.

Do not use a drying machine.,
Never wring your Merino wool.,
Roll it in a towel.,
Lay flat to dry.,
Keep it away from heat.,
If necessary, use a steam iron on a wool setting.",How to Wash Merino Wool3," Unless the washing instructions on your Merino wool product specifically indicate that you can use a dryer, do not tumble dry it. If the care instructions do permit it, be sure to use a gentle, low-heat setting., Twisting this fabric can seriously stretch it and leave your garment misshapen. Squeeze out excess water without twisting the wool., Get out the excess moisture in your Merino wool by laying it in a dry towel and rolling it up. Gently squeeze the roll to remove as much of the remaining water as possible., The best way to preserve the shape and texture of your garment is to reshape your Merino wool while it’s still damp and then let it dry on a flat surface.You can use a flat drying rack for this. Some racks have a mesh surface that’s especially designed for garments that need to lay flat. You can also simply lay your garment on top of a dry towel on a flat surface, like a floor or bed.
You don’t want to hang Merino wool on a hanger, line, or hook because the weight of the wet fibers can lead to sagging and stretched knits.

, Don’t leave drying Merino wool near a heat source, like a radiator, or in direct sunlight. You should dry your wool in the open air and away from heat to prevent shrinkage., Merino wool is not prone to wrinkling, but if you need to press it, wait until it’s completely dried. Then, use a steaming iron on a wool setting to press out the wrinkles.Don’t move the iron back and forth over the wool. Instead, lower the iron onto the fabric, press for a few seconds, and then lift it directly up. Repeat this process until you have the wrinkles out.
If you have a delicate knit, cover the fabric with a clean, dampened dish towel before pressing it. This will protect the fibers.

Brush your Merino wool.,
Spot clean stains immediately.,
Use white spirit for grease stains.",How to Wash Merino Wool4," Use a soft-bristled brush to gently remove any surface dirt, dust, or soil that could lead to a stain. Doing so will prevent any build-up that might dull the color and texture of your garment., Rinse the affected area with cold water and/or seltzer water to keep the stain from setting. Dab it out with a dry, soft, clean cloth.Avoid rubbing the stained area with your cloth since this will only encourage the stain to set into the fabric.
For particularly stubborn stains, treat them with wool-specific soap. Dab a small amount of your mild wool detergent onto the affected area. Let it soak for a few minutes, and then rinse it with cold water., Remove any excess grease with a metal spoon. Then, soak a section of a clean, soft cloth with white spirit or mineral spirit.

Mix together one part vinegar to four parts warm water. Then, use a mop or a nylon scrubber to spread the cleaner and remove the grout haze.Make sure you use a scrub pad that is soft and made of nylon. You do not want the scrubber to scratch the surface of the tiles.
Use the scrub pad to loosen up any grout haze caught between the tile and the grout. Then, swipe the mop over the area to remove the grout haze.

, Make sure the cleaner is labeled mild and is made for grout haze removal. Using a strong acid-based cleaner can damage the tile and weaken the grout. Dilute the mild acid-based cleaner with half water. Then, spray the cleaning solution on the tile surface with a spray bottle. You may notice a fizzing effect on the tile as the cleaner reacts to the grout haze.Scrub the grout haze off with a mop, making sure you remove any excess cleaning solution on the floor. You can also use a nylon scrub pad to get rid of any hardened grout haze on the tiles.

, If you have tiles made of stone, never use an acid-based cleaner on the tiles as this can damage or stain them. Instead, get a non-acidic cleaner made for stone tiles at your local hardware store or online. Use a mop and a nylon scrub pad to apply the cleaner and remove the grout haze.If you have tiles made of stone, do not wait a day for the grout to set before you remove the haze. Instead, clean the grout haze as soon as the installation is done, as the grout haze will be harder to remove on stone tiles if it dries overnight.

, No matter what type of cleaner you use on the flooring, you should always rinse the floor well with water at the end of the cleaning. You do not want any excess cleaning products to remain on the surface of the flooring. Wet a clean mop or a damp terry towel and wipe the entire floor so any remaining cleaning solution is removed., You should also dry the floor with a clean cheesecloth or terry cloth once the cleaning is done. This will ensure the flooring looks fresh and polished once the grout haze has been removed.


Dry the floor as soon as it has been rinsed, as you do not want excess water to remain on the flooring. Excess water can damage the tiles and the grout, especially if it has recently been installed.

Clean the grout haze once the grout has set.,
Use a strong professional grout cleaner.,
Talk to the manufacturer for cleaning instructions.",How to Clean Grout Haze3," Epoxy grouts are designed to withstand chemical exposure and repel staining. This makes the grout haze caused by epoxy grout the hardest to remove. Before you try to clean the epoxy grout haze, make sure the grout has been set, or cured. This will ensure the grout is not damaged when you clean off the grout haze.Speak to the professional floor installer to find out how long the grout will take to set. You can also contact the manufacturer of the grout for this information. Most epoxy grout takes four to 14 days to cure.

, Epoxy grout haze can be difficult to remove with mild cleaners or scrubbing tools. Try using a professional grout cleaner designed for epoxy grout haze. Use a mop or spray bottle to apply the cleaner to the flooring. Look for a professional grout cleaner at your local hardware store or online.Get an eco-friendly cleaner that is easy to apply. Eco-friendly cleaners usually do not contain toxic ingredients that can be bad for your health and for the tiles.

, If you are not sure which grout cleaner will be best for epoxy grout haze, contact the manufacturer of the grout for guidance. Some epoxy grout will require a specific type of cleaner to remove grout haze effectively.You can also consult a professional floor cleaner if you need more information.

Do a preliminary clean.,
Create your solution.,
Pour the mixture in a spray bottle.,
Spray the grout.,
Begin scrubbing.,
Clean up the dirty liquid.,
Complete your grout cleaning.,
Do a final wipe-down.",How to Clean Grout1," Before you get down to the deep cleaning methods, it is necessary to do a regular clean up of your tile. Follow your regular cleaning process of wiping down counters or sweeping and mopping floors. This will get all the top layer of scum off, and make your work a bit easier.;
, In a bucket or large bowl, mix 7 cups of warm water, 1/2 cup of baking soda, 1/3 cup of ammonia, and 1/4 cup of white vinegar. Allow all the ingredients to mix completely, so the baking soda is dissolved.

, Keeping this in a spray bottle will make it easy to mist the dirtiest areas specifically, and for storage. Fill your spray bottle completely, and then shake the solution well.

, Start on a small area, only as large as 1-2 square feet total. Spray your cleaning solution over the grout so it is dampened. Allow the mixture to set for 3-5 minutes to work into the grout.

, Use a scrubbing brush of your choice - a hard bristled cleaning brush, a toothbrush, or a magic eraser are all good options. Put some hard work into your scrubbing to get the ground-in dirt out from between your tiles.

, All your scrubbing has probably created little pools of dirty liquid on your tiles. Use a damp cloth to wipe this up, and wring it out into a separate container. This will keep your tiles cleaner in the end.

, Use the above process to move onto the rest of your grout, giving all it a thorough cleaning. Focus on simply getting the dirt and dark areas out of your grout, exposing the natural white underneath.

, When you are convinced your grout cleaning is finished, do a second clean up of the entire area. If you were working on counters or in a bathroom, use a generic cleaning spray and rag to wipe down your tiles. For floors, go ahead, mop your tiles again, and towel dry.

Choose a grout stain.,
Clean the tile and grout.,
Apply the grout stain.,
Add additional coats.,
Seal the grout.",How to Change the Color of Grout1," Most often, people resort to dying their grout because it’s lost its previous luster and now appears brown and dingy. Rather than going back to the original hue, find a new color to cover up the wear and tear. Although it may sound strange, grout stains that are close in color to dirt are typically the most successful, because you won’t have to worry about the grout becoming discolored again over time.Light hued grouts blend in and hide the shape of your tiles, while dark grout makes your tiles stand out and is very bold.
When possible, look for grout stains that are also a sealant, so that you can skip the final step of sealing the grout.;
, Get out your cleaning supplies and grab a little elbow grease, because before you can begin staining your grout you need to give it a thorough cleaning. Use a bleach-water scrub to kill any mold or mildew that might cause problems. Although it might be uncomfortable, use a damp sponge/scrubbing brush to clean your grout and tile, even if it is on the floor. The grout stain cannot be applied to damp grout, so wait 30 minutes or longer after cleaning to begin the application process.

, Some grout staining kits come with a small applicator brush, but if yours didn’t, simply use a very small stiff-bristled brush for application. Dip the brush in the grout stain, and carefully paint it onto only the grout. The stain is permanent and cannot be removed from your tile after it dries, so be careful to paint in the lines and wipe off any stain from the tile.

, Depending on the look you’re going for, you may need to add more than one coat of grout stain. If so, wait at least 24 hours for the first layer to dry, and then carefully paint on the second coat of stain. Again, be careful not to accidentally get any stain on the tiles as it is very difficult to remove.

, Some grouts are a combination of grout/sealant, but typically you’ll have to apply a special oil-based sealant to finish up your grout. This is especially important for areas that come into frequent contact with water (such as in a bathroom or near a kitchen sink). Follow the directions that accompany your sealant of choice as you paint over the grout."

Decide what color tiles you are going to use.,
Decide If you want the grout to blend in with or stand out from the tiles.,
If you want the grout to blend in with the tile so the tile pattern is less visible, choose a grout color that is close to the color of the tile.,
If you want the grout to stand out from the tile so the tile pattern is more visible, think of colors that contrast your tiles.,
Install the grout according to the manufacturer's instructions.

",How to Choose the Right Grout Color," There are a wide range of tile materials and designs to choose from, each with its own characteristics and appearance. Do you want tiles with a solid color or printed patterns? Are they manufactured porcelain or ceramic, or are they natural stone? Are you using mosaic sheets with differently-colored tiles? Understanding the color composition of the tile that you choose will help you find the most complimentary grout.;
, Each design option offers different advantages to the space and installation. However, if you have other surfaces in the room, consider their color and layout as well.

, When grout and tile colors are similar, the installation has a more uniform, monolithic look. Grout joints are less visible from a distance, as are the edges of the tiles. Blending will only work if all of the tiles have a similar color. A blended look will require more maintenance, especially with lighter colors, to ensure that the installation maintains its uniform look.

, Color discrepancies between tile and grout create a striking, patterned look. Grout joints and tile edges are more visible, and the tile layout pattern is more apparent. The greater the difference in grout and tile colors, the more noticeable the pattern will be. In many commercial kitchens, a darker grout is used to accent the tiles and reduce the appearance of stains.

Wring and dry the clothing.",How to Wash Clothes without a Washing Machine1," It's not difficult to wash a load of laundry without any tools, but it can be tedious. If you plan to wash all your laundry by hand, especially towels, jeans, and other heavy items of clothing, you may wish to use a handheld agitator, which is simply a plastic tool useful for pressing and moving the clothes. If you cannot find one in a store, look online or make your own by cutting a few holes in the rubber of a brand-new plunger.Note: You may use these instructions whether or not you have an agitator.;
, Washing clothes by hand usually involves lower temperatures and less agitation than most washing machines, so there is less risk of color bleeding. It can still occur, however, so separating white and light pastel clothing from darker colored clothing is recommended.


Separate out wool, cashmere, silk, lace, and any other delicate clothing from your other laundry. Wash these items using the instructions for delicate clothing, in a separate load.

, If you don't have a large washing tub or bucket, you can thoroughly clean a sink or bathtub and place the clothes in there, spreading them out evenly. The less full the container is, the easier it will be to wash. If you have too many clothes to wash at once, consider keeping a second clean bucket nearby to store clean, wet clothes while you finish washing the rest of the load.


If you are only washing a couple small articles of clothing, you may only need a large bowl.

, If your clothing has a stain that has dyed the fabric, such as a stain from mustard or ink, rub a little stain remover cleaning product over the affected area, or use soap if you do not have any stain remover. Let the clothing sit for at least five minutes before continuing.

, Fill until the water level is about 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) above the level of the clothing. Unless the clothing is both sturdy and heavily soiled, do not use hot water. Lukewarm or even room temperature water will work fine for most laundry loads, and reduces the chance of damaging or color bleeding.


If you are not certain whether an article of clothing can be washed in warm water, play it safe and use cool water instead.

, If you are using a bucket or sink, you likely only need one to two tsp (5–10mL) mild detergent or washing powder. If you have enough clothing to require a bathtub, use 4 tbsp (60 mL) instead, or follow the instruction on the package.If your detergent is not labeled ""mild,"" or if you have sensitive skin, wear rubber gloves to prevent rashes or itching.

, The detergent will take time to work, so leave the tub of water alone for at least twenty minutes. If your clothing has a significant amount of dirt or stains, you may wish to leave it for up to an hour.

, Using either your hands or a simple agitator tool, move the clothing gently around in the water. Press the clothing against the bottom or sides until suds emerge, but try not to scrub or twist it, as this could stretch the clothes.Do this for about two minutes, or until the clothing is clean.

, Empty the water from the container, and fill with cool water. Continue moving the clothing around in the same way, pressing to remove the soap suds. After a couple of minutes, drain again and repeat an additional one or two times. Once no soap suds are visible when the clothing is moved or pressed, the clothes are ready to dry.


If you are filling the container from a faucet, you may start rinsing before it's full by holding clothing in the running water.

, Twist each article of clothing to remove most of the water, or send it through a hand-cranked wringer if you have one. If you are not using a dryer, hang the clothing on a clothes horse, clothesline, or the backs of chairs and banisters. Make sure the clothing is spread out evenly, and that articles of clothing don't overlap with other. If a wet area is hidden by other clothing or a bunched up area of fabric, it will take much longer to dry.


Keep in mind that wet clothing will drip, and may leave a stain on hard wood or upholstery if draped directly on it.
On a sunny day, your clothes should dry within a few hours.
If you do not have sun, dry in a warm, ventilated room.

Know when to replace your grout.",How to Clean Grout4," Letting cranberry juice or orange juice sit on grout for a few hours is a sure way to get a new stain. As soon as something is spilled on your floor, wipe it up with a wet rag, removing every last trace.


If a stain is left behind, pour a bit of hydrogen peroxide over it. Let it sit for a minute before wiping it away with a clean cloth.
Dry spills can also stain grout if they are left to be ground into the floor. Sweep up coffee grounds, clumps of dirt, and other solids soon after they are dropped.

, To avoid having to do a deep cleaning too often, treat small stains as they come. Use the same cleaning solution you would use for a deep cleaning, but employ a spray bottle to treat the small area you want to clean. You could also try an alternative small stain-cleaning methods:


Use a baking soda paste. Mix baking soda with a little water to make a paste, and then rub it into the stained section of grout. Let it sit for a few minutes, then use an old toothbrush to scrub it away.
Use white toothpaste. Squirt some toothpaste directly onto the grout in question, then rub it in using your finger. After a few minutes, use an old toothbrush to scrub the area. Wipe it up with a clean wet rag.

Use a soft cloth to gently scrub the bag.,
Buff dry.,
Recondition the leather parts using a vinegar solution.",How to Wash a Longchamp Bag2," For surface stains that cannot be scrubbed away with a cloth, like ink stains, rub the stain with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol.Many surface stains, like grease stains, will be removed when you clean the entire surface of the bag with soap and water later on.
Dip the cotton swab into the rubbing alcohol, then rub the surface of the bag with the swab until the stain disappears. Focus on the area of the stain only.
When finished, let the bag air dry.

, When you are dealing with a stain that has set deeply into the material, use a paste made from cream of tartar and lemon juice.


Deep stains can include blood, wine, and many food or drink stains.
Combine one part cream of tartar and one part lemon juice, mixing until a thick paste forms. Apply a generous amount of this paste to the stained area of the bag and let it rest for 10 minutes.
After the paste has had a chance to sit, wipe it off with a clean, dry rag.

, Combine 2 cups (500 ml) of warm water with just a few drops of mild, dye-free liquid soap.


This soap solution can be used to clean light dirt from a leather bag, or from a bag with leather components, as often as once a week.
Use the mildest soap possible to minimize the risk of dehydrating or damaging the leather.

, Dip a soft, clean cloth in the soapy water. Wring out the excess moisture, then gently wipe away all the dirt and grime from the bag.


Use this solution to clean the outside and inside of the bag. Make sure that everything in the bag has been removed before you clean the inside, however.
Only allow the leather parts of the bag to get slightly moist. Do not soak or submerge them.

, Use a dry, soft cloth to lightly buff the surface of the bag while it is still moist. Continue buffing until the surface feels dry.

, A standard liquid laundry detergent should be fine, but opt for one that is dye-free and fragrance-free if possible.


The detergent should be as mild as possible to minimize the risk of damage.
If you want to be especially caution, skip the detergent and opt for a more gentle, natural cleansing product, like Murphy's oil soap or liquid castile soap.Only use about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of soap for this process.

, Both the agitation and temperature settings should be mild, so choose one of the gentlest settings on your machine and set the water temperature to ""cool"" or ""warm."" After making your selections, start the machine.


A ""wool"" setting should work well, but a ""delicate,"" ""gentle,"" or ""hand wash"" cycle might be better.
The temperature of the water should be somewhat cool, approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius).

, After you remove the bag from the washing machine, hang it from its straps on a clothes hanger and let it air dry for four to five hours, or until it is completely dry.


To speed up the drying process, you could toss the bag into a drying machine and run the dryer on its lowest heat setting. Make sure that there are other items in the dryer, like large towels, to further reduce heat exposure. Dry the bag this way for five to ten minutes, then finish hang drying it for another hour or so.
You can also speed up the drying process by placing it in a sunny spot as it hangs.

, Place a little commercial leather conditioner on a clean, soft rag and buff the conditioner into the leather portions of the bag.


Conditioner softens the leather and protects it from further stains and possible water damage.

Wash your hoodie in cold water.,
Add a mild detergent.,
Avoid fabric softener.,
Rinse twice.,
Line dry or dry on low heat.",How to Wash a Zipper Hoodie1," Before washing your hoodie, determine if a wash is needed. It’s recommended that you wash hoodies after about six or seven wears because as outerwear they don’t dirty as quickly. Washing less frequently prevents added wear and tear.As long as your hoodie doesn’t smell, it’s okay to go a bit between washes.


If you exercise in your hoodie, then you will likely need to wash it more.
If you’re questioning whether or not it’s dirty, it’s better to go ahead and wash it. You don’t want worries about a dirty hoodie overshadowing your day.
Consider what you’re wearing under your hoodie. The more layers you wear, the less sweat your hoodie encounters.;
, Closing the zipper will protect the teeth so that your zipper continues to open and close easily. It will also protect your fabric, which can snag on an open zipper., Use a safety pin to keep the zipper from sliding back down during the wash.Take the metal pull of the zipper and fold it up toward the collar of the hoodie.
Loop the open side of the safety pin through the hole in the metal pull.
Push the pin through the fabric.
Close the safety pin.

, If you want your hoodie to stay soft and vibrant, you need to turn it inside out before washing so the color and texture of the fabric are protected during the wash., Spread out your hoodie and place it in the tub of the washing machine, careful not to ball it up.

, Prevent extra wear on your hoodie and its zipper by using the delicate cycle., Make sure that you set the washer to “cold” before turning it on to help preserve the color and any graphics that are on the hoodie., As the water flows into the washer, add your soap. Choose a soap that is gentle on clothing, avoiding products that contain bleach., Both liquid fabric softeners and dryer sheets can harm your hoodie. Some fabrics, such as those that are water-resistant, can be damaged by fabric softeners. Keep it simple when washing your zipper hoodie., Because hoodies are thick, they may hold onto detergent.

Remove stains with a wet sponge.,
Fill a clean sink with cold water.,
Mix in a gentle detergent.,
Soak the burlap for five minutes.,
Rinse well.,
Dry flat.",How to Wash Burlap1," Dip the sponge in cold water, then blot out any visible stains on the burlap.


Wring out any excess water before blotting out the stain.
Only blot or dab at the stain. Do not scrub or rub it since doing so could cause the stain to seep further into the fibers of the material.
If you only want to clean off the stain, blot up the water with a dry towel as soon as you get the stain out. If you want to wash the entire piece of burlap, though, continue on with the rest of these steps.;
, Plug the sink and fill it halfway with cold water. Adjust the depth of the water as needed so that there will be enough for you to completely submerge the burlap.


Do not use warm or hot water. Warm water can cause the fabric to shrink.
Use a large bucket or tub if you do not have a clean enough or large enough sink.
For small amounts of burlap or finished burlap pieces, hand washing is recommended over machine washing. Burlap can start to unravel if handled too roughly.

, Pour a quarter to a half cap of gentle liquid laundry detergent into the water. Use your hands to agitate the solution until the detergent disperses and suds begin to form.

, Submerge the burlap in the soapy water. Keep it underneath the water for no more than five minutes before removing it.


Simply leaving the burlap submerged in the water should be enough to clean it. If desired, though, you could also slowly stir the burlap using your hands to gently agitate the dirt off.
Do not leave the burlap in the water for much longer than five minutes. If you soak it for too long, the material can begin to fray and unravel.

, Remove the burlap from the soapy water and rinse it under cold running water. Continue rinsing it until the water coming out from the bottom of the material runs clear.

, Spread out a dry towel on a hard, flat surface. Place the wet burlap on top of it, then drape a second dry towel on top of that. Let the burlap dry flat in between both towels.


Do not wring out the water or otherwise squeeze or twist the damp material. Twisting the burlap fibers while the material is still wet can cause the fabric to become distorted and damaged.
Change the towels as needed until all of the moisture has been soaked up.

Lay your hoodie out to dry.Keep in mind that handwashed items usually take longer to dry because they hold onto more water.",How to Wash a Zipper Hoodie2," Prepare your hoodie for washing by closing the zipper to protect your fabric from snagging. This also prevents damage to the zipper teeth., When washing by hand, you need something to hold enough water to wash your clothing. Great options include your sink, a bucket, or a large cooking pot.

, As you pour water into the wash container, pour in your soap. Gently stir the soapy water to mix it well.


Don’t add too much soap. While you want a clean hoodie, too much soap will be hard to rinse out. Plus, excess soap attracts dirt and bacteria, keeping it in the fabric.Remember that laundry detergent is formulated for a full load, so don’t measure out a whole cup of laundry detergent. A teaspoon is recommended for small items.If you have a thicker hoodie, add a little extra.

, Place your hoodie into the water after you have mixed in the soap. Press it down with your hand until the entire hoodie is under the water., Let your hoodie sit in the container of soapy water for a few minutes so that it will absorb the detergent., Gently move your hoodie around the wash container. Be careful not to scrub the fabric because you may damage it., Lift your hoodie from the wash container and gently squeeze out some of the excess water. Avoid twisting your hoodie because that can damage it., Using a colander will help you rinse the soap from your hoodie without risking damage to the fabric.A colander is a bowl that has holes so that you can drain water. If you don’t have a colander, check if your pots came with a basket to steam veggies.
If you lack kitchen supplies, you could try a large funnel.

, While your hoodie is still in the colander, run cold water over it to rinse out the detergent.If you can’t find anything to rinse your hoodie in, just fill the wash container with clean water and rinse it that way.
Check to make sure that you’ve washed out all of the detergent by smelling the fabric. If you catch a strong whiff of soap, rinse your hoodie again., Gently squeeze your hoodie to remove the excess water. Don’t twist it because twisting will damage the fabric of your hoodie., Find a flat surface that won’t be damaged by dripping water, such as a countertop.

Wash the burlap in warm water.,
Consider adding bleach and fabric softener.,
Repeat, if necessary.,
Dry the burlap in a machine.,
Alternatively, air dry the material.,
Clean the washer and dryer when finished.",How to Wash Burlap2," Toss your burlap into the washing machine and add half a cap of gentle liquid laundry detergent. Set the machine to a ""delicate"" or ""hand wash"" cycle using warm water and start the washer.


Machine washes are a little rougher, even if you use the delicate cycle, so the burlap will take more of a beating than it will if you hand wash it. As such, this method works well if you are pre-washing yards of burlap for a project or if you are washing burlap with hemmed or sealed edges, but it should be avoided if you are washing delicate bags or other pieces.

, If you want to brighten the burlap or remove any stains, add a splash of bleach to the bleach cup of your washing machine before starting the cycle. To make the material softer, add a standard amount of liquid fabric softener to the machine.


Note that you should not add bleach or fabric softener if you plan on painting the burlap. These treatments can make it more difficult for the paint to adhere to the material.
A little bleach can go a long way. Bleach is potent, and using too much can actually damage the burlap.

, After your first washing cycle ends, smell and handle the burlap. If the odor and texture are still not to your liking, put it through another warm water delicate cycle.


You can repeat this once or twice, but putting it through too many washes can cause the material to weaken and unravel.
Add detergent to the additional washing cycles but do not add more bleach or fabric softener.

, If you want to make the burlap softer, toss the damp material into a dryer and set the machine to a regular setting. Machine dry the fabric until it dries completely.

, For a gentler approach, drape the wet burlap over two wooden or plastic chairs and allow it to dry by air for several hours.


Air drying is actually preferable to machine drying since it uses less force and causes no additional damage. If the burlap does not appear damaged after you pull it out of the washer, it's likely safe to machine dry it. If the material seems worn or frayed, however, air dry it.

, Burlap leaves a lot of fuzz and lint behind after you wash it. Thoroughly wipe out the washer after you clean the burlap and clean all the lint out of your dryer's lint trap.


If you have a dryer snake, you should use that to make sure that no burlap fibers get into the dryer vent.
Failing to remove the lint and fibers from your machines can cause permanent damage.

Let the burlap air out.,
Sprinkle baking soda on the material.,
Alternatively, soak the burlap in a vinegar solution.,
Rinse with plain water.,
Air dry.",How to Wash Burlap3," Minor odors can usually be dispersed simply by letting the burlap sit out in the sunlight and fresh air. Keep it there for a few hours.


Set the burlap out on a warm, sunny day, but avoid placing it in direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can cause the material to fade and dry out, and dried burlap can become brittle.
Partial sun is helpful, however, because it can help lighten or eliminate stains.
Bring the burlap inside if it starts to rain, snow, or hail.
Check the burlap after letting it air out. If the odor has decreased sufficiently, you can stop after this step. If not, continue with the remaining steps.

, Spread the burlap out on a flat surface and sprinkle baking soda all over the surface. Let it sit that way for two to four days, then shake the baking soda off.


Baking soda can neutralize many odors.
If you are cleaning burlap bags, sprinkle the baking soda inside the bag and let it sit. For flat sheets of burlap, though, you'll simply sprinkle the baking soda onto the surface.
If the burlap no longer smells, you can stop after this step. If some odor still remains, repeat the baking soda procedure or move onto the next option.

, Mix a solution made with four parts cold water and one part white distilled vinegar. Soak the burlap in this mixture for two to three minutes.


Vinegar can deodorize and brighten burlap.
Do not use undiluted vinegar, however, since its acidic properties can damage the material.
Do not combine this method with the baking soda technique. The chemical reaction that occurs when baking soda and vinegar mix can cause damage to the burlap.

, After soaking the material in vinegar, make sure that you thoroughly rinse the vinegar out using cold running water.


If you cannot dust off the baking soda, you can rinse that off using cold water, as well.

, After rinsing the burlap, sandwich it between two clean, dry towels. Allow it to dry completely before handling it.

If the sweater is a bright color and has not been washed before, wash it by itself the first time to be sure that the color won’t stain your other clothes., Check the back of your laundry detergent container to see how much you should use, given the amount of clothing in your load. For most cotton sweaters, you can use regular all-purpose laundry detergent or a gentle laundry detergent.


Liquid detergents tend to work best for removing greasy or oily stains. Powder detergents work great for removing dirt or clay., On your washing machine, turn the knob or press the button to select the cycle called “wool,” “hand-wash,” or “delicate.” If there is no delicate cycle option, choose the shortest cycle available. This will help prevent damage to your sweater from a rough wash cycle., Select cold water for bright-colored sweaters, and warm water for light-colored sweaters. Cold water can help the sweater maintain its color, so if in doubt, stick with a cold wash for your sweater. Avoid using hot water with sweaters, unless the care tag specifically says to."

Try to wash your blanket separately if possible.,Place some detergent into the washing machine.,Set the the water temperature set to cold and use the gentle cycle on your blanket to avoid too much agitation--a main cause of pilling, fiber breakage and other damage that will shorten your blanket's life.,
Add fabric softener either to a dispenser or to the final rinse of the wash to improve softness.",How to Wash a Throw2," This will prevent friction between fabrics from roughing up your blanket's surface. This is especially true with fleece blankets as they will pill if abraded. If your blanket does pill despite your best efforts you can remove the pills with a sweater shaver, or if you are careful and brave--a disposable razor.
,,, Adding an extra rinse to the end will reduce buildup that can cause fabric stiffness over time."

In the dryer use the gentlest and coolest cycle and check the blanket every 20 minutes to ensure that you do not leave it longer than it needs in order to dry.,
If fabric cling is an issue with the blanket, use a clean tennis ball or similar drying ball to keep the blanket moving in the dryer.",How to Wash a Throw3," The dryer is another source of friction and so you may wish to further limit the tumbling time by removing the blanket damp and line drying.

, This will also speed drying time and tends to fluff the fabric.







Ideally, for a long blanket life and to prolong softness, line drying outside is the preferred drying method. It removes the friction and fabric damage that occurs during the tumbling action of a dryer.

Fumigate.",How to Keep Wool Clothing Safe From Moths1," You first step is to figure out where your moth infestation originated. Look for holes in any garments made out of animal fibers to try to find out where the moths have been leaving their eggs, since it's the larvae that feed on them after they hatch. Commonly what will happen is that someone buys a piece of secondhand clothing that's already been infested, thus transferring the infestation to their own closet.Depending on the source's financial and sentimental value as well as the extent of the infestation, you may either decide to have the item cleaned and repaired, or it may be more cost effective and safe for the rest of your wardrobe to simply dispose of the infested items.;
, For items that are made of wool or animal products, this means taking them to the dry cleaner's. Let the workers know that you want the clothes cleaned specifically for moths so that they'll use chemicals that will kill moth eggs.Everything else needs to go into the wash with hot water, preferably around 120° Fahrenheit (roughly 49° Celsius), to be sure that any stray caterpillars are destroyed.Finish this process off by drying them in the sunlight, which is known to kill larvae.

, After you've found the source and gotten your clothes cleaning underway, you need to clean your closet. Moths' eggs can end up in a whole host of places: your floor, the tops and bottoms of shelves, and even the ceiling. Do a thorough job of vacuuming and dusting, especially in the corners and any carpeted areas.Moth eggs can hide in carpet and under furniture, so it's very important that you thoroughly vacuum everywhere.Although you do not need to use a special spray for solid, wood surfaces where dusting is easy, there are special sprays that you can buy to use on your clothing and carpet to repel and kill moths. ContainerStore.com, GreenFibres.com, Lakeland.co.uk, and RoullierWhite.com all sell sprays ranging from $7.50 to $18.60 per bottle.

, These traps lure male moths to powder that contains the pheromones of female moths. This powder sticks to their wings and gives the male moths the false appearance of female moths. With both male and female moths confused as to who to breed with, the breeding cycle can be effectively ended., Mothballs are an effective way to kill moths. They contain naphthalene, which is made from crude oil or coal tar, and turns from a solid to a toxic gas. When it's inhaled, it reacts with cells, breaking them down and damaging tissue.Items like coats that have pockets can be protected by putting mothballs in the pockets.
Be careful: using mothballs around small children and pets is potentially very dangerous, especially if ingested.Clothing that has been stored with mothballs should be washed afterward to prevent anemia (when blood doesn't carry oxygen through the body) caused by naphthalene vapors.
If you develop a headache, nausea, dizziness, or vomiting after being exposed to mothballs, discontinue using and dispose of the mothballs.

, High temperatures will kill moth eggs and larvae. So using an iron, which applies direct, high heat to your clothing, will kill moth eggs and larvae clinging to your clothes.It is perfectly safe to iron your wool clothing unless the garment's tags say 'do not iron' or 'dry clean only.' If the clothing item can be ironed, set your iron to the 'wool' setting, use a steam heat, and press from the inside with a pressing cloth between the iron and your clothes., Sub-zero temperatures will kill any larvae or moths in any of their developing stages. If you live in a place that gets cold enough, you can leave your items outside for the day. Otherwise, you can pack them into the freezer for a few days without needing to pack them into plastic bags.Make sure if you've washed your clothes first that they are completely dry before freezing them or else you risk moisture turning into ice crystals on the cloth.
Some sources indicate to freeze your clothes in plastic bags for a week to be sure any pests are completely dead., If all other efforts to rid your closet of a moth infestation fail, you can always turn to a professional pest control service for help. There are usually 24-hour emergency call out services available that you can use to book a last-minute appointment. While this method will most likely be the priciest, it will also probably be the most thorough.Reach out to a local fumigator by looking up pest control in your phonebook or doing an online search using keywords like ""pest control near me."" Try finding a number of services to compare pricing, and look to websites like Yelp or Angie's List for customer reviews.
Be aware that if you choose to go with fumigation, they will most likely be using commercial pesticides. You and any children or pets you have may need to avoid any areas that have been fumigated for a day or more.

Wash and clean your rug as needed.,
Vacuum your rug regularly.,
Rotate your rug every six months to a year.,
Reduce the amount of direct sunlight that your rug sees.",How to Clean Wool Rugs," Shake off any loose dirt or dust that has accumulated on your rug since buying it or cleaning it last. Dirt and dust rubbing against rug fibers actually prove to be damaging to the quality of the rug over time.Be sure that it is dry wherever you shake it out. Shaking a wet rug can further embed the dirt you are trying to remove.
If possible, designate an area where you can hang a clothesline and hang the wool rug like that. Beat against the rug with a broom to help shake it clean.;
, Vacuum the rug in a “V” action to alternate the vacuum’s direction and prevent crushing the fibers of the wool rug. Repeat this 3 times over the wool rug. To keep dirt from building up and embedding itself in your delicate rug, anyway, you should be vacuuming regularly: twice a month. Vacuum the underside of your wool rug once every 2 months.
Make sure the vacuum has a setting of a high height to avoid agitating the rug excessively. Shrinkage, piling, and overall damage to the wool fibers can be a result of agitating the rug too much., Sponge the rug with cool water and a mild liquid soap or rug shampoo. Wash the fringes of the rug with the same solution.Make sure that you wet the rug, paying special attention to the nap of the rug. When you brush your hand against a rug toward the outer edge in linear motions, one side will feel rough and the other side will feel soft. The soft side is the nap side. Apply the soapy water in the direction of the nap side.To finish the job, rinse all the soapy solution off the rug thoroughly with water. Make sure all soap is out of the rug before continuing on to the next step.

, Wool rugs require an extensive dry so do your best to get rid of any excess moisture on the rug by squeezing it out or hanging it out to dry under the sun. Never place them in a dryer, but feel free to use heaters to help facilitate its drying speed.Once the nap of the rug is dry, turn it over, and dry the back of the rug. Make sure both sides of the rug are completely dry before placing it back on the floor.
If the material feels stiff after drying, vacuum the rug one more time or brush it gently to bring some of its softness back., Blot the rug with a towel to remove as much moisture from the mess or stain. Scrubbing will only deepen the stain so it's important to pull the stain out by blotting the rug, not by rubbing it in.Sprinkle the damp area with a liberal amount of baking soda.
Let the baking soda sit on the spot for at least 30 minutes and then vacuum the area.

, Mix the ½ tsp of dishwashing liquid, 2 cups of water, and ½ cup of white vinegar together in a bowl. Using a clean sponge or towel, scrub the mixture onto the area. For wool rugs with pile on them, be gentle with the scrubbing to maintain the wool’s polished look.
Spot treat a small area of the wool rug to test whether or not the rug will have an adverse reaction to the cleaning agent.
Typically avoid dry powder cleaners, alkaline cleaners that contain soda ash, Oxy cleaners , hydrogen peroxide, and bleach to treat stains or clean wool rugs., Place the dry towel on top of the area and, using your hands, press your full weight on different areas of the towel to absorb as much moisture as you can from the spot. Repeat this motion on different parts of the towel until the spot is mostly dried.

, This will allow air to pass up and underneath the rug and give you access to any wet spots that might need to be cleaned up from the spill seeping through the rug. Turn on a heater or the ceiling fan to help the rug dry faster.

, Depending on where the wool rug is placed in your home, cleaning might range from once a year to once every several years. A professional cleaning is recommended, but as shown above, it can be a job you do yourself.


To see how dirty your rug is, lift it by a corner and kick the back of it. If dirt comes out, it is dirty and in need of a cleaning. If nothing happens, a cleaning isn’t necessary., Vacuuming is how you keep your rug clean in between the yearly washings. It is essential to keeping dust and dirt from everyday foot traffic at bay.


For the first year of a wool rug’s life, vacuum at least 2-3 times a week. For areas that have high traffic, vacuum once a week. For older rugs and areas that have less traffic, vacuum once every couple of months.Do not vacuum with vacuums that have a brush or beater bar. Try to limit the type of vacuum to suction-only options., By doing this, you regulate how often areas of the rug get stepped on. Wool rugs should be rotated at a 180 degree angle periodically to counteract foot traffic patterns on the rug., Use shading to reduce sunlight in sunny rooms. Apply UV filters to windows to prevent wool fibers from weakening and the wool from drying out."

If the label is still intact, give it a read before you begin ironing to see if there are any special instructions.Some items will have special instructions regarding ironing. They may need a very low heat setting, for example.
If you see a symbol of an iron with an X through it, or words that read something like ""Do not iron,"" you should not iron this garment. Some items will be damaged very quickly by the heat of an iron.
You can steam items that cannot be ironed or spritz them with hot water and then rub the wrinkles out.;
, Most irons come with a wool setting. When ironing wool, use this setting unless the manufacturer's label says otherwise. The wool setting will assure that the iron in a heated in a manner that will not cause damage to wool clothing.If your iron does not have a wool setting, heat the iron to the lowest possible setting. Wool does best when ironed at lower settings., Wool fabric should not be ironed dry. You should always steam wool fabric, so add water to your iron before you begin to iron your wool. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on your iron to figure out how to add water for specific guidelines.








If your iron doesn't have a steam setting, spritz your garment with a little water prior to ironing., You should never iron wool fabric directly. Wool fabric is fragile and requires extra care when ironing. You need a pressing cloth to protect your wool fabric.You can buy a pressing cloth at a department store. Its specific purpose will be to protect fabrics when ironing.
If you don't have a pressing cloth, you can use a clean cloth or handkerchief.

, It's always best to iron wool inside out. You want to protect the surface of wool from shine. Turn any garment you're ironing inside out before setting it on the ironing board and covering it with a pressing cloth., As you lay down your wool garment to iron, try to press out any wrinkles you can with your hands. You want to use the least heat possible when ironing wool. Smoothing out wrinkles with your hands will lessen ironing time.








Try to smooth out any wrinkles with your hands.
You should also try to get the garment to lie as flat as possible. This will minimize the time spent repositioning the garment while ironing.
Remember to place your pressing cloth over the garment.

, Place your iron on one end of the garment. Pull the iron to the other end. Make sure you do not wiggle around as you move. this can actually iron wrinkles into a garment.When you're done, move the iron over a few inches and iron another line.
Keep ironing in single straight lines until you've ironed the entire garment.

, For best results, only iron one side of an item. For example, only iron the front side of a wool sweater. You want to press the iron hard enough you press out the wrinkles on both sides of a garment. This will both save you time and minimize the clothing's exposure to heat.








If you still need to iron the other side of the item, try to use a bit more force the next time you're ironing. This will help you avoid such problems in future.

, Wool is prone to shine after ironing. Luckily, this is an issue that can be easily treated with white vinegar. Sponge a little white vinegar on the surface of the wool. Then, rinse the garment thoroughly.








If you've never treated a garment with white vinegar before, test a small patch of the item before using white vinegar to remove shine.

, An unstable ironing board can be a safety risk when ironing. An iron can cause serious burns if it falls on you or another person. Make sure your ironing board is not shaky or otherwise unstable before you begin ironing., You should let wool items sit out for five minutes after ironing before hanging them up or folding them. Hanging or folding iron items too soon can cause creasing.







, In the event you're burned by an iron, treat the burn quickly. This will help minimize damage and allow your skin to heal fast.








Burns should not be iced, as this can further damage the skin. Instead, run burns under cool running water for 20 minutes.
A burn bigger than a dime should be treated by a doctor.

Inspect any recently purchased items.,
Keep your closet area clean.,
Keep your clothing clean.,
Store clothing in airtight containers.,
Use cedar.,
Use natural, food-based repellents.,
Periodically check your clothing.",How to Keep Wool Clothing Safe From Moths2," Especially if the item came from a secondhand store or a friend, regardless of the fiber content of the item, you should make sure there are no signs that the item is infested. It is possible that stray caterpillars could be attached to the clothing and end up hatching in your closet. In the United States, most infestations come from webbing clothes moths, but you should still inspect for both.Look for patches of silk webbing and feeding tube which webbing clothes moths leave behind.
Casemaking moths' cases will change to match the color of the clothing they're eating. For this reason, you should always look for numerous, suspicious small holes as this your best warning sign for an infestation.

, Frequently clean your closet from top to bottom; moths like to live in places where it's dark and they're undisturbed. Move things around: move your clothes out, wipe things down with detergent-soaked clothes, and vacuum the floors and drawers., You might think that your clothes, particularly those made out of cotton and manmade fibers, will be okay as long as your wool is stored separately. But moths like to eat the tiny detritus left behind from human skin, like sweat, as well as food particles. Make sure your clothes have always been washed before they return to your closet space., You can use vacuum sealing, ziplock bags, or even plastic containers with airtight lids to store your wool garments when you're not using them. This is particularly helpful in the spring and summer months. You can also line these spaces with anti-moth paper, cedar, or even mothballs to make them extra secure. Most if not all of these items should be available from Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, Target, or Walmart.Be careful: storing clothes in an airtight container can only keep new infestations from happening; if your clothing already has eggs on it, they'll hatch and eat the clothes anyway. Be sure you've properly cleaned your clothing first.
Make sure the containers are also dry, as are your clothes, to prevent mold.

, The strong smell of cedar helps to camouflage your clothes from moths. You can invest in cedar furniture to store clothing, but if that's too expensive, cedarwood hangers, cedarwood blocks, and even oil diffusers that use cedarwood's aromatic oils are affordable solutions. JCPenney, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Amazon will all carry them.There has been some limited evidence suggesting that Eastern Red Cedar (actually a juniper) contains an aromatic oil that, over time and with a sufficient enough concentration, will kill small moth larvae. However, a closet would provide too much air circulation to be lethal to larvae, and would probably only serve as a deterrent for the adult moths.
Eastern Red cedar is only effective for a few years. After a while, the aromatic oil contained within the wood will evaporate, rendering it ineffective in a fight against moths.

, It's long been thought that certain herbs and food products could protect your clothes from moths. The theory is that, for the same reason that cedar is effective (a very powerful odor), moths can be similarly kept at bay by other strong odors. In a recent experiment, researchers found that cinnamon, cloves, and lavender were all effective at keep moths from eating clothing. You can make sachets or put out a bowl of scented oil in your closet.Some aromatic herbs, like bay leaves, eucalyptus, lemon peel, and mint proved to be ineffective in the experiment, so be careful about which herbs you use.
Beware that some of these scents are very difficult to get out of clothing, in case you or loved ones dislike or have any allergies to these plants.

, Whether you're trying to prevent an infestation from occurring for the first time, or trying to prevent one from recurring, you should check your clothing throughout the year. Look for signs of an infestation, which generally amount to suspicious and multiple holes in your clothing.Although this is particularly important during the months your clothes are not stored in plastic containers, it's also important to check at least once after you've stored them: adults live for about 75 to 80 days, and eggs hatch into larvae after 4-10 days. If moth eggs managed to make their way into the storage item and go unchecked, you may come back to ruined clothing months too late.Moving and shuffling your clothes around during this process is actually very helpful because moths do not like to lay their eggs in places that are frequently disturbed.

Which cycle to use in the washer (if permitted)
What detergents or soaps to use
Other special washing and care instructions
Drying instructions
Whether the is coat dry clean only;
, Use a garment brush and wipe the coat gently to remove dirt, dust, food, mud, and other particles that have collected. To prevent felting and making the wool fluffy, brush lengthwise from the collar to the bottom.


You can use a damp cloth to brush the coat if you don’t have a garment brush., Look over the garment for dirt, food, and other stains that may be on the fabric. To spot clean, apply a small amount of mild detergent, such as Woolite, to the affected area. Rub the detergent in gently with your finger until the dirt comes loose.


Even if you don’t see any soiling, spot clean the collar, cuffs, and armpits of the coat.
You can also use a stain bar or cashmere and wool shampoo to spot clean a wool coat., Rinse out your bathtub with a bit of soapy water and a sponge. Rinse out all the soap with clean water. This will ensure that you have a clean area to work in, and will prevent dirt from the tub from being transferred to the coat.If you don’t have a bathtub you can use, clean out a large sink or wash basin.

, When the tub is clean, put in the plug and fill it with lukewarm water. While the water is running, add ⅛ cup (29 ml) of mild liquid detergent, like Woolite or baby shampoo, to the stream. Let the tub fill with enough soapy water to immerse the coat.


It’s important to use lukewarm water instead of hot water, because hot water can shrink the coat., Immerse the coat in the soapy water. Push it down until it’s saturated enough to stop floating. Leave the coat to soak for 30 minutes. Squeeze the jacket all over with your hands to make sure the soapy water gets into all the fibers.Saturating and soaking the coat will help prevent shrinkage.

, After an hour or two of soaking, rub soiled areas with your fingers to get rid of dirt and grime. Then, swish the coat around in the water to dislodge dirt and other particles.


Don’t scrub the wool against itself to clean it, because this can cause felting., Drain the soapy water from the bathtub. Transfer the coat to a large bucket. Rinse out the tub, and then refill it with clean lukewarm water. Return the coat to the tubful of clean water. Swish the coat around in the water to remove excess dirt and soap.Repeat the rinsing process if necessary if there's still a lot of soap coming out in the water.

, It is possible that your jacket has a care label that says the garment can be machine washed. Before washing the coat, turn it inside out and place it inside a mesh wash bag. This will protect it from rubbing and getting snagged in the washer.You can use a large pillow case if you don’t have a wash bag. Place the coat inside and tie the top of the pillow case in a loose knot.
If the coat is too large for a pillow case, wrap it up in a bed sheet and tie the bed sheet together around the coat.

, Set your washing machine to fill the drum with lukewarm water. As the water is running, add ⅛ cup (29 ml) of a delicate or wool-specific detergent like Woolite or wool shampoo. Let the drum fill with soapy water.Soaking a wool coat is an important part of the washing process. If you have a front loader and aren't able to soak the coat in the machine, either wash it by hand, or soak it first in a tub and then transfer it to the machine.

, Place the coat into the soapy water in the drum of the washing machine. Press it down into the water so the fibers become saturated and the coat sinks. Leave the lid open and let the coat soak in the soapy water for 30 minutes.Soaking will help prevent shrinkage and loosen dirt.

, After 30 minutes of soaking, close the washing machine lid. Set your washer to a delicate, hand-wash, or wool setting. Turn the machine on and let it wash the coat.It’s important to use a cycle for wools or delicates because it will involve less agitation and rubbing, both of which can cause felting.
Make sure the washing machine temperature is set to lukewarm, otherwise the coat may shrink.
When the wash cycle is complete, remove the coat, take it out of the wash bag, and turn it right-side out.

, Hold the coat over a sink or tub. Working from the top of the coat toward the bottom, gently squeeze the coat to remove excess water. Do not wring or twist the wool or you could distort and stretch it.When you get to the bottom of the coat, go back to the top and squeeze the coat again from top to bottom.

, Lay out a large towel on a table. Lay the coat flat on top of the towel. Roll up the jacket and the towel together, like you're making a jelly roll. When the jacket has been rolled up into the towel, squeeze the towel to help it absorb moisture from the coat.Do not twist or wring the jacket when it’s rolled in the towel.
Unroll the towel and remove the coat.

, Replace the wet towel with a clean dry one. Spread the coat out on the towel and leave it to dry flat. After the first day, turn the coat over to let the other side dry. Drying may take two to three days.Never hang wet wool to dry, as it could cause stretching and misshaping.
Never dry a wool coat in the dryer, as it can cause shrinkage.

Examine the weaknesses of door sweeps and ready made thresholds.,
To make your own door threshold, that fits like a glove, out of cardboard, you have to assemble some materials: cardboard, box cutter, paper glue, measuring tape, and duct tape (buy a color that matches your floor).

,
Measure the width of your doorway and the thickness of your door.,

",How to Make an Uneven Door Threshold out of Cardboard to Keep Critters Out,"


Door sweeps work fairly well but tiny mice can squeeze in at the ends of the door sweep. Strengthen the ends of your door sweep by putting an additional wood screw at the end. Additionally, strengthen the door sweep by using rubber cement, or even paper glue, to bond the lower part, usually made of rubber or felt, to the metal upper part. If possible, mount the door sweep at the exterior of the door, because if it is mounted on the interior, a space is created under the door that a big roach will naturally hide under. Sometimes a door sweep may fit better mounted on the interior side of the door and that hiding space is created. If you live in an older home and the flooring is uneven, the door sweep might get pinched between the door and the floor, and break.






Door thresholds decreases the gaps under doors, but not perfectly, and they work well with a door sweep. Door threshold also keeps dust from blowing into a room, and helps contains the heat in winter, and the cool air in summer.





;
,, Next measure the space under your door.

, With a door that is 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) thick, plan on making your threshold 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) wide.

, For an uneven threshold make their widths the same and the lengths different. For an even threshold make the widths and lengths the same, and all you have to do is make the height correct. In either case you want a snug fit.

,, If there is still a gap, add another strip of cardboard. If the threshold is too high, either compress the threshold a bit or peel off a layer of cardboard. Adjust the length of the threshold to fit the doorway exactly.

Address new stains as soon as possible after they occur., Use a gentle touch and a towel to carefully blot at fresh spills. Do not rub the fabric, since this can push the stain even more deeply into the tweed fibers. Soak up as much of the liquid as you can from the fabric.

, Modern tweed may be a mix of other fabrics with wool, so it’s possible that you can wash it in the washing machine. If your tweed item still has its care tag attached, check it for instructions. If it's machine washable, place it in a mesh bag first to protect it, then follow the care tag's specific directions.If your item's tag says “Dry Clean Only,” follow those instructions.
If there’s no care tag and the item is expensive, dry cleaning may be the safest option for dealing with set-in stains.

, Spot-cleaning with a mild detergent is the best option for most stains on tweed, since it's effective on oil-based and water-based stains alike. If you're dealing with a water-based stain, attempt to spot-clean it with mild detergent first before resorting to a dry cleaning kit. For oil-based stains, always spot-clean with detergent; dry cleaning solvents may make oil-based stains worse or ruin the fabric.

, Before you address the stain with a cleaning solution, place a dry cloth or handful of paper towels underneath the stained fabric. This will help to capture the moisture that runs off during the cleansing process.

, Make sure the detergent you use is labeled “wool safe.”Use the water and mild detergent solution to address water-based stains like soup or juice. Use detergents that are petroleum-based to get rid of greasy or oil-based stains.

, Dip the sponge in the solution, then gently dab at the spot with it. After applying, allow the solution to sit for a few minutes on the fabric, which will help to loosen up the spilled substance embedded in the fibers., Dampen a clean towel with warm water and press it against the area to rinse away the detergent. If the stain persists, you can try to apply the detergent again or dry clean the tweed item.

, Use another clean dry towel to absorb excess moisture from the area. Lay the item out flat on a towel and allow it to air dry completely before using it. Never put any woolen fabrics in your dryer; this will ruin the item."

Reserve this technique for water-based stains.,
Choose a dry cleaning solvent or kit for the home.,
Take the stained fabric to a well-ventilated place.,
Pre-treat the item.,
Place an absorbent pad under the fabric.,
Apply the solution directly to the stain.,
Follow the kit’s instructions for drying.",How to Clean Tweed2," Unfortunately, dry cleaning solvents aren’t that effective on oil-based stains like ketchup and lipstick. In some cases, they may even make the stain worse. Since the chemicals are so harsh, you may damage your tweed in the process, as well. Use dry cleaning solvents on water-based stains, such as juice or cola stains., These kits can be purchased at most home improvement stores or online. Check the packaging to ensure it’s safe to use on woolen fabrics before you make the purchase. If time allows, you may want to do a quick Google search for customer reviews on various products before purchasing one.

, Some dry cleaning solvents are toxic. Crack a window and complete the process in a well-ventilated area. Restrict children and pets from entering the area while you work.

, Every brand is different, but most dry-cleaning kits provide a stain pre-treatment. This may be a pre-moistened towelette. Follow the instructions provided by the kit to pretreat your item. If there is no pretreatment included, make sure to get up any solid dirt and debris before you begin., Before you begin applying the dry cleaning solution, it’s important to place a cotton pad or thick wad of paper towels underneath the item. This will absorb excess fluid.

, Turn the bottle upside down to dispense the fluid. Then gently rub the stain with a small towel or sponge. The stain should go through the fabric onto the absorbent pad or be absorbed into the towel. Continue applying the solution until the stain is no longer visible on the fabric.

, Some kits will direct you to place the items in the dryer. Proceed with caution, since this can damage tweed. It’s safer to allow the item to dry on a flat surface instead. Let it dry completely before you use it.

Store tweed clothing and upholstery fabric in a cool dry place.,
Vacuum tweed upholstery weekly.,
Apply fabric protector to tweed furniture.",How to Clean Tweed3," Moths are attracted to wool. Put tweed items in a cedar chest or other cool dry receptacle, where moths cannot eat them. You can also buy moth deterrents at home improvement stores. Follow the instructions on the packaging to apply it.


Store garments in zip-up clothing bags for additional protection., If you have tweed upholstery, vacuum it weekly to avoid allowing dirt to become embedded in the tight weave of the fabric. Use a brush attachment and lightly run it over the surface of the tweed. Be sure to get into the cracks and crevices, such as the areas between cushions. You can routinely clean tweed garments this way, as well.

, It is a good idea to apply a fabric protector to tweed furniture as soon as you get it, and occasionally afterward. Check first to see if it has already been applied. If you have applied this in the past, a liquid stain should bead up and be fairly easy to remove by blotting. The fabric protector does not make it waterproof, however.

Hammer the nut closed.,
Push the cable through the washer holes.,
Thread the end of the cable through a nut.,
Hammer the nut closed.,
Set the snare trap.",How to Make a Coyote Trap1," Purchase a ⅛ inch aircraft cable. Then, use wire cutters to cut the cable so that it is 48 inches (1.2 meters) in length.You can purchase an aircraft cable at your local hardware store.;
, Using a 5/32 inch drill bit, drill two holes in a flat washer. Lay the washer flat and drill one hole at the top and the other hole at the bottom of the washer. For example, the two holes should be located at 12 and 6 o’clock.Position the holes between the pre-existing center hole of the washer and the outer rim.

, Place the washer in a bench vise and pinch the washer. It should bend slightly in half. This will form the lock for the snare., Take one end of the cable and thread it through a ¼ inch nut. Then, thread it back through the nut creating a loop. Continue to pull the cable back through the nut until you have a loop with a ¾ inch (2 cm) diameter.Leave an extra inch of cable at the end.

, Place the nut on an anvil and hammer the nut so that the cable is fastened in place and the loop is secure.

, Then, push the cable through the top hole of the washer, from the outside of the bend to the inside. Pull the cable about a foot through the washer. Then, loop the cable through the bottom hole of the washer from the inside of the bend to the outside.This should create a loop.

, Create a stopper at the end of the cable. Thread the end through a ¼ inch nut. There should be about ½ an inch (1 cm) of cable sticking out through the center of the nut., Place the nut on an anvil and hammer it so that the nut tightens around the cable, locking it in place.The snare is now complete and ready to be set.

, In order to set a snare trap, you want to place it on a trail or path that is frequented by coyotes. Then, attach the small looped end of the snare to a solid object, such as a fence post or small sapling. This will anchor the snare in place. Hang the larger loop from a nearby branch so that the bottom of the loop is approximately 12 inches (30 cm) off the ground.When a coyote walks past it will mistake the hanging wire for a branch and walk into the snare. The loop will tighten, trapping the coyote as it continues walking and the bent washer will prevent the loop from loosening.

Select a trap.,
Create a trap bed.,
Cover the trap with dirt.,
Dig a tunnel near the trap bed.",How to Make a Coyote Trap2," The most common coyote trap is a jaw trap. In order to make a trap set, purchase a no. 3 coil spring trap. This will be the appropriate size to trap a coyote. You can purchase a trap at your local hunting store.

, When setting a trap, you need to dig a trap bed. The trap bed should be large enough so that it can fit the trap when opened and laying flat. It should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep so that it can be covered with dirt and hidden., Set the trap and then place dirt over top of the trap. Pour the dirt through a sifter so that it gently sprinkles over the trap. Try and make the area look as natural as possible. You can also lay larger sticks or mounds of grass and dirt along the sides of the trap. These can be used as guides to make sure the coyote steps on the trap.When placing guides, be sure to make it look as natural as possible. Do not put the sticks in a straight line. They need to look like they fell there naturally.

, Once the trap is covered by dirt, dig a hole about 8-10 inches away from the trap bed. The opening of the hole should be facing towards the trap bed and the hole should be two inches in diameter and dug on a 45 degree angle.The hole is supposed to look like it was dug by a small rodent, such as a mouse or mole and the small dirt pile that is covering the trap will look like the dirt that was removed from digging the hole.

Position the trap on a natural coyote trail.,
Use bait to lure the coyote.,
Ensure the traps do not have a human smell.,
Approach a trapped coyote with caution.",How to Make a Coyote Trap3," The best traps are located in areas where coyotes naturally walk on a regular basis. Typically, these paths are located along fences or other field boundaries. Before setting your trap look for coyote tracks or traces of hair. This will help you determine where the coyotes travel., Meat is the best way to attract coyotes and can actually lure coyotes from a wide area. Use a piece of raw meat, such as beef or wild game. Coyotes will also be attracted to dog food, which can act as a cheap substitute to raw meat.This meat could also attract domestic animals, such as dogs. As a result, you should place the trap far away from homes.
You can also purchase lures and scents from a hunting store.

, Coyotes have a very sensitive sense of smell and will avoid an area if they smell humans. As a result, you should always wear gloves when setting traps so that your scent is not left near the trap. You can also spray the area surrounding the trap with commercial coyote lures to cover up the smell., If you successfully trap a coyote, you will need to cautiously remove the coyote from the trap. Read the local laws in your jurisdiction concerning coyote trapping. In some states coyotes that are trapped must be euthanized. Other locations may have specific handling legislation. Always wear gloves when removing a coyote from the trap. This will help prevent the transmission of diseases, such as rabies.If the animal is still alive, you may want to contact a wildlife control expert.

Keep any pesticides you purchase in its original package.,
Buy or build a special cabinet or lockable shed or other structure for storing pesticides.,
Protect the container from water leaks, direct sunlight, or excess moisture which may cause the label to become illegible.,
Place dry powder or granular pesticide containers in a moisture proof plastic tub or container.,
Do not buy more pesticides than you intend to use in the near term.",How to Store Pesticides Safely," These packages are designed for the safe storage of the product, and offer the longest potential ""shelf life"". Here are some things you should know about pesticide containers.


Chemical resistant plastic jugs and bottles are not subject to leaks caused by corrosive chemicals in the pesticide.
Glass bottles for particularly reactive chemicals.
Amber or dark colored plastic or glass containers for photo-reactive chemicals. Some chemicals undergo change when exposed to sunlight, so these are usually stored in colored containers.
Childproof (or resistance) lids. These keep the container from being easily opened by children.
Labels. This is the most important reason for keeping pesticides, or any chemical product (cleaning solvents, herbicides, etc.) in the original container. The label should contain the following information.

Product name.
Specific warnings (avoid contact with skin, harmful or fatal if swallowed, do not breath, etc).
Chemical contents (ingredients)
Expiration, or ""dispose by"" dates.
Instructions for use.

;
, If you only have a few small containers, they may be stored in a utility room, garden shed, or garage if you can be sure they are out of reach of children, and not exposed to potential causes of leakage. They should not be stored where there is a potential ignition source, such as a furnace or water heater.

, Any container whose label becomes unreadable is manifestly more dangerous.

, These products usually are purchased in a heavy paper sack container, weighing as much as 50 pounds. Although the product container is suitable for storing the material in normal conditions, you may want to by a large, lidded, plastic storage bin like a Sterolyte or Rubbermaid closet storage box if you intend to store the product for more than a few days.

, Even though bulk chemical products usually cost less, they are dangerous to store, and often have a shelf life which can cause their effectiveness and usefulness to decrease over time.

Use a lamp to attract fleas.,
Use a yellow-green filter on a light.,
Place a candle in the center of the dish.,
Place an indoor plant beside the trap.,
Bathe and comb your pets.,
Vacuum regularly.,
Wash bedding, drapery, clothes, and rugs.,
Consider an insecticide.",How to Make a Flea Trap," Ideal containers for a dish soap flea trap include cookie sheets, rubber tote lids, plates, and pie plates. You want a container with a large surface area and short sides.A shallow dish will help you catch as many fleas as possible, because the short sides won’t act as a barrier for jumping fleas that might land in the trap.;
, Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of liquid dish soap to the water. Swish the water around with a spoon or your finger to distribute the soap throughout the water.


Fleas don’t drown in plain water because they aren't heavy enough to break the water’s surface tension.
Adding liquid dish soap to the water reduces the surface tension. When the fleas jump into the trap, they will sink and drown., A homemade flea trap doesn’t have the power to attract fleas, so it’s best to put it somewhere that fleas have already been in your house. Place a towel on the floor to catch spills, and lay the trap on top of the towel on the floor.Make multiple flea traps for different rooms if necessary. Common places to find fleas include:


On carpets and rugs
Near pet bedding
Near windows
Around pillows and furniture
Around pet bowls
Near drapes and curtains

, Fleas become active a couple of hours before sunset and stay active all night long, so the best time to catch them is overnight. Once you lay the trap, try to leave it undisturbed for the rest of the night. When possible, close the door to the room to keep pets and kids out.

, In the morning, check the trap for dead fleas. If you caught any, dump the soapy water and rinse the dish. Fill the dish with fresh water, add more dish soap, and lay the trap out again on the towel for the next night.


Repeat each night until you stop catching fleas., Place a directional or table lamp beside the trap. Before bed, turn on the lamp and position the bulb above the trap, so the light shines into the trap. The fleas will be attracted to the light and warmth, and when they jump toward the light, they’ll land in the trap below.Use an incandescent or other heat-producing bulb for your trap to attract the most fleas possible.
Make sure the lamp is sturdy and not at risk of being knocked over into the water. Use this attractant only in rooms where you can shut the door and keep people and pets out while the lamp is on.

, Fleas are, for some reason, twice as attracted to yellow-green light as they are to other colors of light. You can increase the efficacy of your lamp attractant by using a yellow-green bulb, or by installing a yellow-green filter on a lamp with a regular bulb.You can buy colored light bulbs at many department and superstores.
You may be able to find filters and gels at camera and art supply stores.

, You can also use a tea light to create light and warmth that will attract fleas to the trap. Place a tea light or votive candle at the center of the trap, and light the candle before bed. As the fleas try to get close to the source, they’ll fall into the trap and drown.Place the trap away from walls, drapery, and other flammable objects.
Always exercise great care and proper fire safety measures when burning candles.
Close off the room to prevent people and pets from entering when the candle is lit.

, Fleas are attracted to carbon dioxide, and this is part of the mechanism they use to find a host. Because plants release carbon dioxide at night, placing one beside the trap may help to attract more fleas.Dormant flea pupae are particularly sensitive to carbon dioxide, so this may be a great way to catch young fleas before they have a chance to lay eggs., Pets are the most likely culprit for bringing fleas into your house, so keeping your pets clean and groomed will help stop the infestation at its source.To treat your pet:


Comb your pet’s fur with a flea comb, concentrating at the neck and tail especially
Swish the comb around in soapy water after each brush to kill fleas
After combing, soak your pet with a hose or in a tub
Lather your pet’s fur with a flea controlling shampoo
Leave the shampoo on the fur for a few minutes
Rinse your pet down
Repeat regularly during the spring, summer, and fall

, Adult fleas, eggs, larvae, and pupae can hide almost anywhere in your house, so you must vacuum three to four times each week to stay on top of them. Use a strong vacuum that will suck fleas and eggs from the nooks and crannies in your house.Use a brush or nozzle attachment for hard to reach areas.


Vacuum floors, carpets, sideboards, furniture, around windows, and especially around areas where your pet spends the most time.
After vacuuming with a bag-style vacuum, remove the bag, tie it tightly in a plastic bag, and remove it from the house immediately.

, Fleas and eggs won’t survive a trip through the washing machine and dryer, so launder everything that can go into the washing machine, and hand wash everything else. Use the hottest water setting and highest heat setting in the washer and dryer.Items to wash include:


Blankets
Sheets
Pillow cases
Pillows
Shoes
Clothes
Pet toys
Pet bowls
Towels

, Flea infestations can persist for months if you're not successful at removing all the fleas and their eggs. For stubborn infestations, use a pyrethrin-based pesticide with an insect growth regulator, such as Ultracide or Onslaught. Apply the insecticide inside and outside.


Get everybody out of the house. Put on gloves, goggles, long sleeves, and a respirator to apply the insecticide. Use a dust or aerosol and apply a light mist on floors, walls, furniture, and all other surfaces inside the house. Allow the dust or spray to settle before letting people back in. Vacuum after 48 hours.
Outside, apply a layer of dust or spray to the garden, on bushes and shrubs, around tall grass, in wooded areas, and around windows and doors.

Make two perfectly flat 1'frames out of either plywood or straight sticks (tied together);
,Make four Y-shaped sticks, about 16"" (not including Y part of sticks)

,
Make a bunch more 1' straight sticks.

,
Place one frame on the ground where you are trapping the animal.

,
Use the pocketknife to whittle the straight end of each Y-shaped stick to a point.

,
Carefully push the pointed end of each of these sticks into the ground at the insides of the corners of the frame on the ground, so there is about 12"" between the ground and the bottom of each Y of each stick.

,
Turn these sticks so that if you drew a line diagonally across the square, the line would go directly between the two prongs of the Y (in other words, the Y is diagonal to the corner of the square).

,
Place the other frame on top of the assembly, so that it is resting on the four Y's.

,
Tie each corner of the frame to the Y it is on top of.

,
Place and tie foot-long sticks horizontally on top of the frame.

,
Do the same thing with most of the other sticks on 3 of the sides of the assembly to form walls.,
Tie the top of each remaining stick to the top frame on the side that does not yet have a wall, so that the bottom of each stick is inside of the trap at the bottom of the frame, so that you can effortlessly put your hand into the trap, but if you try to pull on a stick, it will get stuck on the bottom frame.

,
Add bait (peanut butter works great for rodents) inside the trap in one of the back corners and your trap is complete.Then just set back and wait for the animal you are trapping.

, Any straw will do, you can cut it to make it shorter if you want.

, You may need to cut the bulb to make it fit. You want the straw to fit inside the bulb, not outside.

, When you squeeze the bulb and let go, air should rush in, and ants will too! Since you're using a drinking straw, you won't be able to fit large bugs in, but ant and fly size will fit.

, It should be around the size of a hotel shampoo bottle. Fill it with bug spray, or anything that can kill bugs. You can empty out your bulb into this container, leaving the bugs to drown.

Repeat as needed.",How to Buy Organic Insecticides," Before you can begin eradicating the pests that have invaded your garden, you’ll first need to learn what they are. Inspect your plants closely, paying attention to the physical characteristics of any insects you happen to spot. You can then run an internet search or consult a horticulture specialist to get more information about what they are and how to get rid of them.Aphids, caterpillars, cutworms and various beetles are among the most destructive pests commonly found in gardens.A guidebook with detailed photographs may come in handy for researching common insect species.;
, Take a minute to assess the severity of the problem, as well. One or two bugs isn’t a cause for alarm, but a full-fledged infestation will need to be dealt with immediately. Determining how serious the situation is will also help give you an idea of how much and what kind of insecticide you'll need.If you only spot a few bugs, you may be able to simply brush them off by hand or blast them away using a garden hose.Don't forget to check the backs of the stalks and the undersides of the leaves, as well. Insects can often be found hiding in shady, out-of-the-way places.

, While organic insecticides tend to be more gentle than chemical treatments, some may contain potent ingredients that aren’t a good mix with certain plants. Lime sulfur, for instance, can burn through foliage if applied in hot weather conditions. You’ll usually be able to find out what sorts of plants a product is designed to treat by reading the label.Even organic pesticides can weaken or kill healthy growth if applied too frequently, or in too high a concentration.
Be particularly careful about applying insecticides to seedlings or plants suffering from blight or another type of fungal infection.

, All commercial pesticides must be approved by the EPA before they can be sold. These products will bear a seal of approval somewhere on the packaging, which indicates that they’re safe for the environment and for the people using them.Organic pesticides should also feature a seal from the USDA confirming their organic status. It’s necessary for these solutions to be made from at least 70% natural compounds in order to qualify for the “organic” label.Don’t buy a product if it doesn’t have a seal on it, or if it doesn’t contain at least 70% organic ingredients.

, Not only are these places the most likely to carry the treatments you need, they’ll also have a more extensive selection. Greenhouses are another option, if you happen to have one in your area.


While you’re there, consult the gardening specialists on staff about your pest problem. They’re trained to identify common species of invading insects, and will be able to tell you how best to eliminate them.
It might also help to buy seeds or clippings of other plants that are known to protect against pests, like lavender, clover or chrysanthemums., The gardening center at big commercial outlets like Walmart might also have the products you’re looking for. Remember to scan for the EPA and USDA labels to make sure the pesticide you buy is organic and environmentally safe.

Organic pesticides don’t tend to be as readily available as their chemical counterparts, so there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to find them at chain stores.
If you’re unable to find a suitable product, you could always pick up the components you need to whip up your own solution at home.

, Search for organic insecticides on retail websites that specialize in natural gardening methods. The product listings will present you with a snapshot of everything you need to know about a treatment and how to apply it. You may also be able to find articles on related topics, including how to prevent pests from moving in in the first place.The internet is one of your best resources when it comes to gathering information about pests and pesticides.
Be sure to include important key terms like the species of plant that’s under attack and the type of insects that are to blame.

, In addition to commercial pesticides, you could also try mixing up your own DIY natural repellents at home. Substances like hot peppers, essential oils, garlic and onions or even liquid dish detergent can be combined with a little water to form a solution. Transfer the solution to a spray bottle and mist it onto the foliage of the plants wherever else you see unwanted insects.Apply homemade solutions once or twice a day every 5-7 days until you begin to see an improvement.Detergents and other substances like hydrogen peroxide are known as “contact pesticides,” which means they’ll need to be applied directly to insects to be effective.

, Always look over the included instructions before you attempt to apply a commercial insecticide. They may include special directions that are worth knowing, like the best weather conditions or time of day to use the product. It can also make a difference to target the soil or roots of the plants as opposed to the foliage.Using pesticides haphazardly can end up doing more harm to your plants than good.
For homemade remedies that don’t come with instructions, it’s a good idea to err on the side of caution and use a lower concentration. You can reapply the solution later if it doesn’t do the trick right away., Mist the leaves thoroughly, making sure to cover them as evenly as possible. Use only as much as recommended for each application. If you’ve selected a contact pesticide, you’ll need to spray the insects themselves in order to get the desired effect.Some liquid insecticides come prepackaged in convenient spray bottles. Others may need to be transferred to a sprayer or hooked up to a hose before you can use them to treat your garden.
For your own protection, make sure you're wearing the proper safety gear: long sleeved clothing, thick rubber gardening gloves, eye protection and a facemask or respirator if available., These can be sifted using a hand duster or simply placed in a separate container in the correct amount and shaken out. When using an insecticide in powdered or granulated form, it will usually be necessary to distribute some over the soil at the base of the plant, as well.Use a spray bottle filled with water to wet the leaves of plants before applying a powdered product. This will help the pesticide stick better.
Substances like food-grade diatomaceous earth can be spread by hand if no other tools are available., Most insecticides act quickly, but they won’t work overnight. Wait 7-10 days after the initial application before following up with a second. In the meantime, keep an eye on the plants to see if the problem clears up. Within a few weeks, your garden will most likely be be back to normal.

Try not to expose your garden to foreign substances like insecticides more frequently than is absolutely necessary. Even if they’re safe to use on plants, they may be harmful to beneficial insects and other wildlife.Homemade treatments can be employed on the spot whenever you notice insects swarming in large numbers.

Choose a DEET product that is appropriate for your outdoor activity and age.,
Using DEET products simultaneously with sunscreen has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of sunscreen by as much as one-third the SPF.,
Pour liquid DEET-based insect repellents onto your hands and spread evenly over exposed skin.,
Watch insect activity around you to know when to apply DEET to yourself again.,
Reapply your DEET-based product as needed.,
Wash and remove the DEET-based product you previously applied after your outdoor activity is finished.",How to Apply Deet," The lower the concentration of DEET in any bug repellent product, the shorter it will remain effective. While you can apply DEET on children as young as 2 months of age, remember that the lower concentrations of DEET are safer for kids but you will need to reapply DEET more frequently.;
, Remember to reapply sunscreen more frequently when using a DEET product. Only reapply DEET if bugs start bothering you again.

, If using a spray, don't aim it at your face but instead spray it into your hands and rub over your face while avoiding eyes, lips and nostrils. Remember that DEET can burn the eyes and taste unpleasant if ingested.

, Younger children tend to be bothered by insects first. By watching kids, you'll know when the effectiveness of your DEET-based product has diminished. Dusk and dawn are typically the most active times for biting insects to bother people.

, Utilize your product label's instructions and remember its effectiveness ratings to know when you will probably have to apply DEET once again.

, Although DEET is considered safe to use on humans by the Environmental Protection Agency, you should always reduce and eliminate any DEET residue on your skin as soon as possible.

Prepare the tin.,
Decorate your tin.",How to Recycle Candy Tins,"


Convert tins into household storage devices. They can be used to hold screws, nails and other small hardware in a tool or utility area. They make great mini sewing kits or storage for buttons, needles, pins and other sewing items in a laundry or sewing room. They can also hold craft supplies, beads or pieces of crayon. Tins are also a good way to organize jewelry. In a purse, they can hold coins or credit cards.
Use candy tins to make homemade gifts. Because of their size, they make a great box for a gift card or for money. Use them to make stocking gifts like sewing kits, first aid kits or small craft supply boxes for kids.
Think of art projects that can be made with tins. Many mixed media artists use tins to create mini shadowboxes, layered with old digital photographs, images and words cut from books, old jewelry and other vintage goodies. Think about creating seasonal decorations or grouping the tins together for a larger piece.
Decide whether you want to try a more advanced project like etching or creating an electronic device. For example, etching the candy tins creates a one of a kind storage case. It involves scratching a design onto a tin and using saltwater and a battery charge to etch the tin. Tins can be altered into robots, music devices and other electronics.;
, Paint is the simplest way to cover the tin. Decoupage--covering the candy tins with fabric or paper--is another way to decorate them. Use scraps of fabric, gift wrap or book pages if you have them already. Decorate with ribbon and other fiber, buttons, old jewelry, glitter or confetti. For another option, use polymer clay to cover the tin.

, Wash it out to remove dust and old candy residue. Sand the surface. How much to sand depends on how you will decorate it. For etching, you'll need a smooth, plain surface. If you plan to reuse the tin by painting or covering with paper, just sand enough so that paint or glue will adhere to it.

, Add paper lining on the inside, if desired. Add wire if you choose to hang it on a wall.

It is safe to transport and hold an animal inside the covered Havahart trap for a few hours, as long as you continue to feed and water it. However, you should be prepared to transport the animal immediately to a vet or wildlife center upon trapping, or release the animal in a new area where food it eats and water are readily available (see Warnings about feral cats). Contact your local animal control agency beforehand if you're unsure of what to do after trapping. Ask them what will become of the animal after you trap it. (Generally, wild animals such as squirrels or raccoons can be relocated to a wildlife management area, but feral cats are often euthanized.) Make as many phone calls as you need so that you will have a plan for where to take the animal once it is caught. Also, never make plans to trap a mother animal, which will only guarantee a miserable and agonizing death for the babies.;
, Many traps exist on the market that treat animals with varying degrees of kindness. Experts generally agree that Havahart models are the most successful at catching animals and are regarded as the most humane traps available. They are well crafted, strong, and feature blunt trapping arms so they do not harm the creature. They are also regarded as inexpensive and low maintenance.
, You probably have a spot in mind as to where you would like to place your trap--where you have seen the animals. Consider the following when placing your trap:


Human traffic. Place the trap away from human traffic. Animals usually have certain areas in which they travel regularly, and they generally stay away from humans and locations they have recently been.

Pets. Place the trap away from pets. Keep your own pets inside and tell your neighbors to keep theirs inside over the time you have the trap set out. A family cat or dog is an animal too, and they probably will be attracted to a baited trap. This trap could be set off, perhaps capturing or injuring pets instead of the intended target. It's also possible that trapped animals could be injured or tortured by family cats or dogs.
Houses. It is not a good idea to place the trap underneath a house or deck. You may forget about the trap, or it may be hard to retrieve a trap with an animal inside of it from underneath a house.
Water. Often, animals stay close to water sources like springs, streams, rivers, and lakes. If you are having a hard time catching any animals, try locating a spot close to a water source. Watch for footprints in soft soil, and place traps along these routes in shaded, dark areas.
Animal hot spots. Place a trap where you have seen animals congregate. If many squirrels regularly congregate in your backyard, then that is a good place to locate the trap.

, Peanut butter is a good choice for an unknown mammal. Try some of these bait suggestions if you are trying to trap one of these common pests:Squirrels - Cereal, grains, nuts (especially peanuts), sunflower seeds, shelled corn, apples, mixed peanut butter and oatmeal, popcorn
Skunks - Canned fish (sardines), crisp bacon, cat food, bread crust coated with peanut butter
Raccoons - Fresh or canned fish, honey or sugar covered vegetables, watermelon, sweet corn, cooked fatty meat, crisp bacon, Marshmallows


, Cock the arming bar and fill the collection plate with a tablespoon of bait. Follow the instructions that came with your purchase. Keep in mind that the trap needs to be placed on fairly level ground for it to arm properly.

, This covering will calm the trapped animal by providing a sense of protection from predators and thus prevent crying out and struggling, actions which could attract predators or cause it injury.

, It is unwise and inhumane to leave the animal trapped without attention for more than a short period of time. Do not leave the vicinity of the trap until the animal is caught - it may be the wrong animal or it may struggle despite the cover and hurt itself.

Peel the label away from your coffee can.,
Punch holes around the sides of the can.,
Place a small candle into the coffee can lamp.",How to Recycle a Coffee Can1," Unless you want the finished candle holder to have its label displayed, peel the label away with your fingers. You can use dish soap and a scouring pad to remove any remaining adhesive from the coffee can.;
, For the candle's light to escape in decorative patterns, you will need to punch holes in a random pattern all around the coffee can. You can do this using an electric drill or by hammering a nail into the can to create each hole.

, After punching the holes in the can, you can place a candle into the lamp and light it. The coffee can's size will allow it to hold tea lights, votives, and small pillar candles comfortably. In low light, your coffee can lamp will project flickering star-like patterns onto your walls through the holes.

Lastly, cut two 8 inch lengths of the wire.

,
Attach the rails to create a channel for the door.,
Nail the side boards to the bottom board.,
Attach the back board.,
Prepare the top board.,
Attach the top board to the assembly.,
Prepare and place the door.,
Prepare the trigger dowel.,
Prepare the lever dowel.,
Set the trap.",How to Build a Box Trap," The items are: a hammer, small box of 8 penny (1 and ½ inch galvanized) nails, one 10 foot long pine (1 inch x 8 inch) wood plank, circular saw, jig saw, safety goggles, tape measure, pencil, speed or “T” square, drill, 1 inch paddle bit, wire (old phone cord would work), a wooden dowel (approximately broom handle width) 3 feet in length (long enough for a 18 inch and 11 inch sections), bait can, and some form of bait.;
, Using the circular saw, cut the 1 x 8 pine plank into: three lengths of 2 feet (bottom and side boards), 1 length of 22 inches (top board), one length of 9 inches (back board), one length of 10 inches (door board), four lengths of 1 inch (rail boards), and one length of 2 inches (fulcrum board).

,,, Using two of the three two foot lengths, attach the rails (four 1 inch length) to the front of the side pieces. This is done by first nailing the 1 inch length flush with the end of the side board but raised ¾ inches above the top, use at least two nails per rail. The second rail is spaced 1 inch from the initial rail and runs parallel to it. Using a speed-square will assist with correct spacing. Unlike the initial rail this second one will be flush with the top and bottom of the side board. The channel formed by the rails must have consistent one inch spacing to ensure the door slides properly. This should be repeated on the other side board.

, Lay the bottom board on its side so that the underneath portion of the board is facing the assembler. Lay the right side board, with rails facing up, parallel to the top/inside of the bottom board. The ends of the bottom and side board should be flush with one another. Nail the two boards together, making sure to drive no less than four nails through the bottom board into the right side board. Now, the left side board can be attached to the bottom. This is done by rotating the partial assembly 180 degrees. With the underneath portion of the bottom board still facing the assembler, lay the left side board, with the rails facing up, parallel to the bottom board. Make sure the rails of both sides are facing one another at the front of the trap and that the side and bottom form a 90 degree angle. Note that the ends of the side of the end of the side and bottom boards should be flush.

, Place the back end of the trap toward the assembler. Position the 9 inch length so that it is flush with the bottom and side boards, but uneven with the top leaving it ¾ inches above the top of the side boards. This will allow the top board to be flush with the back board once it is attached. Drive the nails through the back board into the edge of the side and bottom boards, using no less than two nails for each of the three boards.

, Place the 22 inch length top so that a hole, using the one inch paddle bit, can be drilled 4 ½ inches from the rear and three and ¾ inches from the side of the board. After drilling the hole, make sure the edges of the hole are smooth. A “V” shape notch is removed (cut) from the end of the fulcrum board by the jig saw. Then nail the non-notched end of the fulcrum board 10 ½ inches from the front of the top board; making sure that it is equal distance from each side and that the “V” notch is visible from the front and back of the top board.

, Place the top board on the assembly, making sure it is butted up against the back board and flush to the sides prior to attaching it. The hole in the top board will be closer to the back of the trap and the fulcrum is extended up. Then nail through the top board into the edges side boards, four nails for each of the sides. Two nails will then be driven through the back board into the edge of the top board.

, Using the 1 inch paddle bit, drill a partial hole 1 ½ inch from the top of the door (ten inch length), making sure the center is equal distance from each of the sides. The depth of the partial hole should be approximately ½ inch and should not completely penetrate the board. With the partially drilled hole facing inward slide the door into the rail channels, making sure the door smoothly slides up and down.

, Drill a hole, 1inch from the end of the trigger dowel, using an 1/8 inch bit; making sure the hole is equal distance from each side. Place one of the two wires through the hole and knot is on one end. A notch that goes halfway through the trigger dowel is cut 5 inches from the bait end and continues 2 inches toward the lever end. Make sure that the notch can catch onto the underside of the top board, but will easily be tripped.

, Drill a hole, using an 1/8 inch bit, 1 inch from the end of the lever dowel. Place the wire, previously run through the trigger dowel, through the lever dowel hole and knot the wire so the trigger and lever are closely connected; making sure the ends of the two dowels do not bind.

, A can containing bait is placed in the trap, directly beneath the trigger dowel hole. The trigger dowel is slid through the hole in the top of trap with the notch facing the front of the trap. The lever dowel is placed on the fulcrum notch and the end of the dowel is inserted into the door notch while the door is in the open position. At the same time, the notch of the trigger dowel must catch the underside of the top of trap. The trap is now ready to be used.

Begin adding the yarn to the can.,
Wind the yarn tightly around the can.,
Continue winding until you reach the top of the can.

,
Finish off the end part.,
Finished.",How to Make Yarn Can Art," Clean it out.


If it's a soda can, remove the top with a can opener.
If it's a grocery can, remove the label if it's a paper one, and remove the lid if not already taken off.
Take care to remove the top or lid so as to avoid leaving a jagged edge.;
, Be sure to keep the duct tape covering very smooth, without bumps or raised edges. This forms a neat surface for winding the yarn around.

, At this point, you have various fun options, including:


Use one single yarn color the entire way up the can.
Use a rainbow of colors, adding a new color length now and then as you wind the yarn on.
Use two tones of yarn in an even pattern.
Make a picture from the yarn in the center of the can. This will need to be added first, then the rest of the yarn is wound around this picture. Since this is very fiddly, it's best done as a project after you're used to making the yarn can the simpler ways.

, You'll be using it shortly.

, The yarn used can be scrap yarn or new yarn, as preferred. New yarn is probably easier to work with if you're doing the same color, all one length. Whatever you choose, the yarn needs to be in long lengths, to make it easier to wind around the can, unless you're making the picture design, in which case, you'll need to keep cutting the lengths to fit around the image.

, Tape the end of a yarn length to the bottom of the can. Leave it long.

, Keeping each line woven around the can closely tucked next to the previous line added, wind all the way up. Add more glue now and then, to keep the yarn neatly wound in place; it's up to you whether you add glue constantly or just now and then. The most important thing is to keep the yarn lines snug together.


If changing colors, do so seamlessly by twirling the end of the old piece into the new piece, then firmly gluing it down and beginning the winding process again.

,, Once you have reached the top of the can, snip the yarn off neatly. Be sure that there is no gap left afterward. Then, use the glue gun to pin down the yarn firmly in place.

, You now have a lovely yarn can piece of art that can be used to contain pencils, pens, bits and pieces or anything else you like.

Remove the label and paint your coffee can.,
Attach multiple coffee cans together if desired.,
Fill the coffee can cubbies with your favorite items.",How to Recycle a Coffee Can2," Coffee cans can also make inexpensive and elegant cubbies for holding pencils, office supplies, knitting supplies, and anything else you can think of. To tailor the aesthetic impact of your coffee can cubby, remove the label and paint the can your desired color.

, If you want to build an entire storage rack from the coffee cans (for example, for storing many skeins of yarn), you can attach them together. You can glue the sides of each coffee can to the next using a hot glue gun. Coffee can cubbies assembled in this way can even be mounted on the wall.

, These cubbies are great for storing pencils, pens, and scissors on a desktop. They are also excellent for storing knitting needles or yarn and for organizing paperclips, staples, and other small office supplies. They can even be used in the kitchen to organize different kinds of teabags or individual packs of sweeteners.

Decorate the sides of the coffee can.,
Affix the drum head to the coffee can drum.,
Fashion sticks for your coffee can drum.",How to Recycle a Coffee Can3," To recycle a coffee can in a kid-friendly project, you can make a small (and relatively quiet) toy drum. Begin by decorating the exterior of the can with your child in any way you want. Paint, construction paper, and stickers are all excellent options for decorating the drum.

, Cut a circle out of felt that is a bit larger than the opening of the coffee can. Secure this felt over the opening of the can using a rubber band. The felt forms the drum head of the drum - the surface that is struck when the drum is played.

, To play the drum, you'll need to improvise some drum sticks. Pencils or pens make adequate impromptu drum sticks, but you can make more sophisticated mallets by gluing foam balls to the ends of thin wooden dowels.

Create beer can creature wall art.,
Give your betrothed a bouquet of beer can flowers.,
Design beer can model transportation.,
Go for the gusto and create a full size beer can sculpture.",How to Make Beer Can Artwork," Whether you need to fill wall space in the den or want to simply display your affinity for beer, create creatures using an empty beer can.

Plot what creature you plan to make. During the planning phase you will also need to consider how many beer cans and extra accessories (i.e. crafting features, google eyes etc.) it might take to create your design.
Consider how you will morph the beer can to accommodate each area of the creature. What kind of tools will you need to create your creature? Perhaps you’ll need strong scissors, a brick to pound out the can and possibly a pair of work gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges.
Assemble and bond your creature together using either liquid nails or a staple gun. Lay out your pieces first before gluing them together. You may see other ways to design your creature as you lay it out versus what you’ve sketched on paper.;
, Why be ordinary and give your honey a bouquet of fresh flowers when you can create one, two or even an entire array of flowers from beer cans? They won’t wilt or die like fresh, plus they can symbolize a drink you both enjoy.

Cut off the top of the can. You won’t need the top so remove it first. Make a clean cut using either a pair of sharp scissors or a well sharpened knife. Be very careful not to cut your fingers.
Create the flower petals by cutting elongated oval shapes down the sides of the can. You may need multiple cans to create the petals.
Cut off the bottom of the can to be used as the middle of the flower. Pound out the can’s middle so it is smooth and round, removing any ridges or edges.
Create leaves by cutting out small elongated ovals from the sides of other beer cans. Use a stick or even a green ballpoint pen to etch veins into the leaves.
Find a stick in the yard or use a smooth crafting stick from the hobby store to act at the flower’s stem. Place a dab of glue on the back of your flower middle (the bottom of the can) and hold one end of the stick to the glue until it is fully bonded.
Add flower petals around the edges of your flower. Consider alternating sizes and label designs. You could have one side facing up donning the beer can label and the next could be the silver backside.
Glue leaves down the sides of the stick. Affix the leaves to the backside of the stick area and hold until bonded.

, Create model airplanes, trains and automobiles using beer can art. Because cans are so pliable you can mold and shape the beer cans to accommodate a variety of designs such as wheels, engines and airplane wings.

Create a blueprint for what you want to design. Approach your model car or plane the same way you would if you were to build it from any other material. Break down each section/piece and list what you will need (i.e. four wheels, the car body, the front dash etc.). Sketch out a rough design on paper for a better idea of what your design will become.
Gather supplies, which may include additional pieces such as a model propeller or wire that you could use to hang an airplane or helicopter.
Break down your beer cans and prepare for assembly. For example, you can make wheels from the bottoms of the can, the body from an entire can and/or wings or fins from cutting out the sides of a can. This is where you’ll need to truly use your imagination to build your vehicle.
Assemble the vehicle. In some cases you can slide cans together and press them together, however in most situations you’ll need some heavy duty Super Glue or liquid nails for adhesion.

, The sky is the limit when it comes to crafting with beer cans. Is there something missing in the front yard that perhaps a life size beer can sculpture could fix? Depending on the amount of beer you drink, you could design something that was take the neighbor’s breath away.

Consider the statement you want to make and where you’d like to maintain the sculpture. Would a sculpture of an eagle or a large cactus compliment your way of living or something more modern and Remember, cans will eventually rust so you’ll probably want to either maintain your sculpture indoors or underneath a covered patio.
Sketch out what you’d like to build. Perhaps it's a replica of the Eiffel Tower or a woodland creature; use a sketchpad to map out how your figure will look.
Gather supplies. If you are planning to create something big, you may need to tap into local college kids’ beer can supply as you will need hundreds upon hundreds of cans. Otherwise create your sculpture with the supply you currently maintain and then add any other pieces that will be vital to your sculpture.
Map out your location. Make sure your sculpture’s home is free and clear (as well as available to receive your sculpture). Consider cleaning off table tops or the floor to ensure you don't have dirt or grime forever trapped underneath your sculpture.
Create your masterpiece. Put creativity to the test by building the image you have in your mind and on paper. Make it permanent by using glue to adhere pieces together and build it from the ground up.

Choose a can.,
Wash out the can.,
Remove the lid from the soda can.,
Cut off the top portion of the soda can (optional).,
Place your pencils and pens in the can.",How to Make a Pencil Holder from a Can1," Save an old can that you no longer need. Choose a size and shape that you find pleasing, though make sure it is large enough to support the size and weight of pencils or pens. Make sure the can doesn’t have any damage or rust to avoid hurting yourself when handling the can.


Soda cans are made of a lightweight metal, making them easier to modify.Vegetable or sauce cans are made from a heavier metal. These will be sturdier, but harder to modify.;
, Use soap and water to thoroughly wash out the can you will be using for your pencil holder. Remove all traces of grease, food, or sugar, and allow to air dry.


If you are using a soda can for your pencil holder, you will need to either open the can to clean it or fill the can with soap, water and rice, and give it a good shake.
Leaving food in or on the can will hinder customization efforts that you make later!

, Use a can opener on the top part of the can to remove the entire lid featuring the tab. Cut as close to the edge of the can as possible to avoid leaving sharp, jagged edges. Safely dispose of the soda can lid.


If your can opening has sharp edges, use sandpaper to dull the edges.
Modeling clay or other putty substances can also be used to cover the sharp edges to prevent injury. This clay can be purchased or made at home with a few simple ingredients., Rather than removing the lid, cut around the top portion of the can to easily create an opening. Use standard scissors, tin snips, or a box cutter to cut through the aluminum.


The top edges of the can will be sharp after cutting. Use modeling clay or putty to cover these edges to avoid injury.
The brim of the can may also be folded inward to cover the sharp edges. Use heavy work gloves to avoid injury when handling the sharp edges., Once there is a large enough opening, you may store your pencils, pens, and other writing utensils in the can. Take care for top heavy pens, as they can tip the can over.


Place some loose change or other small heavy objects in the can to help prevent the can from tipping over.
Gluing a small piece of wood or cardboard to the bottom of the can will also help stabilize the can and prevent toppling. Use a polyurethane glue for a strong hold."
"
Empty and clean out an old can.,
Cut incisions in the can.,
Push the pencils through the can.,
Add some flair.",How to Make a Pencil Holder from a Can2," Save an aluminum can that you are finished with, or grab an old one out of your recycling bin. Make sure all of the food or liquid is out of the can. Give the can a good wash with soap and water to make sure it's clean.


Remember to use a soapy water and rice mixture to clean a soda can that you haven't removed the lid from.

, Use your scissors or box cutter to create small incisions around the can. Angle the incisions toward the base of the can. If using a can with harder aluminum, you may need to drill holes large enough for the pencils, as the metal will be too hard to push the utensils through.


Use a small hand drill to create cleaner holes in the can. Be careful to drill slowly, as you don't want to tear a large hole in the can. Soda cans in particular are easily damaged by excessive force., When the pencils are pushed through, they will need to sit in the can angled toward the bottom of the can. This allows a large number of pencils to be stored without offsetting the balance of the can.


Frequently inserting and removing pencils from the can may eventually wear down the can, the pencils, or both. Keep pencils or pens you are particularly attached to in a location that subjects them to less wear and tear.

, Placing silly straws, mini-umbrellas, or national flags among the pencils is a great way to introduce a little color to your pencil holder. Try stacking a second soda can pin cushion atop the first and make a multi-level pencil holder! Go for the world record of stacked cans!"
"
Paint your can.,
Cut patterns and designs into the cans.,
Paste paper designs on the can.,
Sew or knit a cozy.",How to Make a Pencil Holder from a Can3," Paint designs onto the can to customize your pencil holder. Acrylic paint is a great all-purpose medium for painting on various surfaces, and dries quickly, allowing you to continue to decorate your pencil holder.


Use a primer before applying paint to the can in order to ensure the paint adheres to the metal.Use acrylic spray paint to give your can a full, uniform coat for adding further designs.
The paint on your can will likely crack if the can is bent, so be careful once the paint has dried.

, Use a box cutter to cut various designs into the can. Hearts, diamonds, abstract patterns, or faces are all fun options for customizing your pencil holder.Avoid grabbing the can near these designs, as the holes created will have sharp edges.
Try marking the designs you will be cutting with stencils to help guide your cutting efforts.

, Draw some designs on a piece of paper and paste them on the can as decoration. You can also paste an entire sheet of plain paper onto the can as a canvas for additional paper decorations.


Cut your name out of paper, or another’s name if you are giving the pencil holder as a gift, and paste it onto the can to mark the can as yours.
Glue sparkles, felt, ribbon and other accoutrements to put the finishing touches on your design.

, A homemade cozy for your pencil holder can help bring some warmth to its appearance. Feel free to knit whatever design fits the room you’re placing the pencil holder in, or make multiple cozies to keep the style of the can fresh.If you used a soda can for your pencil holder, you can also purchase a regular cozy from the convenience store. These can at least give your pencil holder stability, if you aren’t concerned about the design.

Find a can that is no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) wide in diameter.,
Use the table below to calculate how far you will drill the hole for placement of an N type Female Chassis-mount connector.,
Drill a hole in the can at the correct position according to your calculation or the center rib of a Progresso Soup can.,
Widen the hole to accommodate the adapter.








,
Place the adapter in the hole and secure to the can.,
Attach a pigtail cable to the adapter (a pigtail is a wire that attaches the adapter to the computer's wifi card, note you must have a compatible wifi adapter to make this work).,
Connect the cantenna and wifi card with the pigtail or BNC connectors.








,
Tape cantenna to tripod or create a small, portable stand or clamp with a bit of thick wire that loops around the BNC connectors and can be easily removed and allows you to rotate the cantenna to find signals.








,
Aim at source and adjust to get the best signal.,
Finished.








",How to Make a Cantenna," Ideal diameter is 3.25 to 3.75 inches (8.3 to 9.5 cm). A Progresso Soup Can is a good start. Since these are DIRECTIONAL antennas, a longer can will increase range, but they decrease the angle of sweep. This helps eliminate interference, but requires you to point it more accurately. 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) long will improve signal strength (gain). You may be able to solder several cans together to improve performance.






;
, If you use a single Progresso Soup Can its easy; count the total number of ribs and punch the hole at exactly the CENTER RIB. One side is N-female for connecting the cable from your wireless equipment, and the other side has a small brass stub for soldering on wire. These can be found at electronics stores internet suppliers. The wire you solder should be exactly 1.21 inches (3.1 cm) tall (just a hair under 1 1/4 inches) sticking up inside the can. You may find soldering or using a small torch melts the plastic insulator in the connector. If so, remove the brass stem from the melted puddle of plastic, use a small torch to solder the wire into the brass stem, then wrap it the brass stem with 10 - 20 turns of black tape and re-insert it snuggly into the adapter, leaving the 1.21 inches (3.1 cm) of copper wire exposed.








, Since tin cans rip easily, a hole saw will make a mess. Use a small drill bit and then SLOWLY widen the hole slowly with a rat-tail file, a brad-point drill bit or hole saw held with pliers or vice grips, slowly working it back and forth. A power drill and a big bit will likely to destroy the can or make a poor hole.








,, Instead of drilling holes and screwing the adapter to the can, you can get a bit of rubber garden hose about 3/8 long, slip it over the outside end of the adapter and as you tighten the cable, the hose compresses against the can and locks the adapter in place.








, One problem with pigtails is the wires are very thin and they just don't last long. A reliable, long lasting alternative is to go to an electronic store and assemble 2 or 3 BNC or BNC reversed connectors, eliminating wire problems. This makes the antenna easily detachable from the USB wifi card with a simple twist-lock.








,,, This should be much stronger than the whip antenna you had before. To improve the signal even more - much more - cut a 2 foot (0.6 m) wide by 1 foot (0.3 m) high sheet of concrete lathing screen with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or smaller holes and curve it slightly to form a parabolic dish, similar to a TV satellite dish. Instead of pointing the can at the signal source, point it at your screen which points at the signal so the back of the can points at the signal. It takes a bit of adjusting to get the curve of the screen and distance to the can exactly right. You can find formulas for calculating the exact focal point or use trial and error since you will see your signal gain double or even triple when you get the curve and distance just right. You can then make a wooden or aluminum frame to hold everything together in the right position. You can also use a real satellite dish and place the cantenna at the end of the arm at the position the TV antennas (the horn) usually go.

Before we start, let's get an understanding of what happens when we strike an arc with welding electrodes.,
Prepare The Bevels and Lands

Prepare to clean the steel plates by donning your safety equipment, welding helmet, welding gloves and a dust mask for particles.,
Set The Root Gap

When the bevel has been applied to both steel plates, turn them face down, set the root gap (I use the metal stub of the welding electrode I'm welding with) and employ spot welding to tack them into position.

,
Position The Steel Plates

Now that the plates have been cleaned, beveled and tacked, clamp the steel plate in a position of comfort and prepare to weld the root pass.,
Preheat The Steel Plates

It is never a bad Idea to preheat, in fact, almost every welding job I perform professionally demands a preheat temp of 400 degrees and up.,
Run The Root Pass

Extra care should be taken when running the root pass because If the root pass has good fusion and is watertight, the rest of the welding is just formality especially when welding pipe.,
Run The Fill Passes

Run the welds in steps starting with the root pass, the intermediate fill pass and the final fill.","How to Weld With a ""Buzz Box"""," The size of the welding rod, amperage and plate thickness determine weld fusion (adhesion) initially. In other words, a large diameter welding rod on a thin steel plate will blow right through it. On the flip side, a small diameter welding rod on thick steel plate may not start the arc and, if you do, the weld will not fuse to the steel but simply lay on the surface of the steel plate. This is where preheat comes to your aide. Preheat allows you to use small welding electrodes with your buzz box on thick steel plate.
, ""Junk In, Junk Out"", is exactly what you will get if you do not prepare the steel plates for welding. Never weld through trash, rust or scale if you have the means to clean the steel. The bevel should approximate 45 degrees with a 1/8"" land (flat) at its base.

,, Gather your welding supplies, gas and torch for preheating, welding electrodes, stinger and your Buzz Box.

, You will be amazed at how easily the arc strikes and how well the welding rod burns, improving welding quality significantly. Bear in mind, once the steel has reached preheat temp, this temp must be maintained throughout the procedure till all welding is finished.

, Make sure the joint is good and hot and you are comfortable during the weld. Comfort means control.

, As you step up the welds, pay particular attention to tying in the sides, this is the strength of your welding.
The ""Cap"" passes are where you let your skills shine. They can be as few as one or as many as it will take to cover the filled joint you just welded. This is your signature so take your time and get them straight and the proper height. The grand finale' of this episode is to turn the plate over, grind out the root opening down to flawless metal, preheat the steel plate, fill the joint and run the caps, you're done.

Figure out how much spice you need to store.,
Purchase small metal tins.,
Choose the right magnets.,
Rough up the tin and the magnets.,
Glue the magnets onto the tins using strong glue.,
Label the tins.,
Tighten the lid, if necessary.",How to Make Magnetic Spice Tins1," Gather your spices together and look at what you need to store. A beginning cook may only have a few different types, while a more ardent cook can have dozens.

Take stock of how much you presently have, as well as what you would like to buy more of once you have the right amount of space.
Make a note of which spices you use more often. Spices that you use more often can be stored in larger quantities.;
, Only buy food-grade tins, since other metals may affect the flavor or quality of the spices. You can buy tins with transparent plastic fronts, but spices can be damaged by prolonged exposure to light.

Most ground spices can fit inside round 2 oz. (60 ml) tins, while whole spices should usually be stored in round 4 oz. (125 ml) tins.
Ground spices that you use frequently can be stored in 4 oz. (125 ml) tins instead of 2 oz. (60 ml) tins.
Long spices, like cinnamon sticks and vanilla beans, should be stored in rectangular tins that hold 4 oz. (125 ml) or more.

, Common craft store magnets lose strength as time passes, but they are relatively safe around electronics. Rare earth magnets are very strong magnets that will not lose their strength, but they will cause damage to electrical appliances. If you do not plan to keep your spices near any electronics, rare earth magnets are the way to go. If there is a chance that you may position your spice rack near a sensitive electrical device, however, a standard craft store magnet would serve your purpose better. Just be aware of the fact that you may eventually need to change the magnets out., Rub steel wool in the center bottom of each tin and on one side of each magnet. By roughing the material in this manner, you make it easier for the glue to hold together., Most tins will need at least two small magnets to support the weight of each spice, but heavier spices may need three magnets or more. Light spices, like dried leaves, may only need one magnet, especially if you are using rare earth magnets. Super glue usually works as a bonding agent, but you could also consider mixing together epoxy and epoxy hardener for an even more secure bond.

If using super glue, simple apply a dot of glue to the roughed up back of the magnet and the rough patch on the back of the tin. Press the two dots together and allow the glue to dry.
If using epoxy, mix the epoxy and hardener together with a small stick. Place the magnet in the epoxy glue, coating it with enough of the bonding agent so that extra epoxy will be squeezed out as you press the magnet against the tin. Press the magnet against the roughed patch on the back of the tin and let dry.

, You can print out labels from a label maker or printer, or you can get plain white labels and write the name of each spice by hand. If you do not have self-adhesive paper, you can apply labels made from thick matte paper to the front or back of the tin with craft glue., Check each lid to make sure that it is secured to the tin. If it feels a little loose, you can usually remedy this problem but placing a small piece of masking tape to the inside edge of the tin's lid. The added resistance is often enough to prevent the lid from slipping."
"
Purchase a large sheet of aluminum.,
Coat the aluminum to prevent it from rusting.,
Attach two long strips of Velcro to the back of the sheet.,
Attach the connecting sides of the Velcro to the wall.",How to Make Magnetic Spice Tins2," The sheet should be large enough to hold all of your completed spice tins, and if you plan on expanding your collection of spices, you may want to get a sheet that can fit a few extra tins.

A sheet of stainless steel is, in theory, the best option, but stainless steel sheets can be expensive. An aluminum sheet will be more cost effective.

, The downside of aluminum is that it can rust inside of a moisture-filled room like the kitchen. Purchase a sealing spray or an anti-rust spray from a home improvement store to prevent the sheet from getting damaged. Follow the directions on the product's label to coat the entire metal sheet.

Note that if you opted for a stainless steel sheet, this step is not necessary.

, The advantage of using Velcro is that it does not damage the wall and can be removed more easily if something goes wrong. The wider the strips, the better, since wider strips will have more holding power than narrow ones. Attach the Velcro strips along the entire length of the top and bottom, fixing them in place with super glue or a similarly strong adhesive., Use a ruler or tape measure to make sure that the Velcro strips are spaced the exact same distance apart from one another as they are on the back of the metal sheet, so that the connecting strips line up. Do not attach the Velcro to the wall using super glue, since using such a strong adhesive defeats the point of having a removable hanging device. Instead, use heavy-duty craft glue that is strong but can be removed with a solution or powerful force."
"
Find metal rulers.,
Attach a strip of Velcro to the back of each ruler.,
Attach the connecting side of Velcro to the desired surface.",How to Make Magnetic Spice Tins3," Rulers that are entirely composed of metal work well, as do wooden rulers with metal strips. Make sure that the metal used in the ruler is magnetic by practice sticking a magnet to it.

If you only have a few spices, one ruler might be enough. For slightly larger collections, use more rulers.

, Since this rack and the small number of spices it can hold will be fairly light, you can probably get away with using strong craft glue instead of more permanent bonding agent. Cut the strip so that it covers the length of the ruler., Use craft glue to adhere it. The surface you choose is a matter of convenience more than anything else. You can choose a small patch of wall, like the wall under a cupboard or behind the sink, or you can even use the inside of a cabinet door or the side of the cabinet itself. Avoid places that get too warm, however, since spices can be damaged by prolonged heat."

For small votive candles, a little tuna can will do the trick. However for a substantial planter, a large can of crushed tomatoes might be more appropriate.


Have supplies such as dirt, plants, candles, glass holders, etc. on hand before you begin the project.;
, Ideally an empty tuna can works well, however small soup or other stouter cans will do the trick.


Remove the food and then wash and rinse well. Make sure you use hot, soapy water when cleaning out the can and then dry thoroughly. You want the can to be completely dry so you avoid having it rust.






Remove the can label. Depending on the label you can either wash, peel or rub it away.

,,









Shielded metal arc welding is also known as SMAW, or stick electrode.
Gas tungsten arc welding is also known as GTAW.
Flux cored arc welding is also known as FCAW.
Keyhole gas tungsten arc welding is known at K-TIG.
Gas metal arc welding is also known as GMAW. This process is divided into two differing methods: short circuit transfer and spray transfer.

,









In some instances, such as SMAW, an inert shielding gas isn't necessary. The other methods vary from argon to helium to a combination of gases in varying proportions.

,









If both metals to be fused are the same, the base metal should mirror the composition of those base metals. If the metals differ, the filler metal will have to be picked according to which is least likely to crack and which is most compatible with the base metal.

,









The cleaning process eliminates the chance of oxides forming on the base metal. The entire base metal should be gently brushed with a stainless steel wire brush, removing existing oxides and burrs.
Wear gloves so you don't transfer oils from your hands onto the stainless steel.

,









If the stainless steel is austenitic, preheating is not necessary. Preheat when dealing with martensitic or ferritic stainless steel. Also preheat if the stainless steel is particularly thick or high in carbon.

,,









The rapid cooling down of the stainless steel can cause a lot of internal stress, which contributes to cracking. Post-heat is particularly necessary when joining thick pieces of metal.

, Remove by grinding or using a chipping hammer.









SMAW and FCAW are both prone to leaving slag residue.

The welding helmet is possibly the most important piece of safety equipment because it provides protection from any sparks for both your eyes and skin. It also protects from ultraviolet rays that can damage your vision.


A welding jacket will protect you from flash fire and electric arc.
Heavy, flame-resistant gloves should also be worn to protect arms and hands from burns and scratches. Choosing material such as leather will also help protect against electric shock.Don’t forget to protect your feet with heavy, leather boots. Having metatarsal guards over the laces can protect your ankles and upper foot from falling objects.;
, Welding can give off dangerous fumes. Always be sure that adequate ventilation is available, especially in confined areas. Keep exhaust near the arc while changing the filter frequently to keep fumes to a minimum.If possible, use a smoke extractor welding gun. If you’re using a semi-automatic welder gun, extra equipment may be used to exhaust the fumes towards the arc.An approved respirator should always be used within confined areas to protect your lungs from fumes., Electric shock kills individuals every year. Be sure to wear insulated boots and never wear gloves with holes. Welding machinery should always be properly grounded, and equipment should be turned off when not in use.To help protect yourself further, always replace repaired parts in a timely manner and only weld in dry conditions. This includes wearing dry clothing. , In order to take extra precaution, consider the location of your compressed gas cylinders. They should be away from arcs and excessive heat, as well as fastened to a sturdy surface to prevent falling. The cylinders must also not be grounded to prevent electrocution.Remember: Nobody regrets having fire fighting equipment. Having a fire extinguisher could save you or your family from death., When welding, only clean metal should be used. Do not weld materials that have been painted or previously plated.These metals can release excess fumes. If you know a metal has been in contact with a hazardous material, do not weld unless they have been properly cleaned. Hazardous materials can be life threatening and release excess fumes.If you must weld a painted or plated copper, take care with ventilation. Use your respirator and weld in an open area., When welding copper, try to use oxygen-free or P-deoxidized. Oxygen-free copper will allow copper to retain the original bronze color after welding, by preventing oxidation. This alloy generally has less than 0.02% oxygen. P-deoxidized copper contains low amounts of oxygen but tends to have up to 0.05% phosphorus and 0.05% arsenic, which can release fumes. Oxygen-free copper is the most commonly available and readily weldable copper., While copper alloys can be welded, each alloy will weld differently from another. An impurity can cause different relativities of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, or electrical conductivity. Copper alloys should only be used by a more experienced welder.For example, look at copper-zinc alloys. Zinc reduces the weldability in copper. It also contains a low boiling temperature resulting in toxic vapors that can be produced upon welding., Depending on if you are using TIG (tungsten inert gas) or MIG (metal inert gas), and the thickness of your copper, you will need to adjust the ratio of your gas and temperature. As a general rule of thumb, copper under 2.0 mm should have argon gas and up to 160 amps applied.If the copper is thicker, you will need to adjust the gas and amp by applying helium and upping the amp. Look online or welder’s handbook to determine the best ratio for your copper.


If the welding isn’t going smoothly, try using 100% helium gas. It has a higher power compared to Argon, which allows for more heat to be applied to your copper., Since copper has a high thermal conductivity, high heat and preheating is necessary at thicknesses of over 0.01” (2 mm). Preheating is always measured in degrees and can be anywhere from 50 degrees Fahrenheit to 752 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius-400 Celsius ).To preheat, simply insert your copper into a furnace until the desired temperature increase has been found.


Preheating allows the metal to cool slower after welding which works to produce a finer weld. This also reduces the risk of cracking., Once your safety gear is on and you’re ready to go, initiate the arc. Hold the arc steady for 2-3 seconds until the puddle appears. When welding with copper, the arc should be at approximately 70 degrees to the copper.


An arc is a shooting line of electricity created between the electrode and the material you’re welding, copper., As soon as the puddle has appeared, gently apply a small amount of filler through the arc to weld the metals together.Apply the filler by gently probing it into the pudding as the arc welds the copper together. The filler will liquify and mix in with the two copper, helping the metals weld together.


Your choice of filler rod will be dependent upon the type of welding you are doing, however, it should always be a copper or copper alloy rod., The longer your puddle is present, the more time the copper has to oxidize. This can prevent a clean weld, so move quickly to get the welding completed., Cooling too fast can mean your weld will break or crack. Slowed cooling is assisted by the preheating of copper. Allowing the copper to come to a heightened temperature before welding will keep the fresh weld warm. If welding indoors, it is acceptable to let the weld air-cool if it has been preheated.When welding in cold temperatures, you may to insulate your freshly welded copper to prevent it from cracking. The simplest way to slow cooling is covering the copper with a fibreglass blanket. Another method is stacking sandbags around the copper to help prevent heat loss.Never splash water or ice on a weld. If you don’t have time to patiently wait for the heat to dissipate slowly, don’t weld at all."

Prepare the lead for welding.,
Apply flux to the areas being joined.,
Melt the lead.,
Apply solder.,
Connect the old and new pieces of lead.,
Wipe the area with glass paper you have coated with flux.",How to Weld Lead,"


Before lead can be welded, it must be cleaned. This is especially important if you are replacing an existing piece of lead, such as an old pipe. Use a sharp knife to remove any debris or crusty lead from the area where the lead will be welded. In addition, you may want to consider using a piece of steel wool to completely polish the area.;
,


Flux is a waxy acid paste which helps to clean and secure two pieces of lead together. Typically, flux is applied with a small, clean, dry paintbrush. Carefully brush a small amount of flux onto both of the pieces of lead that are to be welded together. Apply the flux rather liberally for best results.

,


Once you've coated the end of the lead that you'll join to another piece with the flux, you will need to heat it with a blow torch. Melting lead increases its ability to be connected to other fixtures.
Keeping the blow torch at a horizontal angle, apply the flame to the end of the piece of lead. For best results, constantly move the heat source back and forth across the area being heated.
Unlike other types of metals, lead can melt quite rapidly. When direct heat is applied, lead can actually become the consistency of very soft butter. In contrast, when a blow torch is moved over and across the area to be heated, as described above, the area simply ""sweats,"" and become soft and manageable.

,


Once the lead has been softened, solder must be added to aid in joining it to the new piece of lead. Use a pallet knife to carefully apply the solder to the softened piece of lead. Make sure that the solder is on all sides for the best connection.

,


Once the solder has been added, you can carefully connect the new piece of lead to the appropriate area on the old product. Make the connection as accurate and secure as possible to maintain the life expectancy of the product.

,


As a final step in the lead welding process, it is important to wipe over the newly-created connection with a piece of glass paper coated with flux. This not only helps secure the connection even further, but polishes the area, providing a more professional appearance.

Start your welder.,
Heat the welding surface.,
Lower the rod to the heat.,
Allow the weld to cool.,
Clean the weld.",How to Weld Bronze," This is an arc welder. It uses an electrical current to weld. Your machine should have a tungsten electrode and a chamber for shielding gas. These can be found at local hardware stores.



Oxyacetylene torches are an option for producing a weaker weld in the process known as brazing, which shouldn’t be confused with welding. It follows the same steps as TIG bronze welding but melts only the filler rod, not the surface metal.;
, The shielding gas is what protects the material you are welding from the environment. Oxygen and water vapor getting into your project will weaken the weld. The gas you’ll use is argon, possibly combined with some amount of helium depending on the depth of the weld. The cylinder that contains the gas fits into the chamber on your welder.Pure argon is used for welds up to two millimeters thickness. The thicker the weld, the more helium you’ll want in the gas.

, The filler rods are what you’ll use to create the weld. For bronze welding, you’ll use a bronze rod, but these rods come in varieties with differing amounts of copper, aluminum, and other metals. Ideally, you want to match the composition of the rod you use to the metal you’re welding and the thickness of the weld you need.For example, a bronze rod with 10% aluminum is good for close-fitting joints, but a bronze rod with 7% tin is good for welding dissimilar and unknown metals.Welding rods are thicker than brazing rods. Brazing rods look very narrow because they’re used to leave only a line of bronze on metal.

, Flux is a substance that cleans metal, protects it, and facilitates heat transfer. When using a TIG welder, flux isn’t necessary to do the welding, but you may still wish to use it for cleaning. Choose a flux that matches the metals in the objects and rods you are welding.If you are using an oxyacetylene torch, you’ll need flux to protect metal against oxides.

, Welding should only be started once your skin is protected. Wear a mask to avoid acids, welding odors, sparks, and stray fragments. Underneath, wear a welding suit that covers your arms and legs. Put on gloves before starting any torches.


Weld in a well-ventilated area to avoid fumes coming from the gas, heat, and metal.

, To get a good weld, the surface of the metal you’re using has to be free from substances such as oxides, grease, and oil. Use a degreasing solution first from a local hardware store to remove the grease and oil first. Rust and scale can be removed by pickling, soaking the metal in a compatible strong acid such as hydrochloric acid. Use an abrasive such as an emery cloth to remove dirt.Rinse the metal in warm water to remove leftover acid and debris before you weld.

, If using flux, use a brush to coat the spot where the weld will happen. The flux looks like a paste and should be spread evenly along the surface. Coat the filler rod too or dip it into the flux. Cover it completely with the flux.


The bigger the welding piece and rod, the more flux you’ll need in order to get more heat.

, If you’re using a TIG welder, set it to a low current, about 80-95 amps. Halve the current for brazing. An AC (alternating current) setting is good for keeping the oxide out when using aluminum bronze, but otherwise a DC (direct current) is a common choice.A DC current heats up faster and needs to be restarted less.

, Start your torch or welder and bring the heat close to the surface. The metal will have a higher melting point than the filler rods, but still avoid pointing the heat directly at the surface. Keep the torch or welder moving, causing the metal to heat up evenly. Look for the metal to change colors, such as to a dull red or orange.Metal expands in heat. This makes the filler material join to it more completely.

, Hold the torch or welder at an angle so that it strikes the bottom of the rod. A little heat should reach the metal you are welding in order to keep it warm. Move the rod along the surface as the filler material pools and forms the weld.Monitor the surface for an even distribution of heat. If you used flux, the flux will change colors and disappear when it gets hot. Your filler will move towards the hottest areas.

, Turn off your torch and put away what’s left of your filler rod. Let the weld set. The weld should be solidified before you attempt to clean it.

, If you used flux, you need to make sure all of it is gone or else it will corrode the metal. Rinse the welded metal in hot water while it is still hot, if you can. Use a wire brush to remove stubborn scales. For oxide formed during welding, repeat the process of pickling the metal in an acid bath, such as hydrochloric acid. Rinse off the acid when done.Remember to keep wearing protective gear to shield against damaging acid.

TIG (tungsten inert gas) welder. This type of welder uses a tungsten electrode and an inert gas to shield the welding area. The precision achieved with this type of welder is crucial when working with aluminum, especially thin pieces.

TIG welders are expensive, so look into rental possibilities. Contact a local welding supply store or home hardware outlet and inquire about rental possibilities.
It is possible to weld aluminum with other welding processes, such as MIG welding, but TIG welding is the most painless method and is well-suited for beginners.



Aluminum filler rod. This is the material that will bond the two pieces. Try to avoid using rusty or dirty filler rods, as these will lead to weaker welds.

A canister of argon gas for use as shielding. Pure argon is a cost effective gas solution. 3% helium can be added to increase arc stability.

Gas needs to be acquired from authorized gas dealers. Most welding supply stores will be able to provide gas or refer you to an outlet that can.

;
, Welding requires a bevy of personal protective equipment. Make sure to wear a heavy welding helmet and a pair of thick gloves (the thicker the better). You will need to wear a shirt with long sleeves made from a thick fabric; TIG welding produces a large amount of ultraviolet radiation, and if you weld in short sleeves you will get burns along your arms.


Try to find a shirt that is thick, 100% cotton.
Your welding gloves should be insulated and fire-resistant.
Try to use a helmet with a lens that automatically darkens during the welding process. The lens should be rated at 10-13 shade.
Make sure that your pants do not have cuffs that can catch flaming material.
Keep a fire extinguisher easily accessible in case of any stray sparks.

, Over time, aluminum forms a thin coat of aluminum oxide on its exterior, which melts at a much higher temperature than aluminum. So, before welding any piece of aluminum (even a brand new piece), you have to clean away the aluminum oxide.


Spray the joints with acetone. Rinse the work piece in water, and then allow it to dry thoroughly. Scrub the aluminum with a stiff brush with stainless steel bristles to finish the cleaning process.
The welder itself will clean the metal as welds, but this is often not sufficient to remove all contaminants.

, A dirty filler rod can contaminate the weld just as easily as a dirty work piece. Use an abrasive cleaning pad to ensure that the rod is contaminant free.

, For practice, keep the torch unlit to save metal. Using the base of your gloved hand on the table for support, hold the torch with a slight angle tilting back, about 10°. Hold the tip of the tungsten about 1/4"" away from the aluminum.


If you pull the tip too far away, it will cause the arc to spread too much and the weld will become difficult to control.

, With the torch in proper position, practice moving your hand along the path that you will be welding. Make sure to practice with gloves on to simulate the amount of effort required. For small welds move your entire hand, instead of just the fingers.

, You will lead the weld with the filler rod, which should be held at about a 90° angle to the torch tip. The torch should always be pushed and not dragged.


If the filler and the tip come into contact, your weld will be contaminated and lose structural integrity.

, Aluminum is much easier to weld when the work is already much hotter than room temperature. When welding thick pieces of aluminum, welding without preheating can lead to a very weak, shallow bond.


You can heat the work piece by putting it directly in an oven, or you can use a gas torch to apply heat to the heat sink that the work is clamped to. This will distribute the heat throughout the work piece.
Aim for a temperature of about 350°F (176°C).

, TIG welders will be unforgiving if the joint is not fitted very tightly; you will be left with gaps in the joint. Make the work pieces fit together as tightly as possible by filing them before clamping them together.

, Aim to use about 1 amp per 0.001 inch (0.025 mm) of the work piece's thickness. It is a good idea to set the welder's amperage to higher than your expected need and then tone the current back with the foot pedal.

, Begin by extending the tungsten electrode no more than the diameter of the torch’s nozzle. For example, if you are using a 1/4"" wide nozzle, your tungsten tip should extend no more than 1/4"" from the nozzle. Tap the electrode tip against the work piece and then pull it away about 1/8 inch (3 mm). Use the foot pedal to create the electrical arc.

, Melt the work piece until you have an adequately sized puddle. Add just enough of the filler rod to fill in the joint, and then move to the next portion of the weld. Continue until the entire joint is welded properly.


As you weld, heat will increase throughout the work piece. Use your foot pedal to lower the amperage as you go to maintain control of the puddle.

, Slowly push the puddle that the torch creates down the joint, adding filler as you go. Move at an even pace to keep the puddle a consistent size.

, This includes a welding helmet (shade #10 or higher), welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt, pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses.


DO NOT wear tennis shoes, frayed clothes, pants with cuffs, a t-shirt, a shirt with open pockets, or sleeveless shirts.

, Remove all flammable material and find a good surface to weld on. Although you can put the ground connection right on the piece you are welding, most shops have a large metal workbench that the ground is hooked up to.


If there are other people present, set up welding curtains around the work area. This will protect them from UV damage.

, Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should most likely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted for metal thickness and electrode diameter.

, DCEP (direct current electrode positive) sets the arc to go from the metal to the electrode, heating the metal more. DCEN (direct current electrode negative) has the reverse effect. For stick welding, DCEP will give your weld more penetration. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding, depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.


Electrodes used for DCEP are E6010, E6011, E6013, E7014, E7018, and E7024. AC (alternating current) electrodes are E6011, E6013, E7014, and E7018AC.
E6010 and E6011 are especially useful for rusted, painted, or dirty metal that you can’t clean.
E6013 is an all-purpose electrode that is great for projects where the joints fit poorly.

, This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be welded with a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible.


Use acetone to clean oils off the metal, especially aluminum.
DO NOT use a chlorinated solvent, as the reaction when heated with a welder can kill you instantly.
Just because the metal is shiny, doesn’t mean it is clean. Use a hard grinding disc to remove the layer of mill scale and get down to the bare metal. This is most applicable to steel.

, Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely and firmly held together.

, This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up or striking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes the electricity to jump from the electrode to the metal.


Most modern welding helmets allow you to see clearly until you strike the arc, and then darken automatically to protect your eyes from UV damage. Some older or cheaper helmets just use a tinted lens that is too dark to see through unless welding. In this case, you should find where you want to start welding and flip the helmet down with your other hand, then strike the arc.

, When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electrode and instead watch the pool of molten metal. To create a good pool, you should stay where you started for a second or two before moving.


The arc gap should be no wider than 1/8"" from rod tip to metal. This gap dimension should be maintained by feeding or gently pushing the electrode toward the molten weld puddle. If the gap gets too wide, it will lead to excessive spatter.

, Keep the electrode at an angle a few degrees shy of 90°. Don't travel too fast; as a general guide you want to use about an inch of electrode for each inch of weld. When moving the weld pool, you can go in a straight line (a stringer bead) or move around in small circles.


It is important to maintain a constant arc length, or distance from the tip of the electrode to the metal. This can be hard at first since the electrode is constantly burning down.
Continue moving the pool towards the end of the metal. Again, make sure your travel speed and arc length are steady.

, Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to cool. The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.

, Slag is a residue left from the welding process. During the weld, the slag protects the hot metal from contaminants. The slag covering does not cool at the same rate as the weld bead, which can cause the slag to pop off the weld. Use the chipping hammer to break the slag off the weld.


Safety glasses should be worn while welding so that when the shield is raised the eyes are protected.
Tap the slag only hard enough to loosen the slag and avoid putting hammer marks in the new weld.
Use the wire brush to clean the weld. Remove as many excess particles as possible, especially if you are going to do another pass.

, A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. However, practice changes this. Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.

, If this is only practice, dipping the metal in water will cool it faster. Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structural welds to cool by air instead.

If they know they can get food from you, they will gather on your lawn.Human food is not healthy for geese. Even if the geese are in a public place, such as a park, refrain from feeding them.Geese are easily domesticated, especially if they are getting most of their food from you.You may want to construct signage in your area letting others know not to feed the geese.;
, Geese will feed on grass as well as garbage. Make sure you dispose of your garbage properly, or keep it where geese cannot access it. If you have Kentucky Bluegrass planted in your lawn, consider replacing it with another grass.Changing grasses may only work if there is another source of food for the geese. Geese will eat most short grasses and legumes if it is all that is available.You may have to treat your grass with a chemical repellent, such as anthraquinone, which triggers digestive irritation in geese. There are several goose repellents available, many of which contain Methyl anthranilate, a chemical that makes grass taste bad to geese., Geese like to feed on young grass shoots. By growing your grass taller, at least 6 inches, you may be able to get the geese to feed somewhere else.Let your grass grow taller in the winter, and limit the amount of watering and fertilizing you do in the spring.If you have a pond on your property, let the grass grow up to 20 inches to prohibit geese from gathering around it. Let the grass grow several feet across the property. Your property will look shaggy, but the geese will likely search for another nesting area.Geese prefer open spaces where they can see predators and feel safe. Tall grasses disrupt this feeling of safety., Border collies and other herding breeds can be trained to scare geese away from an area. The geese will perceive the dog as a predator and may be convinced to leave the area for good.Only dogs that have been specially trained by a handler should be used to scare geese away.Do not let the dogs catch or harm the geese. If not specially trained, the dogs may cause the geese to re-locate to the water, where the dog will not pose a real threat.If the geese are nesting or raising young, do not attempt to scare them away with a dog., There are several products on the market solely for the purpose of scaring geese, such as fake alligator heads or plastic dead geese. Geese will eventually get used to these devices, but they may buy you some time to plan a more permanent solution.Cutouts of dogs or coyotes may work better in an area where geese have already learned to fear these animals.Keep cutouts moving by placing them on a swivel. The wind will cause them to appear more lifelike to the geese. Move the cutouts around your property to maximize the effect., Sonic repellents can be effective at moving geese away from an area, but only for a short period of time. Most sonic repellents come equipped with a timer and make use of a recorded goose ""alarm"" call. When the geese hear the alarm, they flee.Like decoys, sonic repellents may only work as a temporary solution. Geese can get used to loud noises rather quickly. Sonic repellents are much more effective if the geese associate the noise with a mobile threat, such as a dog or a person., A humane way to prevent a growing flock of geese is a practice known as ""addling."" Goose eggs are treated with corn oil or removed from the nest entirely at the earliest stage of development.Addling prevents geese from tending flightless goslings, and limits the number of geese in an area.You must be properly trained to addle eggs. There are courses available online to guide you through the process.You must register with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before addling eggs. Some states require special permission aside from registering with the U.S.F.W., Geese nest near ponds and other bodies of water where they can have a good view of the area. Search near fence lines and other human-made barriers.Geese often return to their nesting places from the previous year. Keep records of nest locations to make finding nesting areas easier.Geese build oval nests out of vegetation, mulch, and other similar materials. Goose feathers on the ground may be a sign that a goose nest is close by.Don't approach a nest alone. When approaching a goose nest, it is important to work in small teams of 3-4. Geese will actively, and aggressively, defend their territory., Coating eggs that are young enough (less than 14 days old) with corn oil prevents air from passing through the shell to the embryo.If you know the eggs to be older than 14 days, it is no longer humane to coat them in corn oil.If a goose egg floats in water, it is past the 14 day limit. Return the goose egg to the nest. Do not dry the egg off as this can disrupt the protective outer layer of the shell., Another way to addle eggs is to remove them from the nest within the 14 day incubation time. Dispose of eggs according to the guidelines provided by the U.S.F.W.Your state may have other requirements for disposing of goose eggs.Consuming goose eggs is illegal, as is trading, buying, or selling.Once the eggs have been removed, you can scatter the nesting material to discourage geese from using the nest again."

Understand the metal you are working with.,
Set up your welding machine.,
Prepare the metal to be welded.,
Grind away the zinc coating at the site of the weld.,
Choose an appropriate rod.,
Make sure you have plenty of fresh air while welding.,
Trial weld a small piece of the same metal you are welding together to practice.,
Go ahead and weld your metal.,
Clean the slag and zinc oxide (a light grey to white powder residue along the weld) between each pass and after your are finished, then grind the weld smooth, if required.

,
Coat the weld with a zinc rich primer after the metal has cooled and been cleaned.",How to Weld Galvanized Steel," Galvanized steel has a zinc coating or plating to protect it from corrosion. There are two basic types of galvanizing, and for welding purposes, some minor, but significant differences. These are:


Electroplated galvanize has a (generally) thinner zinc coating, which will allow for a cleaner weld with less burn off and splatter.
Hot dipped galvanized steel has a thicker plating, since the steel has actually been submerged in molten zinc. This coating will burn away during welding, but will leave a dirtier weld and weld area, and require slightly more amperage for sufficient penetration.;
, For most purposes, a 150 amp AC SMAW or arc welder will weld galvanized steel. You will need to set up the amperage according to the thickness of the metal and the diameter of your rods. A 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) 6011 rod will run about 90-110 amps, smaller rods, slightly lower amperages, larger rods, higher.

, Assuming you are joining two pieces, fit the parts to be welded so there is a minimum gap. Grind a weld prep, or bevel on edges of metal over 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick to recieve the filler metal during the weld and to insure full penetration.

, This is helpful in striking and maintaining a steady arc, but isn't critical if you are dealing with a thin galvanized coating and using appropriate rods. Still, since the galvanized coating will be burnt away during the weld anyway, there is no real harm in removing it prior to welding if it is practical.

, For coated metal like galvanized steel, a 6011 rod will give good results without having to clean the weld joint. For high strength rods like E7018, you will find cleaning down to the steel very helpful, since these rods must either be used at high amperage or you will need to endure a lot of sticking as the combined slag and burnt zinc will cause this.

, Using a fan or welding outdoors where there is a slight breeze will drift the combustion fumes away from you is a good idea. If you are welding in a confined space (never recommended in any circumstance), you may need a respirator capable of filtering out the particulates produced during welding.

, Since galvanized steel behaves slightly differently from regular mild steel, it may take a little practice to get used to the larger, more plentiful sparks you will create while welding, and the slightly slower welding speed required to allow the zinc to burn out of your way.

, Strike your arc, hold it in position to maintain a good arc flame, and move along the weld path sweeping the electrode slightly side to side to create a neat weld.  Make subsequent passes if you cannot fill the whole weld prep in a single pass, rather than overheating the metal trying to finish in a single pass.

,, This won't equal the corrosion resistance of the original galvanized coating, but it will help.

Prepare plastic components.,
Ensure that all soils are removed.,
Use a face mask when performing this task as this process can create a fair bit of dust.,Once the part has been properly cleaned are prepared, we are now ready for the ""Tacking"" step.,
Apply a ""V"" groove to the weld area:

Weld plastics components relies on a number of factors -
Surface Preparation
Good joint interfaces
Plastics Identification / Correct welding rod selection
""V"" Grooving, using the rotary burr
Tacking
Correct welding temperatures
Welding technique

,
A Rotary Burr is used to provide a ""V"" groove along the weld line.,
Tack plastics:

Tacking of plastics components prior to welding, helps the welder to achieve two things -

Good joint interfaces and
Alignment of the plastic components prior to main welding


The ""Tacking Nozzle"" can be used to ensure close joint interfaces and alignment of broken parts.,
Fit the standard nozzle (LE100303) on the welding tool.,
Once up to temperature (from cold, this takes approx.,
Do it all at once.,
Finish it.,
Use the ""Speed Welding"" technique for long weld runs.,
Fit the standard nozzle on the welding tool.,
The Speed Welding nozzles are an easy push fit onto the standard nozzle.",How to Weld Thermoplastic," Poorly prepared plastic components will lead to weld failures. As with all forms of welding, cleaning of plastic components prior to welding is as important as any other welding preparation in achieving strong, structural welds.
, Any paints, oils, greases and even UV degradation must first be removed prior to welding. With large parts, eg. Bumper bars, washing the part is usually a good start.

This will ensure we are removing any atmospheric soils, eg. Mud, Traffic films etc . Use a soft sponge with warm water - don't use any industrial detergents as these can also introduce film coatings that may also affect the welding results.

Clean all the painted surfaces right back to the parent material. Paints and other remaining soils should be removed easily using a standard abrasive wheel (sanding disc) with any high speed air drill or electric drill will do the trick.


A grinding disc will make quick work of this process, but be warned - plastics yield easily to abrasives, so take care you don't end up damaging other sections of the part where the wheel can 'catch' and 'drag' across the component.

, Other methods for preparing plastics include - paint scrapper, sharp blade, clean wire brush...,,,

Take care when using the rotary burr, as plastics will yield easily to abrasives. Ensure you use adequate jigging and support, to prevent the rotary burr from 'digging in' and running across the plastic being repaired. When ""V""ing is complete, you are now ready for the ""Tacking"" stage.

, Unlike metal welding, where tacking is carried out at the ends of the welding area, Plastic Welding requires ""Tacking"" to be carried out where ever you intend to place welding rod.

, Set the required welding temperature on the welding tool using the guide provided., 1.5 minutes), select the correct welding rod (see our previous Tech Tip covering ""Plastics Identification""). Cut the start of the welding rod to a point. This will help with the initial flow of the weld rod.

Use a pendulum motion to evenly heat the parent material and the welding rod. Feed the welding rod into the welding area, while curving the tail of the weld rod away from the welding tool. This will help you control the rod feed during welding and will allow the operator to observe the material flow during welding.

, Welding should be carried out in one continuous run along the length of the area to be welded. Welding speed should be adjusted to the point where you observe a slight 'wash' at the sides of the welding rod.

Ensure that your pendulum motion is providing even heating of both the parent material and the welding rod throughout the weld run. When complete, allow the plastic component to cool completely before attempting to trim or clean up the welding area. This is important as the plastic will not be at full strength until completely cool.

, Trimming & sanding can now be carried out if required., The term ""Speed Welding"" gets its name from the fact that it is a relatively fast process compared to that of the ""Pendulum Welding"" technique.,

Select the correct ""Speed Welding"" nozzle to suit the corresponding welding rod profile - these are available to suit a range of welding rod profiles

,

Once up to temperature, simply insert the welding rod into the Speed Welding nozzle and apply a downward pressure on the welding rod itself.
Apply approx. 2.5 - 3 kgs of downward pressure, forcing the welding rod through the speed welding nozzle and into the weld area. The welding tool will only need to be supported, as the force on the welding rod will move the tool along the weld area with ease.

Use a dog.,
Bring in a raptor.,
Combine and rotate methods frequently.",How to Get Rid of Birds1," Purchase a premade one from your local craft or garden store. Or, make your own by constructing a cross out of wood and then covering it with clothes. Place your scarecrow in the vicinity of the pesky birds and watch them fly away.Move your scarecrow around every few days to keep the birds from getting too comfortable with it. Changing up the clothes can help as well.;
, Buy a number of cheap, plastic animal decoys. Choose natural predators of birds, such as snakes, owls, swans, and even coyotes. Set one or two of these up around the perimeter of the bird-infested area. Rotate them out with fresh ones every few days to keep the birds on edge., This solution is not feasible in every space, but can be a great tool to keep birds away from decks or pools. Install a motion-activated sprinkler aimed at the area of concern. Purchase one online or at your local garden store. Every time a bird tries to land a spray of water will scare them away.Don’t worry about the strength of the water stream. This is a harmless way of keeping an area bird-free., Get a number of balloons with faces on them and hang these throughout the bird-infested space. Tie the balloons tightly to branches or posts so that they don’t fly away. Add some flyaway pieces of shiny ribbon for even more effect. Rotate everything every few days to keep the birds uneasy., Cut out strips of aluminum foil and hang them from the trees or shrubs. Punch holes in thin aluminum disposable pans and do the same thing. Hanging shiny CDs or reflective tape is another way to deter birds. Make sure that you leave plenty of room for these objects to spin around and move, as this will scare birds even more.








There is also a product called “optical fire gel” that mimics the appearance of moving flames. This can be applied to the edges of buildings to deter landing or roosting.Metallic spinning propellers sold at most garden centers do an excellent job of ridding an area of birds., Get a CD of these sounds and play it near to the infested area. You may need to boost up the volume to reach up into the highest trees. Although it may be a hassle, playing these noises for numerous evenings in a row will get you the best results. Starlings, grackles, and other pest birds have been known to move roosts due to harassing noises.







, Border collies, sheepdogs, and other breeds enjoy chasing birds and are very good at it. Hire a trained dog handler to patrol your bird-infested space or borrow a friend’s dog and do it yourself. Walk the dog in the early morning and early evening hours when birds are most active.For example, a single sheepdog walking up and down a beach line at peak hours can reduce gull numbers almost 99 percent., Contact your local zoo or wildlife refuge and ask for the information for a falconer, a trainer who works with falcons and other birds of prey. The falconer will likely charge an hourly rate to come out to your site. They will let their falcon or hawk fly around and scare away any smaller birds.This is a great option for areas where the birds are no longer frightened by decoys or less aggressive methods. However, it can get expensive, with multiple treatments averaging around $55 an hour.
There are also kites available that resemble birds of prey. Some people have been successful when flying these over bird infested areas., Birds can be pretty smart and determined when it comes to finding a place to hang out and nest. To keep them away for long periods you must switch up tactics every few days and create many layers of defense. Look for how you can gain the element of surprise."

Use anti-roosting spike strips.,
Install weatherproof string in popular roosting areas.,
Install sloped sheathing.,
Avoid feeding pigeons.,
Eliminate other food sources.",How to Get Rid of Pigeons1," You can attach these to just about any spot that a bird might want to perch, such as the roof of a house. Buy spikes at the hardware store or garden centers. Attach according to the manufacturer's instructions.A smoother alternative is to use a “Slinky” toy, available from department and toy stores. Spread it out along the handrail of a balcony, with the coils not more than 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) apart. Wire it (or use duct tape) in place every 8⁄12 inch (1.7 cm). The pigeons hate it because it makes the surface uncomfortable for them to land on.;
, Tie the string from one end to another of the area. Place it about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the perching spot. This will prevent them from being able to balance anywhere, so they cannot roost.







, Sheathing made of metal, plywood, or PVC provides a slippery surface that birds can't roost on. Sheathing products, such as BirdSlide™, consist of three sheaths that form right triangles.The base fits securely into flat roosting areas. The surface is a 40- to 60-degree angle that birds can't perch. Place it on eaves, ledges, window sills, and other flat areas where pigeons roost., Never feed pigeons or allow bird feeders to remain on your property. Pigeons have excellent memories when it comes to food sources. They'll constantly return to places where they have human accomplices.You can bend this rule if you're using pigeon birth control, which relies on the flock mentality and long memories for long-term effectiveness., Food sources for pigeons can include grass seed, berries from pyracantha bushes or olive trees, and dog or cat food left outside. Don't constantly put seed on a lawn if the seed isn’t germinating. Eliminating or controlling their access to the source of food will reduce the number of pigeons.

If you really want to keep some songbirds around, switch over to tube-shaped feeders and fill them with black oil sunflower seeds.To keep away the scavengers, secure your trashcan lids carefully and cover up your compost pits., Thin out any heavy thickets and any grass or brush debris. Haul away any dead trees or logs. All of these sites provide shelter from predators and potential nesting spots for wild birds. Maintain this level of upkeep after the birds leave, so that your lawn doesn’t attract another flock., Look at your local garden or hardware store for nylon or plastic mesh. Use stakes or posts to create a framework for the netting around any trees that need protecting. Drape the netting on top of any vulnerable bushes. Use netting to block off potential nest sites on buildings, like rafters.Four-inch mesh is large enough to block out crows and other large birds. Go with a finer, smaller mesh if you are trying to dissuade tiny birds.Before you place the mesh, make sure that no birds will be trapped inside.

, Get wire cables or monofilament/fishing line and string a set of parallel lines about a foot above the area you’d like to protect. Use cinder blocks spread along the sides as line anchors. This will not stop birds from landing, but it will keep them from building large nests.Check the filament every so often to make sure that the lines are still intact.

, Birds will sometimes fly right into an interior space through an open door. Hang thick plastic or rubber strips from the doorframe to keep them out. Cut out 10” strips and place them 2” apart to create a heavy barrier., Buy a few strips of metal spikes, also called perch blockers, and attach them to any potential roosting or perching areas. Most people put them on ledges, around gutters, at the edges of roofs, and on top of patio covers. The strips usually attach to your structure with glue or screws.







, These are flat, flexible strips that put out an electrostatic pulse when pressed upon. So, when a bird lands on a strip, they’ll get a quick, painless jolt. This is a great option for the edges of signs or ledges, as they can be purchased in a number of colors and thicknesses.Some strips run off traditional electrical or battery power while others can be set up to store and use solar energy., Purchase the repellant and then smear it on any problem areas, such as ledges or eaves. Go slowly and make sure to leave no spaces untreated. While there is no scientific backing that this method works, some people argue that the scent alone is enough to drive birds away.Some of these repellants can stain surfaces. If you are worried about this, put down a layer of tape and then follow it with the repellant., Starlings and other small birds are known for aggressively seeking out small spaces in which to build nests. Walk around the perimeter of your house and look for any holes. Push a piece of copper mesh or steel wool into them. Cover this plug with a piece of wood, metal, or mesh.








Seal up your gutters and vents as well with mesh screens.Don’t just use caulk to seal up the holes, as birds can easily peck this out.

Hire a wildlife expert.,
Catch and relocate with traps.,
Check before using lethal methods.,
Destroy the nests and eggs.",How to Get Rid of Birds3," If you’ve tried a number of tactics and nothing has worked, then it may be time to call in the wildlife professionals. Get ahold of a local wildlife refuge or zoo and request contact information for an avian expert. This person will come out to your location and may even relocate large bird flocks.Again, be prepared to pay for these services. You may be able to contract with an expert if repeated treatments and visits are necessary.

, Contact Wildlife Services or Animal Control in your area to see if traps are available for rent or to borrow. If not, you can buy a “bob” or “funnel” trap online relatively cheaply and resell it afterwards. Place the traps around the infested areas and check them daily. When you find a bird inside, drive as far away as you can and release it., Look into the laws in your area before attempting to harm any pest birds. Some species are protected by law, whereas others are considered “nonprotected” and can be killed by shooting or chemical agents, also called avicides.For example, certain states in the U.S. allow citizens to shoot pigeons and sparrows as a control measure. But, it is still recommended that you exhaust all other measures before even considering this type of action.

, Some people may find this tactic repugnant, but it is one guaranteed way to reduce your pest bird population. Remove or destroy eggs once every two weeks in the spring and summer months. Pull down nests from window eaves, gutters, and other undesired places at the same time.








A less messy method is to give the bird population birth control pellets via feeders. However, you won’t be able to guarantee that only certain types of birds are affected.Depending on the bird type you may need to contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to get a permit for egg or nest removal.

Seal off your attic.,
Cap your chimneys.,
Tuck netting under places where pigeons nest.,
Hire professionals.",How to Get Rid of Pigeons2," Fill any gaps between your roof shingles or in the siding of your house.Seal the edges of places where birds nest using hardware cloth and silicon caulk or plastic bird netting. Close off the space above the rafters where pigeons roost and nest with industrial bird netting.


You can further prevent access to your attic by trimming tree branches that grow close to your roof., Pigeons enjoy roosting in chimneys. Install mesh stainless steel caps that prevent animals from entering while still allowing smoke to escape. If you're not skilled at scaling roofs, call an expert to do this. Just make sure that no pigeons are in the chimney while it's being capped.







, Mesh is a popular humane deterrent because it can be used anywhere is pleasing to the eye. Cover any surface where pigeons may perch or lay their eggs, such as under air conditioning units. This will prevent them from entering the place at all.







, If you find pigeons in your attic or other interior spaces, hire a professional to install a one-way door. These devices allow the birds to exit the area but prevent them from re-entering. You can also hire professionals to clean up any droppings, feathers, or other refuse left behind. Professional cleaners will have the proper cleaning equipment and protection gear that might be too expensive to obtain on their own."

Spray pigeons with water from a garden hose.,
Install “scare-pigeons.” These lightweight kites or decoys are sold in the form of hawk silhouettes.,
Use reflective surfaces.",How to Get Rid of Pigeons3," Pigeons won't appreciate the force or concentration of the water being targeted at them. Spray the birds when they first arrive. If you wait until they set up house, it will be too late., Place them where the pigeons usually roost. Be aware that pigeons will grow used to the presence of mute raptors that “perch” in the same location.For good measure, move the decoy on a regular basis.








, When the sun hits reflective objects, it creates a prism effect that interferes with the birds' eyesight. Install reflective tape or foil balloons to scare away the pigeons. If money is tight, string old CDs from nearby trees or along awnings.

",How to Repurpose Candy Tins," Hold notecards, pens, pencils and various paperclips and office supplies in a handy candy tin container you can attach to the fridge. This is suitable only for upright rectangular shaped candy tins that have a small lid at one end rather than wider flat style tins. To make such a candy tin magnet:


Clean the upright candy tin thoroughly. Remove all stickiness and candy crumbs.
Line the inside of the tin with contact or craft paper. Measure the inside of the candy tin to determine the size of craft or contact paper needed to line the tin walls and bottom. Cut to the precise measurements and either use the self adhesive to attach to the inside of the tin or line the back of the paper with a glue stick for adherence.
Place a self adhesive magnetic sticker on the backside of the container. For a small to medium sized tin, find the center of the tin side and attach a two inch (5cm) magnetic sticker. For larger tins, consider using two magnets––one toward the top of the tin side and another toward the bottom.
Attach to the fridge to see if it hangs well. Make adjustments as needed.
Add the items you wish to store inside the tin, shut the lid and hang from the fridge or other magnetic surface.;
, A delightful memory box can be created using a small candy tin; tiny but very precious! This can be given as a gift, carried around as a keepsake or even placed on display. Here is one way to create such a memory box from a candy tin:


Decorate the outside of the candy tin using photos and scrapbook type paper and materials. If you're already into scrapbooking, make the most of your know-how to perfect the cover. You could also decoupage it or paint it. Another approach is to simply stick a favorite photo on the lid and varnish over it with an appropriate craft varnish.
Create a small ""album"" that can be folded out of the tin. Measure the size of the tin for the paper width. Out of thin card, create a concertina length of folded paper that equates to the width of the tin (you'll need to ensure that the rectangle/square shape is just a little smaller than the tin, so that it fits in neatly). How many concertina folds you make is up to how many photos you'd like to add. Keep in mind that if you start adding ribbon, lace, scrap paper bows, etc., then the height of the folded album will increase quickly.
Assemble the album. Glue the photos in place on each folded square/rectangle of the concertina album. Some pages you might like to add special quotes or messages rather than photos––the design additions are entirely up to you. Leave the base layer without a photo though––this will be glued to the bottom of the candy tin.
Once dried and completed, attach the base layer of the concertina album to the inside base of the candy tin. This will ensure that the photo album remains attached to the tin and cannot be lost. Of course, you can skip this step if you'd prefer to be able to remove the whole album.
If wished, you could also add pieces and keepsakes inside the tin, such as memorable coins, locks of hair, baby teeth and other keepsakes. Put items in special envelopes or pouches to preserve the integrity of the item; obviously, the more items you wish to add, the bigger the candy tin will need to be.

, A candy tin can be a great way to store lose jewelry or hair accessories that don't have a home anywhere else. This can be handy when you'd like to keep certain pieces together for easy retrieval. You could also keep broken jewelry in a candy tin, for safe storage before taking it in for repair or repairing it yourself.


Design the outside of the tin to taste. One approach might be to decorate as outlined in the previous step. Or, you could jazz it up by using spray paint and faux jewels to cover the candy tin.
Place individual smaller boxes inside the larger candy box to hold specific pieces. Divide your earrings, necklaces, rings and pins using either smaller candy or gift boxes or you could even use paper muffin or cupcake cups as a divider.
Consider creating a second shelf inside the candy box if the box is deep. Use a piece of cardboard to separate levels. Cut to fit.

, A candy tin can be the perfect size for small emergencies, such as a sewing kit, tiny first aid kit or a mending kit for a sports or hobby activity. Simply pack in the items needed for repair and it's ready to go. For example:


Sewing kit in a candy tin: Add a few needles, a small card of basic colored threads, a few generic buttons, a thimble and a small pair of scissors (preferably foldable). The sewing tin lid could be lined underneath with batting and a piece of fabric; this will allow you to slip the needles and any pins/safety pins into it for ease of finding and storing.
First aid kit: This kit could contain some Band-Aids, some antiseptic cream, a bandage and bandage tie, some alcohol wipes, etc. Obviously it can only contain a small amount, so be wise about what you add but this can be ideal for short day hikes, picnics, etc. when you may encounter basic bumps, bites and scrapes.

, You won’t need to do much to create a handy organizational system making the most of candy tins; just choose a tin size that accommodates the craft materials you need organized and stored. Candy tins of varying sizes can be ideal for storing buttons, beads, sequins, thread, writing and painting items, stamps, decoupage pieces, and more.


Designate different tins for specific materials. Separate your craft stuff into the different tins. For example, if you have numerous boxes of half used crayons, consider consolidating all crayons into one tin or provide your collection of different threads for sewing into another. Obviously, take into account not mixing objects that might stain or poke each other and cause damage.
Use like-sized tins for crafting projects that can be stacked and easily stored. If you are a big crafter (or have a number of craft supplies that need to be separated and organized). If you have numerous candy tins, make sure they are stackable and can easily accommodate your supplies.
Candy tins can also be simply tossed into sewing baskets, craft caddies, etc. and will still keep their contents safe. You don't have to stack them as long as you can still get to them easily.

, As with craft, candy tins have an excellent second life holding all manner of hobby objects that might otherwise go astray. Some ways to make the most of candy tins for a hobby include:


Store stamps inside the candy tin, both sorted and unsorted ones depending on what your needs are.
Store war-game figures inside the candy tins. Label according to the game and ranks.
Store seeds for gardening inside the candy tins. Be sure to date the seeds though, as most seeds are viable for a short period only.
Store tees for the golf green inside a candy tin.

, Candy tins happen to be an ideal size for storing nails, nuts and bolts, screws and all those other little items that the handy person needs to keep in place. They can be easily labeled using adhesive labels and a marker––there's really no need to decorate them unless you want to. Candy tins used to keep hardware organized can be stacked, thrown into toolboxes or arranged neatly in drawers.


All those bizarre little objects you find around the house that have fallen off things but you're not sure what can be safely stored inside a handy ""discovered objects"" candy tin. Often one person might find something that has ended up on the ground, like a covering button off a piece of furniture or a mechanical piece off an appliance without realizing what it belongs to. By having a household ""discovered objects"" tin, you can be reassured of finding the missing object again, especially by the person who knows what it is and what to do with it!
Candy tins are great for storing car fuses and household fuses. Always easy to locate again!

, Coins rattling around in the car are a nuisance and even the car's own coin holder can be a pain when it rattles. By lining a candy tin with cotton wool, felt or fabric scraps, you can deaden this sound and keep spare coins needed for tolls, snacks and other needs neatly together inside the candy tin. Moreover, having two candy tins can be really handy if you live near the border of another country, such as between the USA and Canada. If you frequently travel across the border, it can be easy to start confusing the coins that you gather. A simple and effective answer is to place the coins of different currencies into different candy tins and slip them into the glove compartment of the car for ease of reach when needed. This method can also be applied to storing coins of different currencies at home if you're a frequent traveler––they're easy to find before you travel each time and can be neatly stacked with other travel items when not in use.

Learn the basics of MIG welding.,
Learn how it works.,
Understand the applications.",How to Use a MIG Welder1," The process is GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding), commonly known as MIG welding (Metal Inert Gas welding). MIG welding was developed during World War II as a fast, portable process to create strong, durable joints. Today it is used in many shop and factory applications as well as by home hobbyists and welding enthusiasts.;
, MIG welding uses a machine to feed a wire through a contact tip into a MIG gun. The electrically charged contact tip transfers the welding current to the wire. The arc is established between the wire and the base metal. Often times an inert gas is used, which flows out of the gas nozzle to shield the welding process from the atmosphere. There are several modes of metal transfer:


Short circuit (thin metals)
Globular transfer (heavier metals)
Spray transfer (hottest)

, Once you learn how to use a MIG welder, you can make repairs around the home. A MIG welder can be used on stainless steel, mild steel, and aluminium of all thicknesses. Shielding gases will vary depending on base metal and welding wire.

Choose the right propane torch for your needs.,
Wear appropriate safety gear.,
Light the propane torch.,
Adjust the height of the flame.,
Place the flame against the material you need to heat.,
Turn off the gas when you are done using the torch.",How to Use a Propane Torch1," Most propane torches consist of a small gas tank fitted with a regulator, with or without an electric igniter. If yours doesn't have an igniter, you'll need to use a striker to light the torch.


If you need low heat, opt for a propane torch with a flame-spreading tip, which will allow you to diffuse the flame to lower its heat.
When using a high heat for repairing chain-link fences and the like, consider using an oxygen-fuel torch. These torches have 2 separate tanks for gas (usually propane or MAPP) and oxygen.;
, Before using the propane torch, you should put on a pair of heavy work gloves and safety glasses. It is also best to wear long sleeves and pants. Your propane torch should only ever be used in well ventilated areas. Be cautious of wind when using your torch. It can cause the flame to jump and catch unintended things on fire. Never ignite your torch near flammable material.
Avoid clothing that is loose or hangs. Loose or hanging clothing is more likely to accidentally catch on fire when operating a torch.

, Hold the torch with the tip facing away from you and open the gas valve. If you have a striker, place it over the torch nozzle and strike it to ignite the gas. If your torch has an electric igniter, pull the trigger to ignite the gas. This may take several tries.Some propane torches have a safety trigger that must be depressed when lighting the gas.
If you are using your torch indoors, make sure to open a window for ventilation. If using one outdoors, be cautious of the wind causing the flame to jump to flammable objects., Once the propane torch is lit, you can adjust the height of the flame by turning the gas valve. For soldering or other high heat applications, a small flame is best. A larger flame works better for low heat applications.The flame will have a bright inner cone and a more diffuse outer cone. The hottest point of the flame is the very tip of the inner cone.

, For soldering pipe, place the tip of the inner cone against the joint and hold the torch steady. For loosening rusty bolts, try to focus the flame on the nut only or the surrounding metal. For low heat applications, hold the flame further away from the material and keep the torch in motion.


Applying your torch to metal will cause the metal to expand. When loosening bolts, it may be best to heat the surrounding metal to prevent the bolt from expanding.

, After use, rotate the gas valve until it closes completely. Allow the propane torch to cool down and then store it in a dry location. Listen for running gas to ensure safety.


Separate your torch from the fuel cylinder when you finish using it. This will provide less opportunity for accidents.If you hear leaking gas, check the valve and make sure it is completely closed. If you still hear gas, check for leaks in the fashion explained in the section on troubleshooting your torch.

Work in an open space free of any flammable materials.

,
Turn on the fuel adjustment knob.,

Adjust the flame size.",How to Torch Weld1,";
,, The knob is located on the shorter of the 2 tanks on the torch. Turn the knob slowly, about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm), to release the gas.

, Tilt the lighter so that the fuel is trapped in the spark cup and slowly light the torch.

, Carefully open the oxygen valve a little bit at a time until you have the size flame you require. A steady flame will have well defined blue edges.

Keep your yard free of clutter.,
Avoid tall-growing plants.,
Get rid of any possible source of food.,
Patch up any holes.,
Put up snake-proof fencing.,
Create vibrations.If you have spotted snakes in your garden or yard in the past, and suspect that a few might be hiding in there even now, run the lawn mower or tiller around the area before working in it.,
Lay traps.",How to Keep Snakes Away1," Snakes are ambush predators, meaning they like to attack their prey from dark hiding places.As such, clutter is essentially an open invitation to snakes, giving them perfect hiding spots. Piles of leaves, compost piles, straw mulch, wood chip mulch, stacks of firewood, and piles of cut grass are all comfortable places that snakes like to hide in, so these should be removed from your yard.Instead of wood mulch, consider crushed stone. It’s not as comfortable or effective for snakes to hide in.;
, Just like clutter, certain shrubs and other plants provide the perfect hiding spot for a neighborhood snake. Keeping your grass mowed is a good way to prevent snakes from slithering around your yard. Shrubs and packed gardens with thick plants will also attract snakes.


If you are very concerned about a potential snake problem, remove or thin these plants out. If you want to keep these plants, however, consider transplanting them to the far side of your yard, away from the foundation of your house., Snakes will only hang around your yard if there’s something there they can eat. Depending on the species, this could mean a problem with large insects such as cockroaches and grasshoppers, or small mammals such as mice and rats.Try laying traps or spraying repellents designed to keep these pests away from your house, and the snakes should stay away as well.

, If you have spotted snakes in your yard and are worried about keeping them out of your house, the best thing you can do is locate and repair any holes in your property’s foundations, the garage, or screen doors. Carefully inspect these areas and if you notice any holes, no matter how small, patch them up immediately. Even holes as small as a quarter are large enough for certain types of garter snakes to squeeze through.


Beyond allowing access into your home, any holes or cracks in your building’s foundations provide great hiding places for snakes., The effectiveness of snake proof fencing might depend on the type of snake you have in your area and how it commonly travels, but there are specialized types of fencing that have proved effective against many types of snakes. Snake-proof fencing usually follows three broad types: plastic sheeting, steel mesh or catch net fencing. No matter the construction, these fences should be flush to the ground and angled outwards. This prevents snakes from slithering under the fence or climbing over.


It might not be practical to fence your entire yard this way. Instead, consider fencing specific areas commonly frequented by children and pets.You should consider putting up similar snake barriers around any buildings on your property elevated off the ground. This will keep snakes from hiding underneath.

, You do not want to push the mower or tiller through the area, because the idea is not to kill the snakes but simply to scare them off. The vibrations produced by these machines are usually enough to warn and frighten off many snakes, especially common garter snakes.


Note that this won’t keep snakes away permanently, but if you need to work in a garden, this can scare off snakes long enough to let you work.

, If you suspect that you already have a snake, or are worried about any snakes that might have snuck in before you took measures to repel them, you can set up mechanical traps or glue traps in your basement or garage. Before setting these traps up, though, you should contact your local animal control officer or state wildlife agency to make sure that the procedure is done safely and legally.


Make sure not to use glue traps outside. This could inhumanely trap wildlife other than snakes."

Paint the coffee can's background if desired.",How to Decoupage a Coffee Can2," If you want the background of the can to show through, apply a layer of acrylic paint. Brush the paint on in long, smooth strokes until the entire can is covered. The paint should be dry in several hours.

"
"
Affix decorative cutouts to the coffee can.,
Coat with an adhesive.,
Seal the decoupaged coffee can.",How to Decoupage a Coffee Can3," After painting the background, you can begin applying your cutouts. Images or shapes cut from magazine pages work well, as do cutouts from photographs or craft paper.

, The easiest way to apply the cutouts to the painted coffee can is by dabbing a bit of all-in-one decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge, to the back of the cutout. Then, carefully press the cutout onto the can to affix it.


If you do not have a decoupage glue, you can mix regular white all-purpose glue with water until it reaches the consistency of thin paint. This glue mixture can even be used as a final varnish, as it dries almost completely clear.

, After you have finished decorating the can, you can leave it as-is or you can seal it to give it a more inlaid, professional appearance.


If you are using Mod Podge or a similar decoupage glue, apply several thin coats of the glue over the entire surface of the coffee can. Check the product packaging for recommended wait times between coats.
You can also seal the coffee can using a thinned mixture of craft glue and water. If you are worried about a hazy, translucent finish using this method, test the glue mixture first on another surface.

"
Assemble your safety gear.,
Select a comfortable MIG gun.,
Prepare the area to be welded in.",How to Use a MIG Welder2," You will need a full set of safety equipment to ensure your safety while welding. This includes gloves, masks, and protective clothing.


Make sure that all of your skin is covered to prevent overexposure from UV rays. You will need a mask with at least a #10 shade or darker. This will help prevent arc eye.
If you are working in a poorly ventilated area, you will need a vapor mask to minimize the amount of toxic vapors inhaled during the welding process.
Wear gloves that can protect your skin from molten metal.
Keep a CO2 extinguisher and a bucket of sand nearby for emergency fires.

, Some are shaped like pistols, while others may look like acetylene torches. The size of the machine will depend on the size of the project.


A MIG gun may also be water or air cooled. Air-cooled guns are used for 200 amps or less and are easier to manipulate in small areas. The air-cooled gun is the type that home MIG welders typically use.

, Remove all flammable material and find a good surface to weld on. Although you can put the ground connection right on the piece you are welding, most shops have a large metal workbench that the ground is hooked up to.


If there are other people present, set up welding curtains around the work area. This will protect them from UV damage.

"
"
Obtain the proper wire.,
Prepare the reel.,
Feed the wire to the torch.,
Adjust the tension.",How to Use a MIG Welder3," Use the same wire type as the material you are welding. For example, if you are welding stainless steel, use a stainless steel wire.


For steel welding, there are two main types of wire. AWS ER70S-3 is an all-purpose steel wire. This is usually the most economical choice. AWS ER70S-6 is a high-quality steel wire, designed for welding on rusty or dirty steel
E71TGX requires no shielding gas. It is suited for welding in high winds and for painted or rusty materials.
Vary the diameter of your wire based on the thickness of the metal you are welding. Use thin wire for thin metals, and thicker wire for thicker metals. You may need a larger machine for thicker metals.

, Tighten the tension on the reel so that the wire doesn’t unravel due to its own tension. Make the first 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the wire as straight as possible to avoid tangles or damage to the line feeder. Use a wire cutter to trim the wire accordingly.

, Insert the wire into the guide tube and feed it over the roller. Insert it in to the wire liner. If you have to use force, chances are that the wire is not aligned properly.


Make sure the wire is free from rust or grease, this will cause bad welds. Use a dry cloth to clean any dirty wire before inserting it. Wire will become rusty if left in the welder when not in use.
Once the wire is inserted into the liner, turn the welder on and use the wire feed mechanism to push the wire through the welder.

, Once your wire is fed through, you will need to adjust the tensioner. TO much tension will cause the mountings to bend, damaging the welder. Keep the tension at the minimum amount that still allows the line to be fed through.


Make sure to check the tension on the reel as well as on the line feeder. Both should be as low as possible.

File rough edges on your pipe if necessary.,
Dry the pipe.,
Shine the pipe.,
Prevent the flow of water in your pipe.,
Apply flux to your pipe where you will solder.,
Heat the flux.,
Assemble the pipe components and heat them.,
Apply solder to the pipe.,
Clean the pipe after soldering.",How to Use a Propane Torch2," Use a metal file to take off burrs, rough edges, and loose shavings on your pipe. This is especially important if you have cut the pipe to fit a plumbing project.


When the jagged edges of your pipe have been filed down, wipe away any remaining fragments with a clean rag.
If you don't have a proper file, substitute fine grain sandpaper, emery cloth, or steel wool to smooth rough edges on your pipe.
If your pipe didn't cut cleanly and has jagged edges or burrs, wear work gloves when filing to prevent cuts and slivers., In most cases, you can do this by tipping the pipe upside down to force the water out one end of the pipe. If this is impossible, use a dry, clean cloth to absorb all water or liquid near where you'll be applying the solder.


Water can interfere with the soldering process and create a weak bond in it. Be thorough when drying your pipe., A shiny pipe will solder more easily than ones that are not. Use a wire brush on the part of your pipe you will be soldering. Brush the pipe until it shines brightly, and do the same to the joint you will be soldering.Use a clean rag on your pipe after shining it to wipe away any dirt or particles that have been loosened when shining.

, Insert a drain plug, available at your local hardware store, into the pipe to prevent the flow of water. Water can remain in the line if the pipe is still attached and run to where you are soldering, negatively impacting the bond.


Generally, pipe plugs come with an applicator. Use this applicator to push the plug up the pipe. Dissolve the plug when you are done by briefly applying the torch to the area the plug is., Be sure you're wearing gloves and goggles when doing this. Flux that has not been treated with heat can be harmful in your eyes, mouth, or open cuts.Use the applicator that came with your flux to apply a thin layer of it to the outer surface of the pipe you'll be soldering.


If this is your first time soldering pipe, you may apply to much flux initially. Wipe away excess flux with a clean cloth.

, Light your torch and hold it 2 in (5.1 cm) from the part of the pipe with flux on it. Pass it back and forth over this area for about 10 to 20 seconds. First the flux will become shiny, but then the pipe should darken. When the flux sizzles and smokes slightly, the pipe is ready for solder.


Be cautious when handling heated pipe. Touching this could result in accidental burn in the same way touching the flame of your torch would.
Keep the flame of your torch set to a moderate or low setting when heating flux. You only need a relatively low temperature to melt it., Use caution when assembling pipe components so as to not burn yourself on the heated part. Slide the pipe into the fitting until it can go no further. Twist the pipe back and forth in the fitting to spread the flux on the inside of the joint. Then use your torch to reheat the assembled components.


Pass the flame of your torch evenly back and forth over the pipe components. Failing to heat these evenly could cause your solder to melt unevenly, allowing water to leak., Hold your solder to the heated pipe. If the solder runs, your pipe components are sufficiently hot enough to begin soldering. If your components glow or turn a blue color, you've applied too much heat.


If you've applied too much heat to your pipe, wait for it to cool completely. When the pipe is cool, try again by repeating this process from the beginning., While the pipe is still warm but the solder solid, brush another thin layer of flux on the solder. After that, use a clean cloth to wipe the soldered joint clean. Do not try to cool the joint rapidly. Doing so could cause damage to it.Avoid tightening the fixture or moving the joint around until the solder has completely cooled. The solder will remain soft until it is cool.

"
"
Avoid tipping the torch more than 60° from upright.,
Recognize the effect of temperature on your torch flame.,
Check your torch for leaks.,
Send in your torch for repairs.",How to Use a Propane Torch3," Tipping your torch in this fashion can cause the torch to flare. This can be especially dangerous on windy days. The wind could cause the flame to jump to the surrounding area and start a fire., If you use your torch in cold weather and if your torch is not pressure regulated, you may notice that the flame is smaller than usual. Cold temperatures reduce the amount of pressure in the tank, resulting in a smaller flame.


Keep your tank in a warm, indoor area and use it quickly and efficiently when out in the cold to maintain a suitable flame.Using a pressure regulated torch will also prevent a small flame due to temperature.

, If you hear a hissing noise of gas escaping your torch even while the valve is off, it likely has a leak. You may also notice that your torch is losing fuel even when not in use, which is another sign of a leak.


In a well ventilated, spark free area where there are no open flames, open the valve of your torch but do not ignite it. Use dish soap and water on all connections. If you see bubbles form, you have a leak., Many torches are designed to absorb drop impact so as to prevent damage to the pressurized fuel cylinder. This can sometimes result in your torch breaking off at the airholes when dropped, or another component being damaged.


A damaged torch can be severely dangerous; send your torch into the manufacturer for repairs.The customer service number for your torch can often be found in the user manual or on the manufacturer's website. Customer service should be able to inform you of the proper process for repair.

Clean the material to be welded.,
Apply the flame to your weld.",How to Torch Weld2," Check the material you are welding for rust or any other debris. Clean the material until it is smooth and free of dirt or debris.

, Adjust your flame, and begin to carefully move the torch over the area to be welded. Move at an even pace in order to see your results. If you hold the flame too closely to the material for too long a period, you will create holes in the material. Not enough application will result in the piece not melting.


Move your torch in short runs so that you are certain you are getting the result you need. Pay attention to the angle of the torch and the amount of flame, and adjust accordingly.

Use trekking poles when hiking.,
Stay on cleared, popular trails.,
Watch your step.,
Choose the time of your hike carefully.",How to Keep Snakes Away2," These poles look very similar to ski poles, except they’re usually adjustable to adapt to the terrain. Trekking poles allow you to push tall grass and other brush out of your way, potentially scaring off any hidden snakes. As you hike, your pole hitting the ground and banging against rocks will also deter snakes. They can feel the vibrations in the ground, and will usually leave when they sense your approach.If you can’t afford or otherwise acquire a trekking pole, a ski pole will do fine.

, Snakes tend to hide under stones, logs and in dense foliage. Trails cleared of clutter are less likely to attract snakes. Additionally, if you stick to well travelled trails, the frequent foot traffic will already keep snakes away. They have no desire to approach humans, and if they know people frequent a particular area, they’ll tend to stay away from it., Many snakes, such as the rattlesnake, are colored in a way that blends in with their environment. Keep your eyes open while on a trail; you might spot and effectively avoid a snake encounter before it happens. Be especially careful if you’re traversing rocks or fallen logs. Both of these are favorite hiding spots of various snakes. If you need to traverse these fallen objects, step up on them, then down, rather than simply stepping over. This gives you the chance to scan the area around the object, to ensure no snakes are hiding nearby.Avoid picking up stones or wood while on a trail. This might disturb any snakes hiding underneath and provoke an attack.
If you need to lean on something while hiking, such as a rock face or a tree, pay close attention to where you place your hands.

, Snakes are cold-blooded, meaning they can’t regulate their body temperature the way humans can. They have to expose themselves to sunlight to warm themselves up, and hide away from sunlight to cool down. Consequently, snakes tend to be more active in warmer weather. If you’re really concerned about encountering a snake on a hike, consider planning your hike for the cooler weather of fall and winter."

Set the welding machine polarity to DCEP.,
Keep a consistent electrode length.,
Use the proper shielding gas.,
Weld a joint using a drag or push welding technique.,
Make a flat weld.,
Make a horizontal weld.,
Make a vertical weld.,
Make an overhead weld.,
Finish the weld.",How to Use a MIG Welder4," This is reverse polarity.

, As you are welding, keep your electrode extended between ¼” and 3/8” from the contact tube. This will help make for a clean, regular weld.

, Use carbon dioxide as an economical choice to provide deeper penetration on steel. This will be too hot for thin metals though. Use argon for aluminum welding, and a mix of argon (75%) and carbon dioxide (25%) for thinner steel.

, The angle should not exceed 10 degrees in either technique. Keep the wire at the front edge of your weld pool. This will give you greater control over your weld.


Drag welding pulls the bead along with the tip. This will give you a deeper penetration and a narrower bead.
Push welding pushes the bead with the tip. This will give you a wider bead.

, Use the welder to place material directly into the joint. You can use a back and forth method to fill large gaps. For flat joints, hold the gun at a 90° angle.

, You must lower the gun angle slightly to keep the filler from sagging. Keep the same push or pull angle as normal. Use a back-and-forth weave motion to fill large gaps.


Keep the amperage the same as a flat weld. You may need to use a slightly smaller diameter wire to keep the weld pool from getting too big.

, For thin materials, start at the top and move the pool down with gravity. This keeps the arc from penetrating the material. For thicker metals, start at the base and work up. This will help increase penetration.


You may want to lower the amperage by around 10-15% to help fight gravity.

, Use standard welding techniques, but increase your travel speed. This will help prevent filler from falling out of the joint. You may need to increase your gas flow rate.


Keep your nozzle clean, as spatter will build up faster when welding overhead.

, Once you are done with the weld process, grind off any excess filler. If the weld is defective, grind it down and re-weld the joint.

Obtain all necessary equipment.,
Prepare the metal to be welded.,
Bevel the edge of the metal if it is thicker than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).,
Align your metal to make sure the edges line up well.,
Turn your pieces over.,
Separate the pieces a little bit and set the amperage on your machine about 10 percent higher than the level you intend to use welding the metal.,
Make tack welds.,
Flip your metal over to be welded.

,
Strike an arc and create your root pass.,
Clean the weld with a hammer and wire brush and make subsequent passes if needed.",How to Perform a Butt Weld Using Electric Arc Welding," This should be a welding machine, electrode and workpiece clamps (and their leads), a welding helmet darker than shade 10, welding gloves, and appropriate safety clothing.;
, This includes grinding down rough edges and cleaning the areas to be welded.

, Beveling allows for better penetration of the root pass and subsequent passes. Beveling can be done with an oxy-fuel torch or a plasma arc cutter, but isn't necessary on thinner metal.
, They should be smooth and align cleanly.

, This should be the flat side if on or more pieces are beveled, or the side you don't want to start welding.

, So, if you are going to use 100 amps to make your weld(s), set your amperage at 110 amps.

, These will hold the metal together and prevent it from warping or bending inward when the weld is finished. To make a tack weld, strike an arc and let it sit for a few seconds. A few tack welds are usually needed and you should be able to break them with a hammer or wrench.

,, This is going to be the first and deepest pass on your weld, and if the metal is thick enough, the only pass you'll need. If you beveled the steel start at the bottom for your root pass. You need to ensure the root pass penetrates deeply enough, and for this reason 6010 electrodes are frequently used for this purpose.

, These passes should strengthen the weld and fill it in. Make sure to clean each pass before you start a new one.

Select the polarity.,
Grind the tungsten.,
Set up the gas flow.,
Set the amperage.",How to TIG Weld1," Before operating any welding machine, make sure to put on protective eyewear, thick, fire-resistant clothing, and a welding helmet with an eye shield.;
, All TIG torches have a ceramic nozzle for directing argon, a copper sleeve for holding an electrode, and some way of cooling themselves. Use the adapter from your accessory package to plug the torch into the front of your machine., The foot pedal is used to control the heat at which you are welding.

, You will pick different settings based on the type of metal that you are welding. If you are using aluminum, place the welder on the alternating current (AC) setting. If you are using steel or other metals, place the welder on the DC Electrode Negative (DCEN) setting.


If your welder has a high frequency setting, it will also need adjusting. For aluminum, the switch will need to be on continuous high frequency. For steel, it should be on high frequency start.

, The thickness of the metal to be welded and the welding current used determine the size of the tungsten rod. Make sure to grind in a radial direction around the circumference of the tungsten, not straight toward the ends.


Use the face of a fine stone to grind the tungsten electrode. Grind so that the electrode is pointing in the same direction as the rotation of the stone as a safety precaution.
Grind the tungsten to a balled tip for AC welding and a pointed tip for DC welding.
To make a butt weld or open corner weld ground the tungsten to a five to six millimeter stick., You want to use a pure Argon gas or mixed Argon gas such as an Argon-Helium mixture. Remove the plastic protective cap.


Shift the valve body by quickly opening and closing the valve to clean any debris out of the threaded valve body.
Screw the regulator on, then screw the nut tight while simultaneously twisting the regulator until it is seated in the valve.
Tighten the regulator using a spanner, making sure that the pressure knob is backed off counter-clockwise.
Put on the gas hose and flowmeter, then turn on the cylinder valve. Make sure to turn on the cylinder valve gently and in small increments. Usually a quarter-turn revolution is enough.
Finally, check for any leaks by listening for a wheezing sound or using an aerosol leak detector spray.
Set the gas flow rate by adjusting the cylinder regulator. Though the rate may vary depending on your project, usually the rate stays between four and 12 liters (3.2 US gal) per minute.

, The amperage allows you to regulate the control you have over the welding process.


The thicker the metal, the higher the amperage.
The more coordinated you get with the foot pedal, the higher you can leave the amperage.
Some conventional current ratios are: 1.6mm, 30 to 120 amps; 2.4mm, 80 to 240 amps; 3.2mm, 200 to 380 amps."

Look into other welding processes, such as MIG (metal, inert gas) with solid and flux-core wire, or TIG (tungsten, inert gas) and oxyacetylene.",How to Learn Welding As a Hobby," Community college class fees are very inexpensive.;
,,, Usually, they are more than willing to answer your questions and give you a basic description of the class and what you will be able to do after completing it.

, If you have access to a welder and some metal, you may want to attempt to learn welding on your own.

, For simplicity, we will look at a standard AC arc welder using welding rods.

, Welding rods are sold according to their intended use and are usually identified by a coded number. A 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) 6011 rod is a mild steel electrode. This electrode is designed to use Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current Electrode Positive (DCEP).This is a good rod to use for learning about basic welding using practice steel.

, It should be clean, unpainted and ungalvanized and thick enough that you will not easily burn through it when welding. A good piece of steel to start with is a 6"" X 6"" X 3/8"" piece of flat stock, but just about any scrap of flat plate or angle will work.

, Ideally, use a welding table, if one is available. If you end up having your workpiece on the ground, clear away any flammable items from the area.

, This is usually an uninsulated copper clamp from the welder. Make sure it has a good contact, is firmly clamping the metal and is out of the way of the welding process.

, You will be practicing without the welder powered up, but getting used to the feel of the electrode holder (stinger) by practicing with gloves on will make the transition easier once the welder is powered up.

, The stinger is a high amperage, insulated clamp with a handle you will be holding while welding. It should have grooves in the ""jaws"" to hold the electrode in either a 180, 45 or 90 degree position to the handle.

, You will want the end of the electrode to hit the metal and pull back about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm), so the ""arc"" will strike, or begin. By practicing with the welder off, you will ""feel"" the metal and be able to watch the tip to become familiar with how far to pull back after you contact the metal. Sustaining the ""arc flame"" will require you keep the end of your electrode very near the metal without actually touching it, which takes a bit of practice.

,, Some hoods do not have a hinged lens, so you will have to push the whole helmet up. Most helmets are hinged at the headband also, to allow you to do this, and keep the helmet in the up position while you are replacing your electrode or working on the metal.

, The electrode is now energized with 80 amps of electricity at about 28 volts and is very dangerous. Do not touch any uninsulated parts of the stinger while the welder is on. You may install new electrodes with a dry gloved hand by gripping it where it is coated with unbroken flux.

, You will see a flash when the arc is formed and most likely you will tend to jerk back. This is a natural reaction that will soon subside. You may have to practice striking your arc and moving the rod back quickly several times before you actually are able to sustain a steady arc flame. This is the first step in beginning welding.

, You will have a more consistent weld bead if you weave or move the electrode back and forth as you move the electrode along the path of your weld. Usually, the finished weld is about the same width as two electrode diameters. If the electrode used for welding is 1/8"" diameter, without the flux, the completed weld should be approximately 1/4"" ( 2/8"" )wide.

,, This is where people get hot slag in their eye if the glasses are not worn under the shield. Looking at your weld bead, is it straight? Is it uniform in width? Is the height of the bead uniform?

, Safety glasses are essential when chipping the slag, and you may want to either cool the metal or wait for it to cool before doing this. You will want a smooth, even bead (path of new welded metal) on your work piece. If there are bumps, or places where little metal is deposited, it probably means you moved at an irregular speed.

,, You will want to ""prep"" the surfaces to be joined by grinding an angle on each side to form a ""v"" where they meet and clamp them together to hold them in place while you weld.

, Thicker metal requires more amperage and larger diameter rods, while thin metal requires lower amperage and smaller diameter rods. Special electrodes are available for welding certain steel alloys, cast and ductile iron and aluminum. Electrodes can be found at a local welding shop or home improvement store.

Good Luck!

",How to Pass a Welding Certification Test," In the USA, there are many federal and state laws and regulations, and governing bodies that enforce and require certain building codes, rules, and welding fabrication standards.;
, Although, there are a vast number of different metal fabrication processes and techniques, the AWS certification tests mainly cover:


Shielded Metal Arc Welding - SMAW.
Gas Metal Arc Welding - GMAW.
Flux Cored Arc Welding - FCAW.
Gas Tungsten Arc Welding - GTAW.
Oxy-fuel Gas Cutting and;
Plasma Arc Cutting.

, (American Welding Society) standards (codes, specifications, recommended practices, methods, guides, etc.). Most types of metal fabrication will fall under one of the various AWS codes in USA.


ASME - This code covers the same variety of metal fabrication types as AWS does, but in the USA it is used mainly for the production of pressure vessels and high pressure piping.
API - This code covers the production of low pressure tanks and piping for the transport and storage of fuels and crude oil.

, Practice every type of welding (methods, metals, thickness) and all body positioning, working space clearance, and weather conditions you could be tested on.


The usual steel plate groove test for the AWS D1.1 code consists of two plates with a 45 degree inclusive angle (22.5 degree bevel on each plate).
The bevels are placed facing each other, leaving 1/4"" gap between the feather edges.
A backing plate is tacked onto the back of the two plates to hold them together while the weld is completed.

, In the D1.1 test, you will commonly complete two positions: vertical up and overhead positions.


If you pass both of these tests you will be qualified in all positions and if you complete the test using 1"" thick plate you will be qualified from 1/8"" to unlimited thickness.

, The most common failures are found on initial visual examination.


While the code does allow for discontinuities such as undercut, porosity and other issues, these are clues that an examiner will use to understand the skill level of the welder, so practice until your welds are as close to perfect as you can make them. This way when you you actually perform the test you will have already been harder on yourself then anyone else will be.

, Don't rely on your supportive friends; they will only give you excuses instead of helping you get better.

, A bad weld can be masked to look strong. If your weld passes visual inspection, then the next step is to perform destructive testing, otherwise known as the bend test.


If the plate you welded was thicker than 3/8"" then the test strips will be 3/8"" strips cut from across the weld and will be bent to the side with the point of maximum stretch where the weld is.
If the plate is less than 3/8"" thick then two strips will be cut from each plate and these will be bent with one plate face out and the other root out to stretch each side.
There should be no cracks, tears, flux inclusions or other defects.
It should bend just like a solid bar would bend.

, Match the filler metal feed rate, depth and thickness of the weld, and the applied heat intensity to the speed rate of your welds.

, Double check every instrument you use and adjust all settings for the correct application.

, If you use 7018 you need to keep the electrode in a rod oven to keep moisture out of the flux.

, This occurs most often when leaving flux behind. No, the next pass will not burn it out.

, Completely infuse the entire joint area. It should be a smooth transition between filler weld metal and base metal.

, Take your time and cut one part at the time even if you have practiced making the same blueprint before.


The test plate blueprint measurements could have been slightly changed without prior notice.

,,,


Never use baggy or loose clothes. You are working in a hazardous environment with moving machinery and power tools where you could easily be dismembered or burned.
Don't wear pants, jackets, aprons or coveralls with exposed pockets, sleeves, or collars. You could be seriously injured if a 2000 degree molten metal object or spark gets caught inside your clothes.
You will be tested on safety procedures and work space tidiness as well.

Clean your welding material.,
Insert the tungsten electrode into its collet.,
Clamp the parts together.,
Tack weld the parts together.,
Hold the TIG torch in your hand.,
Practice using the foot pedals to control the heat.,
Pick up the filler rod in your other hand.,
Use your torch to heat up the base metal.,
Advance the puddle in the desired direction using your arc.",How to TIG Weld2," Your surface must be clear of debris before you begin to weld.


To prepare carbon steel, use a grinder or sander and polish it down to a bare, shiny metal.
For aluminum, it is best to use a dedicated stainless steel wire brush.
For stainless steel, just wipe down the weld area with some solvent on a rag. Make sure to store the rag and chemicals in a safe place before welding.

, Unscrew the back of the electrode holder on the collet, insert the tungsten electrode, and screw the back on again. Generally, the electrode should hang about 1/4-inch away from the protective sheath on the collet.

, Use an angle iron and/or a flat bar with c-clamps to secure the parts you want to weld together.

, A tack weld is a very small weld that is intended to hold a part in place until the final weld can be completed. Place tack welds every few inches where your two metals meet.

, Be sure to hold it at about a 75 degree angle with the tungsten raised no more than 1/4-inch off the metal.


Don't let the tungsten touch the work piece or it will contaminate your material.

, Your weld puddle should be about 1/4-inch wide. It is important to keep your puddle size consistent throughout the weld to avoid a messy finish.

, Hold it so it rests horizontally at a 15 degree angle from the work piece at the base where the torch will heat the piece.

, The heat of the arc will create a puddle, a pool of molten metal that is used to fuse the two pieces of metal together.


Once there is a puddle on both pieces of metal, tap the filler rod into the molten puddle in quick dabs to avoid clumping.
The filler rod adds a reinforcement layer for your weld.

, Unlike MIG welding, where you lead the puddle in the direction that the torch is leading, with TIG welding you push the puddle the opposite direction that the torch leans.


Think of your hand motion as that of a left-handed person operating a pencil. While a right-handed person moves their pencil like a MIG weld, with the angles both tilted to the right, a left-handed person has their pencil tilted to the left, though they must push the pencil to the right.
Continue to advance the puddle until you have welded the entire area desired and you've completed a TIG weld!

A fillet weld should look like a triangle from the side., Form the weld puddle between the edge of an overlapping piece of metal and the surface of the bottom piece of metal. When these pieces fuse together, dip the filler rod into the puddle.

, Angle the torch so that there is direct heat on the flat surface of the metal. Hold a shorter arc by extending the electrode beyond the ceramic cone. Place the filler rod where the edge of the two metals meet.

, Melt both edges of the metal where they meet in a point. Keep the weld puddle in the center of the joint where the two metals meet. You will need a significant amount of filler rod for a corner joint because the metals do not overlap.

, Center the weld pool on the adjoining edges of two pieces of metal. This requires more skill that the other types of weld because the metals do not overlap. When finishing, decrease the amperage to fill in the crater that forms."

Set up your vessel and heating source.,
Put the lead into the vessel.,
Heat the lead until it melts.,
Pour the molten lead into its mold.,
Let the lead return to a safe temperature.,
Clean up any spills.",How to Melt Lead," Lead should be melted in a well ventilated, fire safe area, as it can create dangerous fumes and present a fire hazard if not handled properly. The best heating source is a hand held oxygen-acetaline torch for melting amounts of lead. As a vessel, you will need to use a heavy metal container. Do not use a pot used for food preparation.;
, Add more lead to the vessel than you think you will need, as some of it will re-solidify onto the sides of the vessel when pouring.

, Turn on your heat source and adjust the heat to its highest setting, if applicable. Apply the heat as directly to the lead as possible. Lead melts at a temperature of 328 degrees Celsius (621 degrees Fahrenheit), so it will take time to melt a large amount of lead. Since most lead you use will not be pure, you will have impurities ('dross') float to the top. Use a metal spoon, preferably aluminum, to scrape off dross, and place dross in a separate container. To purify the molten lead, drop it a small amount of wax (old candle pieces) to 'flux' - be aware you may have some flames but just let them burn off. Stir pot and scrape sides and bottom to get all impurities to rise to the surface - flux again before pouring lead into mold.

, Once the lead has melted, turn off the heat source and prepare to pour it into whatever mold you have prepared. You will have to work quickly because the lead will cool and solidify quickly. Pick up your vessel with heat-resistant gloves, swirling it gently to keep air bubbles from forming in the lead. Pour the lead into the mold. Be careful to avoid placing your hands directly above the vessel, as hot gases will be escaping and present a burn risk.

, After pouring the lead, do not disturb it for at least 10 minutes. This will ensure that the metal is cool enough to handle safely.

, If the lead has spilled or overflowed, it will harden onto the surface it spilled on. It will not form a very strong bond, however, so you can dislodge it with a chisel or a flat-head screwdriver.

Select more powerful welding machines for thicker metal.,
Choose the correct shielding gas.,
Use aluminum electrodes.",How to Mig Weld Aluminum1," A 115-volt welder can handle aluminum up to an eighth of an inch thick (3 mm) with adequate preheating, and a 230-volt machine can weld aluminum that's up to a quarter of an inch thick (6 mm). Consider a machine with an output greater than 200 amps if you will be welding aluminum daily.;
, Aluminum requires a shielding gas of pure argon in contrast with steel, which typically uses a blend of argon and carbon dioxide (CO2). This should not require any new hoses, although you may need to replace regulators that were designed specifically for CO2.

, Electrode thickness is especially critical with aluminum and there is an extremely narrow range to consider. Thinner wire is more difficult to feed, while thicker wire requires greater current to melt. The electrodes for welding aluminum should be .035 of an inch in diameter (less than 1 mm). One of the best choices is 4043 aluminum. A harder alloy like 5356 aluminum is easier to feed, but will require more current.

Paint your weld with a suitable rust-preventative primer to protect it from corrosion.",How to Arc Weld," An electric arc is formed at the tip of the welding rod when a current passes across an air gap and continues through the grounded metal which is being welded. Here are some of the terms and their descriptions used in this article:


Welding machine. This is the term used to describe the machine which converts 120-240 volt AC electricity to welding voltage, typically 40-70 volts AC, but also a range of DC voltages. It generally consists of a large, heavy transformer, a voltage regulator circuit, an internal cooling fan, and an amperage range selector.The term welder applies to the person doing the welding. A welding machine requires a welder to operate it.
Leads, or Welding leads. These are the insulated copper conductors which carry the high amperage, low voltage electricity to the work piece that is being welded.
Rod holder, or stinger is the device on the end of the lead that holds the electrode, which the person welding uses to accomplish the welding task.
Ground and ground clamp. This is the lead that grounds, or completes the electrical circuit, and specifically, the clamp that is attached to the work to allow the electricity to pass through the metal being welded.
Amperage, or amps. This is an electrical term, used to describe the electrical current supplied to the electrode.
DC and reverse polarity. This is a different configuration used in welding with an arc/electrode system, which offers more versatility, especially in overhead welding applications and for use welding certain alloys that do not weld easily with AC voltages. The welding machine that produces this current has a rectifier circuit or has the current supplied by a generator, and is much more expensive than a typical AC welder.
Electrodes. There are many specialized welding electrodes, used for specific alloys and types of metals, such as cast or malleable iron, stainless or chromoly steel, aluminum, and tempered or high carbon steels. A typical electrode consists of the wire rod in the center covered with a special coating (flux)which burns as the arc is maintained, consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide in the weld area to prevent the base metal from oxidizing or burning away in the arc flame during the welding process. Here are some common electrodes and their uses:

E6011 electrodes are a mild steel electrode with a cellulose fiber coating. The first two numbers in the electrode identification is the tensile strength, measured in pounds per square inch times 1,000. Here, the yield of the electrode would be 60,000 PSI.
E6010 electrodes are a reverse polarity electrode, commonly used for welding steam and water pipes, and are particularly useful for overhead welding, since the metal holds its position while in a liquid state, being drawn into the molten weld pool by the flow of the direct current from the electrode to the workpiece.
Other specific purpose E60XX electrodes are available, but since E6011s are considered a standard, general purpose rod, and E6010s are considered the standard for reverse polarity DC welding, they will not be covered in detail in this article.
E7018 electrodes are low hydrogenflux coated steel rods, with a high yield tensile strength of 70,000 PSI. These are often used in assembling structural steel used in the construction industry, and in other applications where a strong filler material and higher strength weld is required. Note that, although these rods provide greater strength, they are less forgiving in respect to achieving a clean, high-grade weld at incorrect amperages and with dirty (rusted, painted, or galvanized) steels. These electrodes are called low hydrogen due to every attempt to lower the hydrogen content. These electrodes must be stored in an oven with a temperature between 250ºF and 300ºF. This temperature is above the water boiling point of 212ºF at sea level. This temperature keeps the moisture (dew)(H2O) in the air from collecting in the flux.
Nickel, Castalloy, Ni-Rod electrodes. These are special rods made for welding cast, ductile, or malleable iron, and have more yield, to allow for the expansion and contraction of the iron material being welded.
Dissimilar metals rods. These rods are made from a special alloy and give better results when welding tempered, hardened or alloyed steels.
Aluminum rods. These are a more recent technology and allow arc welding aluminum with a conventional welder, rather than using a special gas-shielded wire feed welder like a MIG (metal, inert gas) or TIG (tungsten, inert gas) welding machine, often referred to as heliarc welding, since helium was the gas used to shield the arc flame while welding. The official names created by the American Welding Society (AWS)for this arc type welding are Shielded Metal Arc Welding (stick), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (tig)and Gas Metal Arc Welding (mig).
Electrode sizes. Electrodes come in a variety of sizes, measured by the diameter of the metal center of each rod. For mild steel rods, a diameter range of 1⁄16 inch (0.2 cm) to 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) is available, and the size used is determined by the amperage of the welder, and the thickness of the material being welded. Each rod performs best at a given amperage range. Selecting the correct amperage range for a given size rod will depend on the base material and the desired penetration, so specific amperages will only be covered for the welding described further in this article.


Safety equipment. A critical part of welding safely is having, and knowing how to use, the correct safety equipment for the job. Here are some typical items that are required for welding safely.

Welding shield (hood). This is the mask which is worn to protect the person welding from the bright flash of the arc, and from sparks being thrown during welding. Standard arc welding lenses are tinted very darkly, since exposure to the arc flash can cause flash burns to the retina of the eye. A level 10 darkness is the minimum for arc welding. Welding hoods with a flip up lens was once preferred, as the dark lens can be lifted up, and a separate clear glass lens will protect the welder from bits of slag while the weld is chipped. The newer self darkening welding shields are the most desirable welding shield now sold. These welding shield lens are very light colored for grinding and torch cutting. When an arc is struck the automatic self darkening lens will change to a preset #10 shade. Even newer on the market are the variable shade automatic self darkening lens.
Welding gloves. These are special, insulated leather gloves that reach about 6 inches (15.2 cm) above the wrists, and protect the hands and lower arms of the welder (the person welding). They also provide limited protection from accidental shock if the person welding comes into contact with the electrode accidentally.
Welding leathers. This is an apron like leather jacket that covers the shoulders and chest of the welder, used for overhead work where sparks might ignite the welder's clothing, or cause burns.
Work boots. The person welding should wear at least a 6 inch (15.2 cm) lace-up type boot to prevent sparks and hot slag from burning his feet. These boots should have insulating soles made from a material which does not melt or burn easily.

;
, Welding is more than dragging a welding rod across a piece of steel and gluing it to another one. The process begins with properly fitting and securing the work pieces, or metal to be welded, together. For thicker pieces, you may want to grind a bevel so subsequent beads can be placed in the groove to fill it completely with a solid weld. Here are the basic steps for completing a simple weld.


Strike the arc. This is the process of creating an electric arc between the electrode and the workpiece. If the electrode simply allows the current to pass directly into the grounded work piece, there will not be enough heat produced to melt and fuse metal together.
Move the arc to create a bead. The bead is the metal from the melting electrode flowing together with molten metal from the base metal to fill the space between the pieces being joined by welding.
Shape the weld bead. This is done by weaving the arc back and forth across the weld path either in a zig zag or figure 8 motion so the metal spreads to the width that you want your finished weld bead to be.
Chip and brush the weld between passes. Each time you complete a pass, or trip from one end to the other of your weld, you need to remove the slag, or the melted electrode flux material, from the surface of the weld bead so only clean molten metal will be filling the weld on the subsequent pass.

, This means the welding machine, electrodes, cables and clamps, and the metal to be welded.

, For practice, a few pieces of mild steel, at least 3⁄16 inch (0.5 cm) thick will work.

, If the metal consists of two pieces that are to be joined in the welding process, you may need to prep, or weld prep them, by grinding a beveled edge on the sides that are to be joined. This allows for sufficient penetration of the weld arc to melt both sides to a molten state so the filler metal bonds through the sectional thickness of the metal. At the least, you should remove any paint, grease, rust, or other contaminants so you are working with a clean pool of molten metal as you weld.

, Locking type pliers, ""C"" clamps, a vice, or spring loader clamps will usually work. For special projects, you may find you will have to adapt different techniques to secure the work pieces until they are joined.

, Make sure there is a clean location so that the electrical circuit can be completed with minimal resistance at the ground location. Again, rust or paint will interfere with the grounding of your work piece, making it difficult to create an arc when you begin welding.

, As an example, 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) plate steel can be welded effectively using an E6011, 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) electrode, at between 80-100 amps. Place the electrode in the electrode holder (henceforth referred to as the stinger) making sure the conductive material of the stinger clamp is on the clean metal at the end of the electrode.

, You should hear a humming sound from the transformer. The sound of the cooling fan running may or may not be heard. Some welding machine fans only operate when the machine requires cooling. If you do not, you may need to check the circuit that is supplying your power, and the breakers in the panel box. Welding machines require a considerable amount of power to operate, often a special circuit rated at 60 amps or more at 240 volts.

, Hold your welding shield up just high enough so you can see to move the electrode to within a few inches of the workpiece, ready to flip in down to protect your eyes. You may want to practice tapping the electrode against the weld metal to get the feel of it before turning the power on, but never strike an electric arc without protecting your eyes.

, Position the tip of the rod close to it, then drop the welding hood into place. You want to tap the tip of the electrode against the metal to complete the electrical circuit, then instantaneously pull it back a little bit, to create an electric arc between the electrode tip and the metal being welded. Another way to strike an arc is like striking a match. This arc gap, or airspace, creates a great deal of resistance in the electrical circuit, which is what produces the arc flame or plasma and heat needed to liquefy the electrode and the metal adjacent to the weld area.

, This takes a great deal of practice, since different electrode diameters and welding amperages require a different gap between the tip of the electrode and the work piece, but if you can hold the gap steady, a continuous electric arc will occur from the electrode to the work piece. Typically, the arc gap should be no greater than the electrode diameter. Practice steadying the arc by holding the electrode about 1/8 to 3/16 of an inch from the work piece, then begin moving along the path you want to weld. As you move the electrode, the metal will be melting away, filling the pool of molten metal and building your weld.

, When you have mastered controlling the arc, you will begin to practice laying, or building up the weld bead. This is the deposit of metal that joins the two pieces that you are welding together. The technique you use for laying your bead will depend on the width of the gap (if there is one) you are filling, and the depth you want the weld bead to penetrate. The slower you move the electrode, the deeper the weld will go into the metal work pieces, and for making a wide path, the more you zig zag or weave the electrode's tip, the wider the bead you will lay up.

, If the electrode grounds to the metal and becomes stuck, jerk the stinger to break the rod free either from the stinger clamp or the weld metal. If the arc is lost because you move the electrode too far from the metal's surface, stop the process and clean the slag from the spot you are welding so when you re-strike the arc to continue, there will be no slag in the weld area to contaminate the new weld you are beginning from the place the arc was lost or broken. Never lay a new bead over existing slag, as this material will melt in the arc plasma and bubble through the new layer of metal you are placing, resulting in a weak and dirty weld.

, This will allow you to fill more of the weld in a single pass, leaving a cleaner and more sound weld. The electrode is moved in a sideways motion as it is drawn along the weld path, either in a zig-zag, curved, or figure eight motion.

, If you find the finished weld bead is pitted, with deep cratering at the bead's edges, or the adjacent metal is simply melted or burned away, reduce the amperage incrementally until the condition is corrected. If, on the other hand, you have difficulty striking or maintaining an arc, you may need to increase the amperage.

, After you have finished welding, you may want to remove the slag and clean up your weld, either to allow paint to bond better, or simply for cosmetic reasons. Chip off the slag and wire brush the weld to remove any foreign material and remaining slag. If the surface needs to be flat to allow fitting the piece you have welded to another piece, use an angle grinder to remove the top, or high portion of the bead. A clean weld, particularly after grinding flat, is easier to examine to see if pitting, puddling, or other defects have occurred while welding.

, Freshly welded metal will corrode rather quickly if exposed to the elements, since the actual base metal is exposed directly to moisture.

Buy a crucible container to hold the gold as it melts.,
Use flux to remove impurities from the gold.,
Be very careful of safety at all times.",How to Melt Gold1," You need the right equipment to melt gold. A crucible is a container that is specifically designed to hold gold as it melts because it can withstand the extreme heat.


A crucible is usually made of graphite carbon or clay. Gold’s melting point is at about 1,943 degrees Fahrenheit, which means you will need temperatures that hot to melt it. Thus, it's very important that you don't just choose any container.In addition to a crucible, you will need a pair of tongs to move the crucible and hold it. These need to be made out of heat-resistant material.
If you don't have a crucible, a homemade method uses a potato to melt gold instead of a crucible. To use this method, cut a hole into the potato, and place the gold in it.;
, Flux is a substance that is mixed with the gold before melting it. It is often a mixture of borax and sodium carbonate.You need more flux if the gold is impure. You can use many different formulas for flux mixtures. One method involves mixing borax and sodium carbonate. Add two pinches per ounce of clean jewelry scrap and more for dirty scrap. You can use regular baking soda or bicarbonate purchased from the store. When you heat it, it forms sodium carbonate.Flux helps hold together the fine gold particles, and it also helps remove impure materials from the gold as it heats. When using the potato method, add a pinch of borax into the hole in the potato before melting the gold., It can be dangerous to melt gold because of the extreme heat needed to do it.


Consult a professional if you have no training in melting gold at all. You also should find a place in your house to melt gold that is safe, such as in your garage or a spare room. You will need a work bench to put your materials on.Make sure that you wear safety goggles and a face shield to protect your face. You should put heat-resistant gloves on your hands and wear a heavy apron too.
Never, ever melt down gold near something that is flammable. It can be very dangerous, and you don’t want to cause a fire.

Feed the electrodes with an aluminum feeding kit.,
Keep the gun cable as straight as possible so the wire feeds properly.",How to Mig Weld Aluminum2," These kits are commercially available and will will allow you to feed softer aluminum wire with the following features:


Larger holes on the contact tips. Aluminum expands more than steel as it’s heated. This means the contact tips will need larger holes than the ones used for steel wire of the same size. However, the holes should still be small enough to provide good electrical contact.
U-shaped drive rolls. Aluminum feeders should use drive rolls that won’t shave aluminum wire. The inlet and outlet guides for these feeders shouldn’t shave the softer aluminum wire. In contrast, steel feeders use V-shaped drive rolls, which are specifically designed to shave the wire.
Non-metallic liners, which will further reduce the friction on the wire as it goes through the feeder.

, Softer wire is more prone to kinks due to feeding restrictions.

Buy an electric furnace that is used for melting gold.,
Try melting down gold in a 1200-watt microwave.",How to Melt Gold2," These are small, high-powered kilns that are specifically designed to melt precious metals, including gold and silver. You can buy them online.


Some of these electric gold furnaces are pretty affordable. They also allow people to mix previous metals together (such as gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and so on) and melt them at home. To use them, you will need the same equipment, including a crucible and flux.
If the gold item also contains small percentages of silver, copper or zinc, the melting point will be lower., You want to use a microwave that does not have the magnetron on the top but rather has it on the side or back.You can buy a microwave gold smelting kit or kiln. You place the kiln on a kiln shelf in the microwave. The crucible holds the gold while it is being heated and is placed in the kiln, with a lid on top.Don’t use the microwave for cooking food again if you have used it to melt gold, though."
"
Try using a propane torch to melt gold.,
Shape your melted gold.",How to Melt Gold3," As noted before, you must be extremely careful about safety concerns if you are going to use a torch. However, a torch will melt gold within a few minutes.


The gold should be placed into a crucible. Then, put the crucible on a fireproof surface, and direct a torch toward the gold within the crucible. If you add the chemical borax to the gold first, you can melt it at lower temperatures, which might be needed if you’re using a torch.
Be careful to bring the torch down slowly if you have fine powdered gold in the crucible because you could easily blow it around. Heating the crucible too fast also could crack it. You want to heat it thoroughly and slowly. An oxy-acetylene torch will melt the gold faster than propane.With a torch, hold the flame well above the gold powder and slowly work in a circular motion. Once the powder begins to heat up and turn red, you can begin to work the torch in slowly until your powder is reduced to a nugget.

, You need to decide what you are going to do with the melted gold. Perhaps you want to sell it in a new form. You could try to make an ingot out of it or another shape, like a gold bar.


Pour the melted gold into the ingot mold or other mold before it hardens. Then, let the gold cool. The mold should be made from similar material as the crucible
Don’t forget to clean up your mess! You never want to leave heat sources unattended or in the reach of children.

Gather your materials.,
Ensure that your safety equipment is of a high quality.,
Use an induction furnace.,
Obtain necessary fuel.,
Compose the outer body.,
Line the foundry bottom with a kiln shelf brick, or fire brick.This will catch any flux or spilled metal and prevent further to damage to people or materials outside the foundry.

,
Line the interior floor and walls.,
Coat the exposed kaowool (which will form your foundry interior) with ITC-100 or satanite.,
Drill an entrance hole for the propane tank.,
Prepare your propane burner.,

Position your foundry over sand or dirt.Molten metal can explode if it is spilled and comes in contact with concrete, so it is safest to do your DIY foundry work over dirt and sand, substances that will safely absorb the high-temperature material.

,
Place the crucible in the foundry.,
Turn on your propane burner.,
Cover the foundry with your lid.,
Place copper pieces in the crucible.,
Check the temperature.,
Pour melted copper into a mold or cast.",How to Melt Copper," DIY foundries consist of the furnace body, insulation/lining, crucible, propane tank and burner, as well as a lid. You will also need protective gloves, a suitable face guard, and a set of lifting tongs for moving the crucible. Keep in mind that while is is possible to construct a safe furnace, it is exceedingly important that you properly insulate your foundry to prevent any injury to yourself or others.


DIY furnace bodies are typically cylindrical and made of metal. Depending on the size of your furnace — which you can determine by the volume of metal you would like to melt — you can use metal cans from bulk food purchases, or a stainless steel crockpot.
Kaowool (a ceramic fiber with high-heat resistance) is an ideal lining for metal melting furnaces.Crucibles are the container in which you will place the metal scraps to be melted. The liquified copper will pool here; it is necessary that you use a material that will not melt or crack at the temperatures needed to melt your copper. Clay graphite is a common choice.For the propane burner, you do not want something used for cooking, but instead a torch-like fixture to position through the foundry exterior and by the crucible. These are widely available online.
The lid will be fashioned out of a smaller top portion of whatever you choose to be your foundry body. Foundry lids have a small hole in the top that allows for ventilation and the prevention of dangerous pressure build-up.;
, High temperature gloves used in the molten metal industry, as well as a face shield of durable material are recommended. It is useful to know that your flame itself will not be reaching the necessary temperatures; thanks to proper insulation, the crucible center will be super-heated to a point where copper will melt.

, Because copper has a high melting temperature of 1083°C (1981°F), induction furnaces are typically needed. Although highly expensive industrial machines, induction furnaces will guarantee for a level of safety that is not present in self-constructed foundries. The two most common types are double push-up, and tilting furnaces.Double push up furnaces rapidly heat metal in individual ""shots"" or rounds. The advantage here is that you can start and stop your process easily and not waste energy when only melting a small amount of metal.
Tilting furnaces are often used in industrial settings. They continuously melt large amounts of copper and are automated to pour into a ceramic container or any desired metal cast/mold.

, If you decide to build your own furnace, you will need enough fuel to provide a consistent burn. In the casting industry, natural gas is the essential go-to. However, it is also possible to work with charcoal alone.


Originally metal workers used charcoal and coal. Presently propane and natural gas are used because it saves time and allows blacksmiths to focus on their work.
One downside of charcoal is that it gives off harmful smoke and will require more attention in maintaining proper temperature.

, For small scale copper metal melting it will be sufficient to create a furnace 6 in. to 1 ft. in diameter. Furnaces are commonly shaped like cylindrical prisms.


Bulk canned foods (such as peaches and soups) can provide a metal can of the proper size and shape for your DIY furnace.
For something larger, stainless steel crockpots can also be easily converted into a foundry.

,, Use kaowool. Kaowool is a synthetic mineral wool (sometimes referred to as ceramic fiber) that has a high heat-resistance.It is not necessary to use adhesive between the foundry walls and the kaowool. Simply arch and form the kaowool into place along the curved interior walls; it will hold its form.


Kaowool is made of a blend of alumina, silica, and kaolin.

, This will increase its durability over time and help to maintain the high temperatures needed to melt copper and other metals.


ITC-100 is an infrared reflector which will send back up to 98% of the heat that touches it.coating used inside of kilns and elements. Using this can help protect your kiln, and also save fuel.
Satanite needs to be mixed with water until it forms a pasty solution, and then painted onto the kaowool with a brush.

, Using an electric drill and hole-cutter bit, drill through the foundry exterior roughly two inches above the interior floor's height.


The entrance should be angled down at roughly 30˚. Should any metal fall from the crucible (or should the crucible break), this will prevent any dangerous material falling into the propane tube.
The circumference of the hole should be only slightly larger than that of the propane burner, so that is is held securely in place.

, Propane burners for a forge can be purchased online. These important devices attach to your propane tank and create the consistent flame that will be building temperature inside the forge.


Once the burner is safely attached to your propane tank, slide it snuggly into the pre-drilled entrance.
Do not insert the burner completely through the hole. The flare should be 1.5in. from the chamber center to protect it from high-temperature damage.Always keep your propane tank's valves closed when not in use.

, If you are using a can as your foundry, simply cut the top 2 inches off and line the interior with kaowool and a proper coating. Drill a hole in the top of your lid. This will serve to release pressure and allow you to safely add metal scraps into the forge while it is at peak temperatures.

, Crucibles are made of steel, silicon carbide, and often clay graphite. They resist high temperatures and will hold and heat the copper you are melting. Keep in mind that you will also need proper tongs to grasp the crucible if you intend to pour your liquid copper solution into any molds. Tongs must hold the crucible firmly within slipping.If you would like to make your own crucible, you can repurpose old materials like fully used fire extinguishers.

, Scraps of copper are common in many home appliances and electronics.


Copper is used to make wires, electronics, appliances and motors, and is therefore commonly found around the house. You can find copper in cookware, furniture, wires and pipes.
Appliances that utilize copper include air conditioners, dishwashers, heat pumps, freezers, refrigerators, washing machines, clothes dryers, garbage disposals, dehumidifiers, and stoves. Decorative and utilitarian items can also contain copper: fire screens, large clocks, bells, jewelry, etc.
Be aware that it is illegal to melt U.S. pennies or nickels., Depending on the size of scraps this can mean more than just carrying a few wires to your backyard. Potentially you have large, heavy slabs of copper that will require more serious effort to move.


This may involve either light or heavy-duty trucks, conveyor belts, and potentially stationary or mobile cranes depending on the scale of you operation., Because of the various shapes of recycled copper pieces, it can be physically difficult to efficiently fit them in a foundry. Working with larger slabs of metal will require heavy manual labor. Commonly the ""drop-ball"" method is used, which involves using heavy duty machinery to slam the pieces at high speed in order to break it apart.


Be aware that this process can create a serious safety hazard. Flying pieces of metal quickly become a physical threat. Make sure this process is performed in isolation. Anyone near the operation should be protected by appropriate blockades, walls, etc. to ensure they will not be struck and/or injured.

, Once you have reduced all larger pieces of copper to a workable size, use a torch to produce samples that will fit easily in a foundry. Torches using compressed gas are most common in the cutting of metals.Always wear a face mask to protect yourself from burning debris.
Copper has a high heat-resistance and can be difficult (though not impossible) to cut with a gas torch. Plasma torches and powder cutting torches are often used when cutting super-conductors like copper and bronze.

, Use an automated metal baler to pressure high quantities of metal scraps into smaller pieces. Balers are typically made of steel, operating with a hydraulic ram to crush the desired materials.,, Inspect the interior of your foundry for any foreign objects that could interfere with the crucible's balance or the melting process. Also ensure the crucible is entirely dry. If molten metal comes in contact with foreign objects or water, an explosion can occur.Before lighting your flame, also ensure that the crucible fits securely inside.

, Lighting the flame will begin the process of building a formidable internal temperature high enough to melt your copper. As the charcoal begins to burn, your foundry is almost ready to take in metal scraps.

, With only a hole on the top, your foundry should be almost entirely closed off at this point. Now the crucible's interior space can create the intensity needed to superheat whatever scraps of copper will be placed inside.

, As they are already compacted and cut from earlier steps, it should be easy to fit a large amount of pieces in at once, and make your melting process more efficient. Be careful though not to insert so many pieces that, once melted, would cause overflow and breaching of the crucible's lip.


Always wear heat-resistant gloves and a face guard when beginning the actual metal melting process.

, Copper melts at 1981°F. In order to check that your foundry is hot enough you will need to use a high-temperature thermocouple probe. There are both disposable and reusable models available for purchase from different companies within the metal working industry.

, Once the desired amount of copper is ready. Prepare the mold on a safe space (ideally sand or another heat-resistant ground surface. Grasp the crucible with your tongs, lift it from the foundry and slowly pour your liquified copper into the desired cast.

Seek advice online or from foundry workers to find a furnace setup suitable for your budget, the volume of metal you plan to melt, and all types of metal you might want to use it for.


Popular metalworking forums online include IForgeIron. The hobbyists and professionals there should be able to advise you.;
, Melting brass requires a great deal of preparation, and a special furnace that can heat the brass rapidly before too much of the component metals oxidize. Purchase a metal melting furnace that can reach 2,000ºF (1,100ºC), constructed from a refractory material that can withstand this heat.Most brass will melt at temperatures as low as 1,650ºF (900ºC), but a higher maximum temperature will give you a margin of error, and make the brass easier to pour.


Select a furnace large enough to hold the crucible and brass you intend to melt.
Consider the fuel you will be using. Waste oil is a free fuel source, but the furnace may be more expensive. Propane furnaces are cleaner, but require you to keep purchasing more fuel. Solid fuel furnaces may be cheapest to purchase, or make yourself, but require significant fuel expense and cleanup if used frequently.

, You may already have brass items ready for melting, but if you want more raw material, thrift stores and yard sales are often treasure troves. Failing that, you can try contacting local scrap yards. Remove the brass from other materials, especially non-metallic objects such as glass, plastic, paper, and cloth.

, Wash the brass with soapy water to remove surface contaminants such as oils and excess oxidation prior to performing the melt. If the brass is lacquered, remove the lacquer with acetone, lacquer thinner, or paint stripper.


Always wear gloves and work in a ventilated area while removing lacquer, especially if using paint stripper.

, A crucible holds the molten metal while it is in the furnace. For brass alloys, a graphite crucible may be the best option owing to its durability and ability to be heated quickly.Crucibles made from other materials are available, but make sure they can withstand the high temperature required.


Before using a new graphite crucible, heat it to 200ºF (95ºC) for 20 minutes and let cool. This removes excess moisture that can cause spattering.Each crucible should only be used for one alloy. If you also plan to melt aluminum, iron, or other metals, they will each need their own crucible.

, You'll need tongs, a skimming spoon, and a pouring shank to handle the metal. Steel tongs are used to grip the crucible and place it in or out of the furnace. A steel skimming spoon is used to remove dross from the surface of the metal before pouring. Finally, a pouring shank is needed to hold the crucible in place and allow you to tilt it for pouring.


If you are able to weld, you may fabricate these tools yourself from scrap.
Optionally, purchase a pyrometer for measuring high temperatures, to make it easier to determine when the brass is ready to pour.

, An outdoor area is almost a necessity for melting brass, as the creation of toxic fumes is almost impossible to avoid. An open garage or similar structure may be a good option.


Even when melting other metals, make sure your furnace has sufficient ventilation. Furnaces require a great deal of air, and may produce carbon dioxide and other gases, depending on the fuel source.

, Even apparently dry materials, especially concrete, can contain trapped moisture. If a drop of molten metal comes into contact with moisture, the liquid will transform into steam and rapidly expand, spraying the molten metal with force.To avoid this scenario, place a box of dry sand near the furnace, and always carry and pour molten metal above this sand., The easiest way to handle molten brass is to pour it into metal ingot molds. Casting the brass into more complex shapes takes considerably more preparation. Look up information on sand casting or foam inclusion casting if you are interested in casting machine parts or artwork. Find expert supervision for these processes if possible, as success rate can be low for beginners.

, Accept that melting metal in your backyard is a hobby that will probably lead to the occasional accident. This doesn't have to be a big deal, as long as you don't skimp on protection. Leather gloves, leather boots, and a heat-resistant apron should protect you from most minor incidents. These are often available as welding safety equipment.

, Wear long sleeves and long pants underneath your protective gear, to prevent molten metal drops from landing on your bare skin. Cotton and wool tend to extinguish themselves quickly. Avoid synthetic materials, which can burn for a long time or melt to your skin.

, Wear a protective mask to guard your face from drops of molten metal, whenever you handle the hot metal. Put on a welding mask or dark goggles before heating metal to 2,400ºF (1,300ºC) or above, to protect your eyes from overexposure to UV light., Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, sometimes with other metals added. Zinc has a relatively low boiling point (1,665ºF = 907ºC), which is often reached before the brass is fully melted. This causes the zinc to burn, producing a white smoke that can cause temporary flu-like symptoms when inhaled. Other materials such as lead may also be present, which can cause long-term damage after repeated exposure. A respirator rated for metal fume (P100 particulates) should protect you from these dangers.


Children are at higher risk of lead poisoning than adults, and should be kept well away from the furnace while it is in use.

, All flammable and wet materials should be removed from the area, as these can cause fires and steam explosions when drops of molten metal hit them. Keep your workspace clear of all nonessential tools and objects, to give yourself a clear path between the furnace and the molds.

, Don't keep moisture to close to your furnace, but do have a source of cold, running water in the same general area, or at least a large bucket of cold water. If you are burned, immediately immerse the affected area in water, without pausing to remove clothing.

, Preheat the metal molds to a temperature above 212ºF (100ºC) to remove all moisture, or the molten metal will spatter when poured.Remove them from the heat and place them on dry sand. Preheating your skimmer spoon is also recommended, for the same reason., Position the crucible into your furnace. In solid-fuel furnaces, charcoal is often packed around the crucible, but follow the instructions for your furnace model or type of home-built furnace.

, Follow the instructions that came with your furnace, or follow the advice of experienced hobbyists if you built your own backyard furnace. Usually, this involves adding solid fuel or turning on the gas, then lighting it with a torch.

, After 10–30 minutes, add the pieces of brass to your crucible, handling them gently to avoid damaging the crucible. Waiting until the furnace is partially heated may help heat the brass rapidly, giving less time for the zinc in the alloy to separate and burn off.

, The amount of time this takes will vary greatly with the strength of the furnace. If you have a pyrometer for measuring high temperature, keep in mind that most brass will be fully molten at about 1,700ºF (930ºC), but this can vary by about 50ºF (a difference of 27ºC) depending on the type of brass. If you do not have a pyrometer, move on to the next step once the metal is glowing orange to orange yellow, or when the color becomes almost invisible in daylight.Remember to avoid any smoke that emerges from the furnace, and to wear safety equipment while nearby.
While heating metal slightly above the melting point makes it easier to pour, overheating can cause its own problems, such as oxidization. Judging when the metal is ready to pour becomes easier with practice.

, Use your steel skimming spoon to remove the top layer of discolored or oxidized dross from the brass, and deposit this waste onto dry sand. This will also give you a sense of whether the brass is fully melted, but try not to stir the brass or extend the spoon deep into the metal. Stirring too much can mix air and gas into the metal, which can cause defects.


Note that some other metals, such as aluminum, create gases on their own, and require stirring to release these.

, Lift the crucible out of the furnace with steel tongs, and deposit it into the ring of the pouring shank. Use the shank and tongs to lift the crucible and pour it carefully into the molds. Some spill is likely to occur, which is why the molds are kept over dry sand to minimize spatter. You may now fill the crucible with more brass, or turn off your furnace and wait for everything to cool down.


The furnace may take many hours to cool, but the ingots should be ready to handle well before that.

Determine the size of the furnace for your needs.,
Choose materials that will withstand the flame temperature of your fuel.,
Form two cylinders using available materials.,
Attach your outer cylinder to a metal base to help support it.,
Fit firebrick into the bottom of the outer cylinder, making them as tight as possible.,
Set the inner cylinder inside the outer cylinder with an equal space around it.,
Drill or cut a 2 1⁄4 inch (5.7 cm) hole through the outer and inner cylinders just above the top of the firebrick bottom, at an angle off center so the air will swirl around the crucible feeding the burning fuel with oxygen most effectively.

,
Cut a section of 2 inch (5.1 cm) metal pipe (EMT conduit works well) two or more feet long to act as the air feed to the burning chamber and attach it to the outer cylinder with sheet metal screws, or by welding it.

,
Cut another piece of sheet metal large enough to cover the top of the furnace.,
Fabricate your crucible (melting pot).,
Attach your air blower to the 2 inch (5.1 cm) pipe.,
Set a half fire brick or build a support for your crucible so that it will remain stationary during use.,
Fill the space between the burning chamber and the crucible with charcoal to within an inch or so of the top of the crucible.,
Turn the blower on when the charcoal is ignited sufficiently to sustain fire.,
Tend the furnace until your metal is melted, removing ash and trash that accumulates as it melts, then remove the crucible to pour your melted metal into ingot molds or other castings.

",How to Build a Metal Melting Furnace for Casting," For casting a small item such as a hand print or other object weighing less than a few pounds, a 12 inch (30.5 cm) burning chamber with a 1 quart volume crucible should work.;
, We are using charcoal here because it is readily available and inexpensive. It has a flame temperature (heat value) of about 2,300 °F (1,260 °C) with a forced air blower. Coal has a flame temperature oven 3,000 °F (1,650 °C) with forced air, so charcoal is more practical as far as construction materials are concerned, even steel will burn out with a coal fired assembly and forced air. This project uses 14 gauge galvanized steel for the burner container.

, The images show one built by bending 12 inch (30.5 cm) pieces of sheet metal, but people have successfully melted aluminum in steel paint cans and garbage cans. These burn out after a few uses, so you need to weigh the cost of building a more substantial furnace with the length of time you hope to use it.


The inside cylinder should be large enough to accommodate the melting pot crucible you plan on using, allowing space for the fuel to encircle it, and deep enough to allow the crucible to sit beneath the lid you will be adding later. An 8 inch (20.3 cm) crucible will require a 14 inch (35.6 cm) burning chamber, and if the crucible is 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep, the chamber should be at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall.
While an outside chamber is required, it adds a significant safety factor in the event the inner chamber burns out, and increases the efficiency of the burning fuel by insulating the inner chamber somewhat. This chamber should be 4 inches (10.2 cm) larger in diameter than the burning chamber, and at least a few inches taller. An outside cylinder suited for the measurement described above would be about 16–18 inches (40.6–45.7 cm) tall, and have a diameter of 16 inches (40.6 cm).

, It can be welded or screwed down. If you build your base larger than the cylinder, it will be more stable and safer to operate.

, These will be the material the burning fuel will rest on, and firebrick have a very high temperature resistance, and will help keep the heat inside the burning chamber as well.

, You can fill this space with flamestop mortar or dry sand to stabilize it, or simply wedge it with metal pieces to keep the cylinder centered.

,,, Cut a 6X6 inch hole in the center to allow air flow and so you can add metal to the crucible. You may find it handy to hinge this piece to the outer cylinder or to add a handle to make removing it during use easier.

, An expended refrigerant canister can be used in a furnace of the dimensions described above, or an old stainless steel boiler might be used. You will need to attach a steel handle extending above the burning chamber so you can pull the crucible out to pour your molten metal.

, People have used old hair dryers duct taped to the tube, or a low velocity leaf blower, but if you don't have these available, anything which blows air in sufficient volume that can be adapted to your air tube will work. Keep in mind that too much air will over-burn your fuel, wasting it, and too little will not provide enough air to burn your fuel efficiently.

, Set your crucible in place on this support after placing a layer of charcoal in the bottom of the burning chamber and soaking it with charcoal lighter.

, Add your metal scrap you plan on melting, and light the charcoal.

, This should only take a few minutes, as the charcoal will begin to burn quickly when the air is turned on. Lay your lid on the furnace to trap as much heat inside as possible.

Use the forge.",How to Build a Propane Blacksmith Forge," What will the end product be? Questions like this are based on what you want to make or work with, as well as the amount of use the forge.;
, Take the goals and decide on these factors: Number of burners, size of forge, amount of usage, budget, short-cuts (do you already have a major component of a forge?), etcetera. Where the forge will be built and operated is important (this forge must be operated outdoors).

, Create a parts list as based on forge design. Affirm ""blueprints"" as to what the forge will be, part by part, and based on size.

, This can be done progressively as you make your way building components. You can build a gas forge with a $0 budget, but you'll need to scavenge parts.

, There are two major ends of the gas forge, which are the body and the burners. The body can be any metal container such as an air tank or 5 gallon (18.9 L) paint can. This needs to be lined with an insulating layer. Firebrick is cheap but very inefficient, while high-temperature ceramic fiber blanketing is expensive and holds heat very well.

, A book on homemade propane burners will offer insight on propane safety, engineering considerations, and efficiency. There are ways to make burners from mig welding tips and steel pipe, as shown above.


This picture depicts two propane burners with air chokes, mig-welding tip nozzles, and a shut-off to use just one burner.
If budget is a major concern and your forge design is smaller than 200 cubic inches (roughly) a propane bottle torch can be used.

, A forge stand is good if it needs to be used and moved a lot. The forge needs to be outside during operation. Properly ventilating not only the heat but the output gasses is a project on its own and doing so improperly will lead to property damage and/or death.


The picture depicts a dolly style forge cart which holds the propane underneath with tool storage. The propane bottle is removed and place away from the forge when in use.

, Use soapy water to test whether the gas line leaks or not with pressure. Use a medium-sized metal file to see how hot the forge can get and how fast it heats up. When in use, take note of how long gas lasts to budget how much work can be done on a can of propane.

, Always wear safety glasses during all work. Large and hot forge work should be done with IR protective glasses. If you are a home hobbies, try these experiments: .


Use a metal file, examine the amount of sparks produced when on a bench grinder. Anneal the piece and examine again. Quench the piece in water at an orange heat and try again.
Try making a round bar square if you have an anvil.
Make a twist in a square bar with a vice and pliers.
Heat a scrap metal file as hot as it can go. If it turns white and 'burns,' the forge is efficient enough to faggot-weld with. If it does not reach this temperature, it is fine.
Try faggot-welding two rods together using borax

Gather your materials.,
Don your protective gear.,
Get your melted brass.",How to Cast Brass1," You’ll need rubber, sand, clay, cornstarch, cold water, and tongs. You should have clay equivalent to a quarter of the amount of sand you have, and cornstarch equivalent to one percent of the amount of sand you have. You should be able to buy these materials at a home improvement store.;
, Anytime you are near or handling hot metal you need to be very careful. Wear heat-safe clothing, not just heat-resistant clothing. That means you’ll need to buy heat-safe clothing online or at a local industrial supply store. This isn’t cheap, but it is a necessity. , It is assumed you have already melted your brass before you are preparing to make it into something. You melt brass by putting it in a furnace in an iron pan, but it’s a complicated process. Learn how to melt brass before you attempt to cast anything.


To melt brass, you'll need a metal melting furnace and brass items to melt. You also will need a crucible, which is the piece of equipment that holds the melted brass in the furnace, and a skimmer spoon which is used to transport the material.
Put your crucible in your furnace following the instructions of your particular furnace model, light your furnace, and then start to fill your crucible with brass after fifteen minutes or so. Keep the furnace going until your brass has completely melted. Once you start to see discolored material on top of the molten brass then you'll know your brass has melted. Remove the discolored material using your skimmer spoon and discard it in a box of sand or a heat safe trash can.

Position your foundry.,
Place the charcoal and the crucible in the foundry.,
Insert the blower tube into the air supply port.,
Light the foundry.,
Place aluminum in the crucible.,
Remove the crucible from the foundry.,
Separate the pure aluminum from the slag.,
Cool the ingots in water.",How to Melt Aluminum1," Set your foundry in a metal stand or on an insulated surface. Make sure that the surface can withstand the more than 1220 degrees Fahrenheit (660 degrees Celsius) needed to melt the aluminum. Avoid any wooden or plastic surfaces because they will melt or burn. For the best results, set your foundry in a sturdy metal stand that will not easily tip over., Place a layer of charcoal in the bottom of the foundry and then set your crucible on top of it. Fill in the space between the insulation and the crucible with more charcoal. Make sure that the crucible is in the center of the foundry.









A steel crucible works the best for melting aluminum.Placing a layer of charcoal under the crucible will help it heat up quicker and more evenly.

, Once you have filled the foundry with charcoal and the crucible, set up your bellows. Place the steel end of the blower tube into the foundry. You can blow into the plastic end to maintain air flow or attach an electric hair dryer, which will provide a more constant flow of air.








Because it is at an angle, place something under the blower tube to prop it up. This will keep it from breaking or damaging the foundry.

, With the bellows and crucible in place, ignite the charcoal in the foundry. The easiest way to do this is with a propane torch, which will quickly heat up the coals. As the coals heat, blow through the blow tube or turn the hair dryer onto low. This will stoke the fire and help increase the heat. Place the lid on the foundry and let it warm up.








Let the foundry heat for about 10 minutes before placing aluminum inside of it.
The temperature in the foundry will need to be above 1220 degrees Fahrenheit (660 degrees Celsius).
Once the crucible is glowing orange, the foundry is hot enough to melt aluminum.

, Once the foundry is hot enough, you can begin melting aluminum. You can choose to either: remove the lid and place uncrushed cans in the crucible, or leave the lid on and place crushed cans in the crucible through the vent hole. Both methods work well, but if you leave the lid on less of the metal will be oxidized. The cans will melt in a matter of seconds, so you need to quickly add more cans to the crucible.








It is important to quickly add new cans in order to create a pool of molten aluminum. This is necessary to prevent the cans from being overheated and turning into a gas, a process known as oxidization.

, With a pair or metal tongs, slowly remove the crucible from the foundry. To prevent oxidization, be sure to remove the molten aluminum from the foundry at least three minutes after the last piece of aluminum melted.







, Once you have melted enough aluminum to fill your crucible, you will want to remove any impurities. Things like aluminum cans will have lots of other materials in them (plastics and other metals) that will create slag or dross. The slag will form a thick clumpy layer on top of your pure molten aluminum. The easiest way to remove the slag is to slowly pour out the molten aluminum into a steel mold, and then tap the slag out of the crucible.








Use a metal rod or tongs to skim slag off of the top before pouring.
Keeping the crucible clean allows you to melt more aluminum quickly.

, After pouring the molten aluminum into a mold, you will want to cool it off. The easiest way to do that is take your tongs and place the ingot into water for about 10 seconds. After soaking in the water, the ingot should be cool enough to touch. However, you should use your tongs to avoid being burned.








The pure aluminum ingots can now be reused for later castings and will not produce as much slag as before.

Use a sharp pointed tool to probe the mound carefully, so you can determine the extent of the casting below the ground.,
Uncover the top 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) of the casting, so that you are level with the adjacent ground or slightly below it.,
Dig a hole beside the mound about three feet deep, being careful to avoid damaging off-shoot tunnels or chambers.,
Use a water hose to wash the dirt out from between the chambers and tunnels, as well as to expose more of the casting if you are near a water spigot.,
Continue to remove the soil from around the casting until it becomes loose, the carefully pull it free of the ground.",How to Cast an Ant Bed," You can build a simple one using a metal pail, charcoal, and a hair dryer, along with some other commonly available items. If you are adventurous, you can even build a more substantial one, read about it here.

, Aluminum cans have a very low recovery rate if melted in an open air furnace, so look for cast aluminum scrap like automotive parts, aluminum extrusions, or other heavy pieces.
, Since casting the mound will kill the ants, you may want to find an ant bed in the fall, and wait until winter when the bed is abandoned (or at least the inhabitants are dormant, deep in the ground). Many homeowners poison beds in their lawns, so you should be able to find one that will have a minimum environmental damage. Also, remember that removing the casting will require a substantial excavation, so be prepared to restore the area you choose., You will have to take a guess at how much you need, the bed in the photos weights about 18 pounds, but at any rate, play it safe and melt more than you anticipate using. You can always pour another casting of something with any excess.
, Clear any flammable debris from the area, and make sure you have water or a fire extinguisher handy., Continue pouring until the aluminum overflows the entrance so it is completely filled.
, You can spray the top of the mound with water to speed the cooling, but it will be messy when you begin digging your casting out of the ground., Once you have the general area probed and limits established, you can begin to scrape the soil away from the aluminum.
, You can continue scraping and digging, but remember, many of the smaller tunnels and chambers are very delicate, so proceed with caution., This will allow the deeper material you scrape away to fall away easily., This will make damaging the casting less likely and allow you to work faster.
, You can now rinse the remaining dirt out of the casting and get it ready to examine.

",How to Anneal Copper,"


The acetylene tank is used for starting the flame and the oxygen tank is used to continue feeding the flame and to control the intensity of the flame.;
,


Wearing safety goggles is a precaution necessary to ensure eye safety anytime you are working with open flames.

,


Only turn the valve halfway to ensure that there is enough acetylene to start the flame, but not so much that it will be too large.

,,


A blue colored flame indicates that the flame is close to the ideal temperature for annealing copper. A flame that is too hot will burn the copper, while a flame that is too cool will not be strong enough to change the copper's properties like durability and malleability.

,


Constantly moving the flame will help to avoid burning the copper. Copper that is glowing cherry red is at the correct temperature for annealing purposes.

,,


Turning the valves back to their closed positions will ensure that the flame is extinguished. It is a safety precaution so that you can freely work with the copper without worry.

,


Use the pliers to remove the copper from the bucket of water once it returns to its original color. The copper is now annealed and will be soft and malleable for working.

Push your pattern into the sand and clay mixture.",How to Cast Brass2," Make sure you make the pattern .017 inches (0.0432 cm) larger than the finished casting to allow room for the molten brass. Brass gets smaller as it becomes a solid. Styrofoam is a popular option for making your pattern, or you can use wood if you would rather stick with the classic technique. Essentially what you’ll be doing is breaking up a three dimensional object into shapes that will be pressed into sand. The void in the sand will form the solid cast. You can make any shapes that you’d like as long as it can withstand being shoved into a box of sand. You're making a three dimensional prototype of whatever it is that you want to cast. If you want to make basic shapes like a simple doorknob, you can design the prototype on your own using some sort of clay or the materials named above. Whittling a block of wood is always a good option too. Otherwise, if you want a more complex pattern, you'll need to buy it. Oftentimes these patterns are made by experienced metalworkers.

, You can also buy a casting pattern at a home improvement store if you would rather not make your own.

, Mix sand, clay, and cornstarch. Figure out 25 percent of the amount of sand you have in order to find out how much clay to add. One percent of the amount of sand is the percentage of cornstarch you add. For example: 100g of sand = 25g of clay and 1g of cornstarch. You can eyeball this, but you might need to go through some trial and error. Now move your sand and clay into a box. , The idea is the leave indents in the mixture that will hold whatever shape you’re trying to make out of the brass.


Don’t leave the pattern pieces in the sand once you have made the holes, obviously.

, Remember to keep the furnace running until you’re ready to pour the brass. As soon as you turn the gas off the brass will start cooling. , You generally don’t want to pour more than three molds per cast. By this point the brass will have cooled down too much. Transport the brass in the iron pan that you melted it in. Be very careful and pour the brass out using the spigot. Don’t rush.

, Depending on the size of your mold this will take an hour or more. Don’t be afraid to wait a little longer if it still looks molten to you. Brass generally cools pretty quickly. , Fill a large bucket with cold water. It doesn’t have to be freezing, but it should be colder than the lukewarm water coming from your faucet. There needs to be a stark heat difference. Now pour the cold water on your hot brass and the mold. Steer clear of steam. The heat difference should crack the mold right off leaving a still hot brass piece.

, You need to wait for the brass to cool thoroughly before using it. Even though you’ve already waited a while and poured water on it, it is still hot. If you don’t wait you might burn yourself. Let it sit overnight to be safe.

, Even if you waited overnight, it’s always best to use your heat-safe gloves when you touch the metal. The brass piece should be easily removable if you cold bathed it correctly. , Whether it’s a doorknob or a collectible, it’s pretty cool that you just did that on your own. Good job!

Because of the heat you will generate, it is important that you use a steel bucket. Other materials may melt or become brittle under the intense heat generated by your foundry.

, In a five quart bucket, or larger, mix 21 cups of plaster of Paris, 21 cups of play sand, and 15 cups of water. Quickly stir the ingredients together by hand. It is important to moisten all of the dry powder and work out any lumps. After a few minutes of stirring, the mixture should be runny and a uniform color. Because the mixture will set in roughly 15 minutes, it is important that you do the step with some urgency.

, Once you have worked out any lumps, slowly pour the insulation mixture into the steel bucket. The fluid should fill the bucket, leaving about three inches of space at the top.To avoid creating a mess, pour slowly to limit splattering.

, Fill a 2.5 quart bucket with water or sand and place it in the center of the insulation mix. Slowly push the bucket into the mix. Move the bucket up and down a few times to help level the mixture before it sets. Finally, hold the bucket still for two to three minutes and let the mixture set around it.Once the plaster has hardened, the small bucket should stay in place once you remove your hands.
Let the plaster mix sit for one hour to harden.
Clean off any splattered plaster from around the top edges of the steel bucket.

, After the plaster has hardened, use a pair of pliers or channel locks to remove the plastic bucket you used to create the opening. Grip the bucket with your pliers and twist it in on itself. With enough torque, the bucket should cleanly pop free from the plaster mix., In order to promote air flow, you will need to drill a hole in your foundry for a blower tube. Use a 1-3/8” hole saw, attached to an electric drill, to cut a hole in the top line of the bucket (about three inches from the lid). Once you have cut through the bucket, position the blade at a roughly 30-degree angle and drill. This hole should be the perfect size to accommodate a one-inch steel tubing, which will act as your blower tube.The hole saw can found at your local hardware store.
Make sure that your hole saw is capable of cutting through metal.
Creating an angled air supply port will prevent molten aluminum from flowing out of the foundry if your crucible fails.

, Take a 1” x 12” steel pipe and screw on a 1” PVC coupling at one end. Once you have attached the coupling to the steel pipe, slide a 1” x 24” PVC pipe into the smooth end of the coupling. The coupling should have a threaded end for the steel pipe and a smooth end for the PVC pipe.The blower pipe should fit smoothly into the air supply port, but not so snugly that it is difficult to slide it in and out of the hole.

, Fill a 5 quart bucket with 10 cups of plaster of Paris, 10 cups of sand, and 7 cups of water. Stand up two 4” U-bolts in the plaster mixture, placing the ends with the nuts down in the mix. Let the plaster set for an hour. Once it has set, you can simply pop the lid out of the bucket. Finally, drill a hole in the top of the lid using an electric drill and a 3” hole cutting saw.The vent hole will relieve pressure inside the foundry and allow you to add metal without taking off the lid.
Try to make the lid hole the same diameter as your crucible. This will help prevent heat loss when you melt your aluminum.

Find proper pieces of aluminum.,
Wear proper safety equipment.,
Find an open or well-ventilated space.,
Use proper tools.,
Be safe.",How to Melt Aluminum3," The best sources for scrap aluminum are old machine parts. Car cylinder heads, transmission cases, water pump housings and pistons are all great examples. More common sources are things like beer and pop cans, furniture frames, home siding, window frames, and turkey and pie pans. However, these sources tend to be weaker alloys that have lots of impurities, which means that they create more slag and oxidize quickly.An easy way to melt aluminum cans and prevent oxidizing is to add them to a pool of already molten aluminum.

, When you are working around extremely high temperatures, it is important to wear proper safety gear. When handling molten metal you should wear a thick shirt, pants, an apron, a face shield or glasses, and leather gloves. These things will prevent molten metal from burning your skin. Because molten aluminum can give off noxious gasses, you should also wear a mask., When working with molten aluminum, some alloys will give off noxious fumes. Because of this you will want to work in a well-ventilated space or outdoors. This will also help keep you cool while working around extreme heat and avoid dehydration or heat stroke.If you begin feeling sick, have a headache, or are dizzy, turn down the foundry and take a break. Go to a cool place and drink some water.

, Before you begin melting aluminum, make sure that you have the necessary tools for handing molten metal. You will need a pair of metal tongs, a metal strainer or stirring rod, a crucible, and a foundry. Things like the foundry and crucible can be made at home or bought at a store or online., Because of the relatively low temperature necessary to melt aluminum, it can be melted in a variety of unsafe methods outside of a foundry. Avoid melting aluminum in large bonfires or on BBQ grills. These methods are less controlled and can lead to a fire or injury.








If you are new to working with molten metals, be sure to work with a more experienced person before attempting to melt aluminum.

Prepare the metal to be soldered.,
Apply the Flux.,
Heat the metal.,
Fluxing action begins, apply solder.,
Observe the solder deposit.,
Apply additional solder.,
Remove the excess flux with warm water and a wire brush.",How to Solder Stainless Steel," Clean the parent metal or metals to be joined. The base metal must be spotlessly clean. Prepare stainless steel surfaces with a stainless steel wire brush, by agitating the surface vigorously. Breaking the tough oxide coating on the parts is crucial to stainless steel soldering.;
, Apply the appropriate stainless steel soldering flux to break the oxide barrier and draw the solder into the joint/repair area. Use the solder wire or rod to move the flux into position if needed.

, Use a soft flame, heat gun, or soldering iron to heat the parent metal adjacent to the repair area, or on the opposite side of the joint. A direct flame on the repair area is likely to overheat the solder and flux. If using a torch, hold the torch tip 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) away from the parent metal.

, When the flux bubbles and turns brown, it is time to apply the rod. Drag the rod over the area to be soldered, until it begins to flow. Once the solder starts to flow remove the heat. If additional layers are needed, continue to drag the rod over the area.

, The solder should bond smoothly. If the solder balls up like a bead of water it has not wet to the parent metal. This is likely either due to insufficient breaking of the oxide coating or due to overheating.

, If you stopped soldering and want to apply more solder or flow out the deposit more, let it cool a little, add more flux and reheat. The flux will help the bonding process, whether adding more solder or just flowing out the previous deposit.

, Flux by its very nature is corrosive and should be removed.

Score or make a slight incision on the wire jacket.,

Pull the unwanted jacket off.,

Cut a piece of shrink tube and slide it onto one of the wires (If you are using electrical tape to cover your joint, skip this step).,

Flay both ½” pieces of copper wire.,

Push the flayed ends into each other so that the copper wires are slightly intertwined with each other.,

Add the solder flux to the connection.,

Heat the flux into the wires.,

Attach the right tip to the iron.,

Turn on the solder box.,

Pick up some solder with the iron.,

Apply the iron with the solder to the copper wire with flux.,

Inspect the joint.,

Cover the joint.",How to Solder Wires Together," You want to make the score about ½” from the end of each wire that will be soldered. To do this, you can use a pair of wire strippers, or a razor blade. Be careful, you do not want to cut the actual copper wire as it will take away from its conducting strength.

Determine the size of the wire and use the appropriate sized hole to properly strip the wire. If you do not know the size of the wire, test out the holes in the strippers to find the one that cuts into the jacket without cutting the wire.
Clamp down on the wire with the right sized hole. Now you will turn the wire 90 degrees in rotation and do the same thing. Do this a couple more times so that you have a good line around the whole wire jacket. If you are just using a razor blade, don’t forget to make the incision around the whole circumference of the jacket.;
, Once you have that slight cut in the jacket, you should be able to bend the jacket back and forth until the jacket comes loose. You can do this with the strippers or with your fingers. If it does not come loose right away try making a little deeper cut into the jacket. The idea is to get the piece of jacket off without sacrificing any copper threads., If you are using shrink tube to cover your connection, you will want to slide the shrink tube onto the wire before connecting the wires. The piece of shrink tube should be longer than the area being soldered.

The shrink tube should cover some of the jacket on each end and the ½” connection you are making. Use your scissors to cut a 1-1 ½” piece of shrink. You may test the shrink tube on a piece of the wire before getting started to make sure the tubing will shrink down to the size of the wire. Most shrink tube reduce to about 1/3 of its size after being heated.

, To make a good connection between the copper wires, you will want as much of the wires touching each other as possible. Typically, the best way to do this is to flay each end of the wire out. Do this by rubbing the wire between your fingers. The wires should now look like this., Twist and smooth the strands into each other so they hold together. The goal is to make the strands of copper from the two separate wires look like one. Make sure the area is smooth. This is the area that you will be soldering. If it is too bulky, you may not be able to fit the shrink over the joint., You can use your finger or a utensil to do this. Don’t be modest with the flux, but don’t waste it either. You can always add more later. The flux will help the solder flow into the wires so the more you have on the connection, the easier your soldering job will be. Start with a little glob on your finger or utensil and brush it onto the wires. The next step will involve heating the wire which will soak up this flux., Use your heat gun or blow dryer, assuming your blow dryer produces enough heat, to melt the flux. Do not just point the heat source at the wires. You will want to wave the heat source back and forth so there is not as much direct heat on the wires. Overheating the jacket may cause it to melt. Be careful, you do not want the shrink tube to receive any heat yet, so make sure the shrink tube is far from the area you are applying the heat., (If you have the correct tip on the iron to begin with, skip this step) A tip that is too small will not transfer enough heat to larger wires. A tip that is too big may apply too much heat and melt the jacket on the wire. The idea is to use a tip that applies just enough heat for the project. Most medium sized tips will work for soldering wire.

Do not touch anywhere above the handle of the iron. Iron tips can be attached by screwing off the barrel shown above. Always make sure the iron is off before replacing tips. If replacing the tip while the iron is on, metal attached to the soldering iron will be hot; so use caution!

, It is important to keep the solder box and iron in a safe area. You should only turn the iron on when you are ready to use it. Keep flammable objects away from the iron at all times. Remember to turn the box off as soon as you are done using it. Add water to the sponge below the soldering iron holder. This sponge can be used to clean the tip of your iron., Picking the solder up with the iron is easiest for smaller wires. You can do this by touching the tip of the iron about an inch from the end of the string of solder. The iron should automatically soak the solder right onto the tip of your iron. This allows you to focus solely on the iron instead of having to hold the solder in your other hand. If the iron is hot enough, the solder should flow right onto the copper when you touch the iron to it. Different sized wires will require different amounts of solder., With the solder already on the iron, all you need to do is touch it to the copper wires. The flux that was heated into the wires will make the solder flow right into the connection. If it does not flow easily you may need to add more flux to the wires. Repeat your previous process and try again. Again, you do not want to leave the heat source, the soldering iron in this case, in any spot for too long. You should smoothly wave the iron back and forth along the copper. Continue to pick up more solder with the iron and add it to the joint until the wires are full., The wires should now be fully joined. Look at all sides of the connection. Sometimes if the solder doesn’t flow properly, the back side of the connection may not have enough solder to properly join the wire resulting in a weak connection. A slight tug on the wires can be used to ensure a good bind., Cover the soldered connection with your shrink tube or electrical tape. Slide the shrink tube over the joint and apply heat to the area in the same way you did with the heat gun, by waving the heat source back and forth so there is less direct heat on the jacket. If you have forgot to put the shrink tube on the wires, you may always use electrical tape to cover the area; shrink tube just works well in most situations as it looks cleaner and doesn’t leave an adhesive residue."

Rinse the silver.",How to Solder Silver," Soldering will not succeed if too much heat is lost to the air or work surface, so you will need to find a specialized surface with low heat conduction. A charcoal soldering block may be the best option for soldering silver, as it reflects heat to create the high temperature silver requires.A magnesia soldering block or a kiln break are other common options, and may last through more soldering projects than charcoal.


These can be purchased at craft stores or jewelry supply stores, and are similar in size and shape to an ordinary building brick.;
, Silver solder is an alloy formed from silver and other metals, designed to join with silver but melt at a lower temperature. You may purchase this as a container of pre-cut chips, or purchase it in sheet or wire form and cut off 1/8 inch (3mm) chips with wire cutters.Do not attempt to use lead solder when soldering silver, as it will usually fail to work and is difficult to remove.Warning: Avoid silver solders containing cadmium, which may cause health problems if fumes are inhaled.
If you are filling a crack, you may want to use a lower-purity ""easy"" silver solder, as it melts at a lower temperature. For joining two pieces together, use ""medium"" or ""hard"" silver solder with more silver content, to create a stronger bond.Note that there is no industry-wide definition for these terms; if you are switching brands and want results similar to what you're used to, look at the percentage of silver content instead.

, Do not use a soldering iron, as these are intended for use with lower temperature lead solder and may ruin precious metals. Purchase a small oxy-acetylene torch instead from the hardware store, preferably with a flat ""chisel tip"" rather than a pointed one.Silver quickly conducts heat away from the location exposed tot he flame. Because of this, a small torch tip may make the soldering go much more slowly., A ""flux"" is necessary to clean the silver's surface and assist in heat transfer. It also helps remove oxides on the silver's surface, which would interfere with the bond. You may use a general purpose flux, or a ""blazing flux"" specifically for silver or jewelry.


""Brazing"" flux is used for high temperature joining, in which the surface of the metal objects themselves are chemically altered. While even jewelers refer to this process as ""soldering"" instead, ""brazing"" is technically the correct term.It doesn't matter which form of flux you purchase. (For instance, paste or liquid.)

, Open the windows or turn on a fan in order to minimize the amount of fumes you inhale, moving the air over the work area and away from you. Keep strong breezes away from the object itself, however, or their cooling effect may make the soldering process difficult., Copper tongs are recommended, as they can handle high heat and will not corrode and ruin the pickling solution described below. Tweezers are useful for holding the silver objects in place, although these can be made from any metal.

, Safety goggles are essential to protect your eyes from accidental spatter, since you may need to look closely at the joint.A denim or canvas apron minimizes the chance of burning your clothing.


Avoid loose or dangling clothing. Pull back long sleeves and tie back long hair before you begin working.

, You'll need a container of water to rinse off the silver at the end of the process. Make sure this is deep enough to dip the silver object.

, Purchase a ""pickle,"" or acidic solution used in soldering, specifically labeled for its suitability for silver. These usually come in powder form. Right before you begin soldering, dissolve the powder in water and use a crock pot or specialized ""pickle pot"" to heat it according to the manufacturer's instructions.


Do not use a crock pot, microwave, or oven that you intend to use again for cooking. The pickle may leave behind a metallic smell or even trace amounts of toxic materials. Never put steel in contact with pickle.
Most prepared pickle solutions can keep for several weeks., A degreasing solution is recommended for oily or heavily handled silver.If there is oxidization on the surface, you may need to place the silver in a pickle solution before soldering. Optionally, you may use 1000 grit sandpaper to make a rougher surface for joining., Prepare the flux according to instructions on the packaging, if it is not ready to use. Use a small paintbrush to apply this flux onto the silver object(s). Some people apply flux only where the solder will be present, in order to limit the amount of solder that flows to the wrong place. Others prefer to apply the flux over a larger area to minimize the risk of fire damage, but this is not recommended for beginners.Using a small amount of flux in a separate container is recommended, as repeatedly dipping a brush into the original bottle may add dirt and affect its function.

, Lay the two components next to each other on the soldering brick. Position them exactly as you want them to be joined, noting that they must be physically touching to be joined properly.

, Use a pair of tweezers to pick up a solder chip and gently place it on one end of the crack or gap to be joined. Once melted, the solder will be drawn by the heat anywhere flux was applied, so you do not need to cover the entire length of the gap., Light your torch and adjust the heat to its highest setting. Begin by holding the torch about 4 inches (10 cm) away from the joint, moving it constantly in small circles to ensure even heating of all components. Slowly move the flame closer to the joint, focusing on the metal objects near the solder, not the solder itself.When the solder reaches its melting point, it will quickly melt and be pulled onto the fluxed areas of the silver.


If one of the objects to be joined is thicker than the other, heat the thicker object from the back until the solder starts to melt, then heat the thin object briefly.Use tweezers if necessary to hold the objects in place, but place them on the far end of the silver, away from the flame. You may need to hold down small, thin areas of the silver to provide a heat sink, preventing the thin area from melting.

, Let the object cool for a minute, then cool it further by dipping it into a water bath. The ""pickle"" solution described in the work area section is an acidic bath used to clean the jewelry after soldering. Lower the silver into this bath using copper tongs, and leave it for a few minutes to remove the flux and oxidization. Avoid all contact with your skin, clothing, or steel tools, as the pickle bath can be corrosive.

, Rinse the newly joined silver with water. Pat dry with a clean cloth. If the process was completed correctly, the silver should remain joined permanently.

Locate the terminals for the component to be removed.,
Clean the terminals.,
Attach a heat sink.,
Clean your soldering iron as it heats.,
Push down on the desoldering pump.,
Heat the old solder with your soldering iron.,
Vacuum up the melted solder.,
Empty the desoldering pump into the trash.,
Troubleshoot difficult connections.,
Clean the board.",How to Desolder1," A desoldering pump, also called a solder sucker, vacuums up melted solder to separate soldered components from a circuit board. Thoroughly examine both sides of the board to isolate the specific spots holding each component in place.


The desoldering pump works best for through-hole connections. You can use it on surface-mounted devices as well, but it is less effective.That said, it's one of the cheapest options.
You can easily ruin a circuit board by accidentally separating the board layers during the desoldering process. Ensure that you only desolder the exact pins you need to remove a faulty component.;
, Using isopropyl alcohol on a toothbrush, gently clean the terminals of the component(s) to be removed.Ensure that you clean only the terminals on the soldered side of the board and not anything on the component side.

, The heat from the soldering iron can damage sensitive components such as integrated circuits or transistors. To dissipate some of the heat, clip a metal alligator clip between the component and the terminal you plan to desolder., Turn your soldering iron on and let it heat up for about three minutes. Using a wet sponge make quick passes from base to tip over your soldering iron to clean it.You may see a tiny bit of smoke as you pass the sponge, but it’s just from the moisture in the sponge.

, Press the end of the pump until it clicks into place. This compresses a spring, and latches it in the depressed position.

, Using the tip of your soldering iron, heat the old solder until it melts. You can push the terminal with the soldering iron tip at the same time to help free the component as the old solder melts.Use an old soldering iron if you have one, since pushing with the iron can wear the iron down.

, Touch the tip of the desoldering pump to the solder pad and melted solder, without applying pressure.Release the spring (usually by pushing a button on the side) and the piston will shoot back quickly. This creates a vacuum which pulls the melted solder up into the pump.The tip of the pump may melt a little during use. Most pumps either have replaceable tips or are cheap to begin with, but you can try to reduce the damage by pausing for a moment after melting the solder.
Melted solder can harden again quickly. Work with only one terminal at a time. For the greatest efficiency, hold the soldering iron in one hand and keep the desoldering pump ready in the other.

, After each use, push the pump down again over a trash can to re-arm it and to clear out the solder. If you leave the old solder inside, it can leak back out as you go to vacuum the next terminal.

, It often takes multiple passes with the soldering iron and pump before the component is free. If you're not making progress after a few tries, try any or all of these adjustments:


Apply flux first to help the melted solder flow.
Melt a little new solder to mix in with the old, hardened solder.For through-hole connections, use the tip of the soldering iron to gently wiggle the terminal from side to side. This breaks the connection to the sides of the hole., You may notice brown resin stuck around the solder pad, since this can melt when heated. You can remove this with a commercial resin cleaner, or scrape it away very carefully with a small, flat-head screwdriver or steel wool. Finish by cleaning the area with a toothbrush dampened with isopropyl alcohol.Sometimes, the pressure from the iron or pump will shift the solder pad slightly. It should still work as long as the traces connecting the pad to other components are still intact. If the traces are broken, you will need to solder on new ones.If there are still traces of solder on the pad, it's easy to pick these up using a desoldering braid, described below.

Remove the excess flux and oxide.",How to Solder Aluminum," Pure aluminum can be soldered, although it is not an easy metal to work with. Many aluminum objects are actually aluminum alloys. Most of these can be soldered the same way, but a few of them are very difficult to work with and may need to be taken to a professional welder. If the aluminum alloy is marked with a letter or number, look it up to see if there are any specific requirements. Unfortunately, unlabeled aluminum alloys can be difficult to tell apart, and professional identification guides are likely only worthwhile if you are running a business.You may need to just dive in and test your luck.


If you are joining aluminum to another metal, the aluminum's properties are usually the limiting factor, so precise identification of the other alloy's composition may not be necessary. Note that some combinations such as aluminum-steel are extremely difficult or may require specialized welding methods instead of solder.;
, Aluminum melts at a relatively low 1220ºF (660ºC), which combined with its high heat capacity makes it almost impossible to solder using general-purpose solders. You'll need a specialized solder with a significantly lower melting point, which you may need to order online. Typically, an alloy made from some combination of aluminum, silicon, and/or zinc is used for this purpose, but check the label to make sure it is intended for your type of join, such as aluminum-aluminum or aluminum-copper.


Technically, filler metals that melt above 840ºF (450ºC) join by brazing instead of soldering. In practice, these are often sold as solders, and the process is similar. Brazing creates a stronger bond, but soldering is preferred for pieces with electrical circuits or other delicate materials.
Avoid solders that contain lead whenever possible.

, Much like the solder, the flux should be specialized for aluminum or for the combination of metals you plan to join. The easiest option is to purchase the flux from the same source as your solder, as they are likely intended to work together. The recommended temperature for the flux you select should be similar to the melting point of your solder. Select a brazing flux if the solder you chose melts above 840ºF (450ºC).


Some brazing fluxes are not intended for use on thin aluminum sheets or wire. Look for ""dip brazing"" flux for these applications instead., You can use a soldering iron for joining aluminum wire, but other jobs will require the use of a torch. Typically, a low-temperature torch is used, with a flame tip that reaches 600 to 800ºF (315–425ºC).


If torch use is not feasible in your work space, try a 150 watt soldering iron.

, You'll need a clamp if you are joining more than one piece of metal, rather than making small repairs in a single object. A pickling solution, or special substance for cleaning off post-soldering oxides, is also recommended. Some resin-based fluxes must be cleaned off with acetone.

, Protect yourself from toxic fumes by wearing a respirator mask and working in a well-ventilated area. A face mask or goggles are highly recommended, as are heavy leather gloves and non-synthetic clothing. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby and work over non-flammable surfaces only.

, Large joins or difficult combinations such as aluminum-steel can benefit greatly from ""tinning,"" or the application of a small layer of solder to each component part. Follow the instructions below for each piece you plan on joining, then repeat with the pieces clamped together.


Ignore this step if you are using solder to repair a crack or hole in a single object.

, Aluminum forms aluminum oxide rapidly upon contact with air, and this thin layer of oxide cannot be joined. Scrub it off thoroughly with a steel brush, but read the instructions below first. Be prepared to clean, flux, and solder in rapid sequence so the oxide does not get another chance to form.


Old aluminum with heavy oxidization or other surface debris may require sanding or grinding, or wiping with isopropyl alcohol and acetone.

, If you are connecting two pieces rather than repairing a single object, clamp the two pieces together in the position you wish to join them. There should be a slight gap between them for the solder to flow along, but keep this to 1/25"" (1 mm) or less.


If the pieces do not fit together smoothly, you will need to make the joined areas smooth through sanding or bending.
Because the aluminum should be given as little chance to oxidize as possible, you may wish to clamp the pieces together loosely, clean them while they are clamped, then tighten the clamp.

, Immediately after cleaning the metal, apply the flux along the area to be joined using a rod of solder or a small metal tool. This will prevent further oxide from forming and draw the solder along the length of the join.


If soldering wires, dip them in the liquid flux instead.
If your flux came in powder form, refer to the label for mixing instructions.

, Use your torch or soldering iron to heat the metal object adjacent to the join, starting at the lower end of the workpiece. A direct flame on the repair area is likely to overheat the solder and flux. If using a torch, hold the torch tip at least 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) away from the parent metal.Move the heat source constantly in small, slow circles to evenly heat the area.


Soldering irons may take up to ten minutes to heat up before they can be used.
If the flux turns black, let the area cool, clean it & start over.

, Most fluxes will bubble and turn light brown when they have reached the correct temperature. Drag the rod or wire of solder material over the join, continuing to heat the area indirectly from the opposite side of the metal, or a nearby surface. It should be drawn along the gap already, but constant, slow movement on your part is necessary to create an even bead. Making an attractive and strong even join can take practice if you haven't done much soldering before.


If the solder will not bond to the aluminum, it could be that more aluminum oxide formed on the surface, in which case it needs to be cleaned and immediately soldered again. It could also be that you have the wrong type of solder, or your aluminum is actually a difficult-to-join alloy.

, If you are using a water-based flux, the flux can be rinsed off with water once the finished piece has cooled. If you are using a resin-based flux, use acetone instead. After the flux is removed, you may wish to put the finished piece in a ""pickling solution"" to remove any oxides that may have been created under the high heat.

Clean the pipe where it will be joined.,
Apply the tinning flux to the pipe.,
Heat the copper joint.,
Apply the solder to the joint.,
Allow the solder to harden.",How to Solder Pipe," Most importantly, you'll need a propane torch. This is a small propane tank with a regulator fitted on top; some have an automatic igniter, while others will require a striker to ignite the gas. You will also need lead-free solder (leaded solder can leach into your water supply, causing health problems). A tube cutter is the ideal tool for cutting copper pipes, but a hacksaw will also work. To clean the pipe, you will need some 120-grit emery cloth and a small can of tinning flux. All of these supplies can be purchased from a hardware store.
, Copper tubing is soft, and is best cut with a tube cutter. To use a tube cutter, tighten the tool around the pipe and then rotate it around, lowering the blade more with each turn. After several rotations, the pipe will break off cleanly. A hacksaw will also work, but it will leave a rougher edge that will make it harder to achieve a leak-proof joint., Insert the reaming attachment of the tube cutter into the freshly cut pipe and rotate it a full revolution. This will remove the metal shavings produced when cutting the pipe., Use the 120-grit emery cloth to clean any dirt, oil, or corrosion off the parts of the pipe that will be joined. Rub the cloth thoroughly against the surface of the pipe; the copper should be shiny when you are done. To clean the interior, wrap the emery cloth around your finger and rotate your finger around inside the pipe. Avoid touching the pipe with your bare hands after cleaning it., Use a small brush to apply a thin layer of tinning flux to the pipe where it will be joined. After applying the flux, fit the pipe into its joint until it is fully seated, wiping away any excess flux. The tinning flux will acid-clean the copper as its heats, which will help the solder to flow evenly., Turn on your propane torch, and adjust the gas regulator until the inner blue cone of your flame is about 1-1/4 inches (3.2 cm) long. The hottest point of the flame is the very tip of this cone, so hold the torch so that the cone's tip is just touching the copper joint. You do not need to move the flame around; copper conducts heat evenly and quickly, so the surrounding areas will heat sufficiently if the flame is positioned against the joint., After briefly allowing the joint to heat, hold the tip of your solder against the point where the pipe meets the joint. Always hold the solder on the opposite side of the pipe as your flame; this will ensure that you are applying solder to the coldest part of the joint. The reason is simple: if the coldest part is hot enough to melt the solder, then the entire joint will be hot enough and the solder will flow easily. When you touch the solder to the joint, it will immediately melt and disappear into the joint through capillary action. A little goes a long way; be careful not to apply so much solder that it leaks out of the joint., Remove your flame from the pipe and allow the joint to set. The solder will be hard in less than a minute, and the joint should return to room temperature within 10 minutes."

Choose a braid slightly narrower than the solder pad.,
Add a little flux to the braid.,
Melt on a little more solder onto the terminal.,
Place the desoldering braid on the joint.,
Place the soldering iron over the braid.,
Spool out more braid as needed.,
Remove the component once cooled.",How to Desolder2," Also called a solder wick, this tool is a braid made from fine copper wires. Choose a braid the same size or smaller than the solder pad on your circuit board, and slightly wider than the tip of your soldering iron. If the braid is too large, it could burn the board or take too long to heat up.This approach works best on through-hole attachments, or to clean up excess solder after you have finished removing a component using a pump or other method.You can try it on surface-mounted components in a pinch, but it may be difficult or time-consuming to desolder many pins.

, Most desoldering braids already have powdered flux distributed on the fine copper wires, in order to wick the solder up into the braid. You can brush a little liquid flux onto the end of the braid as well to make it more effective., Once you have plugged in and heated your soldering iron, it’s helpful to melt a tiny bit of extra soldering wire onto the terminal.This will help the old, hard solder melt. Withdraw the iron once you've done this.

, Place the end of the braid over the terminal you are desoldering.

, Let the iron rest on the braid without additional pressure, to avoid pushing the solder pad out of place.Wait a few seconds for the heat to pass through the braid and melt the solder. Once the solder has melted, the braid should wick it up and absorb it.


Hold the braid by the bobbin it is wound around. The braid may get too hot to touch.If the solder isn't melted, too much heat could be dissipating up the braid. Try cutting off the end of the braid and using that instead, holding it in place with the soldering iron.

, The braid will change color as the flux coating is used up and solder is absorbed. Spool out more of the braid and continue on to the next terminal.Apply more liquid flux to the braid if needed.


Even on a through-hole attachment, you may need to remove the solder around the component. If you plan to reuse the component, keep the braid and soldering iron away from the component to avoid heat damage.

, Once all the solder is removed, give the area about thirty seconds to cool, then remove it by hand.

Upgrade to a desoldering station.,
Melt solder with a hot air.,
Remove small parts with desoldering tweezers.,
Melt in a low-temperature solder.,
Detach a line of pins using a wire.",How to Desolder3," If you see a warehouse full of circuit boards in your future, consider buying a station that includes higher quality versions of a soldering iron and desoldering pump. The station should allow you to choose a temperature appropriate for each project. This is especially useful when handling surface-mounted circuit boards (i.e. most of them), so you can avoid damaging heat-sensitive components.

, The brute force approach with an ordinary heat gun is a fast way to recover a board, but will almost certainly fry your components. If you want a more accurate approach, you'll need a hot air rework station. This includes a small, high-temperature heat nozzle so you can quickly melt the solder with lower risk to the surrounding components. This expensive, bulky tool is recommended only for people who plan to desolder frequently, and who have some salvage boards to practice on.Vacuum up the melted solder using a desoldering pump or the vacuum nozzle on the rework station.

, Each pincer on these ""tweezers"" is actually a soldering iron. Just pinch each pin on a surface-mounted resistor, diode, or other small component to melt the solder., A few companies make a special kind of solder that melts at low temperature, sold specifically for desoldering. When you melt this onto existing solder, it creates an alloy that lowers the melting temperature. This ensures that the solder stays liquid for longer, making it easy to remove using a pump or braid., If you have a surface-mounted component attached with many pins, desoldering one at a time will be slow and difficult. Instead, you can melt the solder on one side all at once, and use a fine wire to lift the pins up before the solder hardens again:Apply flux and new solder across the whole line of pins, melting the old solder together.
Use a desoldering braid as described above to remove most of this solder.
Strip the end of a fine, enameled copper wire. Tin this end (that is, coat it in a layer of solder).
Insert the wire underneath the line of pins, then solder the tinned end to the last pin to fix it to the board.
Tug the wire upward while you heat the closest pin with the soldering iron, until the pin detaches.
Repeat with each pin. Try not to pull too hard or at too steep an angle.

Learn what soldering is.,
Use solder to bind things.,
Use a soldering iron to heat the solder.,
Use other equipment to assist in soldering.,
Turn on the lights.,
Prepare adequate ventilation.,
Don't solder for too long in one sitting.",How to Solder1," Put into basic terms, soldering is the process of melting a metal onto other metal components in order to bind them.


Soldering differs from welding. In welding, the component pieces are melted together; in soldering, a softer metal with a lower melting point is used to connect them.

Because soldering doesn't melt components, it's useful for more delicate applications, such as electronics work, or plumbing.


The purpose of soldering is to bind two other components. Solder can be thought of as a sort of “metal glue.” It can be used to fill in gaps or hold pieces in place, but doesn't serve any more complicated purpose.

Since solder is metallic, it conducts electricity, which is another reason it's so popular for connecting electronic components.

;
, Solder is the name of the actual material used in soldering. Historically, many solders contained lead or cadmium, but that has been recently phased out for health reasons.


Solder is typically composed of two or more metals combined into an alloy. Silver, antimony, copper, tin, and zinc are all common ingredients.
Solder is soft and flexible. It generally comes in a coil, or spool, that can be stretched and bent.
Solder has a low melting point, and cools extremely quickly after it's been melted. (350F - 500F)
Solder can contain a flux core of natural rosin (tree sap) or a chemical acid. The metal of the solder encircles the core, like a tube.

The purpose of the core is to serve as a flux, or purifying agent. The flux prevents oxidation in the solder as it cools, keeping it strong and pure.



, Soldering irons come in various configurations, but are essentially straight tools with tips that can be heated to melt solder in place.


Most soldering irons typically heat to between 800 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit, so exercise caution when using one.
Soldering irons tend to catch a veneer of solder after each use, which can oxidize and reduce the iron's effectiveness on the next use. To clean this off easily, secure a wet sponge before you turn your iron on, and gently drag the tip across the sponge once the iron is heated.

A layer of fresh solder on the tip can actually make a soldering iron more effective. This process is called “tinning,” and is done by allowing a bit of fresh solder to melt evenly over the tip before use.


Better models of soldering iron come with a heat control that can be adjusted for different projects and types of solder.

, Soldering isn't especially dangerous or difficult if you take sensible precautions. To solder as efficiently and effectively as possible, there are a few useful pieces of equipment you should have.


Clamps or alligator clips, for holding components in place while you solder them
Thick gloves, to protect your hands from the tip of the iron as you feed solder to it
Safety glasses or goggles, to prevent any errant solder flecks from hitting your eyes
A solder stand to rest your soldering iron on between applications.

, Be sure you can see everything clearly so that your work will be as accurate as possible.


If you need to solder somewhere without much light, bring a bright light (such as a portable lamp) with you.

, Even without lead in the mix, solder and flux can produce harmful fumes. Avoid breathing in rosin or metal fumes by opening a window, turning on a fan, and generally doing whatever you can to keep air fresh.

, Soldering is a fast process, and it doesn't generally take more than a few minutes to do what needs to be done, but if you find yourself spending more than 15 or 20 minutes on a project, take regular breaks for fresh air.

Pick your iron.,
Pick your solder.,
Prepare the iron.,
Set a piece in place.,
Pick up the solder wire.,
Heat the component.,
Finish the solder.,
Repeat until finished.",How to Solder2," Most electronic component soldering is done to fasten components to a PCB (printed circuit board). Therefore, an iron with a smaller tip is recommended. Consider a small flathead tip for ordinary work, or a conical point tip for fine detail soldering.


Soldering irons don't have exchangeable tips, so you'll need to buy the one(s) you want. Fortunately, they start at around $15 in price, and a good quality iron can be had for around twice that.
A typical soldering iron for electronics work will be a 40-watt iron that has a temperature (or a temperature setting) of 900 degrees. This allows the iron to easily melt electronics solder without damaging the small wires of the components themselves.

, Both solid wire and Rosin-cored solders area available at stores and online. Be sure the solder you choose will bond to the materials you are trying to solder. Using solid wire solder may require a separate flux to break the oxide coating and allow the solder to bond.


60/40 tin and lead solder used to be the standard for electronics soldering, however due to the toxicity of lead it has fallen out of favor. Tin and silver solder is generally preferred today. The silver raises the melting point slightly to 430F, raises the price, but helps the solder to bind more smoothly.

The numbers in solder descriptions are percentages of the element in the solder alloy. (60Sn/40Pb = 60% tin and 40% lead)



, Plug in the iron and let it warm up on its stand for a few minutes. Be sure to gently wipe it across a sponge if it's been used previously, as described above. Tin it (as described above) once it's clean. When you're ready, set out your components, clips, and solder.

, Put a component in the spot you want to solder it. If soldering to a PCB, be sure the wires of the component are appropriately placed through its pinholes.


For most components, use a small clip or clamp to hold them in place once you've set them.

, Hold a length of solder with your non-dominant hand. Use a long length to ensure that you'll be able to keep your hand well away from the tip of the iron.

, Touch the tip of the iron to the component you want to solder. Only touch it for about one second. This warms the metal so that it can handle the solder more flexibly.


Quickly touch your solder wire to the soldering point, and apply the iron to it. The solder should melt immediately. Soldering to a PCB board should never require more than about 3-4 seconds' worth of molten solder.
If more solder is required to secure the connection, feed it smoothly with your hand.
Your solder should pool loosely, forming concave sides as it spreads around the component wire. It shouldn't ball up or look lumpy.

, Pull the solder wire away first, wait one second, and then pull the iron away from the soldering point to let the molten solder cool. Again, this should only take 5 or 10 seconds at most.


Be sure not to blow on the solder or otherwise try to help it cool. This can make it lumpy or add impurities.

, Repeat the above steps for each point you wish to solder.


Re-tin your iron's tip every several applications, and once more before you put the iron away. This helps extend the life of the iron.

Take away your heat source.

,
Inspect the joint for good bonding and a clean, smooth join.

,
Cool the piece with an appropriate coolant, usually water.

,
Clean the joint (inside and out) to remove excess flux residue.

,
Sand, file etc.",How to Heat and Apply Solder," However don't overly polish the surfaces as a slightly rough or 'keyed' surface usually leads to a stronger bond. It is crucially important in any soldering task to ensure that the pieces to be joined match up closely with the smallest gap possible.;
, Pickling means immersing the pieces or covering the joint area in an acid cleaning fluid. This strips impurities, oxides and greases that can lead to poor solder flow or weak bonding.

, Flux is the magic component in soldering. Applying a moderately generous amount evenly about the bond area is sufficient.

, Ensure that the pieces cannot move and that heating will not cause the fixture to melt.

, If possible move either the work or the materials away. If this is not possible, shield the materials with a flame proof device, like a heat shield mat. If this is not possible, then either ensure you can apply heat in a safe direction or consider another method like removing the pieces and repositioning them afterwards.

, Especially in heating systems water can remain that will be drawn into the heating area. Aside from steam burning you or getting in your face, water will cool the joint and prevent soldering temperatures being reached and if they are, it will blow holes in the solder.

, On a small object like a ring this is the opposite side of the ring. On a larger pipe joint like a 22mm T, the whole T and about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of pipe should be warmed evenly. This keeps heat uniformly contained in the joint area and stops hot and cold spots causing irregular flows.

, This is the cut in a ring, or the centre of the body of the T.

, The water base of the flux should now be completely burned off. If the flux is bubbling still, then continue heat and check again until all the flux is solidified, moving your heat source as needed to target these areas.

, If the pieces are closely matched and well heated, the solder will be pulled in by thermal and surface tension forces, causing the solder to visibly flow up into the joint. This is often seen as the best way to ensure a proper bond was formed as the solder pulled itself into the void. If there is not quite enough solder applied but visually it is clear that it flowed, more can be added to the spots that look a little dry.

Make final adjustments if needed.",How to Solder Gold," These are designed to prevent heat loss and withstand great deal of heat. Kiln bricks, magnesia blocks, or charcoal bricks are all common options.;
, Any metal alloy designed to melt and join metal together is called a ""solder,"" but most solders will not work to join gold. You can buy gold solder, designed for this purpose, as sheets, wire, or in 1 mm (~1/32 inch) chips. Cutting larger pieces of solder into chips is recommended, to make it easier to control the precise amount of solder being applied.


Solder with a higher gold content is stronger, but takes more heat to melt. It is recommended for joining two pieces together. Use ""plumb solder,"" ""medium"" or ""hard"" solder, or solder with 14 karat and above.
Solder with a lower gold content will melt more easily, and is recommended for small repairs. Use ""repair solder,"" ""easy"" solder, or solder below 14 karat.Check the label before buying pink or rose gold solder, as it may contain highly toxic cadmium., A small oxy-acetylene gas torch is a good choice, but butane or other high-temperature torches will work as well. Soldering irons are not recommended for precious metals or other high-temperature soldering tasks., Before soldering gold, or most other metals, a chemical product called ""flux"" should be applied to clean the metal's surface and help the soldering process go smoothly. Find a flux at a hardware or jewelry store that is safe for use on precious metals. This is sometimes called ""brazing flux"" due to the technical term for this high-temperature joining process. Flux comes in paste or liquid form, or as a powder that creates a paste when mixed with water.


While brazing is technically a different process than soldering, even jewelers usually call this process ""soldering."" A flux labeled ""soldering flux"" may work, but check the packaging to see if it is appropriate for gold.

, Use fans or open windows to create a light breeze over the work area, moving potential fumes away from you. Strong breezes may make the soldering process more difficult, due to the cooling effect., Copper will not corrode in the acidic pickle solution described below, unlike steel. You'll also need any tool that can hold the gold objects in position, usually tweezers. A clamp or vise can also be used, but tighten lightly to avoid bending the gold.


The other tools do not need to be made from copper.

, Safety goggles are vital to protect your eyes from molten droplets. A thick canvas apron is recommended to prevent burns on your clothing. Roll up long sleeves and tie back long hair as an additional precaution.

, Set a container of water out for cooling and rinsing the gold. Purchase a ""pickle"" solution for cleaning oxidization off metal, and prepare it according to the instructions on the packaging. Most pickle manufacturers sell it as a powder, which can be prepared in small amounts by dissolving with water and heating.


Never place the pickle solution in a steel container, or put it in contact with a steel utensil.
Never heat pickle in a microwave or container that you intend to use for cooking. The pickle can leave an unpleasant smell or even traces of harmful materials.

, The gold surfaces to be joined need to be clean of dirt and grease for the solder to chemically bond them together. Soak them in the pickle solution briefly to remove surface contamination, then rinse in water to remove the acid. Scrub the surfaces with detergent or soap for additional cleaning.


Some people neutralize the acidic pickle by adding baking soda to the rinse water, but this is not necessary unless your pickle is unusually strong., Place the gold objects on a soldering block, and hold in place with tweezers or a clamp. The areas to be joined together should fit together as closely as possible; this process cannot typically fill large gaps., Flux will help remove additional impurities, and prevent discoloration to the surface. Applying the flux only where the pieces will be joined may reduce the amount of solder that flows to the wrong area, but some people prefer to apply the flux over the whole piece to minimize discoloration., Use the torch to briefly heat the flux wherever you applied it, until the water boils away and leaves behind protective solids, which inhibit the formation of copper oxides. If you applied flux to the entire object, be sure to perform this step thoroughly before you add the solder.

, Place a chip of solder on one end of the seam to be joined, and heat the surrounding gold objects. If you are using an appropriately high-temperature torch, you should be able to heat that area sufficiently to melt the solder without having to heat the entire object. Move your flame back and forth slowly as you heat, to apply the heat across the length of the seam to be joined. The solder should melt and flow across the seam, visibly joining the two sides together.

, Once the solder has flowed along the joint, and the metal surfaces have been heated sufficiently to join together, turn off the torch and let the gold cool. After a couple minutes, quench it further in the water bath. Use copper tools to lower the gold slowly into the pickle bath, and wait a few minutes for most of the discoloring fire-scale on the surface to be removed.

, Remove the gold from the pickle, rinse in the water bath, and inspect. You may need to polish or file off excess solder or fire scale to achieve the appearance you desire. The two gold objects should now be joined together with a strong bond.

",How to Replace Linoleum,"


If you do not already know what kind of flooring lies underneath your linoleum, you will need to find out in order to remove the old linoleum properly.
Choose a corner of linoleum that is the most ragged or curled and try to pry it loose with your fingers. You only need to see a small portion of the floor to identify it. Common sub-surfaces include hardwood, concrete and vinyl flooring.;
,,


Cut the linoleum into strips approximately 6 inches (15.24 cm) wide. Linoleum isn't very thick. Cut only as deep as the linoleum. You will feel the hard subsurface when you hit it. Try not to scrape the subsurface.
Peel a corner of the linoleum slowly with two hands. Reposition your hands down as your peel.
Continue onto the next strip of linoleum.
Discard the strips in the trash.
Boil water in a medium saucepan.
Pour the boiling water onto the remaining linoleum and adhesive on the floor.
Cover the floor with damp towels to keep the surface wet.
Wait 10 minutes.
Use a floor stripper to scrape away the remnants of linoleum and adhesive.
Repeat the process of boiling water and pouring it onto the floor. This should remove the last of the glue.

,


Smooth the floor as much as possible. This might involve refinishing or resurfacing. Hardwood floors should be sanded down.

,,


Both are made of the same material, but sheets tend to last longer because there are fewer places for the linoleum to curl or warp.

,


Determine the layout of the sheets or tiles. Place your linoleum on the floor as a run-through before the actual adhesion process.
Cut the appropriate tiles or sheets to move around bathroom or kitchen fixtures or components such as counters and plumbing.
Spread adhesive to a small area on the floor.
Press the linoleum onto the adhesive firmly.
Continue to apply adhesive and press the linoleum into the subsurface.
Roll over the tiles or sheets with a 100-pound (45.4-kg) roller.

Be prepared.,
Use a torch.,
Get appropriate solder.,
Have an abrasive item on hand.,
Cut off the water.,
Cut your pipe.,
Clean up the pipe.,
Solder the pipe.,
Check your work.",How to Solder3," Soldering copper pipes isn't hard, but it is considerably more involved than soldering electronics, and requires different equipment. People typically engage in pipe soldering to seal joints between sections of pipe, such as elbow turns.

, Instead of a soldering iron, a propane torch is generally recommended for soldering copper pipes together. These are widely available at hardware stores.


Specialized soldering irons can be used for pipe soldering, but a propane torch is just as effective for most jobs, and much cheaper.

, Manufacturers offer specialized solder wire for soldering pipes. It tends to be much thicker, usually 1/8"" in diameter. Pipe solders often contain an acid flux, however solid wire works as well. Solid wire solder may need a separate flux.


Absolutely avoid using leaded solder for soldering your pipes. Be sure to closely read the label to determine the alloy composition. Pipe solders tend to compose mostly tin and may also contain antimony, copper, and/or silver.

, To be sure your solder takes, it's helpful to clean the pipe beforehand by scouring it with an emery cloth, sandpaper, or fine steel wool.

, Turn off the water to your plumbing before you begin work. This will allow you to work with your pipes without fear of flooding or spraying the room.


Before you turn the water off, pour a bucket of water. Keep the bucket nearby in case your torch catches anything on fire.

, If you're installing new piping, use a tube cutter to cut any pipe up to an inch in diameter. Tube cutters are available at hardware stores.


Take it slowly. A tube cutter works best with slow, steady movement. Go too quickly and you might dent the pipe.
For larger pipe, you'll have to use a hacksaw. File off the ragged edges afterward.
Once the pipes are cut, fit them into whatever joints you'll need to solder tight.

, Using an emery cloth or similar abrasive item, thoroughly abrade the area of pipe where you'll be applying solder to smooth and clean it.


A smooth and clean surface will allow the solder to flow into the joint smoothly and seal it evenly.

, Fire up your propane torch and apply heat to the pipe you plan to solder.


Maintain even heat by moving the flame all around the work area.
Once the pipe is good and hot, apply the tip of your solder wire to the place you need to seal. It should melt right away.

Hold the solder on the opposite side of the pipe from your torch. It should flow around the joint and fill it up all the way around.


Let the joint cool. It will cool quickly. Move on to the next joint that needs sealing, if necessary.

, Once you're finished, wait a few minutes and then turn the water back on. Run water through the pipes you soldered and check for leaks. If there are any, you'll have to repeat the process.

, It will require more stripper, because the chemicals are less volatile., This petroleum product has been deemed safe for use with laminate. You can buy it in low-odor and odorless varieties., If you are working on a floor, open all the windows and doors. Avoid working in direct sunlight.


Place a tarp underneath the object to avoid killing grass or creating a stain.

, Purchase thick rubber gloves so that you can avoid contact with your skin.

, Check the label to see what ventilation and precautions are recommended.

, You will also need very fine steel wool, or grade #0000.

, Make sure you only apply it to an area that you will be able to strip in about 15 minutes. Work in three by three feet sections.

,, Wipe the polyurethane onto a rag or into a plastic yogurt container. Repeat until a full layer of polyurethane is removed.

, Do not sand between applications. Continue until the object beneath is exposed.

, Apply the stripper, wait and then work the steel wool with the grain to remove the finish. It is a good idea to strip as much of the surface away with a plastic putty knife before trying steel wool., Take the water to a hazardous waste disposal unit in your town, along with leftover stripper. Do not throw rags and chemicals directly into the trash or sewer.

Clear the work area.,
Cut the linoleum into 12-inch (34.48 cm) strips using a sharp utility knife.,
Heat the linoleum topper with a heat gun to soften it for easy removal.,
Peel back the strips manually.,
Alternately, automate the process by using an oscillating tool system with a rigid scraper blade.,
For older linoleum, consider breaking off a small piece of tacky paper or underlayment gunk and get it tested for asbestos.,
For delicate floors, scrape the adhesive or underlayment with a putty knife.,
For more durable subfloors, soak the adhesive with boiling hot water and allow it to absorb for approximately 15 minutes.,
For a neat trick, try using a wallpaper steamer.You can rent these on the cheap at your local hardware store.,
Apply a chemical stripper to any stubborn adhesive per the manufacturer's instructions.,
Scrape the treated adhesive with a putty knife to remove any existing material.,
Sweep or vacuum the newly exposed subfloor to remove any small debris.",How to Remove Linoleum," Remove all large appliances, furniture, or other obstacles from the linoleum surface.;
, Removal of smaller, easy-to-handle strips will be much easier than trying to handle the entire sheet of linoleum at once.

, In order to get the lino topper soft and pliable, consider heating one section at a time with a heat gun. This will make the removal of the topper much easier.


What if you don't have a heat gun? A hair dryer may work, but chances are that the hair gun doesn't get hot enough to do the job efficiently. Try for yourself and see whether the hottest setting on the hair gun makes the removal of the topper any easier.

, Use a 4-inch (10.16 cm) putty knife to lift the edges of each section and then tear the remainder. The tough outer skin should come off easily, but if the linoleum was fully bonded when installed, you may have large sections of soft backing and adhesive that will need additional attention.

, Rub a bit of petroleum jelly on the scraper blade to keep it from getting gunked up. Then, begin by sliding the automatic scraper underneath a pre-cut seam and lifting the linoleum up with your free hand. Follow the pre-cut seams to remove the linoleum topper. Depending on the job, this process is sometimes quicker than removing the topper by hand.

, Many older linoleum floors contain either asbestos tiles or sheeting, which are small fibers that can be dangerous if inhaled.Although proper and safe removal of asbestos can be accomplished at home, it may be easier (and ultimately safer) to remove it with the help of a professional abatement contractor.


Either way, prepare to use goggles and a respirator mask to filter out any potential asbestos fibers from the more porous parts of your body. These should be used for safety regardless of whether you think your lino flooring contains asbestos.
Another way to make possible asbestos tiles or sheeting less dangerous is to dampen in with water before removal. Dry asbestos gets airborne relatively easily, even if you can't see it. Wet asbestos doesn't get airborne as easily. Be careful about dampening the underlayment if you have wooden floors. See the next couple of steps below.

, You may need to apply moderate to extreme pressure depending on the strength of the adhesive. This can be very time consuming, but it doesn't risk damaging hardwood subfloors.


You can try to use the heat gun and automatic oscillating scraper for removing the adhesive, just as you removed the lino topper. You may, however, find that it's difficult to get the oscillating scraper blade underneath the adhesive. Either way, the heat gun softens the adhesive and makes it easier to remove.

, Again, only apply water if the subfloor is concrete or a replaceable plywood. Wood warping may occur with any type of water application so be careful when dealing with salvageable hardwood subfloors.


Here's how you get the boiling water onto the adhesive or underlayment without creating an absolute mess or, even worse, flooding. Line sections of the floor with towels — towels you're okay with losing. Pour the hot water over the towels, letting the towels absorb most of the water but heat up the adhesive anyway. Wait 15 minutes before removing the towels.
Next scrape away with a manual scraper. You'll want a larger scraper for moistened adhesive, as it comes off much easier than dry adhesive, giving you plenty of opportunity to take a wider berth.

, Get the steamer warmed up. Place the applicator pad of the steamer over one section of the adhesive and let it steam for 60 to 90 seconds. Move the steamer to an adjacent section and scrape off the section where the applicator just was.


This process is pretty quick compared to the dry method of removing adhesive. A 100 square foot floor should take less than two hours.

, Most chemical strippers use the same active ingredients that are found in paint strippers and can be purchased at your local hardware store.

, Since most of the adhesive should have been removed before the stripper was deployed, this process should be fairly easy.

, Your subfloor is officially ready to shine in a new skin!

Determine what to do with the wood.,
Set the blade of a circular saw.,
Take a few safety precautions.,
Make a cut down the length of one board.,
Tear the board out.,
Consider cutting the remaining boards.,
Work one at a time.,
Lift the board using a pry bar.,
Work down the length of each board.,
Use a mallet for stubborn boards.,
Repeat as needed.,
Remove any staples.,
Pull out any nails.,
Gather the metal.,
Mend the floor as necessary.,
Clean away the dust.",How to Remove Floor Boards," If the wood is still in fairly good condition, you might want to consider selling or donating it.









If, on the other hand, the wood is mostly rotten, there may not be much to salvage. In that case, discarding it is probably the most practical thing to do.
For wood that you plan to sell, you should work carefully to minimize the amount of damage you do to the boards when removing them.
Also note that you should be using a carbide blade on your saw.;
, You'll need a circular saw for at least part of this process. Set the blade of the saw so that it matches the thickness of the wood boards.









The depth of the saw is the distance between the blade guard and the bottom of the circular blade.
Hardwood floor boards can vary in thickness, but many are generally around 5/8 inch (1.59 cm) thick.
If you do not set the blade to match this thickness, you run the risk of cutting through the boards and into your subflooring (the base floor beneath your floor boards).

, You should wear a dust mask, safety goggles, heavy work gloves, and knee pads while working on this project.









The gloves and knee pads can help protect and cushion your hands and knees, respectively, as you crawl around to complete the project.
This project throws plenty of sawdust into the air, and that dust could irritate your lungs or eyes if it gets into them. The safety goggles and dust mask can protect you.
Also note that you should open the windows in the room for better ventilation throughout the process., Use your circular saw to cut down the entire length of one board. This cut should be made as close to the lengthwise center as possible.









For best results, choose a board with its length located along one of the perimeter sides of the floor. Removing your first sacrificial board here will make it easier to access and remove over boards further in.
Alternatively, you could use a pry bar to lift up the first few boards along one side of the floor's perimeter. This option is easiest to do if you have square-edged boards with at least one exposed edge.

, Slip the tongued end of a pry bar beneath the cut board and lift both halves of the board up. Once the two halves are free, remove them from the area.









The easiest way to do this is usually by wedging the pry bar in between the slit you just created and prying up both halves one at a time.
With the tongued end of the pry bar beneath the board, press down on the long handle end. The lever force of this action should be enough to pry up the wood, but it may take multiple tries before the nails and staples holding the board allow it to break free.
If the pry bar is too bulky to work with for this step, switch to the blade of a bolster chisel. Use that the pry up both cut halves, instead, working it in the same way as a pry bar.

, If you don't need to preserve the floor boards in long, whole pieces, it will be easier to cut each board into smaller sections before removing it.








Using your circular saw, cut crosswise lines across the rows of floor board. Each line should divide the boards into 1 to 2 foot (30.5 to 61 cm) long sections. These cuts must lie perpendicular to the direction the boards are presently laying in.
If you do want to preserve the length of the floor boards, however, it is possible to remove the boards without cutting them into smaller chunks. The choice is ultimately yours to make, and the steps for removal are essentially the same either way.

, You will need to pull up each board or each cut section of board individually. Wait until completely removing one board before moving onto the next.









You should start with the board that lies directly adjacent to the first board you already pulled up. The purpose of pulling up the first board was to expose edges of the surrounding boards, so you should take advantage of these newly exposed edges.

, Wedge the tongued side of a pry bar beneath the board you intend to remove next. Press down on the handle end of the bar to begin lifting the board.









If you wish to salvage the wood, you should work gently while lifting the each board.
Position the pry bar so that the tongue is beneath the first nail holding the bar to the floor.
Lift in the direction of the nail rather than working against it.

, Once the edge of the board has freed itself from the floor, slide the pry bar down the length of the board and over to the next nail. Lift the board up in this spot using the same type of motion and pressure.








Continue working down the entire length of the board in this manner until the entire thing has been freed.
When trying to save long boards of wood, you should remove each board gradually using this procedure. If you are only concerned about ripping away small sections of previously damaged wood, however, you can try ripping the board up in one motion instead of working it up gradually.

, If you are unable to lift the boards with a standard pry bar, you may need to use the additional force a mallet can provide.









Slide the tongue of the pry bar beneath the floor board as before.
Strike the handle side of the pry bar with the heavy mallet. The force of this blow should cause the pry bar to lift the entire section of board without much (if any) additional work.

, After removing one board or board section, you will need to remove the rest in the same manner. Continue until all of the floor boards have been ripped up.









For best results, work from one side of the floor to the opposite side. Do not attempt to work from the perimeter toward the center or from the center outward.

, Use a nail claw to remove the heavy staples from the exposed subflooring.









Slide the hooked end of the nail claw beneath the top of each staple you spot.
Carefully ease or rock the nail claw backward by pulling down on the handle. As you pull the claw back, the force should yank the staple out of the floor.
For broken staples, you will need to use curved vice grips. Pinch the visible section of staple in between the mouth of the grips. Rock the staple back and forth while pulling in an upward direction. Eventually, the staple should pull free from the floor.

, Use large locking pliers to remove nails from the floor and from any wood you plan to salvage.









Grab the nail over or just beneath the head with the mouth of the pliers.
Lift the nail straight out. If it resists the motion, gently work it back and forth while pulling it away. Continue until the nail lifts out completely.

, Pass a large, powerful magnet over the floor. Most of the nails and staples should stick to this magnet.









It may take several passes before all of the metal has been collected.
Even after you've finished with the magnet, you should double-check the area to make sure that there are no stray nails or staples left. If necessary, pick up these strays by hand.
Dispose of your scrap nails and staples after collecting them.

, Examine the subflooring. If any portion of it was damaged in the process, you should fix it now.









For the most part, this will only involve re-nailing any subflooring sections that came loose while removing the floor boards.
Oftentimes, the subflooring will have no damage at all. In this case, you can proceed without worry.

, Use a shop vac to vacuum away all of the sawdust and remaining debris.









It is best to use an industrial shop vac instead of a home vacuum cleaner. Larger pieces of debris could damage an ordinary vacuum cleaner.
After you complete this step, the entire process is done.

Get some sawdust from the floor you want to repair.,
If you can't find any wood to match, you'll have to ""cannibalize"" a piece of the existing floor.,
Using a belt sander, sand off a cup or two of wood from the piece of wood into a container (or however much you think you'll need to fill the cracks).

,
Mix the sawdust with some wood glue to make a fairly thick paste.

,
Using a plastic trowel (or a plastic spatula), lay the sawdust/glue mixture into the cracks.,
Let the filler dry for a day or two.

,
Sand lightly.,
If there are a large number of patches on your floor, or there's a noticeable difference in level of sheen, you might need to re-varnish the entire floor.

",How to Repair Cracks in Wood Floors," If you don't have any leftover pieces of matching wood laying around your house, you'll have to go to a flooring store and buy a piece of wood to match. (same species and stain if possible).;
, Pull up the baseboard and pry up a strip from the edge of the floor, or alternatively, remove a piece from under a doorway. Sand the side of the wood nearest the wall where it will be hidden under the baseboard once it's re-laid, or at the edge of the strip under the door where it's hidden by the door jamb.

,,, Try to finish off as smooth as possible. Wipe the patch and adjacent flooring with a damp rag to wipe off any excess. Wipe on a diagonal to avoid pulling filler out of the patch.

,, If there's a huge color difference between the patch and the rest of the floor, you might need to re-stain the patch.Using a very small artist's brush, stain the patch. Allow to dry for a minute and wipe off. Let the stain set overnight and using another small artist's brush, cover the patch with a coat of varnish to match the existing floor.

Do not use this method on adhesives containing asbestos.,
Know the benefits of this method.,
Use a plastic putty knife to chip off the adhesive.,
Consider using dry ice.,
Dispose of the old glue.,
Sand the floor down (optional).",How to Remove Adhesive on Hardwood Floor1," Some adhesives, such as ""cut-back"" adhesives and ""mastic,"" were often mixed with asbestos up until the late 1980s, and are still occasionally used today.These adhesives were most commonly used to bond the floor to tiles or to heating and air ducts, not to carpets, and are often black in color. If you suspect your adhesive contains asbestos, do not use this method, as sanding or scraping the dry adhesive can release dangerous asbestos fibers into the air. Refer to the solvent section instead, or hire a professional to remove the asbestos.;
, Chipping and scraping off the old adhesive can be tedious, although not much more so than using a solvent. The main benefit is a lower risk of discoloring the wood or clogging its pores. After using this method, it should be easy to bond a new stain or finish to the wood. However, if there is an existing finish you plan to leave on, or if you plan to cover the floor with a new carpet, the solvent method may save you some time.



Note: renting a wet/dry vacuum from a tool rental service is highly recommended for quick, safe cleanup after the adhesive is removed.

, If you're lucky, the adhesive will chip right off when you apply pressure with a putty knife. Some areas may take more pressure than others. Only use a plastic putty knife, not metal, to avoid scratching the floor. If the adhesive only comes off in tiny chips, try making it easier to remove with dry ice as described below, or use solvents instead.


Pick the widest putty knife you can find to make the task less tedious.

, If you plan to apply a new stain or finish to the floor, this is your best option for making adhesive removal easier without affecting the wood pores. Place pieces of dry ice in a cookie tray and slide the tray over each section of adhesive before you chip, to make the glue brittle and easier to remove. Always follow these safety precautions before you buy dry ice:Wear thick gloves while handling dry ice, as the extreme cold can instantly cause painful skin damage.
Always store and work with dry ice in a well-ventilated room, and leave immediately if you have trouble breathing. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide, and can fill a small space with unbreathable gas.
Do not store in an airtight container, which may explode as the dry ice expands into gas.

, Clean up the chips of adhesive using a wet/dry vacuum if possible, or a broom. Your local government may require you to dispose of them at a waste collection center, rather than adding it to your ordinary trash, since some adhesives contain toxic materials. However, since you did not use any solvents, you may be able to dispose of adhesives normally; contact local waste collection services to find out about local regulations.

, The floor may need to be sanded to clear up any scuff marks caused by the carpet installation or the glue removal. Use 16 or 24 grit sandpaper, but go slowly to avoid scraping into the wood. Optionally, sand away the old finish in preparation for adding a new stain and/or finish.


Sanding away the adhesive itself is not recommended, as the sandpaper will quickly get clogged and need replacing. Heat from the friction may also melt the adhesive, which can be messy.

Know the risks of this method.,
Determine what kind of carpet glue was used.,
For tar-based glues, apply mineral spirits.,
For carpet glues, use a commercial adhesive remover based on orange oil instead.,
Wait while the solvent works on your adhesive.,
Scrape the glue away with a plastic putty knife.,
Scrub stubborn sections with additional solvent.,
Dispose of the solvent as a hazardous material.,
Try other solvents if the attempt was unsuccessful.,
Remove traces of toxic materials (optional).,
Let the hardwood floor dry for 24 hours.",How to Remove Adhesive on Hardwood Floor2," If your adhesive is firmly bonded to the wood, solvents can be used to dissolve it into a liquid. This can soak the liquid into the pores of the wood, or even strip the old floor finish. After using this method, you may find it difficult to get a new stain or finish to bond to the hardwood floor. It is also important to wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated room, using fans if necessary, as most solvents give off toxic fumes.


Any solvent can potentially discolor or damage a hardwood floor, especially if there is no protective finish. Before using any product for the first time, you may wish to test it on a portion of the floor normally under furniture, to see if it has any negative effect before using it on visible portions.
Renting a wet/dry vacuum is highly recommended to make cleanup easier.

, Carpets are usually adhered using either tar-based glue or general carpet adhesive. Tar-based products will have a color from tan to dark brown, while general carpet adhesive has a yellow appearance. The process for removing each type of glue is similar, but the product used will differ.

, Mineral spirits can be purchased at a hardware store or online. They are best for removing tan, light brown, or dark brown tar-base adhesives. Apply it according to packaging instructions, or rub on using an old sponge, paintbrush, cotton pad, or even an old white cotton T-shirt.


It can take considerable time to remove the adhesive, even with a solvent. Consider applying the solvent to a portion of the floor at a time, if the room is large, as you will need to apply it again anyway if the solvent dries before you can get to it.

, Start with an adhesive remover based on orange oil, as this has the lowest risk of causing damage to your floor. Purchase a product such as Dissolve It, D'gel, or Goo Gone from a hardware store or online, and apply according to instructions. Typically, the product is wiped on with a soft cloth or an old, white cotton T-shirt.


If you do not wish to use a commercial product, other options are listed at the end of this section.

, Different products and adhesives take different amounts of time to set, so follow the advice on the solvent label if present. The solvent should become tacky or partially liquid, but this can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.

, Once the mineral spirits or adhesive remover has had a chance to soak into the glue, you can begin chipping away the glue with a plastic putty knife. Do not use a metal putty knife, as it can create deep scratches in the hardwood floor.

, Once you have removed the bulk of the glue with the putty knife, soak a rag or towel in the adhesive remover. Use the rag to scrub away the stubborn bits of glue that remain. Extremely stubborn areas can be scraped away with a utility knife or metal putty knife, but exercise extreme caution to avoid damaging the floors or injuring yourself.

, Use a wet/dry vacuum if possible to remove the solvent quickly and safely. If you do not have access to this tool, follow the instructions on the product you are using. Once collected, material should be disposed of according to your local area's toxic waste collection legislation, never in an ordinary trash bin or by flushing down a drain.

, If your adhesive is especially difficult to remove, or you do not have access to the solvents listed above, you may try another material, or reapply the same material in the spots where adhesive remains. Testing for possible floor damage in an unobtrusive corner is a recommended first step. Here are some common solvents used for this purpose:


Yellow carpet glues can be removed by applying vegetable oil with a soft cloth, but this can stain floors without a protective finish.
Try a little WD40 worked in using a cotton rag, and left to soak for 15-30 minutes. Overuse carries a high risk of causing discoloration or damage.
Denatured alcohol has a high risk of damage, but may be worth trying in small quantities for patches of stubborn adhesives.
Commercial paint remover is usually effective, but can easily damage hardwood floors.

, If you have pets or young children in your house, this step is recommended to remove traces of the solvent from your floor. Simply rub the floor with mild detergent, using a wet cloth. If there is a lingering smell on your floor, apply a mix of apple cider vinegar and water to remove it.


Keep in mind that water will probably cause damage to your hardwood floor if a protective finish is not present, or has been stripped away by the solvent.

, After all the glue has been removed, allow the floor to dry for at least 24 hours. Leave the windows open in the room to ensure good ventilation. The floor is now ready to be used, or to have a protective finish applied over it.


Sandpaper may be helpful if there are a few small pieces of adhesive, or if the solvent has partially dissolved the floor finish and the rest needs to be removed before the new finish is applied.

The most common surfaces for stucco are plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), cement board, and exterior grade gypsum sheathing.Make sure to follow local building codes while installing the sheathing material.


It is possible to stucco over an open frame, but this results in a less even and less structurally secure wall. If you plan to go this route, drive nails halfway into the studs, spaced out vertically in 5-6 inch (13-15 cm) intervals. String line wire horizontally along the protruding nails., Most building codes require at least two layers of ""Grade D"" building paper or an equivalent water-resistant barrier.You may use asphalt felt or some types of housewrap, but do not use a plastic housewrap not intended for stucco.Overlap the paper by at least 4 inches (10 cm) and fasten with roofing nails.While not required by most codes, an air gap between the two layers is highly recommended to prevent wall rot. A 3D plastic drainage mat between the two barriers is one way to accomplish this., Install casing bead as a plaster stop at the corners of doors and windows.Install weep screed at the base of the wall for better drainage.For this project, these two materials are not interchangeable., Selecting the correct lath and installing it properly is one of the more difficult parts of this project. Consulting a local contractor is recommended. In most cases, you should nail or staple the lath to the studs (not the sheathing) at no less than 7 inch (18 cm) intervals. Overlap the lath by at least ½"" (1.25 cm) along the long side and 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the end, but not much more.In all exterior stucco applications, you must use G-60 hot-dipped galvanized lath.Choose lath with at least ¼"" (6mm) furring, or make up for non-furred lath using furring strips or furring nails.Without this furring, the stucco will not adhere properly to the lath.

, To reduce cracking, divide the wall into rectangular panels using control joints, spacing them no more than 18 ft (5.5 m) apart. Also install control joints wherever two dissimilar walls meet.If the lath is expanded metal (rather than stucco mesh), cut it behind each control joint to fully separate this rigid material into panels.Make the panels as close to square as possible, and no larger than 144 ft2 (13 m2)., Mix the scratch coat from 1 part cement material and 2¼ to 4 parts plaster sand. If you are using Type I Portland cement instead of plastic cement, you'll need to add your own hydrated lime; count the final cement and lime mixture as the ""1 part cement.""Mix with just enough potable water that you can trowel the stucco; any more, and it is likely to sage.


The aggregate in the cement should be clean and well graded.

, Apply the scratch coat with a square trowel at a 45º angle, firmly pushing it into the lath. This layer should be ⅜"" (9.5 mm) thick.You may find it easier to use a hawk for some portions of the application.

, The first coat is called the ""scratch coat"" because of the shallow, horizontal lines scored into it by a notched trowel. This will ensure a good bond with the next coat.

, When stuccoing over stud construction, the thick scratch coat must be allowed to cure for 48 hours. During this time, it is critical to protect the stucco from drying out. Mist or fog the stucco twice daily unless the relative humidity is above 70%. Protect the wall with a windscreen or sunshade if necessary.

, Mix another batch using 1 part cement and 3 to 5 parts sand. Apply another ⅜"" (9.5 mm) layer of stucco and screed to an even thickness, for a total thickness so far of ¾"" (19 mm).Once the brown coat loses its sheen, float it smooth.

, Wet cure as you did the scratch coat, but this time allow at least seven days. The first 48 hours are the most important, but you should continue to mist or fog it for this whole period, whenever it looks like it's about to dry.

, This final ⅛"" (3 mm) layer determines the texture of your stucco wall.Apply and float it as you did the brown coat, but this time use 1 part cement to 1½ to 3 parts sand. You may purchase a finish which already contains pigment, or trowel on a plain finish and paint over it once it has had at least a week to cure.


Colored stucco finishes work best in pastel shades.If the finish is colored, wetting the surface during floating may cause mottling. A fog coat may make the color more even.
Many decorative textures are possible when applying this final layer. Judge the appearance from at least 30 feet (9m) back before settling on a look."

Place a couple of two foot long pieces of 2X6 lumber side by side on the ground under the beam and place a 3/4"" plywood 1'X1' on top of the 2X6's.,
Begin jacking up the beam or beams and make sure you jack equally with two beams.,
Look for low areas.,
Remove the old post and measure the distance between the beam and the pier.,
Place a piece of tar paper on top of the concrete pier and the new post on top of the paper.,
Fasten.",How to Relevel a Sunken Floor," Is there a crawl space or basement below the floor? If there is a crawl space, then you will have to work with the jacks while laying down. If it's the basement, then jacks while standing up.
,, Draw on some paper a floor diagram and indicate what direction the floor is leaning. This will help a lot when the jacking begins., Generally there are posts and beams under the floor joists. If a pier that the post is standing on has sunk into the ground you will need to lift the beam off the post and replace the post with a taller one., Place the jack (I prefer at least 25 ton hydraulic. or a house screw jack) on the plywood and then I use a piece of thick hardwood between the jack's ram and the beam to prevent damage to the beam. If two beams meet on the post that is sunk then a jack on both sides of the post is required., Check the floor regularly to make sure you do not over level it., Once the floor is brought to level you check all around to see if there is any other areas that are still low. This is done by placing the level on the floor in several different positions and areas as before., Cut a replacement post of the same dimension lumber that was removed. You can go larger lumber but never smaller. But the best is to go with the same dimension. Also it is not a good idea to try to raise the pier block up by placing more dirt under it and then putting the old post back in. You aren't going to be able to compact the soil enough to keep it from sinking back down under the weight of the house., This will ensure moisture doesn't come up through the concrete and get to the wood. If the reason the floor sank is due to a rotten post and there was no tar paper you can now see what happens. Now put the weight of the house on the post. Keep it lined up with the sides of the beam. Check the floor for level again to make sure you're still good., Once the post is replaced it needs to be fastened to the beam. If the beam and the post is the same width (they should be) then just nail a 2X4 piece on both sides of the beam down the side of the post and nail to the post. Then you fully remove the jacks and lumber they sat on and put them away. You're done!"

Prepare the wall's surface.,
Wet the surface.,

Apply and score the scratch coat.,
Apply the brown coat after a few hours.,
Keep the brown coat moist while it cures.,
Put on the finish coat.",How to Stucco a House2," You may apply stucco directly over these rigid, solid surfaces, but only if the surface is roughly textured and absorbent. If the wall does not absorb a sprinkle of water, or if there's obvious surface contamination, wash the surface thoroughly. If the wall is coated in paint or sealer, or if it's too smooth to support stucco, try one of the following treatments:Acid etching
Sandblasting
Bush hammer or roughing machine (for unpainted, smooth surfaces)Applying a bonding agent, referring to specific product instructions. Do not use over water-soluble paint.If there is any doubt that the wall can support the stucco, follow the instructions in the stud wall section above, attaching metal lath and plastering over it.

, Wet the wall right before you apply the first coat of plaster, preferably with a fog spray. This improves the suction bond and reduces the amount of water the wall absorbs from the plaster, preventing premature drying. The surface should be damp, but not soaked.Delay the job if the next week of weather involves freezing temperature, hot weather (above 90ºF / 32ºC), or high wind. These conditions will interfere with the curing process.

, This coat should be 1 part cement material (including lime) and 2¼ to 4 parts sand.Plastic cement, which has been pre-mixed with lime, is usually the easiest to mix and work with. Combine this with plaster sand from a dry material yard.Only add enough water to allow you to trowel the plaster, or it may sag or fail to stick to the wall.

, Trowel on a layer ¼ inch (6.4 mm) thick.Score this with shallow, horizontal lines using a notched trowel, keeping the tool perpendicular to the wall.These grooves will help the next coat bond onto the surface.


Acid-etched surfaces (among others) may not be quite rough enough for a strong bond with this method. Instead, dash on the scratch coat using a cement gun, or by whipping it on with a fiber brush or whisk broom. This forces out air to create a stronger bond.Some builders combine the scratch coat and brown coat into one base coat. If you choose to do this, plan on a total stucco thickness of about ⅜"" (9.5 mm) for cast concrete, and ½"" (12.7 mm) for unit masonry.Allow about ¼"" (6.4 mm) of this thickness for the finish coat., With modern cement on a rigid surface, there is no need to wait for the scratch coat to cure completely. For a stronger bond, trowel on the second, ""brown"" coat as soon as the scratch coat is rigid enough to resist cracking, usually after four or five hours.Rod and float this surface until it is level and ¼"" (6.4 mm) thick.The brown coat mix should contain 1 part cement materials and 3 to 5 parts sand.It may help to compact this layer with a shingle float.

, Over the next 48 hours, it is critical to keep the stucco moist. If the relative humidity of the air is below 70%, you will need to mist or fog the surface once or twice a day.Wait at least seven days for the brown coat to cure, wetting periodically if it begins to dry prematurely. Some organizations recommend 10 or even up to 21 days of drying for even more crack resistance.In extremely hot or windy conditions, put up a windbreak and sun shade. You may even need to cover the moistened surface with polyethylene.

, The decorative finish coat contains 1 part cement materials and 1½ to 3 parts sand.Optionally, it may include pigment as well to add color. Trowel and float this on in a thin layer, about ⅛"" (3 mm) thick.Allow it to cure completely before painting (if desired), following the same moist curing instructions above if the weather is hot.

Check your work carefully to make sure you’ve colored all the mortar.

,
Clean up.",How to Stain Mortar," Stain is translucent so you must consider what colors are already in the mortar and then decide what must be added to obtain the color you want.


If you are disguising a repair or addition, what additional colors would make the new mortar match the old? If you just want a different look, what colors would give you the look you want? Be sure to consider how light or dark, strong or weak the colors should be. Don’t worry if you are not 100% certain about your decisions at this point.;
, One manufacturer will accept digital pictures of the color you have and the color you want and then advise you about what to purchase and what mixture of colors is likely to work well for you. You should be able to develop a mix recipe that brings you close to the color you want.

, If dirty, scrub with water and a brush. If necessary, use a cleaner recommended by your mortar distributor. Use harsh chemicals such as acid only when necessary.

, Follow manufacturer’s directions regarding appropriate weather for staining.

, Always wear gloves, safety glasses and old clothes when mixing and applying stain. Use tarps to protect nearby surfaces from spills. Keep rags and water handy to remove stain that might drip onto brick or stone where it doesn’t belong. Review the steps to take if stain mixture is spilled or splashed on your clothes, or on floors or walls.

, Try the mixture you have chosen on a 2 to 3 inch length of mortar joint in an unnoticeable location. Let it dry. If it dries to a color you like, begin staining the entire project. If you don’t like the color, adjust the recipe. If you want help adjusting the recipe, send digital photos of the test and ask your kit manufacturer to advise you.

, Use the 1 inch brush with Polyester bristles. Begin by stirring so you get in the habit of stirring with each dip. Then, drain the excess mixture from the brush by pushing it again the inside of the mixing cup on the side closest to your body.

, If you are right-handed, start your row on the left side and pull the brush to the right. If you are left-handed, reverse the procedure. Stain the mortar above 4 to 5 bricks. Complete three to four rows above or below the first row.

, When staining the vertical joints, keep the brush pointed slightly upwards. This will help prevent drips.

, Try to overlap your strokes as little as possible.

, Stain another group of horizontal and related vertical joints until the job is done.

Ensure that all the granite edges are smooth and straight and line up properly before you seam granite.,
Apply masking tape along the edges of the two pieces that you’re seaming.,
Add tint to clear, knife-grade, two-part epoxy to approximate the color of your granite.,
Attach one or two soft rubber suction cups on either side of the seam you are joining and attach turnbuckles between the suction cups.,
Mix the hardener into your tinted epoxy.








,
Butter the edges of your granite with your activated epoxy.








,
Tighten the turnbuckles to squeeze the two pieces of granite together.,
Pull a wet razor blade or putty knife along the edge of the epoxy to remove excess and to create a smooth seam that’s flush with the surface.








,
Wait for the epoxy to dry and remove the tape and suction cups.








,
Polish the countertop and seal for best results.








",How to Seam Granite," If the seams don’t line up properly or are rough, remedy the problem. Don’t grout your granite until you’re happy with the edges and fit.






;
, Some epoxies claim that they don’t stick to polished granite, meaning you shouldn’t need tape. Check the directions on the epoxy you’re using, but if you’re not sure, go with the tape when you seam granite.








, Mix the tint into the epoxy resin before adding the hardener. To ensure the best results, check the color by letting a small amount of epoxy dry. You can adjust the color accordingly based on the test.









You can get color kits at any home improvement store. When in doubt, go with more subdued colors; you don’t want the seam to be brighter or more colorful than the granite. Try mixing a few different shades and seeing which one look the least obtrusive next to your granite.

, You will use this to pull the two pieces of granite together as the seam dries. Leave room so you can work underneath the turnbuckle attachments.








,,, Don’t over tighten or you’ll pull the suction cups off the granite. Depending on your situation, you may also be able to use wedges to push the pieces of granite together.

Wait for your marble to dry.",How to Polish Marble," You will need a mild detergent, 3-4 soft cloths, a poultice for stain removal (optional), a polishing compound, a low-speed polisher with a felt wheel (optional), and a marble sealant. You can collect the items yourself or purchase a kit.If you have cultured marble, make sure that your product says it’s for cultured marble.
If you do not have access to a polisher, you can apply your marble polish with a soft rag; however, this method is very tiring.If you have stains, remove them with a poultice before polishing. Keep in mind that if you use a poultice you will need to wait at least 24 hours to continue to the next step.Use an etch remover polishing compound if you have water rings.;
, If your marble is surrounded by other surfaces such as wood or chrome that could be damaged by the products you will use, protect them with painter’s tape.

Cover wood and chrome surfaces.
If you have wood floors, consider taping around the edges of the bottom of the cabinet if you will be using a spray product because the product could land on the floor.

, Test a small area before you clean the entire slab. If you have stains, try removing them with just your detergent by gently working the area with your damp cloth over the stain., A poultice will remove stains that have settled into the porous surface of your marble. Polishing your marble will not remove the stains; instead, you will be sealing them in.You can purchase a commercial poultice or you can make your own. To make a poultice, mix just enough hydrogen peroxide into flour to create a paste.Smooth the poultice onto the stain and seal it by taping plastic wrap over it. Leave your poultice on for at least 24 hours. Old stains may require more time. Determining the time needed to remove old stains is a trial-and-error process.After 24-48 hours, remove the plastic, pour a little water over the dry poultice, and wipe it away with a soft cloth. Thoroughly dry the area.
If the stain persists, repeat this process again.

, Consult the side of the container for proper measurements, as different products recommend different amounts. Put the compound on the small section where you will begin work.Do not apply polishing compound to the entire piece of marble at once.How much polish you should apply will depend on the type of polish you choose and the size of the space you are polishing.
If you are not sure how much polish to apply, start with a little and add more as needed. It’s easier to add more than it is to remove excess.

, While you can use either, it takes longer to use a soft cloth, and if you do not keep up the same level of pressure it could affect your results, so a low-speed polisher might be your best bet.

If you have a drill, you can replace the drill bit with a felt-top sanding disk so that you can use it as a polisher.

, Only work on one small section of 1-2 feet at a time to create an even finish and avoid having your polishing compound dry out or begin to clump up. Working in small sections also helps you evenly distribute the polish because you are able to add small amounts of polish as you go.Start in a corner and work your way around the entire area to make sure you apply an even polish. If you start in the middle, then you may miss a spot.

, If you're using a soft cloth, make tight, circular movements. If you're using a polisher, slowly move it in a controlled circular motion. When you finish with the flat sides, polish the corners with a soft rag, continuing your circular movements.Use a low to medium speed if you’re using a polisher.

, Use a dry cloth to wipe away the residue, and then finish with a damp cloth to ensure a clean surface., Wait 24 hours before applying your sealant.If your cultured marble still has stains or shows damage, you can polish it with a buffing compound and then again with a polishing compound. If neither of these products works, cultured marble can be wet sanded using 1,000-grit wet/dry sandpaper.Don’t try buffing compound or wet sanding on natural marble because it is more easily damaged.

, Sealants can be topical or impregnator. Topical sealants sit on top of the marble and prevent staining, while impregnators go below the surface and repel water and oils while still allowing the marble to breathe. Countertops and vanities are usually sealed with an impregnator, while floors and other types of marble may be better served by a topical sealant.Don’t seal cultured marble because it’s stronger and doesn’t need a sealant. Some cultured marbles won’t take a sealant.You don’t need to seal marble in a shower unless you plan to use products that stain. Personal care products don’t stain marble unless they’re allowed to sit. Shaving cream can cause etching, but that’s not prevented by a sealant.

, A sealant won't prevent all stains, but will provide some protection to your marble surface. You can purchase marble sealant in a spray bottle at a hardware or home goods store. As you spray on your sealant, make sure that the entire surface of your marble is wet.

Don’t let the sealant fully dry or it will streak.
You can add water to the sealant by spraying on water or dabbing with a damp cloth. Adding water to sealant that is drying too fast will prevent streaking.

, Consult your container for the application time. After your sealant has been on the marble for the recommended time, use a dry cloth to wipe the surface dry.Most sealants recommend a wait time of 10-20 minutes.If you let it sit longer than the recommended time, the sealant will streak.
If your sealant recommends two applications, then repeat the steps once.

, Allow your marble to sit for 6-8 hours. Avoid using or placing anything on your marble until it has completely dried because the seal needs time to set. You don’t want to risk getting the sealant that’s seeped into the surface wet while it’s still fresh.

Marble should be sealed every 6-12 months.

Remove any flaked or peeling paint from the masonry.,
Clean the brick wall.,
Apply a masonry sealer to the wall.,
Apply primer to the masonry wall.,
Paint the brick wall.",How to Paint Masonry Walls," If the wall has already been painted, you need to remove any old paint that is loose, peeling, or flaking away. On an exterior wall, this is most efficiently done with a sandblaster. In areas where a sandblaster would be too messy and cumbersome, loose paint can be removed with a stiff wire brush and a paint scraper.


Failing to remove loose and peeling paint can result in the paint flakes mixing in with your fresh coat of paint and marring the finish.;
, Like other surfaces, masonry should be cleaned before painting. The best product for cleaning brick is trisodium phosphate (TSP). This compound can be purchased in powder form at hardware stores, or a cleaning product that contains TSP can be used, such as Spic and Span.


Mix the TSP with water in a bucket according to the manufacturer's directions. Apply the resulting mixture to the brick with a scrub brush, allowing it to thoroughly dry before proceeding with the painting process.

, Because most masonry is more porous and more highly textured than materials such as drywall or wood, the extra step of applying a sealer is necessary before priming and painting. Masonry sealer can be purchased at home improvement stores, and is usually a latex-based formulation that is applied with a brush or roller just like paint. Some brick is not so porous and most paint will tend to peel. For this, an oil based pigmented bonding primer is superior if you can find it. It is slow drying and soaks deep.


Because brick has such high relief, a paint roller with a long nap (about 1 inch / 25 mm) is the ideal tool for applying sealer. Use the roller to apply a single coat of sealer across your brick wall, cutting in around the edges with an angled-sash paintbrush if necessary.
Allow the sealer to dry completely before proceeding to prime. Brushes and rollers can be cleaned with soap and water if using a latex-based sealer. Note that if your brick wall has already been painted, applying sealer is not necessary.

, Both oil-based and latex-based primers will work well on masonry, and an interior or exterior product should be used based on your wall's location. Masonry can be primed with the same primers used on drywall and other surfaces, but some manufacturers also offer specially formulated masonry primers that improve water resistance.


Like the sealer, the primer should be applied with a long-nap roller and an angled-sash brush. One coat is sufficient, and sanding is generally not necessary between the sealer and primer coats. Make sure that the primer covers all of the mortar joints in the wall; it may be necessary to touch these joints up with the brush.
After allowing the primer to dry, give the brick wall a light scuff sanding with a pole sander equipped with medium-grit sandpaper. This will improve the paint's adhesion.

, Like priming, painting masonry can be accomplished with ordinary latex or oil paints, although masonry paints are available that increase the wall's ability to repel moisture.


It is best to use the same formulation for both your primer and paint. For example, if you used a latex primer, a latex paint will adhere better than an oil paint.
Apply the paint using a long-nap roller in long, smooth strokes. Try to work quickly, as applying fresh paint over partially dried paint can cause flaking. If a second coat is desired, sand the wall lightly with a pole sander between coats.

Clean the bricks.,
Prepare the surface.,
Choose the paint.,
Paint your brick house.,
Let the paint dry.,
Add a second coat of paint.",How to Paint a Brick House,"


Spray the brick surface with a hose. Water is typically effective in removing most of the dirt and dust from bricks.
Use a pressure washer if there is a layer of dirt on the surface of the house, or if there are any areas caked with mud. Utilize a pressure washer that offers 1500 PSI.
Remove white stains with a stiff brush. White stains indicate efflorescence, or salt deposits.
Apply a solution of bleach and water to get rid of mildew. Leave the solution on the bricks for about 20 minutes, and then scrape the surface with a stiff brush.;
,


Cover windows and doors with newspaper. Attach the newspaper to the doors and windows with painter's tape. Cover any other areas that you do not want to paint.
Repair cracks. Use a scraper to widen cracks in the bricks. Brush out the dust, and seal the cracks with acrylic caulk. Allow the caulk to dry for about 5 hours.
Apply latex primer to the surface of the bricks. Use a paintbrush, paint roller or paint sprayer. Put a few extra coats of primer on the areas that were affected by efflorescence.

,


Select elastodynamics paint. It is dense enough to fill in cracks in the bricks, but you will need to apply 2 coats. Elastodynamics paint is also known for repelling water well enough to protect the brick surface during inclement weather. You can buy this paint at most home improvement stores.
Choose acrylic latex exterior paint. Acrylic latex paint allows moisture to leave the surface of the bricks and helps to prevent mildew. It is available at most home improvement stores. You usually just need to apply 1 coat of paint, as you only need a second coat if you can see spots of white wall behind the first layer.

,


Apply the paint with a paint sprayer. Though a paint sprayer is more expensive than a paintbrush, you can paint bricks faster with this tool than you can with a paintbrush. Move the sprayer side to side, overlapping a bit in areas that you have already painted.
Get a paint roller for painting bricks. Paint rollers are larger and costlier than most paintbrushes, but are less expensive than paint sprayers. Paint rollers take less time to paint houses than a paintbrush, but more time than a sprayer. Start at the top of the house, and move the roller up and down as you slowly move to the side to paint the adjacent sections.
Use a paintbrush to fill in spots that you cannot get to with the paint sprayer or roller. Areas by the doors, windows and trim require precision that a paint sprayer and roller do not provide.

, Read the instructions on the paint bucket to determine how long the paint needs to dry.

, Only apply a second coat if the paint's instructions recommend it.

, The vehicle is likely to be registered anywhere but locally if the contractor is not local. This indicates that the contractor is only in town for storm work and won't be hanging around for upkeep or remedying any damage that is poorly fixed.

, Quiz an out-of-town contractor very carefully. Extract a promise of return for further mending even if the contractor leaves the state; get this in writing. Long-term warranties, however, won't be much good if your contractor has left town.

, Ask for current certificates of workman's compensation and liability insurance. This is for your protection. They must have both, as one covers property damage and one covers their workers from injuries if they fall from your roof. Roofing contractors usually use sub contractors to install the roofs, and a lot have crews that travel with them. In most states, the home owner or their insurance company will be liable if something happens; you don't want to risk your home.

, This can lead some contractors to cut corners to avoid the expense. Insist on seeing proof of current dated insurance.

, These will be very vague, lacking in description of the work to be done and will lack information about insurance proceeds.

, Check your local Yellow Pages; go back two or three years to find stability of business continuity. Check the BBB when they joined, as they often join the local BBB because when they come into town, they will be new members.

, There have been instances where storm chasing roofing contractors come in, roof a bunch of houses, and leave without paying the suppliers, thereby leaving the homeowner to pay twice! Ask to see invoices for payments.

, In a storm situation, it is always best to buy from an established local roofing contractor as they will be around to service their work afterward. If your state has any state licensing requirements, you will be able to check these online.

Consider aspects when estimating roof repairs for your home.,
Plan ahead.,
Choose a roofing contractor to employ for a roof repair, it is imperative to research.,
You need time to plan for roof repairing.",How to Save Money During Roof Repair," Especially, if you staying in a place like Plano, that experiences heavy demand for such a service.


One definite consideration should be whether or not the roof is worth repairing.
It is vital to get at least one, preferably two or more, professional estimates on the job. If the cost of repairing the roof is not cost effective, or if the consumer would like a new roof for cosmetic reasons, replacement is a better option.;
, It is common knowledge that repair costs skyrocket during the winter months due to demand.


By planning ahead and having a roof inspected in the Spring, an individual can avoid the unnecessary inflation charged by most roofing contractors during the winters.
Also, should the initial repair not suit the needs of the customer, the follow-up repair will not be as desperate as when there would be snow falling through the roof.

Spring roof repairs can save an individual a considerable amount of money. It is also important to clarify with the roofing contractor if the price quoted for the repair work includes the material.


It is not advisable to be unaware when the actual bill is significantly more than what the consumer expected. If the estimate does not include the materials, the company should provide the material cost itemized for the consumer so that they are aware of how the money is allocated.  

, The internet has a wealth of information on companies.


Many organizations have their own site that will provide the consumer with a vast array of information. Many times reviews by individuals on roof repair companies can be found fairly easily as well. As with all Internet reviews, some of them will go to extremes, and it is important to glean the overall performance of the company.
Friends and family can also be helpful to save some money with a referral service. Certain companies offer a discounted rate for new customers if they have been referred by existing customers. Often the same company will also discount the referring party's next service as well.
Referral programs are a great way to save money and a handy promotional tool for the roofing contractor or company.  

, Warranties on work done and materials should be standard from any repair service, the longer the better for the consumer. It is more lucrative to save money by utilizing a reputable service that guarantees their work rather than have to go through multiple repairs, and pay for them out of pocket.

Run the right cycle for your load.",How to Get Cleaner Dishes from Your Dishwasher," The dirt and grime from your dirty dishes doesn’t magically disappear after you run a dishwasher cycle. Make sure the filter isn't full of gunk from your last cycle. If it is, check your owner’s manual about how to remove it. Then simply wash it in the sink with some dish soap and a sponge, rinse off the soapy water, and put it back in place.A clogged filter is one of the most common culprits behind dishes that come out dirty after a cycle. That’s because the dirty water from the last cycle didn’t drain entirely. This means you’re washing the next batch with the same icky water.
If your filter looks really foul after you take out, you may want to soak it in hot water and dish soap for up to an hour. Also, instead of a sponge, use something more abrasive, like a nylon bristle brush.;
, Like the filter, a clogged spray arm can lower your machine’s performance. That's because the clogs will block the fresh water that's supposed to be washing your dishes. Check your owner’s manual on how to detach the spray arms. Then, once you have them out, check all the holes along each arm to make sure they’re clear. If they’re gunked up:Use steel wire, cable, or even a wire hanger to poke the clog out. Then give the hole a quick flossing.
Follow that up by soaking them in distilled white vinegar. That will break up any gunk that your flossing couldn’t dislodge.

, Over time, gunk is going to build up around the main door’s interior, as well as the rubber gasket that forms its seal. This can cause a yucky odor, so give the door and gasket a quick clean. Wipe them down with a damp cloth or paper towels. Do the same with the soap door inside the machine, too., Now that you’ve cleaned the more out-of-the-way places where gunk and grime like to hide, give your machine a general clean. Just dump a cup (237 ml) of distilled white vinegar in the bottom of the machine. Then start a normal wash cycle and let the dishwasher clean itself., After all that hard work spent on cleaning your machine, don’t undo it all by clogging everything up again with loose food. Dump any crumbs and whatnot into your garbage can or disposal unit before you load them in your washer. Save yourself the time and effort of having to clean the filter and arms all over again!, If little bits of food have crusted over and stuck to your dishes, don’t worry about getting rid of those before putting them into the washer. Many dishwasher detergents are designed to stick to those bits of food, so you actually want to leave them!Only rinse them off or give them a soak if you don’t have enough for a full load just yet and you’re worried about attracting pests.
In that case, it’s usually better to run them through a rinse-only cycle in your machine if it offers that option.
If you rinse or soak them in the sink, don’t use dish soap. Traces of it may end up in your machine and leave a soapy film behind.

, If you’re going to need to run more than one load, sort your dishes out first. Group the really dirty ones that will need a heavy wash together, and keep the ones that only need a light or normal cycle by themselves. This way you won't have to run two heavy cycles.

If you have only enough for one load, but there are one or two that are way dirtier than the others, set those aside and wash them by hand instead., Keep in mind that just because you can fit x-amount of dishes inside your machine, that doesn’t mean each will come out equally clean. Space dishes out so there’s room for water to pass up and down in between.For instance, angling bowls so they’re at a 45-degree angle means you can fit more inside than if you lay them upside down. But crowding them too close together could result in one bowl blocking the one behind it.
The same goes for your utensils. Don’t cram the utensil rack full.

, If you put these in the bottom, they'll block the spray arms. This means water won’t reach whatever you have up top. So use the bottom rack for flat dishes, like plates and baking sheets. For larger deep dishes that won’t fit in the top rack, wash them by hand.If you do put larger dishes in the bottom rack, don't bother putting anything else on top. Odds are that you'd just have to wash whatever's up there again!

, Make sure your water heater is set somewhere between 120 and 125 degrees Fahrenheit (49 and 52 degrees Celsius). Many come preset to such a temperature, but go give it a look-see if you adjusted it for any reason, or if you’ve never checked its temperature before. Readjust it if needed, especially if it’s set any higher than that.Higher temperatures may cause water to evaporate before it has a chance to drain off your dishes. This means that the water’s gone, but the dirt that it was supposed to wash off is still there.

, If your sink has a disposal unit, there’s a good chance that it’s also hooked up to your dishwasher. Before you run your load, run some cold water from the faucet and switch the disposal on. Get rid of any blockage in the unit, because that can cause dirty water from draining into the machine., You know how you have to give the shower a minute to warm up before you can step inside with freezing your butt off? Expect the same thing to happen with your dishwasher. Before you run it:Turn on the hot tap to your kitchen sink and let the faucet run until the water turns hot.
Once hot water is in the line, switch the faucet off and start your machine.

, Only use the amount recommended by your particular brand’s instructions. Using more might seem like a sure-fire way to get your dishes extra-clean, but that can actually backfire. That's because the more detergent you use, the more residue it will leave behind, which can trap gunk that's supposed to rinse off.

If you intend on using a rinse-aid in addition to your detergent, double-check your detergent to make sure it doesn’t include its own rinse-aid. Using a stand-alone aid on top of an all-in-one detergent is a just waste of product., Dishwashers use both water and electricity, but don’t cheat yourself by trying to save money on utilities. If your load needs a heavy wash, don’t skimp and run a light or normal cycle instead. If you do, you're probably going to have to run it a second time to get them clean, so save yourself the time and money."

Prepare the kitchen space for the dishwasher.,
Connect the water supply under the sink.,
Connect the water supply line to the dishwasher.,
Hook up the dishwasher drain line.,
Connect the electrical wires to the dishwashing unit.,
Secure the dishwasher to the cabinet.",How to Install a Built In Dishwasher,"









Most standard built-in dishwashers need at least a 24-inch (60 cm) wide opening. If necessary, you can adjust your cupboard to the height of the dishwasher by removing the cupboard top, or adding an overhang to cover a gap between the top of the dishwasher and the countertop.
If you are installing a dishwasher for the first time in a space, drill holes through the cabinet for the dishwasher's electric wires, water inlets and drain tube.;
,









Turn the water supply off and disconnect the sink's hot water supply inlet. Connect a dual outlet valve to the hot water inlet under the sink. Reattach the sink hot water outlet to one side, and attach the dishwasher water supply line to the other outlet.
Using the dual outlet valve, you can turn the water off to either the dishwasher unit or the sink, so that the water flows to the other at the same time.

, This step will vary depending on the type of dishwasher you are installing. Some newer dishwasher models require that your water and electrical wiring connect to a panel under the front of the unit. However, many models have water, electric and drain connections in the back of the dishwasher.









Thread Teflon tape around the dishwasher water inlet.
Thread a right angle elbow to the inlet, and attach the water line to the elbow. Use a wrench to make sure the line is secure.
If the dishwasher has flush front inlets, you need to tape the supply line and electrical wiring flat to the floor, so that the dishwasher can sit on top of them.

,









Attach the dishwasher drainpipe to an existing dishwasher drain piece. If this is a new installation, replace the drainpipe under the sink with a dishwasher tailpiece, so that you can attach the drain tubing to the sink drain above the trap.
Secure the drain pipe to the top of the cupboard behind the dishwasher using plumber's strapping and a screw, so that the top arch of the tube is higher than the drain inlet. This prevents drain water from backing up into the dishwasher. If your local building code requires the use of an air gap to prevent backups, attach the air gap to the supply line in place of this step.

,









Turn the power off at the main breaker before starting.
Run the electrical wires into the back of the dishwasher's electrical box.
Attach the black (hot) wire to the black wires coming out of the dishwasher using an electrical wire nut.
Attach the white (neutral) wire to the white wires coming from the dishwasher with the nut.
Attach the ground wire (usually green) to the ground screw on the electrical box.
Tuck the secure connections in the dishwasher electric box.

,









Push the under-the-counter dishwasher into its spot, being careful not to crimp any wiring or water tubes located under the unit.
Check to make sure the unit sits level. If it is not, adjust the leveling feet by screwing them in or out.
Mount the front of the dishwasher on the unit with the hardware provided with the product.
Turn the power back on, and make sure your water supply valve is on. Run the dishwasher through a cycle to make sure there are no leaks or problems.
Attach mounting brackets at the top of the dishwasher to the bottom of your countertop. These come with your dishwasher. If the screws are too long and will go through the cabinet into your countertop, buy screws that will fit your cabinet.

Remove the access panel from the front of the dishwasher.,
Check the pump.,
Check common leak locations first.,
Inspect the door gasket.,
Check the spray arm.,
Check the water level.,
Inspect the water inlet valve.,
Make sure the hoses and clamps are secure and intact.",How to Fix a Leaky Dishwasher1," Most dishwashers have an access panel or kickplate on the bottom that covers the water inlet, pump, motor, and hoses. To remove the panel, use a screwdriver and loosen the screws attaching the panel to the unit. Turn the screws to the left (counter-clockwise) to loosen them.


Removing the panel will help you find the source of the leak, which may be coming from underneath the dishwasher.;
, The pump and all its components are located under the dishwasher. Use a flashlight to inspect the pump, housing, motor, and the seal or gasket. Check for cracks in the pump or housing, and inspect the seal or gasket for damage.When there's a problem with the pump or pump components, water will leak from below the dishwasher.

, Most dishwasher leaks come from around or under the door, but water may also be leaking from below the unit. Determining the source of the water can help you narrow down the possible causes. Run the dishwasher through a normal cycle and watch closely to see where the water is coming from.

Water leaking around or under the door could indicate a problem with the gasket, spray arm, or float.
Water leaking from under the unit could indicate a problem with the pump, hoses, or water inlet.

, The gasket is a soft vinyl or rubber seal that makes the unit watertight when the door is closed. The gasket will either be on the door itself (around the sides and top), or on the tub opening. Check this for breaks, cracks, brittleness, or other signs of damage.Water leaking from the sides of the dishwasher doors usually means there's a problem with the gasket.
The tub is the interior basin of the dishwasher unit.

, The spray arm is inside the dishwasher, at the bottom center of the unit. This is what sprays the dishes with water during the wash and rinse cycles. Inspect the spray arm for cracks, warping, blockages, or other damage.

A problem with the spray arm usually causes water to leak from the bottom of the dishwasher door, where there's no gasket., The float is a safety device inside the tub that determines the water level and prevents the dishwasher from overfilling. When the dishwasher is in mid-cycle and full, turn it off, open the door, and check the water level. The water shouldn’t be any higher than the heating element in the bottom of the tub.If the water is higher than the heating element, there may be a problem with the float or float switch.
When the float is the problem, water will often leak from the bottom front of the dishwasher.

, The inlet valve is also below the dishwasher, and this is what connects the dishwasher to your home’s water supply. It may be a rubber hose, a braided hose, or a copper pipe. When the dishwasher is filling up, check the valve and the connections for leaks, which could indicate a crack or tear.Leaks or tears in the water inlet valve will come from below the dishwasher.

, The hoses connected to the pump under the dishwasher allow water to flow from one area of the dishwasher to another, and drain water from the tub. When the dishwasher is running, check the hoses for leaks or drips.When the hoses crack or tear, or when the clamps come loose, water may leak from the bottom of the unit.

Secure the gasket.",How to Fix a Leaky Dishwasher2," When the leak is caused by a damaged or brittle gasket, you can fix the leak by removing the old gasket and replacing it with a new one. Make sure the replacement gasket you purchase is manufacturer-approved, and that it matches the make and model of your dishwasher.

A gasket that’s not made for your dishwasher may not fit properly, and this means it won’t form a proper seal and will continue to leak.

, Open the dishwasher door. Start at the bottom left corner, and pinch the gasket firmly with your fingers. Loosen the gasket out of position, and peel it away from the edge of the door or tub. Continue peeling until you have removed the gasket from its position.


Pay attention to the orientation of the gasket around the tub or door. The new gasket will have to be installed in the same way., Fill a small bowl with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Soak a cotton swab in the soapy water, and use the swab to clean the area where the gasket was. Once it’s clean, rinse the area with clean water. Wipe it dry with a rag and let the area air dry.

This will give the new gasket a clean and dry surface to adhere to, and this will ensure a proper seal.

, Warm the new gasket with a blow dryer on a low heat setting. When it’s warm and malleable, fold the gasket in half and locate the center. Start at the top center of the door or tub, and press the middle of the gasket into position. Working out from either side, push the gasket into place.

Don’t stretch the gasket as you work.

, Once the gasket has been installed, shut the dishwasher door to press the gasket firmly into place. Open the door to check the alignment. When you're satisfied with the placement of the gasket, shut and latch the door for a few hours to seal the gasket to the door or tub."

Do the front and back of the placemats to make sure you remove all surface dirt and debris.Wiping vinyl and plastic placemats on a regular basis can keep them clean, especially if you use them often for your meals.;
, To do a deep clean on the placemats, scrub them with a mixture of soap and warm water. Put a few drops of soap on a wet sponge. Then, use the sponge to scrub the placemats. Focus on any spots that have stains or food on them. Scrub in gentle round motions to remove dirt and debris.Do not scrub the placemats hard or rub any areas for a long period of time. This can end up damaging the placemats.

, If there are stubborn stains or pieces of food on the placemats, try soaking them in a mixture of warm water and soap. Fill your sink with warm water and add a few drops of soap. Then, put the placemats in the water to soak for one to two minutes.Once the placemats have been soaked, take them out and use a sponge or cloth to wipe them off. Stains and pieces of food should be easier to remove once the placemats have been soaked.

, Vinyl and plastic placements can usually handle a mild cleaner. Use a mild kitchen spray or a mild all purpose house cleaner on the placemats. Apply the cleaner and wipe the mats down with a damp cloth or sponge.Make sure you use cleaner that does not contain any harmful chemicals or additives, as you do not want any of these substances to get from the mat to your food. Go for a cleaner that is safe for use in kitchens and in your home.

, Once you have cleaned the vinyl or plastic placemats, put them in a dish rack to dry overnight. You can also place them on a clean towel to dry, laying them side by side.


Do not stack them on top of one another to dry, as the water may get trapped between the placemats.

, Before you put in the new seal, verify there are no chips or cracks on the surface. This is a pressure seal and the face of it connects to the stainless steel bottom of the drain impeller, so it needs to fit perfectly. If required, lubricate it with some water along the edge to make it slide into place easier and so it won’t bind to the motor shaft.

, The cover should not be flat when the screw goes in. If it does lay flat, then the cover won’t sit far enough down the pump housing and it won’t create a good seal.

, The bushing has a notch that will fit into a hole on top the top of the drain impeller and also a hook into the chopper blade.

, The four screws are not symmetrical with the body of the pump so line those up. Loosely replace the screws with the number #20 Torx driver.

Put the placemats in the washer, if safe.",How to Clean Place Mats2," If you have fabric placemats, do not let any stains or spots sit on the fabric for very long. Remove stains right away, as the longer they sit on the placemats, the more difficult it will be to get them out. Food that tends to stain fabric like tomato, mustard, and coffee should be removed right away if they get on the placemats.You may keep two sets of placemats, one made of vinyl or plastic and one made of fabric. Use the fabric placemats for special occasions, as they will be more difficult to clean if they get dirty.

, Use a clean cloth or a sponge that has been dampened with soap and water. Dab any stains or spots on the mat until they come out. Do not scrub or rub the mats, as this can damage the fabric.Once you have spot cleaned the placemats, let them air dry flat on a clean towel. You can also hang them on a clothesline to dry.

, For stubborn stains, try a cleaner that is safe for use on fabric, such as an all natural cleaner or liquid detergent. Make sure the cleaner does not contain harmful chemicals like bleach or ammonia. Apply a small amount of the cleaner to the mats with a damp cloth or sponge.Let the placemats air dry once you have cleaned them. Make sure all the cleaner is removed on the placemats before you let them air dry.

, Check that the fabric placemats are washing machine safe before you put them in your washer. Most fabric placemats can go in the washing machine. Once you have washed the placemats, let them air dry. Air drying them will ensure they do not get damaged by the high heat of the dryer.


Do not wash towels or clothing with the placemats, as they can lead to pilling. Wash only the placemats and other fabric items like table runners or table cloths together.

Use white vinegar on cork placemats.,
Do not put bamboo, wicker, or cork placemats in the washer.",How to Clean Place Mats3," Dampen a clean cloth or a sponge with warm water and add one to two drops of mild dish soap. Then, gently wipe the placemats with the cloth to remove any dirt or food residue. Rinse the placements with water once you are done cleaning them and let them air dry.Do not rub or scrub the placemats, as this can damage the bamboo or wicker. Gentle wiping is best for these types of placemats.

, If you have placemats made of cork, white vinegar is a good cleaning agent. Mix one part white vinegar with one part water. Then, dampen a clean cloth with the solution and wipe the down the cork placemats. You can also put the solution in a spray bottle and apply it to the placemats in a few sprays.Cork can mold if water is left sitting on it. To avoid this, use a clean cloth to absorb any water remaining on the cork once you clean it. Press the cork dry using the cloth. Then, let it air dry overnight., These materials do not hold up well in the washing machine or the dryer. Use clean cloths and sponges to clean these types of placemats. They do best with a gentle hand cleaning once a week."

Take pets away from the area.,
Ventilate the area well.,
Remove objects from the vicinity.,
Follow your specific owner’s manual.",How to Use the Self Cleaning Cycle on an Oven1," Remove pets from the kitchen vicinity or the house itself before you start a self-cleaning cycle on your oven. Take special care with birds, who are particularly susceptible to harm from this process, by removing them from the house completely.


Note that pet birds are easily harmed and killed by inhaling the fumes that come from the pyrolytic coating on self-cleaning ovens, as well as many other nonstick kitchen items containing a substance known as PTFE.While humans and other pets are less susceptible for toxicity from this chemical, they can also experience irritation from PTFE fumes while running the cleaning cycle. Pets should be kept on another floor or removed area of the house for safety, and humans should also try to stay away, except to monitor the progress of the oven cleaning.;
, Keep air flowing in the kitchen where you will turn on the self-cleaning oven feature. Turn on the vent fan on an oven range and open available doors and windows.


You will notice an unpleasant odor from your oven once it reaches high heat for the cleaning cycle. This is due to the heating of the pyrolytic coating, as well as the burning food material.
You can also consider setting up a fan faced toward an open window or door to help pull the smell from the oven outdoors.
Do not perform the self-cleaning function on your oven if you don’t have these ventilation options available. Your kitchen can fill with smoke and fumes, set off smoke detectors, and become very overheated.

, Take out all removable objects from the inside of your oven, as well as on top of it and below it, just to be safe. This would include any stainless steel oven racks, thermometers, cooking stones, etc.


Do not forget to remove any and all items from the warming tray below your oven, if you have one.
Some oven racks are also coated with the pyrolytic material needed for self-cleaning and are thus intended to remain inside the oven for the cleaning cycle. Standard stainless steel racks should typically be removed. Consult your model’s manual to be sure of this., Consult the manual that came with your oven that will be unique to the specific model. Follow any instructions and safety considerations listed regarding the self-clean function before you use it.


If you don’t have or can’t find your original owner’s manual, search online under the brand and model of your oven, as they are typically available in a digital format.If you are having trouble determining the model and brand or locating a manual, especially for older ovens, consult a manufacturer or appliance specialist about the self-cleaning function before you use it.

Hand wash your car normally.,
Avoid thinners, solvents, and gasoline.,
Use a pressure sprayer up to 1800 psi.,
Go through an automatic car wash. Once again, if the Plasti Dip has been properly applied, has had time to cure, and isn’t peeling, a trip through the average automatic car wash will have no negative impact on it.,
Wash brake dust and grime off your wheels.",How to Clean Plasti Dip1," For all intents and purposes, a “dipped” car (that is, a car coated in Plasti Dip) can be washed in exactly the same way as a traditionally painted vehicle. For the most thorough cleaning, hand washing the car with automotive soap (or even dish soap), clean water, a hose, and lint-free cloths for washing and drying is probably your best bet.Should you so choose, you can purchase soaps and cloths marketed specifically for dipped cars.Since Plasti Dip provides a protective coating against UV rays, salt, etc., applying waxes or similar finishes/protectants after washing is unnecessary.;
, Because of Plasti Dip's composition, solvent-based cleaners could cause bubbling, peeling, or other damage to the applied product. Basically, just stick to common soap-based cleaners.Exercise caution when adding fuel to your car, as spilled or dripped gasoline could harm your Plasti Dip finish. You can order special drip guards if desired., Because Plasti Dip can be peeled off by hand with relative ease, some people are hesitant to use pressure sprayers to wash their dipped cars. However, if the Plasti Dip has been properly applied, allowed to cure for a few weeks, and is not peeling along edges or other spots, a common water sprayer of up to 1800 psi can be used.This means you can use one of the self-wash bays at your local car wash without incident.
If you want to exercise added caution, use only the level of water pressure needed to get the job done.

, The various scrubbers, sprays, buffers, and so on should not pose a problem., While some enthusiasts dip their entire cars, others stick to applying Plasti Dip to their hubcaps and wheels. Typical soap-based cleaning methods will work fine in keeping dipped wheels clean.However, newer spray-on, no-scrub, rinse-off cleaners developed for wheels (whether dipped or not) have come on the market as well."

Mix baking soda and water.,
Spread the paste around the oven.,
Spray vinegar on the paste.,
Wait.,
Wipe up paste with a damp cloth.",How to Clean a Non‐Self‐Cleaning Oven2," To make a paste, mix about ½ cup of baking soda with two or three tablespoons of water. You want to have a thick but smooth paste that you can easily spread on the bottom of the oven.








If the solution is too thick, you can add more water. If it is too runny, you can add more baking soda.
Double or triple the recipe based on how much cleaning solution you need for your oven.

, Use a sponge to evenly coat the bottom and sides of the oven with the baking soda paste. Make sure that all stains and encrusted areas are covered with the paste.









You can also clean the inside of the oven window with this mixture. Open the oven door so that it is flat, and spread out the paste on top of the window., Put distilled white vinegar in a spray bottle, and spray it over the baking soda paste. It will start to fizz. This process will help break down grease and stains caked onto the bottom of the oven.









You can also do this step after the baking soda has sat for a few hours. This helps remove any remaining baking soda., Leave the baking soda paste on overnight or for at least twelve hours. This will let the baking soda break down grime, and it will make the stains easier to remove.







, Use a warm, damp cloth to wipe up the baking soda.Most of the crust or stains should wipe up easily, but you may need to scrub to get harder stains out.









If the bottom of your oven is very dirty, you may need to rinse out the sponge and wipe everything down again. Do this as needed until the oven is clean.If there are still crusted-on stains in hard to reach places, you can use a spatula to scrub them off.

, Fill the bath with hot water. Mix half a cup of dishwashing liquid or powder into the water until the water is soapy.







, Place the oven racks in the bathtub, making sure that each rack is submerged under the water as much as possible. Leave them to soak overnight or up to twelve hours.







, When you remove the racks, use a damp rag or sponge to wipe off grime, grease, and dirt. Rinse them with clean water from the shower or sink. To dry the racks, wipe them down with a dry rag or old towel before putting them back in the oven.









You can remove the towels from the bathtub at this point, and wash them separately in a laundry machine.

Remove oven racks.,
Scrape off large food residue.,
Locate and engage the clean button.,
Lock the oven door and wait.",How to Use the Self Cleaning Cycle on an Oven2," Doing this will prevent damage to your racks.

, Assist in the success of the cleaning cycle by scraping at large food stains to loosen them. This will make the resulting ash easier to remove later.


Use a kitchen tool with a straight edge to gently scrape away dried-on food. However, avoid very sharp edges, as this could scratch away the pyrolytic coating over time.
Don’t worry about getting all of the food stains scraped completely away. The goal is not to remove all of the material, just to help loosen it before the self-clean cycle.

, Find the button or setting within your oven’s control panel or knobs that says “Clean” or “Self-Clean.” Engage this function to begin the cycle.


Depending on your oven model, you may need to select a time period to run the cleaning cycle. Typically a full cycle runs between 2 and 4 hours to fully heat up to 800°F to 1000°F and then cool all the way back down. For some models, you can only use one setting, such as 4 hours.For safety, your oven model may also automatically lock the door of your oven for the duration of the cleaning cycle.

, If your oven doesn’t lock the door automatically, engage the lock by pressing a “Lock” or “Control Lock” button, or manually moving a lever to do so. Then wait the 2-4 hours it takes for the full cycle to complete.


Some ovens will feature a countdown or words on the display to indicate the phases of the cleaning cycle and the time remaining (for example, cLn 4:00).
Some oven owners experience problems with their ovens after self-cleaning cycles, especially after repeated cycles on older ovens. This is because the prolonged high heat can more quickly damage heating elements and electronic control panels. For a lower risk of this, try setting the cleaning cycle to just an hour if you are able to, or opt for a gentle manual cleaning."
"
Pour water into the bottom of the oven.,
Locate and engage the clean button.,
Wait for the cycle to complete.",How to Use the Self Cleaning Cycle on an Oven3," Use about a cup of water to pour into the bottom of a cooled oven with a steam clean feature. Consult your owner’s manual on the exact amount of water to use for your oven model.


Note that this method should only be used for an oven with a “steam clean” feature built in. Do not pour water into the bottom of an oven before engaging a regular pyrolytic cleaning cycle, or in an oven that has no self-cleaning feature at all.
Run a steam clean cycle after a recent food spill, and regularly, for the best results., Find the button or setting within your oven’s control panel or knobs that indicates “Steam Clean.” Some models may refer to this feature as EasyClean (LG) or AquaLift (Maytag).Turn this function on to begin the cleaning cycle.


A steam clean cycle works by heating the oven to a temperature that allows the water to steam and distribute throughout the oven, softening and loosening food particles, which are removed easily from a special enamel coating on the walls.
Because of the lower temperature, time period, and lack of chemicals of this type of cycle compared to standard pyrolytic, you can leave oven racks or even pans inside the oven during cleaning, and the oven door does not need to be locked., Allow the full steam cleaning cycle to complete before opening the oven. Wait till it has cooled to perform the rest of the cleaning process.


A steam clean cycle typically takes from 20 to 60 minutes, so it is much faster than a standard pyrolytic self-clean cycle. However, you should still expect to wait for the time allotted for the cycle by your specific machine.
Some oven models may provide a countdown that lets you know how much time is left in the steam cleaning cycle.

Wipe down the cooled oven.,
Clean other parts as needed.,
Avoid hand-cleaning with abrasive material.",How to Use the Self Cleaning Cycle on an Oven4," Wait until the cleaning cycle is completely finished, the oven is cooled, and the door lock is disengaged to open the oven. Wipe down the inner surfaces of the oven with a damp cloth to complete the cleaning process.


The high temperatures of the pyrolytic cleaning cycle carbonize food matter in the oven until it turns to a light ash, not unlike that from a cigarette or campfire. This makes it easy to sweep out with just a cloth.For after a steam-clean cycle, simply use a damp cloth to remove the softened and loosened food material from the surfaces of the oven.

, Clean the inner glass on the oven door, the oven racks, and any other elements with persistent stains using baking soda or your favorite cleaner. You can clean removable items while the self-cleaning cycle is completed.


For an easy way to clean oven racks that must be removed from the oven before a self-clean, soak them in the bathtub with dishwasher detergent or apply baking soda and vinegar to remove built-up stains.Further clean the inside of the oven door only if the self-clean cycle has not removed all stains from it, and only after it has cooled completely from that cycle.

, Spot-clean in between self-cleaning cycles on your oven, but don’t use abrasive materials like scrubbing brushes, rough sponges, or steel wool. These and harsh soaps will scratch away the pyrolytic coating, or the special enamel, that make self-cleaning possible.If you want to clean your oven by hand with cleaner, try a product that’s intended for use with self-cleaning ovens, like Easy Off.Or use another mild cleaner or soap with a soft cloth or sponge.
You should plan to use the self-cleaning feature regularly to avoid further need for cleaning. How often you perform this cycle will depend on your oven model, so consult the owner’s manual or manufacturer."

Make sure the surface is completely clean and dry.,
Apply the Plasti Dip according to the package instructions.,
Add more coats for better protection and easier removal.,
Let the surface dry and cure properly.,
Peel the Plasti Dip off to remove it.",How to Clean Plasti Dip2," If you want your applied Plasti Dip to go on evenly, last longer, and peel away more easily when it’s time to remove it, you must make sure the surface is properly prepared. Taking your time now will provide immediate and lasting benefits.Wash and rinse the surface thoroughly; make sure any soap residue is gone.
Use microfiber cloths to prevent lint accumulation on the surface.
Dry the surface, and also allow it to air dry. Make sure it is absolutely, completely dry before applying Plasti Dip.

, You can dip, brush, or spray on Plasti Dip, although spraying is utilized for most automotive applications. Follow the provided instructions for spray coverage, distance, technique, and safety.Make sure you are in a well-ventilated area, and wear protective eyewear and breathing protection. You may also want to wear gloves and cover exposed skin.
Especially if your car is brand new or has had after-market painting or repairs done to it, you may want to test a small area first. Plasti Dip adheres to (and peels away from) most automotive surfaces with ease, but it is better to be safe than sorry.

, When it comes to applying Plasti Dip coats, the more the better. Four to five thin, even coats should be considered your minimum for the best appearance and protection. However, adding six or more coats will enhance these qualities and make it even easier to remove the product later on., Plasti Dip dries to the touch fairly quickly, and a basic cure will usually occur within four to eight hours. After this point, it is safe to touch the surface and use the vehicle. However, the full curing process will take a few weeks, so it is best to wait perhaps a month before using aggressive cleaning methods., Properly applied Plasti Dip will often last for at least three years. When it does wear out or you simply are ready for a change, just peel it off of the surface with your hands. If you applied enough layers of Plasti Dip earlier, it should peel off in large pieces. If, however, not enough layers were applied, meaning the Plasti Dip is peeling off in tiny pieces, try the following:Add additional coats of Plasti Dip, let it cure, then peel the thicker coating away with greater ease.
Use a branded Dip Dissolver to re-liquify the Plasti Dip, then rinse and wipe it away.Try various automotive and other cleaning products (Goo Gone, WD-40, etc.), as recommended by various sources. This is a bit of a trial-and-error process in regards to effectiveness.Your best bet is to apply the Plasti Dip properly so that it peels away easily.

, You may have to look closely to see the grain, but you will be able to detect which way the grain is going. Rubbing against the grain, even with a microfiber cloth, will leave permanent scratches on the surface of your appliance.








, This is the cheapest method for cleaning your refrigerator, but stubborn stains and fingerprints will require extra rubbing or the addition of a few drops of dishwashing liquid soap. If you use soap, you will have to rinse off the surface with clear, hot water before you dry it with a paper towel. (Dry it quickly so that it doesn’t streak.)

, Any vegetable oil, including olive oil, will clean stainless steel. You can also use baby oil; cleaning with oil does require extra drying to soak up the oil, this cleaning method leaves a very glossy shine but a darker shade.

, Mix the two together in a spray bottle, using 3 parts white vinegar and 1 part water. Spray on your refrigerator and wipe it down with paper towels. Vinegar is excellent at cutting through greasy fingerprints.

Shake off excess soot.,
Run the fabric under cool water.,
Soak soot-stained materials overnight.,
Wash the fabric in hot water.",How to Clean Soot1," Take the soot-stained fabric outdoors and gently shake off any excess soot. Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don’t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary.If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric – ultimately making it harder to clean.;
, For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible.Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process.

, If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours.If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture.

, Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine.Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method.
Don’t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed. Otherwise, this could permanently set the stain in the fabric.

This should be done with a soft brush vacuum attachment or dusting cloth., In a small bowl, dilute regular hand soap or dishwashing detergent in warm water. Mix together 1 teaspoon of soap for every four cups (946 ml) of water., Dip a clean cloth into the soap and water mixture. Squeeze the cloth to remove any excess water. The cloth should be damp and not dripping wet. Wipe the leather surface with the damp cloth. Make sure to clean the entire surface.If you are cleaning a leather couch, it is best to start at the top and work your way down to the bottom.

, Then, take a clean cloth and dip it into plain water. Wring out the cloth so that it is wet, but not dripping. Wipe the entire surface with plain water. This will help remove any soap that remains on the surface., Once you have rinsed the surface, take a dry towel and wipe the leather to remove all of the water. This will help dry the surface. You don’t want to leave the surface wet because it could reduce the lifespan of your leather., After washing the leather you should treat it with a conditioner. This will prevent the leather from drying out and cracking. Once cracks form it is much easier for dirt and oil to get trapped in the fabric, causing stains.You can use a commercial leather conditioner that can be purchased from a home store. Follow the directions to apply the conditioner.
Alternatively, you could make your own conditioner by mixing together one part vinegar with one part linseed oil or flax oil. Apply the solution with a clean cloth and let sit overnight. Then, buff the surface using a dry cloth.

Soak up some of the soot with baking soda.,
Use a vacuum.,
Dab the stain with a cleaning solution.",How to Clean Soot2," Sprinkle a bit of baking soda on the soot stain on your upholstery or carpet. The baking soda will work to absorb some of the excess soot on the surface of the stain. Be sure that you completely cover the stain with the baking soda. Let the baking soda sit for fifteen minutes and then vacuum it up.You can also use cornstarch as an alternative for baking soda.

, Hold the nozzle of the vacuum hose attachment just above the surface of the sooty fabric and let the suction of the vacuum cleaner lift the soot off of the fabric for you. Don’t press the vacuum hose nozzle directly up against the soot-stained fabric, as this could cause the soot to fly everywhere and create an even bigger mess.For most fabrics or upholstery, you should try to vacuum up as much of the soot as possible first. This will help prevent the soot from settling onto other surfaces during cleaning and help permanently remove the soot from the area.

, Make a solution of 2  c (470 mL) of cool water and one tablespoon of dishwashing liquid. Dip a clean white rag in the solution and wring out the excess. Then dab the washcloth on the soot stain repeatedly until the stain comes out.Keep blotting the soot stain with the washcloth until it is diminished to your satisfaction, while occasionally rinsing out the cloth with cool water and dipping it back in the cleaning solution.

After scrubbing with the cleaning mixture, rinse the hard surface with a clean wet rag.You may need to repeat this process several times.
Work on one section at a time so that you can scrub and clean as you go.
Be sure to use rubber gloves when handling the cleaner because it is quite harsh and can damage your skin.

, Most hard surfaces with soot stains can be cleaned by scrubbing them with a sponge (or towel) and a regular household cleaning detergent, like an all-purpose cleaner. Simply spray some of the cleaner on the sponge and wipe the soot away. You will need to rinse the sponge periodically so you don’t just keep transferring the soot stains as you clean.Start from the bottom and work your way up.
This can be very effective in preventing the soot from transferring onto other surfaces, which could cause the mess to get bigger or even create a permanent stain.

Call a professional.",How to Clean Soot4," Soot and ash can be quite harmful to the body, regardless of whether it is inhaled or if it settles on exposed skin. Proper precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to soot. This includes wearing gloves while handling or cleaning up soot and ash.Try to use rubber gloves (like the dishwashing gloves) to protect your hands.
You should also wear long sleeves and pants while cleaning up soot to help protect your skin even more.

, The largest health risk, when dealing with soot, comes from the possibility of inhaling the soot and ash particles. These particles can get into your lungs and cause a great deal of damage, especially over prolonged exposure.You can purchase dust masks at any home improvement store and even most larger grocery stores.
If you can’t find a dust mask, use a bandana or t-shirt tied around your head to cover your mouth and nose.

, Whenever you are cleaning up soot, you want to make sure the area is properly ventilated. It can be harmful for you to breathe in the dust particles from the soot, as well as any cleaning solutions you may be using.If possible, try to clean up sooty items outdoors. But if you must clean it inside, open all the windows you can and take frequent breaks.

, This method of cleaning should only be attempted in outdoor areas. Use the low-pressure sandblasting machine to spray off any soot residue from your hard surface. Try to use the lowest velocity spray possible to keep the soot from flying everywhere.You should be able to rent a low-pressure sandblasting machine at any major home improvement store.
You can also hire a professional to do this kind of cleaning.

, If you are unsure about what to do, or cleaning the soot seems like too big of an undertaking, consider calling in a professional cleaner – particularly one that specializes in soot cleanup. Don’t attempt to clean the soot yourself if you are uncomfortable with the process.Professional cleaners can make the hassle of cleaning up the soot much easier to handle, but they can be a bit pricey. Consider price checking several places before deciding on a service.

Get your leather professionally cleaned.",How to Clean Light Colored Leather3," Because light colored leather shows all marks and stains, you want to make sure that you avoid staining the material. For example, if you own a white leather couch, you should avoid eating and drinking regularly on the couch. This will reduce the likelihood of stains.


Alternatively, if you own a cream colored leather handbag, you should not touch the bag immediately after putting on hand cream. The oils in the cream can transfer to the bag causing stains.

, As soon as a spill, smudge, or stain occurs on light colored leather, you should wipe it immediately with a microfiber cloth. If stains are left untreated they will become extremely difficult to remove. For example, you should wipe down light colored leather shoes after every use. This will keep them looking brand new., If you have purchased a leather designer handbag or couch, it may come with a list of cleaning instructions. Always read the instructions carefully before cleaning. They may give you helpful cleaning tips and product recommendations., If you are unable to remove stains from your light colored leather products, then you should have them professionally cleaned. For example, a light colored leather couch will experience regular wear and tear from sweat or dirty hands. Have this leather professionally cleaned a few times each year."

Repair any sagging gutters.",How to Repair Gutters," Using a putty knife, scoop out any leaves and other debris that might have gotten lodged in the gutter. Use a wire brush to scrub away any rust. If the rust won't come out completely, cut it out using aviation snips.;
, Clean gutters are not only easier to maintain and repair, but they are safer to work with.

, Working with wet gutters can be unpleasant and even dangerous. Once they've dried out, examine them for rust and check for any damage.

, Use some roofing cement and a metal repair patch to cover and seal the hole. Make sure that the patch is at least a few inches larger than the hole itself. Also, make sure that the patch's material is the same as the gutter's material.


Gutters can develop holes over time when they rust and corrode due to exposure. Thinner gutters can develop holes when falling branches or sharp objects pierce them.

, The joints in your gutter--even seamless joints--will inevitably fail over time by allowing leaks. Take the gutter pieces, line them up at the seams, and reconnect the joints.

, When you find a sagging gutter, the problem is most likely due to missing ferrules. Replace the missing ferrule with something that won't fall out as easily, like gutter screws.

Fill pantyhose with deicer.,
Use a flat mallet.,
Check your downspout.,
Hire a professional.,
Leave it alone.",How to Remove Ice from Gutters1," Snow rakes are usually made of metal, with a flat edge. They’re long enough that you can far enough away from the roof to prevent getting buried in snow and ice when it comes down. Extend the handle of the rake so that it reaches the gutter. Place the rake head horizontally at the edge of your gutter and roof. Then pull down toward the ground, scooping ice and snow out of your gutters., You should use a calcium chloride deicer, rather than salt. Salt will eventually melt and can damage any grass or plants below your gutters. Lay the filled pantyhose horizontally on the ice in your gutter.Make sure you check the pantyhose in your gutters frequently – once the ice melts, you don’t want it to block the water from flowing.

, Securely lean a ladder against your house so that you can reach the gutters, then pound the ice with a flat mallet until it breaks apart. Throw the chunks of ice to the ground to clear out the gutters.

Be careful about how hard you're pounding the ice - you don't want to tear your gutter off the house.

, You might have ice build up in your gutters because melting water can’t flow through the downspout and out. Look for leaves and other debris in your downspout and pull it out. There might also be snow piled up in front of the downspout. Remove this snow to let water flow more freely., If your gutters are really packed with ice, you might need to hire a professional to clear them out. They have the proper experience and equipment to remove the ice without injuring themselves or wrecking your gutters or roof., Sometimes it’s best to just leave the ice in your gutters alone, especially if your roof is not easily accessible or has a steep incline. As long as the ice is not causing your gutters to sag, it’s probably okay to let them melt naturally."

Use a ladder to reach your gutters and pull out any leaves or other debris. This allows melting water to flow more easily and prevents ice buildup., This prevents the warm air in your house from escaping through the roof, partially melting snow on the roof and creating an ice dam in your gutters. You should have a roofing professional check your roof insulation during the fall., These are available in a lot of home improvement stores. They are electric, and work by heating up and melting any snow or ice on your roof. Lay the cables vertically or horizontally across the length and width of your roof.

Run a water cycle.",How to Remove Limescale1," White vinegar (acetic acid) is a great cleaner that can remove even the toughest deposits and stains without affecting the surface below. Acetic acid is a biocompatible and relatively gentle chemical, making it an effective alternative to commercial cleaning products for use in appliances.


To clean a kettle or coffeemaker, fill it with equal parts water and vinegar.For washing machines or dishwashers, pour vinegar into the dispensing drawer of the machine.Lemon juice is also a good substitute for vinegar if you don’t have any in your home.;
, If you are cleaning out a coffee maker or kettle, let the vinegar sit for an hour. This allows the vinegar to sink into the water compartment, which is usually the part of the machine that suffers from limescale.If you are cleaning a washing machine or a dishwasher, you don’t need to let the vinegar soak.

, Run a cycle of the appliance you are cleaning. The acid of the vinegar along with the heat will work to infiltrate the limescale and remove it from the inside of the appliance., After you have done a vinegar cycle, do a regular cycle. For coffeemakers and kettles, fill with water and boil. For washing machines and dishwashers, put the machine through a cycle without any soap or cleaner. This will wash out any remnants of the vinegar to leave your appliance vinegar and limescale free!


If you are cleaning a coffeemaker or kettle you may want to do several cycles so you don’t taste the vinegar the next time you use it.

Wring it out if it is excessively dripping, but make it as wet as possible., Take the rag and wrap it around the tap. Use rubber bands to hold the rag in place. Make sure that the entire surface of the metal is touching the rag. Leave the rag wrapped around the tap for an hour. After an hour, remove the rag.Leaving the rag around the faucet helps the vinegar to break apart and remove stubborn limescale.

, You should notice that your faucet looks much better! Use a clean cloth to remove the last remnants of limescale and vinegar. Use a Q-tip to get at hard to reach nooks., Sometimes the head of the faucet needs special attention because it is the place that tends to accumulate the most limescale.

Vacuum your carpet.,
Test your cleaning solution.,
Mix your solution in the machine's tank.,
Begin steam cleaning.,
Let the carpet dry.",How to Steam Clean1," This will remove any loose debris, dirt, pet hair, lint, and other items from the carpet. This step is critical to getting the best results possible from your steam cleaning efforts. Move all furniture in the room off of the carpet or rug so you can thoroughly vacuum every bit of the area to be cleaned.
Use your vacuum's hose and tool attachments to clean the baseboard areas and corners of the room, which can be hard to reach using a standard upright vacuum.
Replace your vacuum's filter(s) and empty the canister (for bagless) or change out the bag (for bag style) before vacuuming. This will ensure that your vacuum's suction power is as high as possible for best pre-cleaning results.
Go over the same areas twice of more to pick up anything that was missed on the first pass.
Do not attempt to steam clean a carpet without vacuuming first. If you don't have a vacuum, rent one or borrow one from a friend.;
, Pour a small amount of the cleaner you plan to use into a small bucket of hot water and allow the two to mix. Rub a bit of the solution into a test patch into a small area of your carpet (no more than 8 square inches). Let the solution sit on the carpet for about 10 or 15 minutes and then check on it. If the carpet appears to be at all discolored, dilute the solution a bit more then run a second test.Ideally, you should use a spare scrap of your carpet or a spot that is normally out of sight (such as the corner of a closet) to do the test. If your solution discolors or burns the test patch, you don't want it to be somewhere obvious.
If your carpet reacts severely to the cleaning solution, consider using a milder cleaner. Some carpets might not do well against certain types of cleaners, and you don't want to risk destroying yours.

, For this step, follow the instructions on the steamer and the bottle of cleaner (if you're using a store-bought one). Fill the tank on the steam cleaning machine with hot water to the maximum fill line. Mix in the appropriate amount of cleaner for the volume of water you are using, as stated on the cleaner bottle (for example, one fl. oz. per half gallon of water).


Some steamer machines may not have a water tank and instead will include a hose you can attach to your kitchen or bath tap. If you are using this kind of steamer, make sure you turn on the hot water on the faucet.
Be sure to add the cleaner and water to the correct tank on the machine. It can be easy to mistake the dirty water reservoir for the clean water tank if you aren't paying attention.
Follow all safety guidelines on the cleaner bottle and wash your hands immediately if you get any on your skin.
You can also create a homemade cleaning solution that may be gentler on your carpet and safer for pets and small children than the typical chemical mixtures you can buy in most home supply stores. Some people use laundry detergent or dish soap (highly diluted), or more natural ingredients such as citrus-based organic cleaners., Make sure the machine is plugged into an outlet that will keep the power cord out of the way, then turn it on and begin! Most steam cleaners are shaped like upright vacuums and have a have a trigger or handle that can be depressed and held down to release the hot cleaning solution onto the carpet as you roll the machine forward. To suck up the solution, release the trigger and slowly roll the machine backwards over the area you just covered.


Start in a far corner of the room so you can work your way back toward the doorway. This way, you won't have to step on carpet you've already cleaned.
Go over areas with stubborn dirt or stains more than once for optimal steam cleaning results.
Keep an eye on your clean water tank so you know when it's time to refill the machine. You may also notice the machine sputtering a bit while trying to dispense solution when it's running out.

, You should not step on the carpet while it's wet if at all possible. This could soak the pad underneath the carpet and promote mold growth. Dirt and debris will easily cling to wet carpet fibers, so this is another reason to stay off while it's drying.


If it is not raining or too cold outside, open a window in the room to increase air flow. This should help the carpet dry faster.
If you have a small heater with a fan in it, you might be able to speed the drying process by placing it on a chair or table and pointing it into the room you have just cleaned. For safety reasons, do not leave heaters unattended.

Let the sealer dry.",How to Polish Slate," If the slate is covered in a layer of discolored or cracking wax, this needs to go before you can clean and polish it. Select a commercial floor stripper appropriate for stone and dilute with water according to label. Mop this over the floor and let dry, then rinse if directed by the label.


Floor strippers are powerful chemicals. Protect yourself with goggles, rubber gloves, and excellent ventilation.;
, Sweep the slate using a soft broom. If you are handling slate tiles, make sure you remove all debris from the grout.


You may use a vacuum cleaner instead, but only with a soft brush attachment. Handling the vacuum too vigorously may chip the slate., If your slate looks dirty or streaky, clean it before you start polishing. In most cases, mopping with warm water and plenty of soap will be enough to remove the dirt. Rinse thoroughly to remove soap suds, then let dry until the slate looks dull and uniform.

, If you clean the slate twice and still see grime, move on to stronger cleaners. An alkaline (high pH) cleaner such as ammonia-based glass cleaner or natural stone cleaner is your best bet for slate. If that doesn't work, rinse it off and try a mild acidic cleaner.


Your best option is an alkaline commercial cleaner from a home improvement store, specifically for slate or at least for natural stone.
Test all cleaners on a corner first. Acid can discolor some types of slate.Alkaline cleaners are less likely to cause damage, but this is not guaranteed.

, Wet the slate thoroughly. Buffing while dry may cause further scratches.

, Buy 200 grit diamond pad or wet & dry sandpaper from a hardware store. Wet the abrasive, then rub it gently over scratched areas until the scratches are less visible.

, Rinse off the slate and the abrasive to ensure that no dust remains to cause further scratches.

, Move on to a 400 grit sanding surface. Once again, wet the slate and the abrasive, then start buffing. Rub it over a wider area this time to ensure a more uniform look.

, Wash the dust off thoroughly from all materials.

, Wet the slate and the 600 grit abrasive. Buff over the entire slate surface. Continue rubbing until the scratches are no longer visible. Rinse thoroughly when finished.

, A small amount of linseed oil will create a dark shine on the stone without causing damage. However, oil attracts dirt and makes the slate harder to clean.For this reason, oil is not recommended for floors or outdoor surfaces.

, Stone sealer can create as glossy a surface as you like, but can make it very slippery, especially when wet. If the slate is outdoors or in an unheated room, water can seep under the sealer and crack off the sealer when it freezes and thaws.


Slate can be honed (smooth) or rough (with small jagged edges). Sealer is more effective on honed slate., If you do decide to apply a sealer, find one specifically designed for slate or at least natural stone, preferably a penetrating sealer for long-lasting protection. Apply a thin layer with a paintbrush, following the grain of the slate. Let dry for two hours (or as the label recommends), and reapply as necessary.Test the sealer on a corner to ensure it results in the desired gloss/matte, slip resistance, and color.

, Wait for at least 24 hours before walking over the fresh sealer."

Vacuum your furniture.,
Pre-treat stains.,
Precondition the upholstery.,
Choose the proper steamer.,
Select an upholstery-specific cleaner.,
Start steam cleaning your furniture.,
Let the furniture dry before using it.",How to Steam Clean2," As with cleaning carpets, upholstery should be pre-cleaned before steaming. This is so loose dirt, hair, and debris won't be ground into the fabric when you steam clean it. Use a vacuum with an upholstery attachment to do this.


If you don't have a vacuum or yours has no attachments that can be safely used on furniture, use a sticky lint roller to remove as much visible debris from the fabric as possible. This may require several passes to get it all.
Be sure to get into the crevices of the furniture, as these areas tend to trap the most dirt.

, If your furniture has a stain or a particularly dirty spot you wish to get clean, pre-treat this area by spraying it with an upholstery cleaner designed for this purpose. You might need to let the spray set for three to five minutes before continuing (or as recommended).


Don't over-saturate the upholstery with the spray cleaner. Follow the recommendations on the bottle to avoid this.
Once you have let the cleaner set in, blot the area with a clean, color-safe towel. You should be able to soak up excess wetness this way, but the spot will still be damp.
You may wish to wait for the spot to dry and assess it before moving on. By doing this, you can determine whether the spray cleaner was enough to remove the stain and whether steam cleaning is still necessary.

, After spot-treating stains, pre-clean your upholstery with a fabric conditioner such as a soil emulsifier or fabric shampoo.Use a soft-bristled hand brush (one that will not damage the upholstery) to gently scrub the conditioner into the fabric. This is only necessary for furniture that is very dirty. You can purchase these items at any home store that sells or rents steam cleaners.


Before doing this, check the tag or label on your furniture to make sure the fabric will not be ruined if it gets wet. If there are special cleaning instructions printed on the tag, follow these. If the upholstery can't get wet, you won't be able to steam clean it.
On microfiber upholstery, use a sponge instead of a brush; brushes (even soft-bristled ones) can damage microfiber.
Remove detachable cushions in order to more easily and thoroughly clean all fabric surfaces.
You do not need to rinse or clean off the fabric conditioner before steam cleaning.

, Not all steam cleaners are the same, so you should choose one that is specifically designed for cleaning upholstered furniture. Carpet steamers might not include attachments for furniture, so these won't work for your purpose. Upholstery-specific steamers usually have a free-standing tank attached to a long hose with a tube-shaped attachment.


Make sure the steamer you choose has an attachment you can safely use on your furniture. Some might include stiff bristles around the mouth of the nozzle, which could be too rough for delicate upholstery.
Whereas some carpet steamers can even be rented from grocery stores, upholstery-specific steam cleaners are somewhat more rare. You will probably have to go to a home supply store such as Home Depot or Lowe's to rent a furniture steamer.

, The cleaners intended for use on carpet may be too harsh for your furniture fabric. Choose a cleaner made specifically for upholstery and mix it into the steam cleaner's tank with hot water. Be sure to follow the instructions on the cleaner bottle and on the machine itself to ensure you use the correct proportions of water and cleaner.


Spot-test the cleaning solution on the underside of a cushion or some other place where any color damage won't be visible. Rub the solution on a small patch of the upholstery and let the solution sit for a few minutes. Check to make sure it doesn't cause the fabric to change color.
Make sure you like the smell of the cleaner before using it on your upholstery. Some cleaners are scented and could make your furniture take on their smell. Avoid any cleaner you think is too fragrant or harsh-smelling.

, Position the furniture in a place where it can easily dry and won't be touched while it is still wet. Make sure you can reach all the fabric surfaces and remove all detachable cushions or covers. Use the trigger or button on the steamer handle to release the cleaning solution as you move the wand across the fabric. Release the trigger and slide the wand over the same area to vacuum up the solution.


Start with the cushions so they will have more time to dry.
Start at one corner of the furniture or one of its cushions and work your way across the fabric gradually to avoid missing spots.
Watch the steamer tank so you know when it's time to refill. If the machine runs out of solution, you will notice that the fabric no longer looks wet after holding down the trigger.

, If possible (and if the weather is not too wet or cold), open a window or door near the furniture to help it dry faster. For cushions, consider propping them up against a clean surface in a place where they will be in direct sunlight.


Use a small heater and/or fan to speed up the drying process if you live in a humid or rainy climate. Don't place heaters too close to furniture, or they could damage or burn the fabric. Don't leave heaters unattended.
Keep cushions and covers off the furniture until everything is completely dry. It may take an entire day or more for cushions or padded surfaces to dry completely, as they tend to soak up water.
If possible, hang your cushions up while they dry so they do not sit on a damp edge for too long (which will make it harder for them to dry). If you cannot do this, rotate them every hour or so wherever they are sitting to make sure all surfaces get good exposure to the air.

Prepare the area.,
Select a hard-floor steamer.,
Prepare the machine.,
Pre-treat tile grout.,
Steam your floor.",How to Steam Clean3," Remove all furniture and other items from the area to be cleaned. Sweep or vacuum the floor thoroughly and be sure to get any loose debris, dirt, hair, etc. out of the corners and away from baseboard edges.It is important to remove grit, rocks, sand, and other rough particles from the floor before steam cleaning, as these can leave scratches.
If vacuuming, us the 'hard floor' setting to remove as much dirt as possible. You may need to use handheld attachments to get into the corners or right up against baseboards.
If the floor you are cleaning is right next to an outside door, put a note on the outside of the door that lets people know not to walk on the floor while you're cleaning it.

, Steam cleaners made specifically for hard surfaces will provide the best results, so choose one made for this purpose when buying or renting a machine. Most are the upright style, resembling a standard vacuum. Hard floor steam cleaners are usually lighter weight and less bulky than those made for carpets and do not spray water directly onto the floor.Not all hard floor steam cleaners are safe to use on wood floors. If you intend to steam clean a wood floor, make sure your steamer is approved for this.
Hard floor steam cleaning is usually done using only hot water (no cleaning solution). However, if you need to remove stubborn stains or sanitize your floor, you can mix in a neutral-pH floor cleaner. Only do this if the steam cleaner specifies that cleaning solutions can be used with it.
If you decide to use a cleaner for steam cleaning, make sure it will not discolor or strip the finish off of laminate or wood flooring.
Make sure wood floors are properly sealed before steam cleaning. If you have a worn spot where no finish is left on the wood, moisture could soak into the wood and cause warping or water staining.

, Once you're ready to begin steam cleaning, remove the machine's water canister and fill it with hot tap water. Check the machine's filter to make sure it's clean; rinse it off in a sink or bathtub if it's dirty. Reattach the canister and turn the machine on, heating the water until it begins to form mist.Unlike most carpet steamers, hard floor machines will begin emitting steam once they've been heated sufficiently, indicating they are ready for use.
If you mixed a cleaning product into the steamer, try not to breathe in the steam, as it may contain particles from the cleaner.

, If you are cleaning a tile floor with stained or dirty grouting, you may want to pre-clean the grout before steaming it. Use a specially made grout cleaner and scrub it on with a stiff-bristled brush (made of nylon or brass, for example). Wipe off the surface with a damp rag or cloth once you've sufficiently scrubbed it.


This can be a very time-consuming and tedious task. In many cases, steam cleaning will be enough to get the grout clean, so only do this if you have extremely dirty or unsanitary tile grout.
You do not need to get the surface totally spotless before steaming, as this process will clean away any residue left from your grout pre-treatment.
Some tile floor steamers have attachments specifically for cleaning grout.These often include hand-held attachments with stiff bristles on the end of a narrow wand that you can use to scrub the grout as the machine emits steam. This is a good way to pre-treat grout before steaming the rest of the floor.

, Once the machine is heated up, slowly push it along the floor like you would a push broom. Steam is given off at the base of the machine and moistens the floor (but does not soak it) as you push it forward. Pull the mop back across the steamed area to allow the cleaning pad to mop up any excess residue.


Start on one side of the room and work your way across to the other, moving backward as you go so you don't step on the freshly-cleaned surface.
Let the floor dry by itself before you walk on it or put furniture or rugs back into place. It is not necessary to towel-dry it.
Open doors and windows (weather permitting) to speed drying. You can also place a fan near the clean floor to improve airflow through the room.

Try the cotton wool method.,
Try the soap method.,
Try the wet paper method.,
Discard properly.",How to Pick Up Broken Glass Splinters," Wet a piece of cotton wool. Dab this over the area where the glass splinters are; the damp cotton wool will pick up the glass splinters.;
, Cut off a piece of soap or use an old piece of soap. Wet it and dab it over the glass splinters. It will pick them up. Be careful not to touch the end picking up the splinters.

, Wet a piece of newspaper or butcher's paper. Dab one side over the splinters and collect them. The advantage to this method is that you can clean up a wider area of splinters quicker.

, In each of these methods, it is very important to discard of the item used to collect the glass splinters in a manner that will ensure the splinters don't escape. Put the cotton wool/soap/paper into a thick plastic bag, seal and then place in the garbage for disposal.

Use a magnet to determine if the item is solid brass.,
Put on protective gear.,
Use a well-ventilated space.,
Apply paint stripper to the object with a paintbrush.,
Use a nylon brush to scrub the brass object.,
Clean the brass with hot, soapy water.,
Try lemon and salt.,
Make a polish with lemon and cream of tartar.,
Use white vinegar and salt to polish brass.,
Re-lacquer the brass.,
Protect brass with olive oil or lemon oil.,
Refresh the protective coating once a year.",How to Refinish Brass," Before you clean and refinish an item, you will need to make sure it is made of solid brass. Place a small magnet on the item you wish to refinish. If the item is made of solid brass, the magnet will not stick. If the magnet does stick, your item is likely brass-plated steel or iron.Do not attempt to remove old finish from a brass-plated item. Instead, simply wash the item with hot, soapy water.;
, You will be using paint stripper to remove the old finish from the brass. Protect yourself by wearing a mask, rubber gloves, and safety glasses. It is also a good idea to wear a long sleeved shirt and long pants to further prevent the paint stripper from coming into contact with your skin., You do not want to inhale fumes from paint stripper. To avoid inhaling toxic fumes, work in a well-ventilated area. If possible, choose an outdoor area for your workspace. If working indoors, open as many windows as possible.You should also wear a respiratory mask to protect yourself from potentially harmful fumes.

, Pour a small amount of paint stripper into a disposable metal or glass can, like an old coffee can. Then use a paintbrush to apply the paint stripper to the entire area of the brass object. Allow the paint stripper to penetrate the old finish for as long as the product instructions suggest., Once you allow the paint stripper to penetrate the old finish, use a nylon brush to scrub the old finish from the object’s surface. You can also use steel wool, but this may scratch the surface of the brass object. Scrub the brass object until all of the old finish is removed., Once you successfully remove the old finish from the brass, fill a sink with hot water and mild dish soap. Use a cotton or microfiber cloth to remove any remaining paint stripper. Rinse with clean water and repeat until the stripper is completely removed from the object. Dry with a soft cloth., Once you successfully remove the old finish and wash and dry the brass item, you will need to polish the object. Cut a lemon in half and remove the seeds. Then sprinkle salt on the flesh of the lemon. Rub the lemon directly on the brass object and polish with a soft cloth until shiny. Once the object is shiny, wash with hot soapy water, rinse with cool water, and dry with a soft cloth., Combine one part lemon juice with two parts cream of tartar. Mix the ingredients together with a spoon until they form a paste. Apply the paste to the brass object and let sit for 30 minutes. After half an hour, rinse with warm water. Then wash the item with hot, soapy water, rinse in cool water, and buff dry with a soft cloth., Try pouring white vinegar directly on the brass object. Then sprinkle the surface of the object with table salt. Allow the salt and vinegar to sit on the object for about 5 minutes. Then use a wet cloth to wipe down the brass. Finally, wash the brass with hot, soapy water, rinse, and dry with a soft cloth., After you polish the brass, you will want to protect it by applying a protective coating to the surface. Try using a high-gloss urethane or UV-resistant clear lacquer to the brass object. Apply 3 or 4 coats of lacquer to the item, allowing the lacquer to dry completely between coats., If you do not want to re-lacquer the brass, you can protect it with a coat of oil. Apply lemon oil or olive oil to a soft, dry cloth. Then use the cloth to apply a thin layer of oil to the brass object. Make sure you apply a very thin coat over the entire surface., It is important that you rejuvenate the brass object’s protective coating at least once each year. If the object has not tarnished, simply apply new layers or lacquer or oil. If you notice tarnish, remove the old coating, polish the brass, and apply a new protective coating to the object."

Set aside a day to perform one large, thorough, top-to-bottom cleaning.,
Put away clothing.,
Eliminate unnecessary clutter or garbage.,
Make your bed.,
Clean the floor.",How to Make Your Room Look Nice1," This is your chance to start over and address any mess or clutter that you don't even normally notice when you attempt to clean your room. Let no corner, nook, or cranny go untouched. Don’t be discouraged if this is overwhelming at first; after it’s completely clean it will take much less work to maintain it., Clothing can make up a significant portion of the mess in any room. Once this is out of the way, it will be easier to focus on other areas that need to be cleaned. Be sure to check under your bed for any clothing that might have gotten kicked under; similarly, look in the corners of your closet and behind furniture to be sure you haven't missed any. Even a few socks can create clutter.


Donate clothing you no longer need. Sort through all of your clothing to identify items you no longer wear or that no longer fit. You can use large trash bags to store these items so that you can easily take them to your nearest thrift shop, such as Goodwill.
Wash dirty clothing. Gather all dirty laundry and sort into piles; one for colors, and one for whites. You may need to divide these piles into smaller piles, if there is too much to fit into the washing machine at once.
Hang any clean clothes that belong in your closet; fold and put away any items that belong in drawers or other storage containers.

, Having too much stuff can quickly create a problem that only grows larger as you accumulate more things. Once you follow these steps, prevent your room from becoming cluttered again by simply throwing away or getting rid of items as you no longer need them.


Donate unneeded or unnecessary items. Like with donating clothing, use garbage bags to contain any donated items. Be honest with yourself and keep an open mind about what things you can part with; do you really need that unfinished puzzle you haven't touched for two years?
Throw away any paper trash that might be cluttering your desk, dresser, or storage shelves. Common culprits include old bills and junk mail, receipts, school work from past semesters, take-out menus, and event flyers that are no longer relevant.
Get rid of dishes and food-related garbage. Nothing makes a room smell and look worse than dirty dishes and half-eaten snacks! Plus, food can attract bugs, which will only make things worse. Don’t keep dishes in your room, and be sure to throw away all food and food wrappers immediately after you are done with them. To be safe, consider making it a policy to avoid eating in your room altogether, if possible.

, Your bed is often the biggest item in your room. No matter how clean your room is, if the bed is a mess, your room will look messy. Get into the habit of making your bed every morning when you wake up.


First, remove the pillows, and put them aside.
Pull the sheets tight and tuck them under the mattress, taking care to smooth any wrinkles.
Pull the comforter to the top of the bed, making sure an even amount hangs down on both sides, and smooth out any wrinkles.
Fluff the pillows and place them neatly at the head of the bed.

, First, pick up any items that don’t belong on the floor, including large trash. Vacuum the entire surface of your floor, paying close attention to corners, as well as under your bed and any other furniture. If you have wood floors, a swiffer can also be effective. Use a mop or sponge to wash any hard surface areas that have mud, dirt, or food stuck to it.

First of all, assess your task.,
If you have a large space, it's good to map it out and tackle each part in sections.,
Get together any supplies you need while you clean.,
Plan out your time.,
Take a deep breath.,
Turn some music and get yourself pumped.,
Now, get moving with a more difficult task.,
Continue with each task.,
Congratulations!,
Open your curtains/blinds and let sunlight shine on your new tidy room.,
Do something fun in the room to enjoy the fact that it's clean!",How to Tidy in an Organized Way," What do you need to clean? Is it just a desk space, or is it multiple rooms? This can help you figure out how to plan your tidy-ing, like how much time you need.;
, For example, if you're cleaning your room, then you could separate it into desk, closet, bookshelf, bed and dresser. Also, if you have a messy floor, you should add that as a part to clean, too.

, If you're doing a bathroom deep-clean, you'll need cleaning tools like spray cleaner and a sponge. If your room is dusty, then you'll need a broom or a vacuum cleaner. If there's something you enjoy doing while you work that calms you down or lets you have fun while working, like music, then set it up. Whatever you do should not distract you from the task ahead.

, Decide how much time you need to spend cleaning, out of the time you have free. I'd suggest to try to get the job done in a day, because if you stretch it out for a long time chances are you'll forget about it eventually. Breaks should be placed in between work periods, and should be about 15 minutes long. Work periods should be 30 minutes to an hour long.

, You're ready to start.

, After a minute or so, start on a task that is pretty easy to get yourself started. For example, if your bed isn't made, do that first.

, As you do tasks, try to clean up each area well instead of pushing the mess into another area. If you do that, the mess will be infinite.

, Take breaks every once in a while, but don't make them too long. Keep yourself well fed so that you don't lose energy while cleaning. try to alternate from a hard cleaning task to an easy one. When you finish each task, cross it of a checklist or off of your map. If you want to move furniture around, feel free, because that can make room for other furniture, like a cozy reading corner or a window seat.

, Hopefully, you've finished, and most likely, it was worth it!

, It will feel good.

, But don't forget to clean up after yourself.

Store all of your items neatly.,
Focus on clothing and shoe storage.,
Get creative for storage in small space.,
Organize school or office supplies.",How to Make Your Room Look Nice2," If there is no way to organize your things, you’ll have no choice but to stuff them into piles. This is not only messy, but it will prevent you from being able to easily find things. Identify a place for all of your things, and make sure to put all of your things into their places.

, Again, clothing that is left out or not stored properly can make a significant impact on a space, making it look dirty and cluttered, even if the clothes are clean and draped over the back of a chair.


Use a hamper or basket for dirty laundry.
Store in a dresser any clothing items that can’t be hung up in a closet. If you don’t have a dresser or don’t have room for one, you can find inexpensive plastic drawers, plastic containers that fit under the bed, baskets, or even shelves to hold folded items. Contain shoes in an over-the-door shoe rack. You can put this inside your closet door to get it out of the way, free up space, and minimize clutter.

, Unless you have a large room, you are likely familiar with the struggle of limited storage space. Don’t be discouraged if your closet and dresser are full to capacity and you’re running out of places to put things. With a few creative adjustments, you might be surprised to find that you have more storage space than you thought.


Use stackable baskets, containers, or even old suitcases to hold things.You can tuck a stack of boxes into a corner to create functional, stylish storage.Optimize the space under your bed. If your bed is low to the ground, use cinder blocks from a local hardware store or plastic bed lifts to elevate it and give you more storage space. You can store things in boxes, baskets, or plastic containers that will fit neatly under your bed and out of the way.
Take advantage of wall and overhead space. Floor space is often limited in small rooms because furniture takes up a lot of it. Opt for shelves hung higher on your walls.

, It is important to know where items such as books, pens, envelopes, and paper clips are, but you don't necessarily need them cluttering up your work space. Store them neatly so that you can find them easily when you need them.


Contain and organize your books on shelves. Line books neatly on shelves, with the spines facing out and in the same direction so that you can easily search and find titles as needed.
Use plastic ziplock baggies to contain small items such as paper clips, thumb tacks, file tabs, sticky-note pads, and rubber bands.
Invest in a small filing box to store important papers and documents. Use file folders to store like items, and be sure to label the folders so you can find these items quickly when you need them. You can use folders to sort tax documents by year, papers associated with your classes, and a “important records” file for items such as your birth certificate and social security card.

Get rid of excess fluid as soon as possible.,
Wipe off the fluid if it’s still wet.,
Pick off dried fluid.",How to Remove Correction Fluid from Clothes1," Make your task easier by removing any fluid from your clothes immediately. Brush off any large, dried flakes with your hands. Do this even if you plan to send the clothes to the dry cleaners instead of tackling the stains at home.;
, Gently blot at the fluid with a rag or paper towel. Don’t press the rag or paper towel into the fluid. Be careful not to rub it into your clothes.

, Make sure the fluid is completely dry. Scratch off as much as you can with your fingernail. Try brushing it off with a stiff-bristled brush. Only use a brush on thicker fabrics.

Paint your room.,
Choose linens that complement the color of your walls.,
Add framed pictures, posters, or art to add color and style.,
Use plants to add color and brightness to your room.",How to Make Your Room Look Nice3," Give careful consideration to the colors you pick. Colors can create and reinforce the mood of a room. Decide what kind of mood or energy you want your room to have. If you have any doubts, a paint store associate can help you decide on a color that's best for you.


Choose a light, neutral color, such as taupe, gray, or an off-white, if you want to achieve a calming effect.
Paint your room a vibrant color such as red, purple, or yellow, if you want to energize your room.
Keep in mind that lighter colors welcome natural light, while darker shades can make a room feel darker. , It is best not to choose an exact match. Instead, look for linens with an accent color that matches your wall, or colors that go well with your wall color, such as a pastel pink to complement a pastel blue wall. Avoid using too many patterns.


If your walls are patterned, choose a solid-colored bed spread or quilt.
If your walls are simple and you prefer to not hang photos or art, consider a patterned bed spread or quilt.
Opt for no curtains to let in plenty of natural sunlight, or choose a pattern that matches your bed spread.
Consider sheer curtains if you want to let in plenty of light while still maintaining a little bit of privacy., This is where you can best express yourself and your personality. Whether you have a special love for music, or a certain sports team, or a particular aspect of art or culture, this is where you can really let your interests shine.


To avoid turning decor into clutter, have a plan for where you will put each item before you start hanging them, taking care not to hang items too close or too far away from one another.
Center a large painting above a headboard or on a wall.
Cluster smaller items together, such as small framed pictures, to create the effect of a larger piece. , As an added bonus, house plants can freshen the air in your room. You can find these at grocery stores, hardware stores, or nurseries.Be sure to pay close attention to the amount of light and water needed; you can find this information on the plant’s tag, or ask a store associate.
If you have a busy schedule or don’t prefer to maintain a strict routine, consider plants that don’t need to be watered regularly.
Use your phone calendar app to set a reminder to water plants that only require occasional watering such as weekly or once a month.
If your room receives little or no sunlight, search for plants that don’t require much sun, such as the mother-in-law tongue.
If you have a bright, sunny room that gets a lot of sunlight, look for plants that require bright light, such as the dragon tree.

Dust the woodwork.,
Choose a cleaner.,
Put the cleaner onto a cloth.,
Clean the woodwork.,
Go back with a toothbrush if necessary.",How to Clean Woodwork1," Go over the woodwork with a dusting cloth, duster, or a hose attachment on a vacuum cleaner to remove dust. Make sure to dust in the direction of the grain. Dusting before cleaning assures that the dust is removed rather than shifted around while cleaning with a product.You can clean with any type of cloth, but microfiber cloths grab onto dust the best.;
, There are plenty of cleaners on the market made specifically for cleaning woodwork and/or other household items. You might choose to buy a cleaner instead of making one to ensure that you don’t damage the wood with the wrong type of cleaning solution. You can choose a spray or liquid cleaner.A few well known wood cleaning products are Magic Cabinet and Wood Cleaner, Murphy’s Oil Soap, and Method All-Purpose Spray.
You can purchase a cleaner at a home improvement store or most supermarkets.

, You can spray or put the cleaner onto a cloth. If using a spray, it is also an option to spray the solution directly onto the wooden surface. You should only need to use a few drops or few sprays of solution, but you should consult the directions on the bottle just in case.You can use a cloth, microfiber cloth, sponge, paper towel, or rag.
Although the cleaner should be okay, test it on a small spot of the woodwork to be sure.

, Once you have the cleaner on the cloth or surface, begin gently rubbing it over the woodwork. Rub it into the woodwork in small, circular motions. Make sure you cover every surface, edge, or cranny of the woodwork. Apply more cleaner if you run out while cleaning. Stop when you are satisfied with result.If you are cleaning items cabinets or doors, don’t forget to clean the sides that are not in front of you.
You can wear cotton or rubber gloves while cleaning if you are worried about skin irritation.

, If there are small spots or buildups leftover, you can take a toothbrush and scrub the spot with cleaner or soap diluted with water. Scrub until there are no spots leftover and then go over the surface once more with the cloth. Allow the surface to dry.It shouldn’t be necessary to wash the surface off with water once cleaner has been used on it.
The woodwork should take only a few minutes to dry.

Clean your baseboard radiators regularly.,
Make sure the unit is unobstructed.,
Dust around your home.,
Replace damaged or broken parts.",How to Clean Your Baseboard Radiators," Before you get started, find the main power control or shutoff valve for the baseboard radiator unit and switch it off. You may also want to turn your thermostat down to keep the temperature low just in case. The copper pipes circulating hot water through the radiator can get scalding hot, so don’t put yourself at any unnecessary risk while cleaning them.Give the radiator several minutes to cool down before you open it up.
Don’t attempt to clean the radiator until you’re certain it’s stopped circulating hot water.;
, Move everything out from in front of the radiator. This includes curtains, furniture and anything else that is blocking the unit or may get in your way during the cleaning process. Ideally, the hot air generated by the radiator should have as clear a path to warm the room as possible.


It’s a good idea to keep your furniture dusted to prevent your baseboard radiators from getting so dirty in the future.

, Take the face plate cover off of the radiator unit. This can usually be accomplished by pulling the cover up from the bottom and lifting it off the groove where it rests on top. Set the cover aside until you’re finished cleaning.Hold your hand a safe distance away from the pipes inside the radiator. This will help you determine whether it’s too hot to work on.
One option is to place the radiator cover on the floor under the unit to collect whatever debris is shaken loose while cleaning. Just be sure to clean the cover separately before you put it back on.

, Look inside the radiator. Along the length of the copper pipe that conducts hot water through your home you’ll find a collection of small, tightly-grouped aluminum squares lined up side-by-side. These are known as “fins,” and they play an important role in diffusing the heat created by the radiator. This is what you’ll be cleaning.Most of the time, dust simply accumulates around the outer surface of the fins, meaning they just need a quick vacuuming.

, Take a vacuum cleaner or shop vac and slide on a brush-head attachment. This is the most efficient way to clean objects with complex construction and many irregular surfaces, like the inside of a radiator. The brush attachment will dislodge dust and debris on the fins, which can then be sucked up by the vacuum.You may be able to dust your unit without the use of a brush attachment (or with another device like a hand vacuum), but it will take longer and won’t be as thorough.

, Turn on the vacuum and place your hand over the hose to make sure it’s getting proper suction. Run the brush head along the length of the radiator pipes and fins, using long, sweeping motions to collect as much dust as possible. Go over the fins as many times as you need to until you’re satisfied with their condition.Brush around the fins in both directions, across the tops and down the sides.
If your unit is particularly dirty, wipe away cobwebs, dust bunnies and clumps of hair with a dry cloth or paper towel before vacuuming., In some cases the bristles of the brush attachment may not be long enough to penetrate the spaces between the fins. If this is the case, use a separate tool, such as a slender paint brush or pipe cleaner, to work the stuck-on dust and dirt out of the deeper crevices of the unit’s innards.Cleaning between the fins can be a tedious process, but it’s worth it to save yourself the expense of a poorly-running radiator.
Some people claim to have had success loosening stubborn buildup with a spray bottle of water. This is not recommended, as it may cause rust or damage your unit., Depending on how dirty the radiator cover face plate is, you might decide to clean it as well. Wet a washcloth with warm, soapy water. Scrub the inside of the cover to loosen any caked-on grime. Rinse and rewet the washcloth, then wipe away any remaining debris.This step will be especially important if you used your radiator cover to catch stray debris.
Treat rusted metal covers with a rust-remover solution before replacing them.

, Lift the cover and position so its back side faces the wall. Set the cover down in the groove at the top of the unit’s base, then lower it over the radiator until it fits back into place. It may click or snap to let you know it’s secure.

, To ensure that your baseboard radiators are working the way they’re supposed to, you should aim to clean them at least twice a year. Give them a good vacuuming at the start of the heating season (usually around late September or October) and again in early spring before you shut them off for the warmer months, checking them as needed in the meantime. Keeping the unit clear of dust will allow it to heat your home more efficiently.If you have pets that shed or live in a place with a high amount of dust buildup, you might want to clean your radiator units more frequently.
Radiators that are well-maintained aren't forced to use as much energy, which means you’ll save money heating your home.

, Baseboard radiators work by pulling cold air up from floor level and filtering it through the heated fins, which quickly warm the air and circulate it back through the room. Help the process along by keeping all drapes, furniture and other belongings out of the way of the radiator. The area around the top and bottom of the unit should be kept clear so that air can pass through without difficulty.Be sure to keep the vents at the top of the radiator’s cover open to let warm air escape.

, Keep your living space free of dust, especially around the baseboards and any furniture that happens to be close to your radiator. Dust from the surrounding environment can get sucked into the radiator as it draws in cool air from the room, and will quickly accumulate around the fins and other sensitive parts of the unit's interior. Frequent dusting is not just a good habit to get into, it can extend the life of your baseboard radiator and cut down on the number of tedious cleanings it requires.Dust before your clean your radiator so that the loose particles floating around the room don't get pulled into the unit's air ducts.
Don't just focus on visible dust. Be sure to vacuum your carpet, drapes and any other surface that might be harboring unseen dust.

, Over time, the fins along your radiator pipes, or the pipes themselves, may take a beating and need to be changed out. Call your heating and air specialist and ask for an estimate for the installation of new pipes or fins if you notice that yours are bent, ruptured or otherwise damaged. The fins do most of the work of putting off the heat generated by the hot water pipes, so it’s important that they stay in good working order.Unless you’re experienced in radiator repair, it’s not recommended that you try to replace fin-tubing yourself.
The metal fins increase the surface area used to conduct heat from the pipes, warming the room at a much faster rate.

Use white distilled vinegar.,
Dip a cloth into the solution.,
Clean the surface.,
Buff the surface.",How to Clean Woodwork2," Pour a half cup of vinegar into a bucket. Add a gallon of warm water to the bucket. You may want to double this amount if you will be cleaning a lot of woodwork or cleaning large surfaces. You can add 2 tablespoons of almond or coconut oil and 10 drops of lemon or orange essential oils into the bucket for a better smell once you have finished cleaning. Keep the solution in a bucket, or pour it into a spray bottle.Make sure you are using the right type of vinegar. Vinegars, like cider vinegar, can damage the woodwork. Test a spot of solution of the woodwork before cleaning to be sure.
Vinegar can leave behind a strong smell that lasts for a while. That is why essential oils are used to provide a better smell.

, If you are using a spray bottle, then spray a few sprays of the solution onto a cloth or directly onto the woodwork. If you decide to keep the cleaner in a bucket, dip the cloth you are using into the bucket. Make sure to wring the rag out thoroughly before washing.It is important to ring out the cloth before cleaning because excess water can damage the woodwork if it penetrates the finish.
You can use a cloth or rag to clean. A sponge can be used, but it retains water, which could damage the wood.

, Take the cloth and wipe it in a circular motion over the woodwork. It should be moist rather than sopping wet. Clean over every surface, corner, or edge. Put the rag back into the bucket and rinse it out anytime it becomes dirty. Clean until you are satisfied with the outcome.You can keep a bucket with the cleaning solution next to you even if you are using a spray bottle.

, Get a fresh, clean cloth that you have not yet used to clean the woodwork. Buff in a circular motion over all of the woodwork. This removes any excess moisture that can cause damage. Try to get the surface as dry as possible. If you see still see a spot, repeat the cleaning and buffing process until the woodwork is as clean as you desire.If you clean again, make sure to buff the surface again and allow it to dry.

Use dishwashing detergent.,
Put the rag into the detergent.,
Rub the cleaner over the surface of the woodwork.,
Wipe with a clean cloth.",How to Clean Woodwork3," Chances are, you already have dishwashing detergent around your home. If not, buy any brand of dishwashing detergent from a supermarket. Look for a mild detergent. Mix one cup of detergent with two cups of water in a bucket, or double that amount if you will be cleaning many or large surfaces. A few brands that offer mild detergents are Ajax, Dawn, and Palmolive. A mild detergent will lather when mixed with water.This method works best on woodwork that has been painted, enameled, or varnished. Detergent may turn lacquer and shellac white as they absorb water., Use a rag or cloth and dip it into the bucket. Wring the rag out to remove excess water. Excess water soaks into the surface and causes damage. The rag should be moist when you have finished wringing it out.Make sure to test the detergent on a small, hidden part of the woodwork. If it mars the surface, try another method of cleaning.

, Rub the moist rag over the surface of the woodwork. You can rub in small, gentle circles, but avoid rough scrubbing. The detergent needs time to break down the grease and wax. Allow a few minutes for the cleaner to set on the woodwork. Re-wipe the surface once it has sat with the same cloth.Do not allow the detergent to sit for too long, or excess water will soak into the wood.

, Take a clean cloth that has not exposed to the cleaner and run some water over it. Wring it out until it is damp. Use the cloth to wipe the surface. This removes the detergent from the woodwork. Then, take a dry paper towel or cloth and wipe the damp surface until it is dry.You should completely dry the woodwork on your own rather than leaving it to dry.

Clean excess dust or dirt from the wood floor.,
Damp-mop the floor.,
Remove marks.",How to Clean Wood1," The first step is to remove any debris from your floors. Grab a broom and sweep your floor clean. You may also want to mop it with warm water and a little bit of a water-based cleaner.Remove loose surface dirt and dust with a clean, soft cotton cloth in specific areas, like under furniture.
Suck up dust or surface dirt with a vacuum cleaner, using the hose and soft brush attachments.
Cleaners that have a neutral PH balance won’t disturb the finish of your floor. Cleaners like detergents can remove dust and dirt, but have a higher PH balance. Only use these on older floors.;
, To get a real good cleaning in that lifts the dirt and grime you can’t remove by sweeping you can damp-mop your floors. Use a wood cleaning product that is designed for your hardwood floor. Dilute the product in water according to the instructions on the bottle. Then, dip a sponge or mop into your solution and wring it out until it is close to dry. Scrub your floor.


You want your sponge or mop to be damp and not wet so you don’t leave any standing water on your floor.
Floor cleaners like Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner are specifically made to be safe on hardwood floors, and will even get rid of scuff marks and hardened spills., Before you go and start scrubbing at those scratches, marks, and stains, determine which kind of hardwood floor you have. If your stains are surface level, you probably have a hard urethane finish. However, if the stain goes deeper into the wood, you may have a soft oiled finish.For hard finishes, only use a soft, clean cloth to wipe. Harder brushes, harsh chemicals with a higher PH balance, or steel wool can ruin your coating.
For soft finishes, you can use No. 000 steel wool and wood floor wax. If the area doesn’t lighten up, apply vinegar to warm water and soak the area for about an hour. Then rinse with a clean damp cloth. As a general rule for soft finishes, use steel wool and floor wax for tougher marks, and a light cloth with dishwashing detergent and water for lighter, or oil-based stains.

, It's easier said than done, but while you are behaving like an irritated bulldog, things are not getting any better. Calm your nerves, take a pill for the headache and get ready for action. Turn on some relaxing music and get to work.


Don the gloves. Always wear gloves before cleaning the house after a wild party. You never know what you might be picking up.

, This is likely the most “infected” room.;
, Pick up bottles and cans and place them in the recycling bin. If you haven't already, take all dishes to the kitchen.

, Nuts are rolling on your mother's expensive white carpet? Don't even think about the vacuum cleaner. Almonds and peanuts have the annoying habit to cause heavy blockages to vacuum cleaners. You'll have to collect them with your bare hands. Look also for coins and other small objects that can be dangerous when sucked up.

, If you find stains on anything, these must be treated quickly and properly. Use a stain removal guide, such as wikiHow's own stain removal category. Carpet burns are harder to deal with and may require strategic placement of furniture followed by either cutting out that piece of carpet and replacing it with a square of the same carpet or calling a carpet laying professional.

, Double check that everything is still there. You did put away all inessential peripherals before the party, right? Then bring these things back out and reinstall them as usual.

, Kitchens are often middle “damaged” from the mess after parties. The fact that the kitchen is supposed to handle mess helps, so get ready to dig in and get things back to their clean state.

, By getting these items out of the way quickly, things will start to become clearer. Use a large garbage bag to toss everything into, such as plastics, paper and disposable cutlery.

, Store them in the sink in readiness for hand-washing, as required or when you have no dishwasher. Large dishes, dishes not meant to be in the dishwasher and excess dishes are usually best done by washing in the sink.


Scrape off all uneaten food into the garbage bag or compost bin. Stack the plates and dishes that have been scraped, in readiness for cleaning.
Empty all the half-drunk drinks from glasses and cups. Then stack these up waiting for their wash, either in the sink or in the dishwasher.
Cut the grease before washing certain dishes. If you ate a really greasy pizza last night, the situation is pretty serious. Soak the affected plates into hot water mixed with detergent in order to soften the litter. Leave them for approximately thirty minutes, then let the cleaning games begin. May the odds be ever in your favor!

, It is probable that you'll need several loads, so leave following loads waiting nearby to be transferred in as the clean dishes are transferred out.

, So, whose idea was purchasing vodka and whiskey? And tequila? And the smell! You'll have to deal with it somehow.


If you're tackling any vomit messes, first of all, buy a new cheap mop and clean the repugnant substance. No cleaning solution is needed in the very beginning. Get rid of the solids first. Once you succeed, apply some disinfectant. Then use the baby wipes to bring some fresh odour to the place.
Clean off the urine stains. They're bound to be around and beyond the toilet bowl as well as on the toilet, so clean further afield.

, No matter what they look like, they need a good clean.

, Any towels left out during a party are fair game for use in all manner of ways, so reassure yourself that they're hygienic by giving them a good wash. Replace with clean towels.

, Clean down hand washing basins and the faucets (taps).

, Any bed that looks as if someone has slept on or in it should have the sheets changed and washed.

, Collect up all bottles, cans, glasses and any debris. Be especially vigilant for broken glass on pathways, lawns and anywhere else that people might walk.

Dust your furniture.,
Start on a small surface.,
Mix water and dish soap.,
Wax or polish your wood.",How to Clean Wood2," Use a soft, lint-free cloth to go over all of your furniture before you wipe it down. This will lift any dust and other small particles that might otherwise get ingrained into your furniture when washing.


Feather dusters aren’t as effective for furniture because a feather duster won’t lift any particles. Some feather dusters also have sharp quills which could scratch your furniture.

, Unless you know for sure what kind of finish your furniture is, paint, stain, or another treatment, it’s best to start with the least harmful cleaning products on a small area. Grab a cotton ball or soft cloth. Moisten your cotton ball or cloth with warm water and add a drop of dish soap or dishwashing detergent. Start wiping an inconspicuous area of your wooden furniture like the inside of a leg.


Right now, you want to test to see if the detergent is going to be harmful to your wood furniture. Let the treated area sit for a minute or so and look for any discoloration.
If you don’t notice any unwanted change, your solution is safe.
If you do notice a change, then continue with only warm water and a damp cloth.

, If you didn’t notice a change when you tested your furniture. You can mix water and dish soap in a bucket. Mix 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water and 1/2 cup of liquid dish detergent. You want to add enough soap so your water is soapy. Start wiping down your furniture with a damp cloth that you dipped in your solution.


Be careful not to soak the wood. Keep your cloth or sponge damp but not soaking wet. Too much water will ruin the wood.
You can also use mineral oil to clean your wood in addition to or as a substitution to detergent.

, After you’ve thoroughly wiped down your wood, protect it by applying a wax or finish. You can find a variety of wood-specific sprays and polishes at any home goods store or grocery store. Look for sprays that contain silicone oil for protection. For waxing, use only a soft cotton cloth or wax brush. Apply the wax a little at a time and rub it into the wood in a circular motion.Once the wax begins to look dry or hazed over, grab a new cotton cloth or wax brush and buff the wax going in small circles over the waxed area.
Different waxes will require you to wait different amounts of time before buffing. Read the directions on your wax for best results.
Test a rub-on oil, spray, or wax on a small area of wood to ensure it does not cause damage to the wood's finish.

At the same time, move any smaller items off the floor that you want to vacuum under later such as step stools, waste baskets, etc. Straighten chair covers and pillows.
, Using a duster is much faster than a dust cloth because you can dust intricate items with a swipe or two. And if your duster handle is long enough, you can use it to get the cobwebs and the baseboards all at the same time. Be sure to take it outside and shake the dust off in the middle of your run through the house, especially if this is a task you haven't done in a while., Place the bag into your outside garbage can., Next, go through again and, using a general cleaner, wipe down other surfaces that need wiping.

White vinegar is important to use because other colors might stain the white leather. Always spot treat a small area to make sure it doesn’t have any damaging effect.Soak a cotton cloth in the water/vinegar mix and squeeze it tightly, removing it of any excess water. It is okay to moisten the leather, but avoid wetting it too much.
If vinegar is not your preference with cleaning the furniture piece, you can replace the vinegar with a dash of mild moisturizing soap. Soak a cloth in warm water, wring it out completely, and run the clean damp towel over the furniture piece.
A magic eraser or an off brand version of it can be used to clean large surface areas like cushions or arm rests of a couch to clean it. Use very light, gentle touches in these instances followed with a damp cloth soaked in water only.For hard to reach areas or areas with stitching, use a toothbrush to scrub and clean with the mixture.

, A hair dryer might seem like a fast, convenient option to help the furniture dry, but because it can dehydrate the leather, it can prove to be a damaging option over time. Instead, use a dry towel to rub it dry., To replace natural oils that leather loses when it is cleaned, apply a good leather conditioner that contains lanolin.For a DIY conditioner option, apply a solution of equal amounts of linseed oil and white vinegar to a soft cloth and rub it onto the furniture in gentle, circular movements.Allow the mixture to sit on your couch overnight.

Use a magic eraser or something similar to act as a stain remover.",How to Clean White Patent Leather3," Dip a cotton ball or a q-tip into some clear rubbing alcohol and rub it against the stain to see if it comes out. Using a pre-moistened wipe like a makeup remover wipe to clean stains is equally effective., A spritz of hairspray on the mark will pull it out of the white leather and you can then gently rub, after letting it sit for a few minutes.


After applying the hairspray to the surface stain, dampen a cloth with warm water and rub in circular motions to remove the stain.Repeat as necessary, but be sure not to rub too hard, or you can damage the leather. This method works even on set-in stains.

, Begin by diluting the vinegar in 1:10 ratio with water (i.e. 1 cup vinegar in 10 cups water) and slowly increase the amount of vinegar until you get the desired effect.


You can also use rubbing alcohol in place of vinegar, if you are worried about the smell, but it may have slightly different results.
Always dilute the solution and slowly increase the concentration, being watchful for any signs of damage.

, With the eraser, only a small amount of water is needed to make it effective. Be sure to spot treat the purse or garment since purses sometimes lose their finish when cleaned off by the sponge."
