Follow the instructions that came with the respirator to ensure it fits properly. Wear goggles without ventilation holes. Put on long gloves that end at the middle of your forearms., Put some water in a spray bottle. Spray the substance and observe whether or not it dissolves. If it doesn’t dissolve, it’s probably white mold. If it does dissolve, it is another substance, such as efflorescence.White mold can be confused with efflorescence, a mineral deposit caused by water seepage.
White mold is usually found in cool and damp areas, such as basement walls. It appears white or light gray, like a coating of unsettled dust. Closer inspection under good lighting will reveal a fungal growth pattern of spots like tiny mushrooms., Look for mold near the intake for your heating/ventilation/air conditioning system. Check inside the air ducts for a musty smell or visible mold growth.If you don’t find any of these signs, and no one in your household has unexplained symptoms, illness or allergies, your air ducts are probably not contaminated.
If you suspect or find signs of contamination in your HVAC system, don’t run it until you have the air ducts cleaned.It’s normal to find dust in return registers, which you can vacuum or remove to clean.

, Consult with a professional if there’s a strong odor, damage from contaminated water, and/or areas of mold larger than ten square feet (three meters), approximately three feet by three feet (91 cm by 91 cm).The area may need to be sealed off with plastic sheeting, while the HVAC is closed and sealed.For instance, a potent, moldy odor could mean there is unseen mold growth under flooring, behind walls or beneath baseboards.
Read online reviews or get a referral for a qualified mold remediation contractor. You may be able to obtain a free estimate and report on what services are needed.
If you hire a contractor, check their references first and ask them to follow current EPA recommendations or other professional guidelines.

, Throw away disposable items, such as cardboard, if contaminated. Absorbent materials like carpet and ceiling tile with visible mold growth will be difficult or impossible to thoroughly clean, so you may want to replace them. Hard surfaces can usually be scrubbed with soapy water.Consult with a specialist if your item is expensive, has sentimental value, or if you’re unsure about the best way to clean it.
If white mold is in your smoker or grill, follow the cleaning instructions that came with the product. For example, ceramic cookers should be cleaned with heat only, not chemicals or harsh scrubbers.

, If you’re using bleach or another chemical agent, ventilate the area by opening the windows, if possible. If the mold is inside of a vehicle, park the vehicle in direct sunlight. Open the windows and doors, regardless of which cleaning agent you’re using. Let the vehicle air out for fifteen minutes or more before proceeding with cleaning., Mix detergent and water to create a soapy solution effective for scrubbing mold from hard surfaces.If your mold problem is fairly mild, this solution should get rid of it. For more serious mold growth, you may need to try a stronger chemical solution.

, Combine one part bleach to three parts water in a bucket.Other options are a borax and water solution, a baking soda and water solution, 3% hydrogen peroxide, or undiluted, distilled white vinegar, any of which can be applied using a quart-sized spray bottle.If you’re using a strong disinfectant, such as bleach, wear safety goggles and gloves made from natural rubber, nitrile, neoprene, polyurethane or PVC.Spot test a small, inconspicuous area first, if desired, to ensure no damage occurs from your chosen cleaning agent.
Don’t mix different cleaning agents, since they may not be compatible with each other. Never mix bleach with other chemical agents or products that contain ammonia.

, Apply the solution to the area using a sponge or spray bottle. Let the cleaning agent sit for five to ten minutes. Use a scrub brush or old toothbrush to scour the mold. Wipe down the area with an old cloth or paper towel to remove the residual mold., If the area is a hard surface, use a sponge or spray bottle to rinse the area with water. Allow the area to dry. Visually inspect the dry area for signs of mold. If you suspect it hasn’t all been cleaned, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing process., Opt for vinegar if the mold is on vehicle upholstery or carpeting, since it’s less likely to stain than chemical agents and doesn’t need to be rinsed off. Fill a quart-sized spray bottle with undiluted, distilled white vinegar., Drain the tub and turn the power and circuit breaker off. Clean all surfaces, especially where there is visible mold. Remove the filter and either chemically clean or replace it. After refilling the hot tub, shock it (with a triple or quadruple dose), drain the tub, refill, shock it again (with a normal dose), then test the water for balance., If you found the mold indoors, keep your home well-ventilated. Run air conditioners and dehumidifiers. Make sure large appliances are vented. Use vents or fans in humid rooms like kitchens and bathrooms.Try keeping a window or door open while you’re showering.

Wash the mop.,
Clean your broom.,
Sanitize the vacuum.",How to Clean Your Cleaning Supplies1," There are different kinds of mops, each of which will need different kinds of cleaning. Cleaning the mop head helps eliminate bacteria that can grow when the damp fabric or sponge sits after cleaning.


If you have a cotton mop with a removable mop head, you can throw it into the wash with towels on a warm wash. Avoid using fabric softener so it doesn’t get on the mop head and make sure you use high heat and the delicate cycle when drying.
If you have a sponge broom with a removable head, you can remove the sponge head and clean it in the same manner sponges, as described below.These should be replaced once a month.
If you have any mop without a removable head, soak the mop head in a bucket with equal parts water and vinegar for 30 minutes to an hour. Rinse it and lay it out to dry.;
, Your broom works hard to remove dust and trash from your house, but these things often get stuck in your broom. Once a week, take your broom outside and beat it against a hard surface. This will dislodge any dirt or dust from the broom. You can also comb through the bristles to remove hair, trash, or anything else stuck into the bristles.


Once a month, soak the broom in a solution of warm water and dish soap for an hour or two. Remove the broom and rinse it, then let it dry completely before using it again. You should also wash the dustpan at the same time.
You can also use the vacuum to clean the bristles if there is deep ground in dirt.If you own a corn or straw broom, avoid soaking it because it will weaken or break the bristles., The canister or bag in your vacuum should be cleaned often. If you have a canister vacuum, empty the trash every time you use it to keep down germs and smells. The canister should also be washed gently with soap and water and dried before adding it back to the vacuum. If you have a vacuum that uses bags, empty the bag as soon as it gets full and wipe out any excess dirt from inside the vacuum.The vacuum filters should be cleaned every three months. Run the filter under hot water to remove the excess dust and dirt that has accumulated. Make sure you let it dry completely before you put it back in the vacuum or it can damage it.
You should also remove vacuum attachments and wash them with hot, soapy water. Rinse them well and let them dry for at least a day before you reattach them. Do this at least twice a year.
The powerhead brush along the bottom of the vacuum should be cleaned periodically. Hair and trash often get wrapped around the tube of the brush and can cause problems if it builds up. Use scissors and your hands to pull out all the debris trapped around the powerhead."

Locate the air filter.,
Take it out of the car.,
Vacuum the filter.,
Wipe off the filter with a dry cloth.,
Put the air filter back in the car.",How to Clean Your Air Filter1," The dry air filter will be made of paper or cotton gauze. Dry air filters tend to get dirty faster but they are also easier to clean than oiled air filters. The dry air filter will be under the hood of your car, on top of the engine. The filter will be housed in a rectangular or round box.If you cannot locate the air filter under the hood, refer to the instructional manual that came with your car for this information.;
, You may need to remove the lid of the housing to take out the filter. There may be wingnuts or clamps that you need to remove. Use a screwdriver to remove the wingnuts or remove the clamps with your fingers. Then, pull the filter out of the housing.Pull the filter out carefully as it will likely be covered in dirt and dust.

, Hold the filter with one hand and use the hose attachment on the vacuum to remove dirt and dust. Run the vacuum over the filter to suck up all the residue on the filter.


You can also do a quick vacuum of the filter housing to remove any dirt or dust., As a final clean, use a dry cloth to wipe the filter to remove any remaining dirt or dust. You can also wipe the inside of the filter housing with the cloth.Do not scrub or rub the filter. A simple wipe should be fine.

, Once you are done cleaning the air filter, put it back in the housing. Make sure the air filter sits properly and securely in the housing. Then, replace the lid on the housing."

Put your pipe back together and rinse.",How to Clean Water Pipes," If you intend to clean it right after smoking, give it a chance to cool off. Wait for all parts to be safe enough to touch. Avoid burning yourself and/or dropping and breaking your pipe., If cleaning right after use, make sure all flames have died out before proceeding. Then dump any ash or other contents in the pipe’s bowl into the trash. Next, empty the spent water from the base into the sink or toilet., Take the bowl out of the base. If the pipe has a washer, remove that, too. Also detach any other additional parts that it may have. These could include: Additional parts that may be removable may include percolators, ice catchers, and coils., As you disassemble your pipe, check for flaws, like chipped or cracked glass and rubber. Replace damaged pieces rather than just clean them to keep your pipe safe and effective., Give each one a few passes under running water. Wash away any loose ash, resin, or other materials. Make the cleaning solution that you’ll be using momentarily that much more effective by giving it less stuff to get rid of., You'll be bagging each individual piece in a moment, and then adding salt to each bag. However, keep in mind that the base is much bigger than rest, and simply adding salt after you bag won't ensure that any reaches the base's interior. So pour some into the base now before you bag it., Place each one in its own sealable, watertight plastic bag. Do not combine multiple pieces in one bag. You’ll be shaking these up soon, so don’t risk banging glass pieces together, since this will damage them. However:, Fill the bag with enough rubbing alcohol to completely immerse the piece inside. Then add enough salt to cloud the liquid slightly. Err on the side of too little salt, rather than too much, since too much will result in clumps that may cause blockage in various pieces.70 to 91% isopropyl alcohol is usually sufficient. However, extremely dirty pipes might require 100% acetone or nail polish remover.As an alternative, you can also try mouthwash, since its aftertaste is far more pleasant than any that might linger from rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover.

, If tons of resin have built up over time, give each affected piece time to absorb the cleaning solution. Let them soak in the alcohol for up to an hour, or even longer if necessary, before proceeding. Give the resin’s bond a chance to break apart and weaken., First, double-check the bag’s seal to avoid spills. Then shake each bag hard for 30 to 40 seconds, or even longer if needed. This will shake the loosened resin free, and also cause the abrasive salt to scratch away at the more stubborn bits., If desired, pour the solution from each bag into a sealable container for reuse in the future. Then, as long as your pipe wasn't too dirty to begin with, take each piece and rinse it under hot running water if your pipe was only slightly dirty at the start. With the base, pour water in through the mouthpiece so it drains out of the hole(s) at its bottom to avoid unpleasant aftertastes where youre lips will touch it., If your pipe was very soiled at the start, don't rinse it off in the sink. Instead, fill a container with hot water and submerge each piece to rinse them off. Then empty the dirty water into the toilet and flush. Avoid using the sink’s drain, since resin is more likely to stick to these pipes and cause future clogs., Once you’ve rinsed off each piece, give it a look over. Expect it to possibly need more than one bag-and-shake if it had a lot of resin to start. If the inside of the base and its tube appear particularly dirty, try:Plugging its holes with cotton balls or similar materials, adding salt and rubbing alcohol to it directly, and shaking it vigorously with your hands covering all openings.

, Inspect each piece for any crud that may have clung on during rinses. Soak q-tips in rubbing alcohol and use these to remove them. If these are too short to reach inside any piece, improvise by attaching cotton swabs or balls to a chopstick or something similar., Once everything is cleaned to your satisfaction, put all your parts back into place. Give it a final rinse under hot running water. It may seem like overkill, but this will reduce the chance of any unpleasant aftertaste."

Sanitize the toilet brush.,
Clean additional brushes.,
Sanitize sponges.,
Sanitize towels.,
Clean microfiber cloths.,
Wash dusters.,
Wipe down the bottles.",How to Clean Your Cleaning Supplies2," One of the dirtiest places in your home is the toilet, which means the toilet brush often needs sanitizing. To wash your toilet brush, soak the brush in a mixture of 2 cups of white vinegar, 1 tablespoon of borax, and ½ teaspoon of dish soap. Let the brush soak for at least 30 minutes before you rinse it thoroughly.


Clean your brush each time you clean the toilet and replace the brush every four to six months., Other brushes you use while cleaning, such as scrub brushes or small detail cleaning brushes, also need to be sanitized. First, remove any stuck in debris or hair from the brush bristles. Next, put all your brushes in a large bucket and soak them in a solution of hot water and your favorite sanitizing product (such as bleach). Let the brushes soak for 30 to 60 minutes. Then drain the solution, rinse the brushes, and remove them to fully dry.


Do this at least once a month or after a particularly thorough cleaning., Sponges get dirty very easily while cleaning up messes. To sanitize your sponges, rinse your sponges to get all possible dirt and refuse from them. While still wet, place the sponges in the microwave and heat them for two minutes. Remove the now extremely hot sponge carefully and run it under cool water, then let it dry.


You can also place the sponge in a small bowl of water instead of just on the plate in the microwave. Remember to remove the sponge from the water with tongs since the water will be very hot.
You can also clean sponges in your dishwasher if it has a sanitize cycle. If it doesn’t, use the microwave method.
If your sponges have any metal parts, do not microwave it. The metal will catch fire in the microwave., The towels you use to clean and dust should also be washed frequently. Once you finish using towels in cleaning, wash them in the washing machine. Use your regular detergent and the hottest cycle your wash has. Dry them on the hottest dryer setting and dry them completely.


Skip using fabric softener, since you don’t want the towels to have unnecessary residue on them.
You can throw in ¼ to ½ a cup of baking soda into the wash with your towels for an extra cleaning boost, especially if your towels are very dingy and dirty.You can also forgo washing detergent and use white vinegar instead in the wash. This provides additional sanitization of your towels., Microfiber cloths need to be washed differently than normal towels. They work by attracting dirt and dust through electrostatic charge in the cloth, which is recharged during washing. Before you throw them in the wash, rinse them gently in the sink, scrubbing the cloths with your hands to release caked in dirt and dust. Then, place your microfiber cloths in the wash by themselves with a small amount of detergent. Then dry on a high heat setting or let them air dry.


Do not use fabric softener and make sure the detergent does not have it in it either. This will reduce the effectiveness of the static charge in the cloths. The same is true for dryer sheets in the dryer.
You can also wash the cloths in a delicates bag to help keep them safe in the wash.
In order to not ruin the effect of microfiber cloths, avoid using these cloths for waxing or super grimy work and stick to dusting and cleaning mirrors and tables., Dusters are easy to clean after each dusting. First, take the dusters outside and shake out the majority of the loose dust and dirt. Then fill a bucket or the sink with hot water and enough dish soap to create sudsy water. Dip each duster in the water, swirl it around to release dirt in the feathers. Rinse and let the duster dry completely before using again.


To ensure all the dirt gets out, use your hands to work the soapy water into the feathers, being careful not to damage the duster in the process., Even the bottles of cleaning supplies need to be cleaned from time to time. After you clean, use a disinfectant wipe or cloth with cleanser on it to wipe each bottle you used. This will cut down on any germs or dirt that may transfer to the bottles from your hands while you clean.

Use the best disinfectant.,
Wash supplies often.,
Replace supplies periodically.",How to Clean Your Cleaning Supplies3," When you are cleaning your cleaning products, you want to make sure you use the best disinfectant for the types of cleaning jobs you do. If you are cleaning supplies that are used in high germ areas such as the bathroom or the kitchen, you should use a product with germ fighting capabilities. If you are cleaning supplies that are used for dusting or other gentle jobs, you should use less harsh cleaning products such as soap or natural cleansers.


If your cleaning supplies are colored, avoid using bleach. Your supplies will lose the vibrant colors in them when they come into contact with the bleach.
If you are trying to get our smells from cleaning supplies, look into deodorizing disinfectants or cleaning solutions.

, Each type of cleaning product you use will have a different schedule for cleaning, which will also vary depending on how often you use the supplies. Larger appliances such as vacuums may not need to be cleaned as often, only going through deep cleaning two or three times a year. Sponges should be cleaned once a week and towels, brushes, and cloths should typically be cleaned after ever use.


Dusters may only need a gently shake after every use, with a deep clean being done every four to six uses. Brooms may only need to be cleaned every month or so.Most cleaning supplies should be cleaned if they are used in a deep cleaning process to clear away the grim accumulated.

, Your cleaning supplies should be replaced every so often, even when you keep them clean. Brooms and brushes should be replaced every six months or so.Sponges and sponge mop heads should be replaced every month.Some cleaning supplies, such as microfiber cloths, towels, and dusters, should only be replaced when they have worn out.
Vacuum bags should be replaced whenever they are full. Things such as vacuum filters need to be replaced less often, such as every one to three years, depending of frequency of use."

Put rock salt in the gutters.,
Caulk penetrations.",How to Prevent Gutters from Icing," Make sure the vents are not blocked. Check to see if any insulation in the attic is wet or damaged. If the insulation is damp, remove it immediately. Inspect and repair any visible leaks in the attic or on the ceilings in the house.;
, If the attic is not insulated, or has wet insulation that needs to be removed, purchase insulation for the entire attic, including the ceiling and the floors. Loose-fill or batt insulation will provide consistent coverage. Ensuring the attic's temperature is maintained and cool will allow the snow to melt evenly on eaves and gutters. Check with area home builders or contractors for advice on how much insulation is needed for your particular home and climate.

, Purchase a set of tape or cables that include electric heating wires. String these along the roof just above the gutters. The heat tapes will also help the snow to melt, and will prevent water from backing up into the roof. These can be found at any hardware or home improvement store.

, If the gutters can be safely reached, use a broom to sweep snow off the gutters to prevent icing. Hire a professional to remove snow from the roof to avoid accidents.

, If icing does begin to develop in the gutters, sprinkle some rock salt on top of it. The salt will begin to de-ice the gutters.

, Use a waterproof sealant around electrical cables and vent pipes to stop water.

Calculate and purchase at least the total length of gutters needed, as well as the necessary downspouts and attachment brackets.,
Inspect the fascia and soffit for any rot or decay before moving on to installation.",How to Install Gutters1," Gutters should be attached to the fascia and run the entire length of the roof, ending with a downspout. If a gutter run will measure longer than 40 feet (12 m), the gutter should be positioned to pitch down from the middle, aimed toward a downspout at each end. A fascia bracket will be attached to every other rafter tail, or approximately every 32 inches (81 cm).


Depending on the type of gutters you want, expect to pay anywhere from $2 to $6 per linear foot for aluminum gutters. Copper gutters could run as much as $20 per linear foot.Expect to pay approximately $2 per linear foot for downspouts, and $6 to $10 each for the brackets that attach the gutters to the fascia.;
, What good will installation be if the fascia holding your gutters up rots away? To inspect the fascia, poke at the ends of fascia boards, or where two ends of fascia boards meet. If it feels spongy or compromised, you may want to consider replacing the fascia before moving on.


Think about replacing the fascia with more resistant material, or just sticking with wood.

If you believe the rotting is caused by excessive moisture due to ineffective gutters, then wood might acceptable. (You are going to install working gutters, after all.)
If you believe the rot to be caused by other factors, consider choosing a material like aluminum or vinyl that withstands the elements a bit better than wood.

Consider the orientation and the landscape of your home to decide what you want to happen to all the water you're sloping off your roof before you plan for gutters to take it there.


You want water to run at least 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) off into the yard away from the foundation of the house if you're going to dump it using downspouts. Is there sufficient room for this in your yard? You also need to make sure there aren't severe slopes or ruts in the ground that angle back into your foundation, which could result in water damage in your basement.;
, To determine how many gutter sections and accessory pieces you need to buy, measure the length of the house that will include gutters. This measurement is called the gutter run.


It may be easier to do a rough measurement from the ground, but to be sure hop on a ladder and get a partner to help you measure the correct sections. You want to be sure.
Sketch a layout for the gutter installation plan to take with you to the store. Include a rough description of the shape with the correct measurements for easy consultation.

, At most home repair stores, you can buy an all-in-one installation kit (or several) that will include all necessary connectors, corners, caps, and gutter pieces to make the job much easier. These kits tend to be more expensive, so if you want a more customizable and cheaper project, you'll probably want to buy the parts piecemeal.


If you decide to buy piece by piece, plan on buying 10-foot (3.048 m) lengths to cover the vinyl gutter run. If you end up with extra, you can shape it to your needs. It's better to have too much and not have to go back to the store.
You'll also need connectors, corners, end caps, and a gutter hanger for every 2 feet (0.6 m) of gutter.
You'll need drainpipe, elbows, hangers and outlets for every 30 (9.14 m) to 35 feet (10.67 m) for the downspouts. If you're unsure about which parts to use, talk to a salesman at your home repair store, or consult one of the DIY kits for the parts list and use it as a guide.

, When you're up there installing, you don't want to have to measure every ten seconds. Before you start, mark the slope angle for the water to run with a chalk line to make the job much easier. Slope the vinyl gutters approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) for every 10 feet (3.048 m) of gutter for short runs of less than 30 feet (9.14 m).


Gutters need a slight slope so that water will flow out of them and not create pools of water. Place the highest point in the middle of the run, sloping in either direction by the same amount for longer runs of more than 30 feet (9.14 m).
For gutter runs longer than 40 feet (12.2 m), consider sloping the gutters down from each end into a single downspout located at the middle of the run, in essence making a ""reverse slope."" Consider what will work best with your home before ordering parts and drawing your sketch., Use a drill or powered screwdriver to attach the outlets using 1.25-inch (3.2 cm) deck screws. The gutters themselves will attach to these outlets, so it's important to place them first to use as a guide as you continue installing.

, Install deck screws every 2 feet (0.6 m), approximately an inch away from the edge of the roof.

, The water needs to be able to travel easily through the gutters, funneling toward the downspouts. You probably won't want to have spouts at every corner, so use gutter corners in the in-between areas.

, First, install the gutter sections into the outlets, using the hangers to support the individual sections. Use a plastic slip joint at the end of every 10-foot length, connecting the gutter sections for each section with connectors. Add an end cap to areas that won't have outlets to keep the water flowing toward the downspouts.If you need to adjust the size of the gutter sections to fit your walls, cut them using a loppers or a table saw.
To make the job easier, have one person hold one end of the gutter while the other takes the other end and begins attaching the vinyl gutter to the hangers from the outside in.

, First, secure the downspout outlet to the gutter. Connect downspout elbows to the outlet and outlet tube coming from the gutter. Secure the correct size drainpipe section to fit between the elbows.


Secure the drainpipe to the wall using the same brackets you used for the gutter sections.

, Often kits will come with jackets made of metal mesh to fit over the vinyl gutters to complete the gutter installation. This keeps debris from clogging up gutters and should keep the water flowing smoothly.

, Maintaining an annual schedule of gutter cleanings will ensure that your system is functional when you'll need it most and you won't have to worry about emergency repairs in the middle of a big deluge. Remember to pencil in regular cleanings onto your calendar and the job won't need to take more than a few hours.

, The biggest problem affecting vinyl gutters is getting them cluttered and clumped with leaves during the autumn. Work your way around the house carefully on a ladder and remove any clumps of leaves and twigs that have accumulated and might be keeping water from flowing properly.


Always work from a ladder and never from the roof. It may seem easier to climb up on the roof and avoid repositioning the ladder every couple of feet, but it's dangerous to be that near the edge, leaning over into the gutter. Take the safe out and work from the ground on a ladder with a spotter to help.
Don't neglect the downspout. When you're finished with the gutters lining the roof, also remove large debris from the downspout as well.

, Using a hose, run some water through with a hose, using a gutter-cleaning attachment if you have one, to clear out any remaining debris you might have missed.


If you've been having clogging troubles, or suspect you might have leaks, have a partner flush the sections of the gutter while you walk around and look for drips, leaks, or places the water builds up and won't drain. Reconnect loose sections or fix them with roofing screws or other fasteners to keep the gutters working well.

Place your fingers on the top of the shutters and your thumb on the bottom of the shutters. Glide your hands along the shutters to remove dirt, debris, and grime. Repeat until you have wiped down each shutter.Stop and rub into the shutters with your fingers as needed if you find any stuck on dirt or debris.
Rinse off your gloves slightly in the cleaning solution periodically to remove built up dirt.

, Use a clean sponge to wipe the shutters down with clean water to rinse them. Wipe the shutters as much as necessary to get the water to run clean. Make sure you remove all the cleaner before leaving your shutters to dry. Cleaning residue can harm your shutters.If the rag you're using starts to get soapy, replace it with a new, clean rag. You should also replace any water that becomes diluted with soap.

Measure and snap a layout line using a chalk line.,
Locate the starting point, or highest point, of the gutter run.,
Then, locate the ending point, or the downspout location, of the gutter run.,
Find the end point of the gutter run by using a 1/2-inch (.635 cm) downward slope.,
Snap a chalk line between the high and low points.",How to Install Gutters2," You want your gutters to work properly, and in order for them to do that, they need to have a slight downward angle to feed any running water toward the downspout.


Longer gutters (35 feet and longer) will slope from the center to each end. They will start at the same height in the middle and tilt downward to the edges, ending at the same point.
Shorter gutters should tilt from one end to the other. They should start at a high point and end at a lower point.

, If your fascia board is longer than 35 feet (10.6 m), your starting point will be in the center of the fascia board. If it's shorter than 35 feet (10.7 m), your gutter will run from one end to the other.


Mark the high point on the fascia, 1.25 inches (3.175 cm) below the roof flashing with a piece of chalk.

, This will be at the corner of a fascia board, and may include one downspout being fed by two different gutters.

, Starting at your high point, move down 1/2-inch for every 10 feet (3 m) of gutter.


For example, if you're working on a 25 foot (7.6 m) fascia board, your end point will be roughly 1-1/4 inch below your high point.

, Use a level or a measuring stick to try to get an even line. This will be a guidepost for your gutters, so it helps to be precise.

",How to Install Gutters3," Use a hacksaw, or heavy duty tin snips to cut the gutter at the appropriate measurement. You may need to cut your gutters at a 45 degree angle if two gutters meet at a corner.

, After you've marked the location of each one, drill pilot holes along every other rafter tail to make installation of the brackets easier.


Brackets will either snap onto the gutters or will be mounted into the face board first, depending on the type of gutters you purchase. Review the manufacturer's recommendations for your particular type of gutter.

, Use a jigsaw to cut a square opening at the appropriate place in the gutter.

, An end cap should be used on any open-ended run of gutter.

, Slip the gutter into place by tilting it upward until its back end fits into place at the top of the bracket. The gutter should either snap into place or be reasonably snug.


A bracket should be mounted to the face-board every 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm). Use a stainless steel lag screw long enough to penetrate the face-board at least 2 inches (5 cm).

, To keep water from leaking through small cracks or openings at conjoined corners, insulate the aluminum strip further using waterproof caulk.


This aluminum strip can be spray-painted ahead of time to blend in seamlessly with the color of the gutter.
Make the strip long enough to extend an inch or two beyond the top of the gutter. Cut a triangular shape into the top of the extending strip, and then fold each corner or the strip over onto the top of the gutter, creating a clean look.

, Make sure that the tapered end of the downspout is facing down and aimed in the appropriate direction.


To get the downspout to connect with the outlet tube, crimp the downspout with some pliers.
Fasten the downspout to the gutters and the downspout to the outlet tube either with pop rivets or the appropriate screws.

Repeat the process if necessary.,
Rinse your shutters.",How to Clean Vinyl Shutters2," You can purchase a commercial cleaner online or at a local hardware store. Use a professional grade cleaner designed to renew oxidized shutters. Shutter cleaners vary in terms of preparation, but most should be diluted with water prior to use. Read your shutter cleaner's directions carefully before applying it to your shutters and dilute it accordingly., Place your cleaner in a spray bottle or pump garden cleaner. Focusing on two shutters at a time, spritz a layer of cleaner over each shutter. Let the cleaner sit on for five minutes before proceeding.Do not let the solution dry on your shutters. Be very careful to set a timer for five minutes and watch the solution carefully to make sure it is not drying.

, Take a non-scratch scouring pad. Working with one shutter at a time, wipe down each side of the shutters to remove the oxidation. Use scrubbing motions to remove mold, dirt, debris, and other stuck-on residue. If you see mild dirt, like mildew, leave this for now. You can target this later during a routine cleaning., After cleaning your shutters, scratch your shutters gently with your nail. If oxidation has been removed successfully, your nails should leave no visible marks., If your nail left a mark in the shutter, once again wet each shutter with your cleaning solution. Then, scrub down the shutters with a non-scratch scouring pad. From there, apply the nail test again. A second cleaning is usually enough to remove lingering oxidation.If the oxidation remains after two cleanings, consider hiring professionals.

, Never let cleaning solution sit on your shutters. Use a hose or damp towel to wipe or spray down your shutters. Keep wiping or spraying your shutters until no traces of cleaning solution remain and water runs clear."

Put on work cloths and rubber gloves.,
Set up the ladder.,
Attach a bucket to your ladder for debris disposal.",How to Clean High Gutters1," Cleaning gutters can be dirty work. Additionally, gutters can be quite sharp. For these reasons, wear work clothes that you won’t mind getting stained and durable rubber gloves.Even in hot weather, wear a long sleeve shirt while cleaning. This will provide additional protection from insects and from the sharp edges of gutters.When cleaning gutters on dry days, especially in dusty areas, wear a face mask to prevent dust and pollen from aggravating your lungs.;
, Position the ladder where you plan to begin cleaning. Lean the ladder against the wall of your house, if possible. Otherwise, lean the ladder on the gutter where it is attached to the house with a fastener, like a nail.Before climbing your ladder, test it for stability by carefully climbing a step or two. If the ladder leans or wobbles, reposition it until it is sturdy.
If the ground is soft, the ladder may dangerously sink. Place same-sized pieces of scrap wood under the feet of your ladder to prevent sinking, then test the ladder again for stability. Reposition the ladder as needed.
Uneven or sloping ground may cause your ladder to lean. Level out the ladder by putting pieces of scrap wood underneath the leg on the leaning side of the ladder. Test the ladder for stability and make any necessary adjustments.

, Straighten the body of a wire coat hanger but leave the hooked end as is. This should form a straight piece of metal ending in a hook. Bend the hook-opposite end around the handle of your bucket. Hang the bucket from the second rung from the top.


Most of the debris in your gutters will be biodegradable. Should you desire to do so, debris can be thrown on the ground and left to decompose or composted.
If more convenient, place a large garbage can, tarp, or wheelbarrow beside your ladder. Throw cleared debris in/on these receptacles.
A plastic bag will work in a pinch as a substitute, but these can be awkward and dangerous to manage, especially if there is wind.

If you do this, make sure to move the tonearm aside, to prevent any accidental scratches. You’ll also want to use only minimal force against the record or you could damage the balance of the platter., You can buy a container of canned air at any office supply store. Follow the cleaning instructions on the can being careful to not get too close to the record. Gently puff air onto the record until the surface appears clean and free of dust. Repeat as necessary.


Canned air can sometimes release condensation as well. If this happens, make sure to wipe up any liquids from your record using a clean, soft cloth.

, Invest in a medium-sized, good quality microfiber cleaning towel. Gently rub this towel in small circles over your record. You can purchase microfiber cloths at most hardware or general home stores. These cloths are good because they will not scratch your record and will pick up dust easily., Look for a brush that is made specifically for cleaning records. You can find these at most audio or music stores. Place the brush gently down on top of the record. Start to spin the record slowly, guiding the brush fibers into the grooves. You can also make gentle sweeping motions from the inner to outer rings of the record.It is a good idea to brush your record first, even if you plan to proceed to a wet cleaning method. Dry brushing will remove some of the particles that could scratch your record if paired with liquid.Keep an eye on your brush and get a new one if the fibers appear bent or aged. Also, keep a brush specifically reserved just for your records., This is an attachment that sits above the record and gently applies a small cleaning brush to the rotating record. The brush should remove dust, debris, and static from the record all at once. This type of cleaning method can also help to keep your stylus free of dust as well.You’ll also want to clean the stylus if you notice dust accumulation on it. Stylus cleaner usually comes in a small bottle with an applicator brush or tip., This is a small, plastic gun that cleans your record by removing static electricity from its surface. Follow the directions of the packaging and aim the gun directly at the record without touching. The gun will then neutralize the static electricity, making your record less likely to attract dust.If your record ever makes a crinkling, crackling, or light crunching noise when being placed in, or pulled out, of its sleeve then it likely needs cleaning by an anti-static device.

, You can buy a roller online, or at a music store, that is specifically designed for record cleaning. Pull the roller along the grooves of the record. It will attract dust to its surface. You can either wash the roller or remove the top layer for a future cleaning.Just make sure that the roller does not leave any residue behind on the record. You may want to do a single test swipe just to make sure.

Remove debris from the gutter by hand.,
Reposition the ladder and continue removing debris.,
Flush your gutters with water.",How to Clean High Gutters2," Scoop buildup and debris from your gutters with your gloved hand. Alternatively, use a tool to clean the gutters, like a garden trowel, hand spade, or plastic scoop. Do not reach for debris. Only remove debris from areas comfortably within your reach.For the safest gutter cleaning, have a friend or relative hold the ladder for you while you work to provide additional stability.
Over reaching while on a ladder could compromise its stability and cause it to fall, potentially causing a serious injury., When a section is clear of debris, descend the ladder and move it so you can reach the neighboring section of gutter. Clear the gutter as described. Continue repositioning and cleaning until your gutters are completely clean., Fasten a garden hose to a pole, tree trimmer, or a sturdy branch. Turn on the hose and raise it to the gutter. In this fashion, flush the entire gutter to finish your cleaning. Note downspouts that flow unevenly or weakly; these may still have blockages.If you suspect a downspout blockage, set up your ladder beside the spout. Tap along its length with a screwdriver from the top down. A dull thudding sound usually indicates a blockage.
Downspouts can also be unfastened from the house and gutter. Lay the spout on the ground and clear blockages with a long stick, leaf blower, or pressure washer."

Equip your vacuum with a rigid extension attachment.,
Calculate the measurement of the secondary extension.,
Cut a rigid plastic tube or pipe with a hack saw.,
Assemble the gutter vacuum.Slide the end of the extension attachment into the secondary extension.",How to Clean High Gutters3," Only use vacuums that can handle wet and dry materials, like a chipper vacuum or a wet/dry shop vacuum. Position the vacuum where you plan to start cleaning your gutters. Insert the longest hose into the vacuum and fasten the longest rigid extension attachment to the hose.The power cord for your vacuum may not be long enough to reach a power outlet. Use an extension cord to supply your vacuum with power in these cases.
Choose a vacuum that has a strong motor for this project. Vacuums with weak suction will not be as effective., Measure the total length of the rigid extension attachment. When measuring gutter height, measure from the top of the gutter to about knee height. Subtract the attachment length from the gutter height. This measurement is the total length of your secondary extension.


While using the gutter vacuum, you’ll likely hold the attachment at about chest height. Measuring the gutter from its top to the ground will likely result in a gutter vacuum that is longer than necessary, making it more unwieldy.

, Mark the secondary extension measurement (gutter height – attachment length) on the rigid plastic tube or pipe. Use a hacksaw to cut the plastic to secondary extension length. Excess tube/pipe can be reused or thrown away.Cutting your tube/pipe may have left behind burrs. These can cause slivers or cuts. Remove burrs with a file when necessary.

, Join these pieces together firmly with aluminum tape. Do the same at the opposite end of the secondary extension with a duct elbow. When the first elbow is in place, similarly add the second elbow to it.Putting these pieces together will result in a long, straight, rigid extension that ends in a hook. The hook formed by the elbows should curve so it is facing roughly downwards.
Be sure to tape the connections of your homemade gutter vacuum thoroughly. Gaps may cause suction to decrease, making the vacuum less effective.

Clean the gutters.,
Inspect the gutters for missed debris.,
Remove small bits of remaining debris and check downspout flow.",How to Clean High Gutters4," Hold your gutter vacuum at roughly the base of the extension attachment. Switch on your vacuum. Pass the downward facing end of the hook slowly over the gutter to remove leaves, twigs, and other debris.If your gutters are especially clogged, you may need to empty your vacuum while cleaning. Overly full vacuums may have decreased suction and leave behind gutter buildup.

, Although most of the buildup will likely be gone after vacuuming, stubborn blockages may remain. Lean a suitable ladder against your home and climb it to visually inspect the gutters. Dismount the ladder, then target remaining clogs with your gutter vacuum.Some obstructions may still remain even after being targeted with your gutter vacuum. Use a tree trimmer, pole, or a sturdy stick to poke at and loosen these obstructions. Suck up loosened material with your vacuum., Tie a garden hose to a pole or long stick. Turn on the hose and lift it up to the gutter. Rinse the entire gutter with water to remove any small debris remaining. Poor waterflow at the downspout may indicate a blockage in the spout.Clogs can be removed from downspouts with a plumbing snake. Use the snake in the same fashion you would to remove a clogged drain.

Use a silicone caulk.Silicone caulk maintains its integrity in sunlight and extreme temperatures better than latex caulk and it also lasts longer under most circumstances.,
Roughen the surface.,
Cut the tip of the caulk tube at an angle.Do not cut the tip off straight across.,
Fix the caulk tube into a caulk gun.,
Apply the caulk in a straight, small bead across the seam.,
Push the caulk into the joint with a screwdriver.After you have applied the caulk, work it under the joint with the tip of a screwdriver.,
Apply another line of caulk.,
Smooth the caulk with your finger.,
Allow the caulk to dry.",How to Caulk Rain Gutters2," Moreover, silicone caulk also works better in gaps that expand and contract, which gutters often do in response to changes in temperature. If you have white gutters, use a white caulk. If your gutters are painted in another color, choose a clear caulk.


If possible, go with a caulk that is specifically formulated for gutters. Gutter caulks are designed to work in the conditions gutters face, and as such, they last much longer than non-gutter caulks.

, Rub the edge of the seam with sandpaper or a wire brush using steady, even pressure. Caulk, especially silicone caulk, adheres better to a surface that is slightly rough and uneven than it does to a perfectly smooth surface. The gutters do not need to be jagged, but it helps if the metal is a little coarse.

, Cutting the tip at an angle makes it easier to fit the tube into the seam.

, The tube should be fitted securely at both ends of the gun.

, Start at the front of the seam and gradually pull the trigger of the caulking gun. As you squeeze, a small dot of caulk should emerge from the nozzle. Drag the nozzle down the length of the seam, applying even pressure on the trigger to maintain the same size dot along the entire seam.

, By working it into the joint, you ensure a stronger seal.

, Draw a second line of caulk above the first using the same method and amount of pressure as you used to create the first. Do not push this line under the joint.

, Use your finger to smooth the beaded line into a smooth strip of caulk. The width should be even throughout the entire line.

, After it has dried, check your work to verify that the caulk is secured.

Make your own cleaning solution.,
Use a prepackaged solution.,
Place the record on a cleaning mat.,
Drizzle the liquid over the record.,
Wipe with a microfiber towel.,
Use a manual cleaning machine.",How to Clean Vinyl Records2," Get a medium mixing bowl and combine three parts distilled water, one part isopropyl alcohol, and a few drops of dish detergent or dishwasher fluid. Stir these together gently. It is best to use distilled water in order to avoid some of the impurities that can be found in tap water.Be aware that there is some debate over whether or not to use alcohol as part of a cleaning solution for records. The alcohol may strip the record of its surface properties. So, be sure to use with caution and sparingly., Record stores and music stores often sell cleaners specifically designed for use on audio materials. Check the ingredients of any cleaner that you buy to make sure that you are comfortable with everything included. Make sure to follow the directions closely as well.Make sure to avoid household cleaning products, such as Windex. These cleaners are far too abrasive for records and can destroy the vinyl., You can buy these mats at record stores and they are generally made out of cork or another soft material. If you are worried about using liquids on top of your turntable, then a mat is a good idea. You can place the record flat on the mat and use the attached spindle to hold the record secure.Not all mats are designed for use with liquids. Before you clean with a solution make sure that your mat can handle it.

, Once you have a solution on hand, gently drizzle a few drops over the surface of the record. Or, moisten a towel with the solution and apply this moisture to the surface of the record. You want the record to be slightly damp, definitely not drenched., Grasp your towel and wipe in a counter-clockwise motion across the record, following the grooves. Be gentle, but apply enough pressure so that the towel makes contact with the interior parts of the groove. Use a totally fresh microfiber cloth to dry the entire record when finished., If you are not interested in cleaning your records by hand, then you can invest in a machine to do some of the work for you. There are machines that require special fluids, ones that brush both sides of a disk at once, and ones that combine vacuuming and brushing. Do some research online to find a machine that suits your particular needs.Be aware that some machines can be rather costly with price tags upwards of $500. To save money, look for a machine that uses brushes to clean, instead of vacuums."

Keep your records dry.,
Touch them carefully.,
Place them in archival sleeves.,
Store them vertically.",How to Clean Vinyl Records3," Never play or store a wet record. It is a myth that playing a wet record will reduce static build-up. Instead, using a record with moisture on it can damage the grooves and create an even bigger mess to clean. Make sure that you fully wipe down your records with a microfiber cloth or let them air dry on a cleaning mat., Try to avoid touching the interior grooves of your records whenever possible. Instead, handle them by grabbing the label or perimeter of the disk with your fingertips. The oil on your fingertips can attract dust to the grooves and make it more difficult to clean the record., When your records are cleaned, place them into fresh interior sleeves. Anti-static plastic sleeves are usually a good option. Look for a sleeve that is labeled as archival quality and non-scratching. This will preserve your disk as you take it in and out to play it., Make sure to place your records vertically next to one another. If you lay them flat, then your risk warping or bending. If your record is leaning to one side, this can also cause bending. So, keep the records placed firmly together with little room in between."

Invest in a gutter system.If your home doesn’t have any gutters, consider investing in a gutter system – especially if you live in a rainy climate.,
Inspect your gutters for effectiveness.In order for gutters to work properly, they must remain free of clogs, holes, and sags.,
Clean your gutters regularly.Gutters should be routinely cleaned of debris at least once per year.",How to Drain Water Away from Your Home1," Gutters collect the rain water that runs off the roof of your home and deposits it onto the ground. A good gutter system will direct rain water away from your home, which keeps it from leaking into the foundation and washing the foundation soil away.Most residential gutters are made from aluminum. Aluminum gutters are affordable and will last a long time.
Gutters made with vinyl, galvanized steel, or copper are also available.
Unless you have previous experience installing gutter systems, have a professional install them.;
, The most common gutter problem is blockage. Leaves, needles and other debris get trapped in the system, causing rain water to spill off your home too close to the foundation. Inspect your gutters closely and remove any debris that you find.


If you find that your gutters are sagging, check the hangars. These can deteriorate over time, but can easily and cheaply be replaced.
Check for leaks and holes in the gutters, as well. If you find any, gutter sealant can be purchased at any hardware store.

, If your home is surrounded by a lot of trees, clean them out twice per year. Inspect your gutters after big rainstorms, as well, since these can cause a significant buildup of debris. Use a sturdy ladder to get up to the gutters. Wear rubber gloves and clear the muck out of the system by hand.


Follow up the debris removal with a good flushing of water from your garden hose.
If you prefer, you can hire a professional to clean your gutters. The charge for this service varies, depending on the size of your home, but usually ranges from $50 to $250.

Determine how much confetti you actually have in the area you want to clean.,
Run the mop over suitable floors to finish up.

",How to Clean Up Confetti1," If there is a lot, not just a few random pieces, and the confetti is on the floor, vacuum up as much as you can. If there is a great deal of confetti, try using a rubber broom or a clean rake to collect a lot in a pile and hand transfer to a garbage bag first, to spare the vacuum cleaner from overload.


A handheld vacuum works best for this as it can get into smaller spaces (such as tight corners), which saves you some effort later. It also allows for quick emptying and refilling, saving your large vacuum cleaner from getting clogged.
Use the narrow nozzle to get under chairs, behind furniture, etc.
Empty the vacuum cleaner regularly. This will help prevent clogging and improves suction.;

Inspect your downspouts.,
Install downspout extensions.This is done by attaching an elbow to the end of the downspout and then connecting the extension piece.,
Avoid pointing your downspout extensions toward your driveway.,
Inspect the ground slope next to the foundation of your house.,
Add enough dirt to create a gentle slope.",How to Drain Water Away from Your Home2," Downspouts are the parts of the gutter that run vertically from the roof gutter to the ground. They should direct water at least six feet away from the foundation of your house. If yours currently don’t do this, you can add extensions to make them more effective. These extensions are inexpensive and relatively painless to install.Elbows and extensions can be obtained at any hardware store.
Typical cost is just under $20 per extension.

, The extension piece will be several feet of straight pipe. In most cases, these extensions are installed by simply screwing them on.


Make sure to direct the water at least six feet away from your home’s foundation.

, In winter, water deposited onto your driveway can freeze, causing a number of dangerous situations.The ideal spot for water to come out of the extension is on a sloped part of the ground, so that the water continues to drain further away from the house.


Make sure the water doesn’t end up on an incline that slopes back down to your home. This will result in the water draining straight back to the foundation of your home.

, Overflowing gutters and inefficient downspouts can erode the ground around the foundation of your home. This erosion will create a trench in the soil that traps the water there. If you see any gaps like this around your home, fill them in with soil. Firmly pack the soil in place for best results.


Avoid soils with high clay content, since these drain poorly. Purchase granular soil with a high sand content.You can buy bagged soil at any home improvement store. How much you need to buy depends on the size of your home and how steep you want to make the downslope.
Buy one bag and start the job. Once you know how much area one bag covers, you'll have a good idea of how many more you'll need to finish the job.

, Instead of just filling the gaps in with soil, add a slight excess of it. This will create a gentle slope that leads away from the foundation of the house, preventing water from collecting around the foundation. This gentle slope should extend, at minimum, about two or three feet from the house.


Pack soil around your house and slope it downwards at about one inch (2.5 cm) per foot (30 cm).Be sure to pack the soil firmly when creating the slope.

Locate and mark the underground utility lines on your property.,
Draw a drainage plan.Make a simple sketch of your property.,
Start digging the trench.,
Install a layer of gravel and the piping.There will be loose soil at the bottom of the trench.,
Fill the trench with gravel.After you’ve put your piping in place, use washed and rounded gravel to fill in the trench.",How to Drain Water Away from Your Home3," A French drain involves digging a trench in your yard. It’s not difficult to do yourself, but it’s important that you contact your local utility company a few days before you begin the work. Have them locate and mark all of the underground utility lines around your home. These underground utilities include gas, water, sewage, electric, and phone lines.
If you damage any of them while you’re installing the French drain, repair costs can be significant.

, Include the house, driveway, porches, the street and any other applicable features. Go into your yard with a line level or builder’s level and use it to figure out where the high and low spots are. Note these spots on the sketch, then draw arrows showing how the water tends to flow on your property.


You now have a diagram to help you properly and efficiently redirect drainage away from your home.
You should never plan to redirect water to run onto your neighbor’s property. If you are considering directing water into the street or storm sewer, find out what regulations apply by contacting the city for information.

, A French drain is essentially a gravel-filled trench that includes a perforated pipe which acts as a drain around your home.Begin the digging four to six feet away from the foundation of your home. Make the trench about six inches wide and about 24 inches deep. The trench should extend to the lowest part of your yard.


The end of the trench can level off, or you can have it go around your yard like a fence.You can dig the trench manually with a regular shovel. You can also purchase tools made specifically for trenching, like trenching shovels or trenching hoes, at a hardware store., Compact it tightly. Lay washed gravel on top of the compacted soil in a layer that is one to two inches thick. You will lay the piping on top of the gravel. The piping should be perforated with two rows of holes running down its length. Lay the piping so that the holes point down toward the earth, not up toward the sky.


If you lay the piping with the holes pointing up, they will get clogged with gravel and the drain will not work properly.
Never lay piping directly onto the soil. The gravel beneath it helps to properly disperse the water, along with the gravel surrounding it., The gravel pieces should be one inch or larger in diameter. The gravel should completely fill the trench within one inch of the surface.


Cover the remaining inch of space with a piece of sod. This will disguise the trench.

Vacuum or mop after sweeping indoors, depending on the floor type.",How to Clean Up Confetti2," For outdoors, use an outdoor broom. For indoors, a feather duster can be helpful for confetti on shelves and other higher places.

, Stop when you have accumulated a small pile and use a dustpan to collect. Toss away.


Constant collection is especially important when sweeping outdoors; the merest breeze can send collected confetti everywhere again.

, Check tree branches, window sills, banisters, drain covers, etc. as well as the ground. Knock confetti down with the broom handle or push it across difficult surfaces with the handle before sweeping.


For difficult pieces, use the wet cloth or tape method suggested below.

,
Run the rake over outdoor ground to finish up. A hosing down might also assist.
For lawned areas, a mow might be a good option, especially if the grass needs cutting anyway.

"
"
Using a wet cloth, loosen and pick up as much of the confetti as you can.",How to Clean Up Confetti3," This step is crucial because the confetti will adhere to surfaces that were slightly wet before and if you attempt to move them, the little pieces of confetti may leave some of their colouring behind on the surface they were adhered to.

Close any doors leading to the area where the cut glass is located, and block any open entrances.If there are any children or animals near the glass, get them out of the area where the broken glass is.
Make sure to check children and pets for cuts and scratches.;
, Broken glass is sharp and will cut through your skin. To clean up broken glass, make sure you're wearing rubber gloves. Always wear shoes when you're near broken glass.Never kneel on areas where broken glass is located. Glass could cut your knee.
If you don't have gloves, pick up glass using tongs or forceps. Never try to pick up glass with your bare hands.

, Carefully put each piece of glass into a empty coffee tin, or a plastic container thick enough so that the glass doesn't cut through.If you don't have anything that glass won't cut through, such as a plastic bag, wrap the pieces of glass into thick layers of newspaper, then put the wrapped glass into a plastic bag.
The newspaper needs to be thick enough so that the glass doesn't cut through it, reaching the plastic bag.

, Once you've picked up the individual shards, you'll need to sweep or vacuum the smaller pieces from the floor. If you don't have any larger pieces, this might be your first step in cleaning up broken glass. Be sure and shake your broom well into a paper bag to release any smaller pieces of glass that might linger.Some experts recommend not using a broom, as tiny shards of glass can linger in the bristles of the broom. Consider trying one of the broom-less methods below to clean up your glass if you are wary of using a broom.
Be aware that sweeping doesn't remove the small, sharp fragments of glass from most floors. Sweeping can offer the illusion that the glass is gone, when sharp fragments still remain.
Continue to keep pets and children out of the area until additional steps are taken to clean the broken glass off the floor.

, Sucking up pieces of glass with a vacuum cleaner may seem tempting, but it may ruin your machine. In addition, if any glass fragments remain in the vacuum hose, they may fall back out when the vacuum is turned off.If the broken glass comes from a broken CFL or other mercury-containing lightbulb, then vacuuming might spread mercury-containing powder or mercury vapor.If you do use a vacuum, cover the hose with a stocking or sock. The air sucking in will collect the glass fragments, and then you can carefully dispose of the glass-covered cloth.

, If you've broken glass onto a carpeted surface, you won't be able to use the methods above. Once you've cleared the area of larger glass fragments, use a small scrubbing brush to agitate the carpet fibers. This will result in glass pieces rising to the surface of the carpet.When you're finished scrubbing the area well, use duct tape to lift any remaining glass pieces.
You should carefully dispose of the duct tape in a double-wrapped plastic or paper bag.

, Cut a potato in half, and then press the cut tuber against the floor. Any stray pieces of glass will be caught in the potato's flesh, and you can throw the potato away.Any root vegetable can be used to collect glass shards from the floor, but potatoes have a good amount of surface space, are easy to grip and are relatively affordable.
The potato also works well to clean up broken glasses inside a dishwasher. Start by shining a flashlight into the dishwasher to see where the broken glass is. When you see the reflective glint of glass against the beam, press a cut potato gently but firmly onto the shiny surface. Throw the potato away when you're finished, and run the dishwasher again to rinse away any stray pieces of glass., A few pieces of white bread make excellent sponges to collect any stray pieces of glass that might remain after you've cleaned the area of the larger fragments. Take a piece of bread, and press it down on the area where you suspect the broken glass is. The glass will embed itself into the soft bread.Bread works well in hard-to-reach spots where broken glass can be found.
When your bread is getting hard to hold safely, throw it away and use another piece.
Repeat until you're sure you've covered the entire area.

, To use this method, it's a good idea to tear off about 12 inches of duct tape. Holding each end of the tape, lay the tape against the surface where the glass fragments are found. Press down on the tape gently, as if you're trying to apply it to the surface. Then, remove the tape. Any glass fragments that had been on the floor will be stuck to the underside of the tape.Any tape will work for this method, but duct tape is ideal for its sturdy texture. The width of duct tape also means it will cover the surface area more quickly than other tapes.
Fold the tape onto itself, and then throw it away into a plastic or paper bag.
Repeat as often as you need to until the whole area is clear of glass.

, If it's a thin towel, consider folding the paper towel in half again so that it's extra thick. Then carefully wipe down the area where the glass fragments might linger, and throw the paper towel away.Because paper towels vary greatly in their thickness, it's particularly important to wear heavy gloves when using this method to clean up glass fragments, so that you don't cut yourself.
Disposable ""wet wipes"" will also work for this method.

, If your window is only cracked, you can use a small knife to score a small arc just beyond the end of the crack. This will keep the crack from expanding. If the crack is only a small hole, as from a BB gun or tiny rock, you might be able to patch it. Simply apply clear fingernail polish or shellac to the area and allow to dry. For best results, apply several coats.
Don't put off replacing or repairing a broken window. A broken window isn't just dangerous because of the glass, but also lets in bugs, rain, cold weather, and water.

, If the glass is broken, but still intact enough to keep out the elements, you may be able to patch it until you can replace it.Possible options for patching the window include:


Using super glue to patch a long crack in the glass. Start by cleaning the window with acetone, then apply super glue to cover the crack. Allow the glue to dry, and then apply another layer. Repeat this process until the crack is covered with 2-3 layers of dried glue.
Masking tape makes a good patch for broken glass. Clean your window well with acetone so that the tape will adhere to the glass, then tear off a section of tape the length of the crack. Repeat this process on the other side of the window.
Staple a piece of wood or a piece of thick plastic against the broken window. Double thickness trash bags can also be used to cover the broken pane.

, As with broken glass inside, you'll need to make sure no children or pets can accidentally come into contact with any shards of glass that may have fallen into the yard, inside the house, or anywhere in the environment. Make sure you're wearing heavy shoes (not sandals or flip-flops) and safety gloves.You can pick up broken glass with newspaper, as above. Wrap it in the newspaper and place directly into a double-bagged leaf or heavy-duty trash bag.
Remember that glass may have fallen into furniture, shrubbery, or elsewhere.

, You may be able to extract the broken glass from the window by lifting out each broken piece from the putty that holds it in place.


If your window is largely intact, you might have to chisel the putty from the window's edge to remove the glass.
Make sure you're protecting your hands and arms from the broken glass.

, You can use a wood chisel, a putty knife, or even an ordinary table knife. The old putty will break into smaller pieces as you remove it. Try to get every bit of putty from the window frame, as this will help when you replace the broken glass.Be careful not to try to remove the putty too quickly, or you might split the window frame on the window.
Remove the small metal triangles driven into the frame beneath the putty. These are glazier's points, and hold the glass in place.
If you come across any putty that's difficult to remove, applying heat might help soften it.

, You'll have to have a replacement glass that's exactly the same size as your broken glass, slightly smaller than the wooden frame. Hold the glass in place with one hand while you insert glazier's points into the frame to secure the glass in place.Glazier points should be placed about every 4 inches around the periphery of the replacement glass.
You can press glazier's tips into the wood with your thumb.

, You'll need to knead the putty until it's soft, then roll it into a pencil-length cylinders. Press the rolls of putty around the window frame to seal in the replaced glass.When the new window is in place, smooth the putty with your putty knife.
Scrape off any excess putty on the window pane.

Treat the fabric gently.",How to Clean Sunbrella Fabric1," As soon as you notice dirt or grime on your Sunbrella fabric, brush it off with a soft bristle brush. Every week or so, spray a basic soapy water cleanser over the fabric and use a sponge to rub the cleanser in. This should bring the dirt to the surface of the fabric.


Use a mild dishwashing soap that you'd usually use for handwashing your dishes.;
, If the fabric doesn't seem like it's getting clean enough, consider applying another cleansing solution. Use a fabric cleanser specific to the type of stain you're trying to treat. Just spray this cleanser on and rub it in gently.For example, if you've used a soapy cleanser but realize that the fabric has mildew, you'll need to apply an extra cleanser that contains bleach to get the fabric clean.

, Depending on the amount of fabric you're cleaning, you can pour water over the fabric or just spray clean water over it. Continue to rinse or spray the Sunbrella fabric until all of the cleansing solution or soap is out. Let the fabric air dry completely.Avoid placing the fabric directly in the sun to dry, since this can cause the fabric colors to fade faster.

, When you're cleaning your Sunbrella fabric, avoid pulling, scrubbing, or tugging at the fabric. Choose a soft bristled brush instead of a firm brush to prevent stress to the fabric. This will extend the life of your Sunbrella fabric.To dry your fabric gently, you can blot it with a dry towel, but don't rub or pull the towel across it.

If the spill originated from a pump, make sure that it’s shut off and that the nozzle has been replaced.Even a small gasoline spill can quickly become dangerous. Try to react as quickly as you can.
Always pay attention when you smell gasoline fumes. Strange odors could indicate the presence of a spill, even if you’re not aware of it.
Be sure to let an attendant know about sizable spills and leaks that occur at filling stations.;
, Assuming the spill is the result of an ongoing leak, it may not be possible to stop it immediately. In this case, look for any sort of large container you can place beneath the leak. This will keep it from coming into contact with other surfaces that are much more difficult to clean.Make sure the container you use won’t leak or overflow.
If you’re at home, grab a bucket, paint roller tray or washtub.

, To prevent the spill from spreading to a larger area, throw down some object or group of objects that can stop or slow its movement. An obvious choice is a beach towel, but a piece of lumber or a few heavy boxes may also work (keep in mind that whatever you use will likely have to be thrown away). Position the barriers closely around the perimeter of the spill.


Be especially vigilant in preventing the spill from reaching electrical equipment or objects that produce or give off heat, such as stoves, space heaters and electrical outlets.Use a plastic tarp to cover and protect objects that are vulnerable to damage.

, Gasoline emits powerful fumes that can be very harmful to inhale. Open all nearby windows and doors to get air circulating through throughout the room. If the spill occurs somewhere inside with no windows, turn on the ceiling fan or air conditioning.Exposure to fumes may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath or disorientation.Gas fumes are also a severe fire hazard. Avoid doing anything that may lead to an accidental ignition.

, Ideally, you should choose a substance like clay cat litter or trisodium phosphate (commonly packaged as the cleaning powder ""T.S.P.""), as these are useful for neutralizing odors as well as wicking up moisture. However, other items like sawdust, sand, straw or even dirt will also be effective. Search the area and use whatever happens to be on hand—speed is the key here.Apply the absorbent agent liberally. It may take quite a bit to soak up all of the standing gasoline.
If you’re near the kitchen, you could also use baking soda, cornstarch or flour.
Some companies now manufacture special sorbent pads that can be used in the event of a sudden accident. The synthetic materials these pads are constructed from makes them a very efficient way of dealing with petroleum-based spills., This will give it time to soak up as much gasoline as possible. While it’s working, be sure to keep the immediate vicinity clear and well-ventilated. If time is a factor for any reason, allow the material to remain over the spill for at least half an hour.Absorbent agents work by separating the gasoline into smaller and smaller droplets, then binding with them to turn into a gritty paste can be lifted away easier than a liquid.

, For larger spills, it may be necessary to clear away clumps of gas-soaked dry material in order to make room for more. Sweep or scoop the saturated material into a trash bag or bucket, then shake more onto the wet spots underneath. Leave the fresh absorbent agent to sit for half an hour or more.Repeat this process until most of the gasoline has dissipated.You may not be able to get up every last trace of gasoline. What you can’t remove you’ll have to let evaporate, then scrub the resulting residue clean.

, Using a broom and dust pan, collect the gasoline and dry material from the affected surface. Dump the mess into a trash can, garbage bag or similar receptacle. If the spill occurred indoors, move the container outside to prevent fumes from building up in the confined space.Don’t cover or seal the container holding the gasoline. Trapped fumes can build up inside, leading to an increased risk of fire or explosion.
Be prepared to deep clean or throw out whatever container you use.

, Once the worst of the mess is up, turn your attention to the surface affected by the spill. The best way to do this is with a squeegee or plastic scraper. Transfer the last of the gasoline into a plastic bag and leave it with the rest of the materials for disposal.For spills on carpet or upholstery, vacuum up the lingering bits of gasoline and dry material before giving the fabric a thorough cleaning.

, Wet a washcloth or sponge with hot water. Apply a liquid dish soap directly to the site of the spill and work it in until it forms a thick, foamy lather. Scrub the stain vigorously to coax it out, then flush the area with fresh water and pat it dry with a towel.If you’re worried about causing water damage to the surface you’re attempting to clean, try sprinkling it with a powdered dish detergent or dry solvent instead. Afterwards, you can mop up the cleaner with a damp cloth.
After you’re finished cleaning, wash your hands and any other parts of your body that may have come into contact with gasoline or gas fumes., Place a call to the fire department or pollution control agency to inform them of the spill and ask for instruction on how to proceed. In most cases, they’ll dispatch someone to deal with flammable substances. Otherwise, they can advise you on how to safely dispose of the mess yourself.Never throw gasoline away in a standard trash receptacle. Toxic and flammable materials require special disposal methods.Gasoline can still present a fire hazard even when it’s been absorbed into another dry material.

Grab an empty spray bottle.,
Mix a solution with dish soap, rubbing alcohol, and water.,
Swirl the liquid around to mix it up.,
Spray dirty spots on the terrazzo with the solution.,
Let the cleaner sit for 30 seconds-3 minutes.,
Wipe the spot with a damp towel.",How to Clean Terrazzo1," Either buy an empty spritzer bottle, or empty and rinse out another spray bottle you already have. If you use a bottle that had liquid in it already, make sure it was a mild, non-acidic cleaner. If you use a bottle that has harsh chemicals, some of that may transfer to the floor.;

It should have a smooth, glossy look. If it appears rough or dull, consult a flooring professional before doing any cleaning.

, Before you do a deep clean with a steam cleaner, run a dust mop across the entire floor to pick up hair, dust, and dirt first. Cleaning with steam will not be effective if there is a lot of debris still on the floor., Follow the instructions on the steam cleaner for how much water it needs and where the water goes. If you know that your tap water has a lot of mineral content, it’s best to use distilled water. Water with lots of mineral particles cannot clean effectively.Mineral-filled water will also leave residue on the inside of your steam cleaner which will eventually make it ineffective for cleaning.
Some steam cleaners require you to add detergent, but the best type to use for terrazzo floors are steam cleaners that do not use soap.

, Position the steam cleaner in a corner and pull it outward in a straight line. Continue to pull the steam cleaner back and forth in straight lines. Slightly overlap the previous line to make sure you don’t miss any spots.

Check the care label of the blinds.,
Remove the blinds from the window.,
Vacuum the blinds.,
Prepare a bathtub to clean the blinds.,
Wash the blinds in the tub.,
Spot clean the blinds.,
Dry the blinds.",How to Clean Roller Blinds," It is important that you follow the care instructions of the blinds, to ensure that you are washing your blinds in a way that won’t damage them.


If the care label indicates that you can wash the blinds (plastic/vinyl blinds), or your blinds are very dirty, you can thoroughly clean the blinds in a bathtub.
If the care label indicates that the roller blinds cannot be washed, you’ll need to spot clean them, meaning you'll only clean the spots that are visibly dirty.;
, Remove the roller blinds from the window, and from the roller, so the blinds can lay flat on the floor. Most roller blinds have a disk on the side opposite of the pulley chain that can be rotated until the top of the blind comes free from its brackets.If you are going to spot clean your blinds, spread out some pages of newspaper on the ground as a workspace.

, If the blinds are especially dirty, a preliminary vacuum might be in order. That way, you can clear the blinds of any cobwebs and large pieces of dust, removing any surface grime.


The vacuum’s soft brush tool is perfect for picking up small pieces of dust and dirt clung to the roller blinds.
You might want to consider vacuuming both sides of the blinds to make sure you remove as much dirt and dust as possible.
If vacuuming isn’t an option, you can remove as much dust as possible by wiping the blinds by hand with a microfiber cloth or an old sock.

, Fill a bathtub about half way with lukewarm water. Add about 2-3 tbsp. of dishwashing soap to the bathwater, and stir the water and soap around until it starts to create sudsy bubbles.1 tbsp of bleach can be added to the water to help clean white blinds.

, If you have multiple blinds, wash them one at a time. Allow the blind to sit in the tub water and soak for approximately 20-30 minutes so the dried on grime can loosen from the blind’s surface.Clean the blind using a soft brush, sponge, or cloth to wipe away any dirt still on the blind. Once the blind is cleaned, drain the soapy water, and add more clean water into the tub to rinse the blind of any remaining soap.


Consider folding the blinds accordion style if they are particularly long.A toothbrush can help loosen up tough stains and markings.
For quicker soap removal, you can try holding the blind vertically in the shower, and use the shower head to rinse the blind of any soap. Dried soap residue left on the blinds can immediately attract dirt and dust., Make a cleaning solution from laundry detergent and water.You can use about 1 tsp. of laundry detergent (or one small squirt of dishwashing soap), mixed with 2 cups of water. With the blind laid on the newspaper on the floor, use a cloth or towel that has been thoroughly wrung out, and wipe the dirty areas of the blind.Continue spot cleaning until the entire blind is clean.


If the blind is really dirty and has significant residue from pets, bugs, or food grease, consider adding about 1 tbsp. of baking soda to your cleaning solution. The abrasive texture of the baking soda will help dissolve the dirt.For tough stains, consider scrubbing the dirty areas of the blind with an old toothbrush.
Be careful not to saturate the blind too much. The cloth you use to clean the blind’s surface should just be a little damp.

, Let the blinds completely dry by arranging them on a drying rack, or consider hanging them on a drying line outside. Reinstall the blinds to the rollers and rehang them over the window.Regular dusting and vacuuming can help maintain clean blinds.

Dust paneling monthly with a soft cloth or rag.,
Pour a small amount of dish soap into a bucket.,
Dip a sponge or rag into the bucket.,
Wipe the paneling with the damp sponge or rag.,
Dry paneling with a clean lint-free cloth.,
Refill the bucket as needed.",How to Clean Paneling1," Dust paneling once a month or whenever it looks dusty. Most paneling cleaning can be accomplished by dusting alone. This easy preventative cleaning will save you from having to use a more labor-heavy type of cleaning later on.In order to dust paneling that is higher than you can reach with a rag, you can use the dusting extension on your vacuum cleaner or an extendable hand-held duster.;
, Then, pour in a few drops of vegetable oil. Finally, fill the bucket with warm water from your kitchen faucet. This mixture will effectively clean and polish paneling, while maintaining its visually appealing shine.


Use this cleaning soap/oil mixture only if there are marks or stains on your paneling that cannot be removed by dusting.

, Wipe down the paneling with this non-abrasive cloth. Ring out the excess water, so that your rag is damp, not wet.

Overly wet rags can penetrate the finish and cause staining. When cleaning any type of paneling, it’s imperative that you not let water soak into the paneling. This can both distort the wood or other material beneath the finish, and also warp the finishing itself., Start from the bottom and wipe straight upward to avoid streaking.Wipe the wood in small sections. Work quickly and thoroughly. Remember that you don’t need to scrub the paneling very hard; a light touch will be enough to clean the surface.

, Continue to rub along the vertical grain of the wood when you’re rubbing it dry. Drying the paneling finish with the lint-free cloth will also buff the paneling, rub in the oil from the soap/oil mixture, and give the paneling an attractive sheen.Work in small sections by first washing and then drying the area before moving on. Otherwise, you’ll leave a large portion of the paneling wet at once and risk damaging the finish.
If you leave the water on the finished paneling for too long, it will discolor the finish and give it an unattractive gray tint.

, As you continue to rinse and re-dampen the cleaning rag in the bucket, the water will become dirty. At this point, dump out and refresh the water and soap solution. You can then return to wiping down the sections of paneling.


Wash out the rag or sponge well to remove dirt and debris.

Apply a second layer of the oil solution.",How to Clean Paneling2," To both clean and oil your wood you can use 1 cup (240 ml) olive oil mixed with 1/4 cup (60 ml) white vinegar. Combine these ingredients into a spray bottle. Light shake the bottle to mix the oil and vinegar, and then screw on the spray cap.You should be able to purchase wood oil specifically designed for unfinished paneling at your local hardware or home-supply store.
Be careful when cleaning unfinished paneling. The unprotected wood can easily absorb water, grease, and other liquids, and can quickly become warped or distorted.

, Always test any solutions on a small area first before trying to clean a large section of your paneling. Using a clean cloth, wipe the solution on a small, inconspicuous area and let sit. Check the test area after a few minutes to make sure there is no damage before continuing., Make sure that the cloth is damp but not wet; if it’s wet, you risk causing water damage to your unfinished wood. Then, gently rub the oil/vinegar mixture into the wood. Work the oil into the wood by rubbing small sections at a time, working from the bottom to the top.Make sure to rub the oil in along the direction of the grain. This will allow the wood time to absorb the oil and will maintain the beauty of your unfinished wood paneling.

, If the unfinished wood paneling is still dry after applying a first layer of oil, then another coat may be necessary. Let the first application sit for a few minutes before reapplying the vinegar and oil solution."

Wipe a small test area with a damp sponge.,
Clean the full surface of the painted paneling.,
Dry the paneling using a clean, lint-free cloth.",How to Clean Paneling3," Clean the painted paneling by wiping it with the damp rag. At this point, the sponge should be dampened only with water.

If you have already tried cleaning painted paneling with only water and were unsuccessful, visit a hardware store and look for a chemical product which will clean painted paneling., Before you start cleaning a large surface of paneling, you can wipe clean a small area to make sure that the water will not discolor or smear the paint., Once you’re sure the paneling is undamaged from your small test, use the damp sponge to clean the full area of the paneling.Rinse out the sponge as it becomes dirty, and re-dampen it before continuing to wipe down the rest of the paneling.

Painted paneling, unlike finished paneling, will be covered in a colored paint which conceals the grain of the wood. Consequently, it’s not as important that you wipe the paneling along the wood grain.

, Once you’ve cleaned the entire section of paneling you wish to work on, you can dry the paneling by lightly rubbing or blotting it with a clean cotton cloth. .


Although painted paneling is less likely to be damaged by water than finished or unfinished paneling, it’s still wise to remove the water from the paneling quickly.

Wipe down the natural stone with the solution.,
Rinse off the solution with distilled water.,
Dry the stone.",How to Clean Natural Stone1," If you are cleaning a natural stone floor, you'll want to use a fluffy mop or brush that has soft, natural bristles. This will prevent the stone from getting scratched by brushes with abrasive bristles. If you are cleaning natural stone countertops, a clean cotton rag or a handheld duster can remove surface debris.Sweep all the dirt and dust into a dustpan and dispose of it.


If you are cleaning natural stone floors, you can also use a vacuum.
Sweep or dust your natural stone at least twice a week.;
, Fill up a bucket with five cups (1.1 l) of warm water from your faucet and put two to three drops of a mild, pH neutral dish soap into the bucket. Mix the water and soap together until bubbles start to form on the top. Read the label of the dish soap that you are purchasing to make sure that it doesn't contain any acid, which could damage the natural stone.Alcohol, citrus, and vinegar all contain acids that are corrosive to natural stone.You can also ask a stone retailer to direct you towards a stone-specific cleaner.

, Use a soft mop or a rag and dip it into the solution that you just created. Work in circular motions to lift up any stuck on soap scum, dirt, or gunk that is on your stone. If you are using a mop, go left and right in large sweeping motions to remove dirt and gunk from the floor., Rinse the stone with distilled water until there is no more soap or cleaning solution left on the stone. Regular water from your tap may contain minerals that could discolor the stone. The cleaner can also be absorbed by the stone and cause discoloration, so make sure that you rinse it thoroughly.If you don't have distilled water, you can boil tap water instead.

, Dry the stone with a soft, synthetic or cotton rag until all of the moisture is gone. Do not leave any cleaner or liquid on the surface of the stone. Continue to buff the area until your natural stone looks shiny and clean. "

Repeat the steps until the stain is removed.",How to Clean Natural Stone2," Saturating the area with water first will fill the pores of the stain and make removing it easier. Spray down the area with water or use a wet sponge to saturate the stain.Refer to your stone manufacturer to determine which kind of poultice you need.
Most stone poultices are safe on travertine, marble, slate, and granite.

, Read the instructions on the back of the stone poultice, so you know exactly how much water to use. Slowly pour warm water into the poultice powder in small batches, mixing it thoroughly in between each batch. Keep adding water until the poultice forms a paste similar to peanut butter., Before you cover a large stain with the poultice, you'll want to make sure that you have the right chemicals for the right stone.If the chemical discolors or stains your test area, do not use it on your natural stone.

, Cover the stain with the poultice using a wooden spatula. Extend the paste for about an inch (2.54 cm) around the stain. Use the spatula to even out the poultice.One pound of poultice will cover one square foot of natural stone.

, Put a piece of plastic wrap over the stain and secure the edges of the plastic with pieces of tape. Make two slits into the plastic wrap to let the poultice breathe., The paste will start to harden and will begin to draw out the stain. Do not disrupt or move the paste while it is sitting., Use a plastic or wooden scraper to remove the poultice from the stone. Break up bigger chunks of the poultice while taking great care not to scratch your natural stone., Clean the stain with a pH neutral soap and water before rinsing and drying it. Make sure that no more poultice paste is left over., It may take several applications for the stain to be completely gone. Continue mixing and applying the poultice paste to the stain until you start to see the stain diminish or disappear.It may take up to five separate applications for the stain to be completely removed.

Clean up spills as soon as they occur.,
Use mats to protect your stone.,
Avoid spilling acidic liquids on natural stone.,
Seal your natural stone.",How to Clean Natural Stone3," Stone like limestone and sandstone are extremely absorbent and will soak up stains quickly. Other natural stone like granite and serpentine are less absorbent, but will still stain if left exposed to liquid. Blot up spills immediately and then perform a simple cleaning on the area to prevent stains.Remember to blot the stain. Do not rub the spill or you may work the stain deeper into the stone.

, Use trivets, mats, and coasters on natural stone countertops to separate the stone from hot items that come out of the oven or stove. If you have natural stone floors, purchase floor mats so that people can wipe their shoes before walking on the stone tiles. This will prevent dirt and scratches.Placemats can also protect the finish on your stone from getting scratched by sharp items like silverware, ceramics, and china.
Sand and dirt are a common reason that stone floors get scratched.

, Things like vinegar, cola, lemon, orange, bleach, and ammonia can seep into the pores of your natural stone and damage it or discolor it. If you do spill something acidic on your natural stone, make sure to blot it up as soon as possible and flush it with warm water before drying the area with a rag., Make sure to purchase a sealer that is made for the specific type of natural stone that you have. A liquid sealer will protect your natural stone from stains and scratches. Spray the liquid natural stone sealer on the surface of your natural stone and rub it in.

Read the care tag for cleaning instructions.,
Vacuum the surface.,
Test the fabric.,
Fill a spray bottle with alcohol.,
Spray the stained area with rubbing alcohol.,
Rub the area with a sponge.,
Try using alcohol wipes for cleaning.,
Wait 20-30 minutes for the surface to dry.,
Dry the surface using a blowdryer.,
Brush the surface in a circular motion.",How to Clean Microfiber with Alcohol," The care tag may indicate that you can clean the microfiber using water. If there is no tag, it is always best to use rubbing alcohol because water can stain microfiber., Remove any dirt particles, food crumbs, or dust from your microfiber before you begin cleaning with alcohol. This will ensure that you do not rub crumbs into the fabric. For the best results, use a brush attachment or hand-held vacuum when cleaning fabric.

, Rubbing alcohol should not leave a mark on microfiber; however, it is always a good idea to test the fabric before applying rubbing alcohol to the entire item. For example, if you are cleaning a microfiber couch, test a small piece of material on the back of the couch that is not visible., Pour approximately half a cup (118 ml) of rubbing alcohol into a spray bottle. The amount of alcohol you need will vary depending on the size of the item you are cleaning and the number of stains present on the material.Alternatively, you can try screwing a spray nozzle directly onto a large bottle of rubbing alcohol., In order to clean microfiber, spray the stain or the entire surface with rubbing alcohol. Touch the fabric to make sure that it is moist from the rubbing alcohol.Alternatively, if you are cleaning a small stain, you can spray the rubbing alcohol directly onto a sponge prior to scrubbing.

, Using a white or natural sponge, rub the area that was sprayed with alcohol. Depending on the severity of the stain, you may have to scrub pretty hard to lift the stain. If the stain doesn't lift, you can try repeating this step.It is important that you only use white or natural coloured sponges. Colourful sponges may actually stain the microfiber fabric.

, To save time while cleaning, you could try using alcohol wipes when cleaning microfiber. This way you don’t have to spray the surface with alcohol and then scrub with a sponge. Instead, you can just rub the surface directly with the alcohol wipes.


Make sure to test the alcohol wipes on a small surface before cleaning the entire item. You want to make sure that they don’t stain the fabric.

, Once you have rubbed the fabric with a sponge or alcohol wipes, let the surface dry. Alcohol dries very quickly and should not take more than 20 or 30 minutes to fully air-dry., Alternatively, you could speed up the drying process by using a blow dryer. Aim the blow dryer at the area you are cleaning. Continue to blow dry until the fabric is dry to the touch.

, After you have cleaned the microfiber, you may find that the alcohol left the material feeling stiff. You can remove this stiffness by rubbing the fabric with a scrub brush. The bristles will help to fluff the fabric, leaving it soft to the touch."

Wear goggles without ventilation holes.You can purchase an N-95 respirator mask online or from a hardware store for about $12 to $25.
Inspecting for mold can stir up airborne spores, so it’s important to wear protective gear.;
, Look for mold near the intake of your heating/ventilation/air conditioning system. Inspect inside the air ducts for a musty smell or noticeable mold growth. If all you find is dust in the return registers, that’s normal and you can vacuum or remove the registers to clean them.If you don’t find any signs of mold, and no one in your household has unexplained illness, symptoms or allergies, your air ducts are most likely not contaminated.
If you suspect contamination in your HVAC system, turn it off and don’t run it until you have the air ducts cleaned., Contact a professional mold removal service if you find a strong odor, damage from contaminated water, and/or areas of mold larger than ten square feet (three meters), approximately three feet by three feet (91 cm by 91 cm). Read online reviews or obtain a referral for a qualified mold remediation contractor. Check their references and ask what EPA recommendations or other professional guidelines they’ll follow.For large areas of mold, the basement and HVAC may need to be sealed off with plastic sheeting.Contaminated water can occur from flooding or sewage backup.
A strong, moldy odor may indicate unseen mold growth behind walls, under flooring or beneath baseboards.
You may be able to obtain a free estimate detailing what services are needed. The average cost for mold remediation is about $7,500., Ventilate your working area as much as possible. Open windows and doors, and use fans. Wear the same protective gear you did when you were inspecting: old clothing, long gloves, an N-95 respirator, and goggles without ventilation holes., Take any moveable items from the area outside to inspect them. Throw away disposable items like cardboard boxes. Wash and dry any contaminated clothing. Clean contaminated items before returning them to the basement, once you’ve finished cleaning the basement mold.You can deep clean leather, wood or inorganic furniture.
Upholstered furniture with visible mold will need to be disposed of or reupholstered by a professional.

Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to vacuum the carpeting. Apply a cleaning solution and scrub the area. Allow the carpet to dry completely.If the carpet is removable, let it dry outside in the sunshine. If not, turn fans on to help the carpet dry.
Dispose of any carpeting that’s been soaked through., Perform a small test area first on each item you’re cleaning to make sure the cleaning agent doesn’t damage it. You can clean mold with diluted bleach, diluted Borax, undiluted vinegar, a baking soda solution, or 3% hydrogen peroxide. Depending on which method you choose, you can use a bucket or spray bottle to hold the solution.For hard surfaces, combine a gallon of water with a cup of bleach, or one part bleach to sixteen parts water. For porous surfaces, try one part non-ammonia, liquid dish detergent, ten parts bleach and twenty parts water.
To use baking soda, combine 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (1 to 2 mL) baking soda with a full spray bottle of water. Alternately, combine 1/2 cup (118 mL) baking soda with one cup (250 mL) of water and one tablespoon (15 mL) of mild liquid detergent.
Borax is safe for porous and nonporous materials. Combine a cup (225 mL) of Borax with a gallon (4 L) of water.

, Use a spray bottle, a sponge or a rag dipped in your cleaning agent to apply it to the moldy area. Allow the cleaning agent to sit for five to fifteen minutes., Use a scrub brush or cloth to scrub the area with your chosen cleaning agent. Make sure to get into hard-to-see areas like cracks and crevices as well as the visible surfaces. Rinse the brush or cloth often to avoid spreading mold residue., Use a clean sponge or rag to wipe down the area with water. Change the rinse water regularly to keep it clean. Once the area dries, check for any mold you may have missed. If you still see signs of mold, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing process., Increase the ventilation in your basement. Run air conditioners and dehumidifiers as needed. If you have a humidifier, clean and treat it with an antimicrobial solution.You can increase ventilation by using oscillating fans, opening windows and doors, and using a dehumidifier.
You can purchase antimicrobial solutions online or at a hardware store.

, Make sure your large appliances, such as your washer and dryer, are vented. Your washing machine needs a floor drain and secure hose connections. Install a pan for overflow right under the machine, if needed., Ensure that your gutters discharge water at least six feet away from exterior walls. If your gutters are sending water too close to the home, install gutter extenders. Look for leaky pipes, and repair your piping, if needed.Sump pumps should discharge water at least twenty feet from your home.

, Ensure that the ground slopes away from the house so that water won’t pool up against the foundation. Clear away any wet leaves against the exterior walls and don’t allow debris to accumulate there., Clean the condensation pan under the coil of your central AC with a 1/2 percent bleach solution. Check that the continuous drain is functioning. If you find any leaky duct joints, seal them with flexible mastic, which you can purchase at a heating and cooling supply store.Clean the AC condensation pan before each cooling season.

, Make sure your roof is insulated, and there are no leaks in your roof or ceiling. Insulate your windows with proper flash and caulking to minimize condensation. Waterproof and insulate exterior walls.You can have your basement waterproofed professionally, or apply sealant to your walls and floors. Fill in any cracks with a waterproof filler.

, Remove any vinyl wallcoverings, which trap humid air between drywall and the wallpaper. After fully cleaning the area, use paint or wall coverings with permeable paper backings instead., Unfinished basements or crawlspaces with bare earth flooring transmit a lot of moisture.

Repeat this process with your other headlight.",How to Clean Oxidized Headlights1," Fill a bucket with water. Add the amount of car soap indicated on the label to the water. Agitate the water until the soap is distributed and bubbles form. Wet a clean microfiber cloth in the solution. Wipe the headlight clean with the cloth.You should work on headlights one at a time. Doing so will prevent cleaner from drying on the light, which can have a negative effect on it.
Alternatively, you can use a household glass cleaner or dish soap to wash your headlights. Spray it on the light and wipe free dirtiness with a clean, dry microfiber cloth.;
, Take a clean, dry microfiber cloth and wipe the light dry. Pay attention to the cracks around the outside of the light, as water collects easily there. Once dry, tape around the light with masking tape or painters tape.


Many cleaners and the sanding that’ll be done later can damage your paint job. A thick border of tape around the light will protect against this., Many kits come with some kind of lubricating liquid for the sanding process. Apply this to the light as directed in the kit instructions. If your kit does not have lubricant, wet the headlight with water. Keep the headlight wet while working on it.


Always follow the usage directions that came with your cleaning kit for best results. Using your kit improperly could diminish its effectiveness., Your kit will likely come with several kinds of sandpaper. The lowest number will be the coarsest. Wet the paper with lubricant or water. Rub the paper with moderate pressure against the light in a circular motion.


Take care not to rub any part of your vehicle’s paint job with the sandpaper. Doing so will likely damage its finish.
Your sandpaper, much like the surface of the headlight, should remain wet at all times. Re-wet your paper as necessary., Use water from a hose to flush away lubricant and loosened particles created by the sandpaper. When the light is completely rinsed, use your microfiber drying cloth to wipe remaining moisture away., Most kits have at least two sandpapers with different grit ratings, though some may have more. Lubricate, buff, rinse, and dry your light as previously described with a finer grit (higher number) sandpaper with each application. Depending on how badly your light has been oxidized, the buffing portion of this project may take you between 10 and 30 minutes.


After drying the light each time, your next buffing sequence should use a finer grit rating sandpaper until all grit ratings have been used.
The highest grit rating sandpaper is often smaller in size. This paper is ideal for the curved parts of the light and corners., Apply a small amount of the polishing agent that came with your kit to a polishing pad. Rub the pad against the light in a circular motion. Keep the pad in motion constantly. Spread the polishing agent over the entire light. When the polish begins to dry or dissipate, it’s ready to be wiped away with a clean part of your microfiber drying cloth.Some kits may be intended for use with an electric polisher. In this situation, attach the polisher pad to the electric polisher and buff the light as you would normally., Some kits may come with sealer to help prevent your lights from oxidizing. A little bit goes a long way. Apply a small amount to a fresh microfiber cloth and rub it over the entire surface of the light. Remove the tape and the light is done., In this fashion, remove oxidation from your other headlight. While you’re at it, check out your taillights and any other plastic exterior lights. These, too, can be cleaned with your kit.


Although kits are suitable for cleaning exterior hard plastic light covers, you should never use this kit on glass. Doing so will likely permanently cloud or damage the glass."

Protect the paint surrounding the light with tape.,
Wet the light and buff it with toothpaste.,
Rinse and dry the light, then repeat the process.,
Wax the light, if desired, and clean the other light.",How to Clean Oxidized Headlights2," Work on headlights one at a time to prevent cleaners from drying and negatively impacting the light. Fill a bucket with water and a car soap. Wet a microfiber cloth in the solution and wipe the light clean. Dry the light with an unused microfiber cloth.If you don't have car washing solution available, mix a moderate amount of dish soap in a bucket of water, agitate it until it bubbles, and use this to wash your lights instead.

, Cleaning your light with toothpaste will take a good amount of elbow grease. While buffing, it’s easy to get toothpaste on the paint. This can cause discoloration. Prevent this by creating a thick outer border around the light with masking tape., Use a hose to wet the light again with water. Dampen an unused microfiber cloth with water. Apply a generous amount of toothpaste to the cloth. Rub the cloth over all surfaces of the light with moderate pressure in circular motions.


Whitening toothpaste may work even better than normal toothpaste. Avoid gel toothpastes. These may have a negative reaction to the light or have no effect at all., After you’ve thoroughly buffed all surfaces of the light, rinse it with water. Use a clean part of your microfiber drying cloth to dry the light. Look the light over when dry. If it is still cloudy, repeat this process.Light oxidation may only take a few applications to remove. Heavy oxidation may take many applications. You should begin to see an improvement in the light after about five minutes.

, A thin layer of ordinary car wax will help prevent the light from oxidizing. Use a fresh microfiber cloth to spread a small amount of wax over all surfaces of the light. Remove the tape when the wax dries. Repeat this process to clean the other light."
"
Wash surface buildup off the headlight.,
Create a baking soda paste in a cup.,
Use a sponge to apply the paste.,
Buff the paste, rinse it, and then reapply it.,
Repeat this process to clean the other light.",How to Clean Oxidized Headlights3," Fill a bucket with water. Add a moderate amount of dish soap to it. Stir the solution to evenly distribute the soap. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution and wipe away grime and buildup on the headlight. When clean, dry the light with a separate microfiber cloth., Put 3 tbsp (44.4 ml) of baking soda into a cup. Add water little by little to the cup. Stir the mixture with your clean hands or a spoon as you do so. When it becomes a thick paste, stop adding water. Blend the mixture so it is consistent throughout., Wet your sponge in clean water. Use the sponge to moisten the clean light. Dip part of your sponge into the paste and evenly dab a generous amount across the entire light. You should have enough paste to clean all headlights and taillights., Rub the paste into the light with your sponge using circular motions. Use firm, moderate pressure while moving back and forth over the light with the sponge. When all surfaces have been buffed, rinse the light with water, reapply the paste, and buff it again. Keep the light wet at all times while buffing.Depending on the severity of the oxidation on the light, it may take many applications before all cloudiness and discoloration is removed. You should see results after about two or three applications.
Baking soda is a milder cleaning agent, so it isn’t likely to damage your paint job. However, it is mildly abrasive, so you should try to avoid getting it on the paint surrounding the light.

, When you finish a light, turn it on to make sure you haven’t missed any spots. Repeat the cleaning process to remove missed spots. In the same fashion as the first light, remove oxidation from your remaining exterior lights, including your taillights."

Put on editing gloves.",How to Clean Old Photos1," Before you begin the cleaning process, back up your photos digitally. While proper cleaning minimizes the risk of damage, it does not completely eliminate it. Scan your photos onto your computer and save them before attempting to clean them. If you don't have a scanner, stop by a local print shop and use one there.;
, As old photos are delicate, you should never use generic cleaning supplies on them. You should use photograph emulsion cleaner and wipes specifically made for cleaning photographs only. These items can sometimes be difficult to find in stores, but should be easy to purchase online.Emulsion cleaners and wipes are made from ingredients and materials safe to use on older photographs. They resemble normal cleaning wipes and spray cleaners, but use less harsh ingredients.
Do not substitute cleaners. While getting specialized supplies is a hassle, it's worth the extra cost to avoid damaging your photographs.

, Before handling your photographs, put on a pair of clean editing gloves. Like other supplies for cleaning photographs, these can be purchased online. It's important to use editing gloves over generic gloves when cleaning photographs.Editing gloves are a type of glove designed to be used when working with film and photographs.

Limescale or calcium deposits are likely culprits, and should be pre-treated before you tackle lesser stains. You can:


Identify calcium deposits by white, slightly rough textured spots. These can be removed by white vinegar on a damp cloth.Spot limescale, which is difficult to remove, by its milky white deposit on the surface of your mirror. Remove these stains with lemon juice, pickling vinegar, or lime juice.;
, If you intend on using regular rags or paper towels, the rough material could cause scratches on your mirror over time, or may leave lint behind. A microfiber cloth is a great way to prevent lint. In addition, you should also make sure you have:


A bucket
Cotton cleaning rag (2)
Water
Rubbing alcohol
White vinegar

, You can also make use of pre-made window cleaner, which are generally available at most stores, but white vinegar is an affordable and safe cleaning agent that will easily cut through build-up on your mirror. To make a white vinegar window cleaner simply:









Dilute one part white vinegar per every four parts hot water in your bucket.So for every four cups of water you use, you'll need one cup of white vinegar.
You might also consider using a spray bottle, found in the home goods section of most stores, so that you can mist your mirrors with your cleaning solution.
If you know you have hard water, using distilled water in place of tap water will prevent minerals from leaving deposits on your mirror.

, Due to the fact that rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly, you should try to perform this task as swiftly as possible.








, Using the second of your two clean cotton rags, dampen it in the bucket containing your cleaning solution and wring out additional moisture.If you drown your mirror in cleaner, your microfiber cloth might not be sufficient to dry it.








, This way, when you notice one side of your microfiber cloth is getting dirty, you can use the opposite side. When that side becomes dirty, you can open it and use one of the clean inside parts of your cloth, and so on.









You can use any soft, lint free cloth. Some people use bar towels for mirrors and glass.

, Pay close attention to cracks, crevices, or contours in your mirror; these are places dirt and grime build up and escape notice. By cleaning from top to bottom, you will also prevent the appearance of drip marks.









Angled cuts, deep corners, or other embellishments can be effectively cleaned with a cotton swab or toothbrush.Never wipe in a circular motion. Side to side and up and down leads to less streaks.

, Observe your mirror from multiple angles, and if you see any spots:









Apply a small amount of cleaner to your cotton rag.
Wring out remaining moisture thoroughly.
Spot clean the offending spot with your rag.
Dry and buff with a clean portion of your microfiber cloth.

Clean only the viewing glass of ambrotypes.,
Do not clean daguerreotypes.,
Use compressed air on vintage cartes and cabinet cards.",How to Clean Old Photos3," Ambrotypes are old photos that often consist of two plates of glass. One plate contains the image while the other, the viewing glass, covers the image. Only clean the viewing glass and only do so if you know which is the viewing glass. The viewing glass should be cleaned with cotton swabs dipped in alcohol. Only do a light wipe down, to rub away any unwanted dirt and grime. Stay away from the corners and sides when cleaning, as you do not want any liquid to seep into the picture and harm the image.If you purchased the image somewhere, the paperwork may inform you which side is the viewing glass. You can sometimes tell by examining the photo carefully. Photographers often used a black lacquer on one side of the glass to darken it. The image is found on the glass opposite the black lacquer.
If you do not know for sure which side is the viewing glass, take your ambrotype to a professional. You can severely damage ambrotype pictures by cleaning the glass that contains the image.

, Daguerreotypes are another antique form of photography from the 19th Century. Due to their extremely delicate nature, daguerrotypes should not be cleaned by amateur collectors. Always take daguerreotypes to a professional for cleaning.You can find a professional in your area by searching online. If you can't find one close by, see if you can find a professional you can work with long distance. Someone may be willing to mail your photos back and forth.

, Vintage cartes and cabinet cards should never be cleaned with liquid. Blow a can of compressed air above these types of photos to remove dirt and debris. If dirt is not removed with compressed air, use a very soft brush to wipe it away using extremely delicate motions.Very dirty cartes and cabinet cards may not come clean with compressed air alone. In this case, seek professional cleaning services.

Store your photographs in a dry environment.,
Remove new stains quickly.,
Minimize how often you handle old photographs.",How to Clean Old Photos4," Once your old photographs are clean, store them in a protected area that is also dry. You can, for example, put them in an envelope and store them in a drawer in your home that is not prone to moisture or humidity.

Pull out the screen.,
Wipe off the lint with your hands.,
Rinse the screen off with water.,
Vacuum out the screen vent.,
Repeat after each use.",How to Clean Lint from a Dryer1," Locate the lint screen on your dryer. It may be at the top, on the side, or at the bottom of the dryer door. Check the screen and clean it of lint every time before you place a load inside. Grab the handle of the screen and pull it out until it is fully extended. In most models, you will be able to remove it entirely for cleaning.Only apply gentle pressure when pulling out the screen. You should meet with little to no resistance. If you bend the screen too much, it may not fit back properly into the lint trap area.;
, Run your hands over the screen until you gather a small ball of lint. Then, rub this lint ball across the screen, as it will attract the leftover lint. Keep going until you can see through the screen without any blockages. Toss the gathered lint in the trash.Instead of your hand, rubbing a cleaning brush across the surface of the screen will gather the lint just as well. However, just make sure to discard the lint pulled from the screen, as it could present a fire hazard.Placing a vacuum brush attachment against the screen is another way to remove the lint.

, After you’ve pulled the screen out all the way, remove the extra lint and then run it under some water in the sink. If the screen is especially dusty, apply a bit of soap to the surface as well. Keep rinsing until the screen is clean and clear.It is not necessary to complete the step after each load, but it is a good idea to do a rinse every few weeks. This is especially the case if you use dryer sheets, as they can leave a residue on the screen’s surface.

, While the screen is out, peer into the lint trap. If you see any extra lint or debris, get out the extended vacuum attachment. Stick this attachment into the trap area, turn it on, and remove any materials present. Taking this extra step may prevent a clog from forming in the trap area., Before you place a fresh load into the dryer, make sure to fully clean the screen and trap. This will help to keep lint and debris from making its way further into the machine. It might be easy to ignore the practice for smaller loads, but continue with it regardless of load size."

Prepare your Seasoning Area.,
Wash your Dutch oven, if necessary.,
Use a towel to dry out your Dutch oven.,
Wrap a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.,
Select your grease.,
Grease the Dutch Oven.,
Apply vegetable shortening to the outside and inside of your Dutch oven and lids, if necessary.,
Place Dutch Oven in oven.,
Leave the Dutch oven in the grill or stove for 45 to 60 minutes.,
Turn the oven or grill off.,
Rub off any residual shortening with a towel, if desired.",How to Season a Dutch Oven," Ideally, do this outside because the process may produce a lot of smoke. If you must season indoors, be sure to take precautions such as turning on the oven fan and opening windows.;
, You need to get the Dutch oven to a point that it has no baked-on food particles, and the surface is free of encrustations. A Dutch oven used on a fire may have a lot of soot, so take care with your hands, surfaces, and clothing.


If you need to use soap, use just a little, mild dish soap, and rinse well. (If you do not, the taste of soap may stay in the cast iron seasoning and take a long time to get out...yuck!)
Steel wool will work well, but may cause some areas to discolor.
Only use power-abrasives such as polishing power tools for Dutch ovens in extremely bad shape.

, Again, if it has been used on a fire, it is likely to be sooty. Turn it over so all water possible evaporates before seasoning.

, Seasoning a Dutch oven will likely cause oil to drip, and this will protect your oven. Be sure the sheet is larger than the base of your Dutch Oven.


Place the cookie sheet on the lowest shelf in the oven.

, There is a lot of debate over the best oil to season cast iron. Whatever you choose, make sure it is not rancid or the taste will stay in your cast iron a long time. The top seasoning oils are:


Vegetable oil
Lard
Vegetable shortening
Olive oil
Do not use butter--it will burn rather than season.

, With a rag or paper towel, generously lube up your cast iron with food-grade safe oil, inside and out. You do not need to do the handle.

, Use a paper towel or rag to spread the oil.

, Turn heat onto 350F/(176.67 C). Place the Dutch oven upside down. You want the oil to fall out of the pot, which will create an even coating on the surface rather than collecting at the bottom of the pot

, Although this is generally a safe kitchen activity, monitor for smoking or other issues.

, Let the Dutch oven sit for 15 to 25 minutes at least. When seasoning a Dutch oven, you want to give the oil a chance to set. Handle the Dutch oven with mitts or other hand coverings, as it will be hot.You can also wait until the oven cools down to room temperature, if you wish. There is no rush here.

, This will also bring out the dark shine of a freshly seasoned Dutch oven. This is how the interior should look when the cast iron Dutch oven is primed for cooking. The exterior does not really matter--it can get dull and not affect cooking.

It is necessary to cut off the electricity to your dryer at this point, as you will be moving the machine around and possibly opening up some of the interior panels., Shimmy the dryer away from the wall and look at the back of the machine. Locate the exhaust hose and loosen it from dryer by loosening the outward “o-ring” clamp. You may be able to simply squeeze the clamp to remove it, but other styles require that you use a screwdriver to loosen a bolt at the center of the clamp. Pull the hose away from the dryer and from the wall port.Make sure to loosen the clamps on both sides of the hose prior to trying to remove it. Otherwise, you could damage the connection to the port and make it more difficult to replace afterwards.Most clamps require a flathead screwdriver for the bolt.
You may want to call in an appliance professional if your dryer connection is older and connected to gas. Moving around the machine could cause gas leaks., Once the hose is fully removed, take it to a well-lit area and look inside. You will likely see lint balls of various sizes. Take a cleaning brush and gently wipe off the interior. Or, stick your vacuum attachment inside and suck out the lint. Set the newly cleaned vent aside., Purchase a vent cleaning rod or kit at your local home improvement store. This kit will contain a brush attached to an extended arm that is then connected to a drill or used alone. Following the package’s directions, slowly feed the brush into the vent. Continue to gently push, rotating as needed, until you’ve cleaned the entire inside of the vent.Rotate and spin the brush multiple times in order to get the most lint out. Also, pull the brush out of the vent entirely multiple times and clean off any accumulated lint before reinserting it.

, Get behind the dryer and place the exhaust hose back into position. Use a screwdriver or your hand to tighten the clamps. Plug your dryer back in and check to see if any hot air is escaping from the sides of the vent. If so, check your clamps once again. If not, push your dryer back into position against the wall., Locate your vent on the outside of your home. It should be a square exit point covered by a plastic or metal screen. Remove the screen and set it aside. Reach inside the vent with your hand and gather any lint sitting nearby. Then, use a small vacuum or brush to clean out the lint a bit deeper inside.

Sprinkle baking soda on a cool oven.,
Apply water to the baking soda.,
Leave the damp baking soda overnight.",How to Use Baking Soda for Stubborn Oven Stains1," Remove any oven racks, thermometers, or other removable elements from your cooled oven. Then apply baking soda to all stained surfaces of your oven’s interior, paying particular attention to thick or greasy stain areas.


Make sure that if you have used your oven recently, it is turned off and completely cooled before cleaning it with baking soda.
Apply the baking soda liberally, up to ¼ inch thick in areas that are stained.For the sides and top surfaces of the oven where you can’t easily sprinkle on baking soda, add enough water to the baking soda to make a paste that can be spread on to the oven surface.;
, Lightly pour or spray water from a spray bottle onto the baking soda-covered surfaces of your oven. Use enough water to fully saturate the baking soda.A spray of water should be enough for a light layer of baking soda, while pouring on water may be needed for a thicker coating. The goal is for a paste-like consistency, with no dry powder but no pooled water either.
You may also spritz plain white vinegar over the baking soda with a spray bottle. Take care if using this method, as the combination of vinegar and baking soda creates a chemical reaction that can be explosive in large quantities. Use only a spray bottle for vinegar in this case., Allow the dampened baking soda coating to sit undisturbed in your oven. Wait for at least 12 hours or overnight before removing it.


You can spritz the baking soda with water again if you find it has become dry, but otherwise you can leave the mixture alone until the next day.
You’ll find that the damp baking soda turns black or brown as it picks up the grease and stains from your oven. If you used a vinegar spray, the mixture will bubble. These signs are normal and show the effect of the baking soda in picking up food stains.

Remove and clean the racks.,
Spread the paste all over the oven.,
Let the paste sit.,
Scrub the oven.,
Wipe the oven and replace the racks.",How to Remove the Smell of Oven Cleaner," On top of smelling like grandma’s house and the holidays, the smell of vanilla can also act as a great mask for other odors. After you’ve cleaned your oven, there are two ways you can use vanilla to make it smell more pleasant:


Fill a small bowl with water and add one teaspoon (six ml) of vanilla extract or 10 drops of vanilla essential oil. Dip a cloth into the bowl and wring out the excess water. With the damp cloth, wipe down the insides of the oven, including the walls, bottom, roof, and the racks. Dip the cloth into the water often, and go over the entire oven a few times to spread the vanilla smell.Instead of wiping the oven down with vanilla, you can also bake the vanilla to get the smell into the appliance. Preheat the oven to 250 F (121 C). Fill a small baking dish with an inch (2.5 cm) of water and add in one teaspoon (six ml) of vanilla extract. Place the bowl in the oven and let it heat up for about an hour. Check on it every 15 minutes or so, and add more water as needed if there's a lot of evaporation going on.;
, Lemons are another miracle odor killer, and they’ll leave your kitchen smelling summer fresh and yummy. Not only that, but citrus itself is a great cleaner, so lemons will help loosen any leftover grease and buildup in your oven as well.Preheat the oven to 250 F (121 C). Cut two lemons in half and squeeze most of the juice into a baking dish. Add an inch (2.5 cm) of water, and place the lemon halves into the dish as well. When the oven is hot, place the dish on the rack and allow it to heat up for 30 minutes to an hour.

, Another similar method to remove chemical and food smells from your oven is to bake oranges.The citrus in the orange has a similar cleaning power to lemons, and it will also make your house smell fresh and clean.


Preheat your oven to 250 F (121 C). Peel an orange with your fingers or a knife and set the flesh aside for eating or juicing. Place the peels on a baking sheet and bake them for 30 minutes to an hour. After an hour, turn off the oven and open the oven door slightly to allow the citrus smell to escape.You can use any citrus for this, or a combination, such as lemons, limes, and grapefruits.

, You don’t need a strong commercial cleaner to clean your oven, and can actually make your own cleaning paste with stuff found in the kitchen and bathroom. There are several cleaning products you can make, including:


A mixture of course salt and lemon juice. Mix a half cup (146 g) of course salt with a half cup (120 ml) of lemon juice.A simple baking soda paste. To make this, combine one-half cup (110 g) baking soda with enough water to make a paste.A baking soda soap mix. You can make this by combining a cup of baking soda (220 g) with a half cup (146 g) of coarse salt, plus one-quarter cup (60 ml) castile soap., To clean the racks, place a large towel down in a bathtub and place the racks on the towel (the towel will protect the tub from scratches). Cover them with hot or boiling water, then add in some of your homemade cleaner or dish detergent.


Allow the racks to soak for a couple hours before scrubbing them with a non-abrasive scrubbing pad to remove grease and food.When the racks are clean, empty the tub and rinse them with clean water. Replace the towel in the tub with a dry one, then stand the racks up on the towel to dry.

, Use your hand or a clean cloth to coat the inside of the oven with your cleaning paste. Rub it in as you work, and make sure you get the entire surface area coated., In order to break up grease and baked-on food, allow the paste to sit in the oven overnight, or for 12 hours if possible.If you don’t have that long to wait, let the paste sit for as long as possible before scrubbing.

, After the paste has had time to soak in, take a sponge with a non-abrasive scrubber attached and get it wet with warm water. If you don’t have this type of sponge, use a cloth and a separate scrubber. Wring out the excess water so the sponge is damp.Go over the interior of the oven with the sponge, scrubbing the areas that need extra work, and wiping off the paste as you go. Rinse out the sponge often with clean water.
Once you’ve wiped out the oven, spray it with white vinegar to activate any leftover baking soda or to get extra residue off, then wipe it down again with the sponge and clean water. , When all the paste residue, grease, and vinegar are gone, wipe the oven out with a clean, dry towel. Replace the racks and leave the door open to allow any excess moisture to dry.

After each metal detecting session, clean your coins with detergent and water.,
Tip the coins onto a tray and inspect them with a magnifying glass or jewelers loupe.,
Dry and accumulate the coins to rock tumble in a container with a lid.,
Use vinegar and salt for a quick and effective cleaning of your coins in the rock tumbler.,
Constantly monitor the condition of the rock tumbler drum because cleaning with vinegar creates a gas that could burst the rubber drum.,
Do your cleaning in three parts instead of one long session.,
Rock tumble the coins that require further cleaning.,
Redeem your severely corroded or damaged coins with the US mint (or other relevant national mint) when you have a large quantity of them.",How to Clean Metal Detected Coins," Whisk the coins in the detergent and water for a minute or two and drain the water. Rinse the coins with water.;
, Set aside coins that: do not require further cleaning or because they are valuable. The main examples of valuable coins are silver dimes and quarters, copper pennies, old coins, and unique coins and tokens.

, When you have a sizeable quantity of coins, rock tumble them with small gravel, sand, water, vinegar and salt.

, Dilute the vinegar with water to a ratio of 1:3 and add a dash of salt. 


Rock tumble pennies separately from nickels, dimes and quarters, because the pennies will put a pink stain on them.
Do not rock tumble nickels, dimes and quarters with tokens and foreign coins, even if the tokens and foreign coins have similar outward appearances.

, When the drum expands too much, stop the tumbling, open the drum cover to let out the gases, put the cover back on and resume rock tumbling.


Clean the seal, with a water soaked brush, of tiny bits of sand and gravel to prevent leakage. Do not clean the brush with water that goes into a drain, clean in a container of water (discard this container of water later outside).
Do not put sand and gravel in the drain––they will eventually cause a plumbing clog.
Settle on a mixture of vinegar and water that suits your monitoring of it. For example, with a ration of 1:3, you must stop the rock tumbling, let out the gases and clean the seal about three times. With a stronger vinegar and water mixture, you will have to clean the seal twice as much; cleaning the seal is time consuming.

, For example, the first session might be for just 30 to 45 minutes; after this, inspect your coins. Some of the coins might have required just a short cleaning because either they were not that dirty or more importantly, you might find a straggler silver or valuable coins that you missed in the initial cleaning. In general, silver and copper coins require very little cleaning, however this is not always the case. After the first rock tumbling session, the coins design and dates should be visible.

, For the a second time, clean for an hour.  Expect most of the coins to be clean and ready to be used after the second session.  For the few coins that require a third rock tumbling session, set them aside for future cleaning when you have accumulated more coins to make it worthwhile to swing in your coil.

, Store your corroded coins in a container with a tight-fitting lid to prevent future corrosion. Clean your mutilated coins enough so that they can be identified. After cleaning, treat your mutilated coins, in addition to storing them in a container with a tight-fitting lid, because they will be very susceptible to corrosion.

You can use a plastic or silicone spatula to gently remove paste that may have become hardened or stuck in a hard-to-reach place.Don’t worry about getting oven surfaces completely clean and dry in this step. Focus on removing the built-up food and residue and most of the baking soda paste.

, Spray down the oven surfaces with water and wipe away any remaining residue of food stains or baking soda with a damp or dry cloth. You can also spray white vinegar for this step before wiping down.


If using vinegar, spray it lightly onto any areas that have some remaining baking soda. The mixture will foam slightly from the resulting chemical reaction.
Make sure to remove all signs of baking soda as best as possible before using your oven again. Baking soda left in contact with a heating element tends to smoke badly when the oven is turned on., Apply more baking soda and water/vinegar to let sit if stubborn stains still persist after the first application. You can apply baking soda to just the location of the stain if necessary.


You can try applying baking soda directly to a wet sponge or other scrubbing material to rub right on the stain for removal. If scrubbing is unsuccessful, re-treat with the baking soda paste overnight.
Use another oven cleaning product if you wish, but the combination of baking soda, water, and 12+ hours to sit is typically effective for nearly all stubborn oven stains.

Use baking soda on the oven door.,
Clean oven racks with baking soda.,
Treat a stovetop in the same way.",How to Use Baking Soda for Stubborn Oven Stains3," Remove stains on the inner glass of your oven door by applying baking soda and water/vinegar in the same way as you would with the other surfaces. Remember to leave the mixture on overnight or for 12 hours.


Keep the oven door open and horizontal to best allow the damp baking soda to sit on stains.
You may want to spot-treat stains to use less water, or apply a premixed baking soda and water paste, to avoid the possibility of the mixture getting in between oven doors that have double panes of glass., Remove oven racks from the oven and lay them on a surface that is okay to get dirty. Sprinkle baking soda over the rack, spray on white vinegar, then let soak in hot water overnight.You can also scrub at the racks using baking soda and a wet sponge or toothbrush for smaller grates. It typically works best to soak before scrubbing.
You can try soaking oven racks in a bathtub protected by old towels. Allow them to sit submerged in hot water with ½ cup of dishwasher detergent for 4 hours or overnight. This will loosen grime and make scrubbing easier, or in some cases not even necessary.Make sure to wipe down the racks with a clean damp cloth once treated with baking soda, soaked, or scrubbed, to ensure they are free from any residue before placing them back in the oven.

, If you have a stove-top oven, you can clean the stove surface with baking soda in the same way you would the oven. Simply let baking soda and water/vinegar sit overnight and wipe down in the morning.


Remove grates if possible on a gas stove. Also note that you want to avoid allowing baking soda and water to drip down into the ignition area, so keep baking soda to a paste and apply carefully on gas stoves.
Remember to wipe down the cooking surface thoroughly with a clean damp cloth once the baking soda and grime is removed, then let dry. A glass-top electric stove will smoke easily from any baking soda residue or other moisture when it is turned on.

Use window cleaner on both panes.,
Slide the doors back together.,
Squeeze the top of the door together.,
Replace the screws.,
Shut and open your oven door to check for rattling.",How to Clean the Insides of a Double Pane Window in Your Oven Door," Wipe down the top, sides, and crevices around your oven door to remove crumbs or other food particles. You can use plain water or a cleaning wipe for this step., Mix baking soda into water until you have a paste. Put a thin layer of the paste onto areas with built on grease and around the edge of the double pane window. Allow the paste to dry for 10-15 minutes.If you need to thicken the mixture, add more baking soda.
If it’s too clumpy, add water.

, Lightly moisten the dried paste by adding a little water. You can either spray it on or sprinkle it on. Use a damp scrub sponge to work in the baking soda. As you scrub, move the baking soda mixture across the entire surface of the oven door. Rinse the sponge and continue scrubbing until you’ve removed the baking soda., As you spray the door, be sure to spray extra degreaser around the the edges of the window where grease can collect. Use a clean cloth or paper towels to work in the degreaser. If necessary, apply more product as you clean. Once the grease is removed, use a damp cloth to remove the remaining degreaser. Finally, dry the oven door with a clean, dry cloth.You can use a commercial degreaser, vinegar, or grease-cutting dish detergent.

, Your door will separate into two sides, and the outer side will just hang there.To keep it from getting damaged, balance your oven door on a flat surface like a chair.Make sure the chair is stable.


There will be a spring between most double-paned oven windows, so expect for the two panes to spring apart.
If your door does not pop open, gently run a kitchen knife along the edges. Then use the edge of the knife to pry the sides apart. Remember that the spring could still pop after you dislodge the inner pane, so keep hold of the door.Read over your manufacturer’s instructions for best results.

, Look at your oven door and locate the positions of the screws that hold the door together. You will need to remove the outer screws to get the two panes apart, but the inner screws below them can stay in place.You may discover that your oven’s window pane is attached with a different kind of screw that looks like it has a star in the middle. These are called torx screws. You can find an inexpensive screwdriver to fit the torx screws at your local hardware store. If you’re worried about finding a good fit, take a photo of it with your phone so that you can get a good match., Use the correct type of screwdriver to remove the screws. Be careful not to lose control of the screwdriver since it could scratch the glass. When you remove the screws, the door should pop open. It will look like you have two thin doors on your oven.Do not use the wrong kind of screwdriver to remove the screws. You could strip the screws or damage the window pane.

, Use a handheld vacuum or a vacuum hose to suck up the hard food particles that have collected between the inner and outer side of the door. Most oven doors will have a collection of crumbs at the bottom.If you don’t have a vacuum, then you can clean away the debris with a wet cloth or paper towel. It takes more time but is just as effective.

, Spray white vinegar onto the surface of each pane, or dampen a clean cloth with vinegar. Rub in the vinegar until no grease remains.The vinegar smell will evaporate, so don’t worry that your oven will stink.

, Clean the inside surface of both window panes with your usual window cleaner. Make sure to wipe it away carefully with a clean cloth to avoid streaking. If you leave streaks, they’ll be sealed back inside the door.For best results, use a microfiber cloth for a streak-free finish.

, Gently move the two sides of the door back into place. Make sure not to let go of either side. Remember that the spring is there, so they could pop back apart, risking damage to your door., Once the doors are back together, press them tightly together so that you can screw the inner side back into place., Put each screw back into place one by one. Tighten the screws with the appropriate screwdriver.Be careful not to over tighten them because you could strip the screws.

, To be sure that everything is back in place correctly, open and shut the oven door a few times to see if it moves like it should. If it doesn’t, take a look at it to make sure that you’ve put all of the screws back correctly and that the sides of the door are correctly fitted together.

Buy the right product.,
Choose a well-ventilated area.,
Coat the inside of the slow cooker.,
Wipe the inside clean.",How to Clean the Inside of a Slow Cooker1," While some manufactured cleaners meant for ovens and grills can be used on the inside of your slow cooker, be sure to read the warnings and directions before purchasing or using them. Check to make sure the product is safe to use on the material in question (in the case of a slow cooker, this is often aluminium).Look for items specifically labeled as non-abrasive cleaners, or simply use vinegar as a cleaner if you are in doubt.If you are unsure of the material used inside your slow cooker, contact the manufacturer or visit their website to find out, or consider an alternate method.
Be advised that many manufacturers do not include instructions for cleaning the inside of the cooker. Instead, they recommended professional servicing.;
, Expect the fumes from such cleaners to be toxic when inhaled and/or simply overpowering in smell. If possible, clean your slow cooker outdoors for the best air circulation. If this is not possible, choose a space with open windows, exhaust fans, and/or a strong cross-breeze.Although this is a general rule when using chemicals, it is especially important here, since you will be working directly over the item to be cleaned.

, First, remove the liner from your crockpot. Then spray the interior with cleaner. Check the product’s directions to find out how long you should allow the foam to sit before cleaning up.For especially dirty cookers, wait a while longer for the dirt and grime to absorb even more foam.

, Use a sponge, dishcloth, or similar soft material to wipe up the cleaner.If needed, scrub to remove any stubborn bits that haven’t fully detached from the walls.If scrubbing still doesn’t work, apply a second coat and repeat.


Be sure you have removed all traces of cleaner before using the cooker again. After wiping up the foam and dirt with a sponge, use paper towels to go over the inside again. Dry it thoroughly.

Rinse the cookware with warm water.,
Wash the cooking surface by hand.,
Use gentle soaps and scrubbers.,
Soak stubborn food stains to soften them.,
Rinse the clean cookware thoroughly.,
Allow cookware to dry completely.,
Allow the cooking surface to cool before washing.,
Handle Calphalon with care.,
Polish pots and pans with a special cleanser.,
Buff out small scratches.",How to Clean Calphalon," Hold dirty pots and pans under the stream and swish the water around inside. The heat and pressure of the water will help dislodge food particles clinging to the surface of the cookware. Try to rinse away as much stuck-on food as you can before you begin scrubbing.Cold water can lower the temperature of the cooking surface too quickly, potentially warping or weakening a piece of cookware.;
, Though some Calphalon products are technically dishwasher safe, it’s always preferable to hand wash nonstick surfaces to preserve their carefully tempered finish and luster. This will allow you to spot clean cookware and give it more delicate treatment.Go over the manufacturer’s recommendations for cleaning and caring for a particular piece of cookware.
Protecting the finish of your nonstick cookware is key to extending its lifespan.

, A mild liquid detergent like Dawn or Palmolive will work best, as these soaps don’t contain any harsh chemicals or astringent agents that might cause scratches. Along with liquid dish soap, you should scrub your Calphalon pots and pans with a non-abrasive sponge or soft-bristled dish brush.For an extra soft touch, a simple washcloth will also get the job done.
Stay away from steel wool, metallic brushes and anything else likely to ruin a piece’s finish.

, If your pots and pans are crusted with burnt or stuck-on residue, they may need a little extra treatment. Soaking the cookware will help the anodized aluminum release hardened food particles without the need for forceful scouring. Use hot water and leave the cookware to sit for 10-15 minutes, then hand wash as normal.For best results, add about a cup of distilled white vinegar to the bottom of the pots and pans before you soak them.
Because of their resilient finish, Calphalon pieces won’t require as much soaking as ordinary pots and pans.

, After soaking and scrubbing your pots and pans, be sure to wash away all traces of food and soap. Otherwise, these substances may dry on the cooking surface, creating an unsightly film. Shake off excess water and find a good place to hang or lay out the cookware to begin drying.If any remnants of food or oil remain in the piece after rinsing, it may be necessary to repeat the cleaning process.

, Pat your cookware dry with a clean, absorbent towel. You can also rest pots and pans upside down and leave them to air dry. Keep your cookware in a well-ventilated, open area while it dries to speed to process along. Afterwards, your Calphalon cookware will be as good as new!Don’t put away wet pots and pans with the lids on them, as this could potentially cause them to smell.
Stash Calphalon pieces in a vertical dish rack to help them drain while they dry.

, Give your cookware several minutes to return to a normal temperature. If you submerge a hot pan in cold water, it may cause the material to permanently warp or bubble.Always use warm or hot water to clean your Calphalon cookware.
Exposing heated cookware to cold water against the manufacturer’s instructions may void your product warranty.

, Though Calphalon is scratch-resistant and made to take a beating, too much consistent wear and tear can render its nonstick finish ineffective. Avoid dropping, banging or being overly rough with your cookware. If you take care of it, it’s guaranteed to last you a long time.Whenever possible, use plastic utensils instead of metal ones to prevent scratches.Never attempt to cut ingredients while they’re inside the pan.

, If your cookware starts looking dull after repeated use, a product like Calphalon Dormond Cleanser or Bar Keepers Friend can restore the finish to its original condition. These types of cleansers are formulated specifically for use on stainless steel and other nonstick surfaces, and can be useful for renewing smoothness and shine.Nonstick cleansers and polishes can leave behind a powdery residue if they’re not rinsed away completely., Buffing can improve the appearance of pieces that have just begun to display tell-tale silvery scratch lines. Using a heavy-duty Scotch-Brite scrubbing pad, rub the area around the scratch with a light circular motion until the worst of the damage disappears. Afterwards, treat the piece with a special nonstick cleanser and rinse it thoroughly.Rub along the grain of the pan to avoid causing further scratching or scuffing.
Severely scratched cookware should be thrown out and replaced. When nonstick surfaces become damaged, it’s possible for them to release toxic chemicals that can leach into food."

, Cover the floor underneath the stove with layers of newspaper. Read the cleaner instructions carefully, and apply as the manufacturer directed.

, Wear the gloves, and wipe the stove from the back to the front (wear old clothes and something to cover your hair). Rinse the sponge well between wipes. Use the oven cleaner with a scrub pad (and rubber gloves) to remove the formerly mentioned baked on crud under the stove top. Use a good quality degreaser product (like Simple Green) to remove any residue left. For stubborn spots, spray until soaked and leave until later.

, Carefully open the garbage bag from yesterday with all the components (rubber gloves, again). Remove the smaller pieces first, and wash in the bucket with a scouring pad. Grease should just fall off. Rinse in clear water, and let dry. If any plastic pieces appear dulled by the process, spray on a little Armor All or similar product, allow it to dry and buff it out. The racks may be a little tougher, but perseverance will pay off.

, Again, wipe down any residue and check to make sure the burners and oven work. It probably looks better than it did when you leased the place, and should make an impression on your landlord and get you back a couple of hundred dollars.

Read your owner's manual.,
Use a nylon scrubber brush while the grill is still hot.,
Clean the underside of the grill.",How to Clean Grill Grates1," Porcelain coating is very fragile and easily damaged from scrubbing and scraping. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to the letter. Otherwise, you could void your warranty., Avoid a brass brush, which can scrape the coating off the grate. Opt for a curved brush that can get in between the grating. Gently scrape in a diagonal motion. Start at the point closest to you and move upward. Move in one direction to minimize the risk of damage to the coating.

If you have built-up gunk like barbecue sauce, wet the brush before scrubbing., Flip the grill over after it has cooled. Scrape away excess food and gunk with the brush using a diagonal motion. The underside will take somewhat longer to clean because of the drippings that accumulated during cooking. Scrub until the grate is completely clean.

If your grate comes in multiple sections, flip and clean each part separately."

Check to make sure nothing is left inside of the oven before you begin cleaning., You may have a lot of burnt food and build-up in your oven. Try to remove as much of the loose build-up as possible before applying the baking soda. Use a plastic or silicone spatula to scrape off the loose matter. You don’t have to remove it all—just remove what is already loose or nearly loose.







, Mix ½ cup (170 g) of baking soda with 3 tablespoons (14.8 mL) of water in a small bowl. Stir the mixture until it forms a paste that can be easily spread. Adjust the amount of water used if 3 tablespoons does not create a spreadable paste.







, You can spread the paste by hand if you’re wearing rubber gloves. If that doesn’t work for you, you can also spread the paste with a clean spatula. Coat the interior of the oven with the paste. Do not apply the paste to the heating elements.








It’s okay if the paste turns brown or is chunky in some areas of the oven.

, The paste works best if you allow it to sit overnight or for 12 hours. If you don’t have that much time, you can let the paste sit for 40 minutes. You may have to repeat the process for a deep clean if you let it sit for a short amount of time, however.







, Use a damp cloth to wipe off the paste after you’ve let it sit. Use warm water to dampen the cloth. You may have to firmly scrub to get most of the paste off.







, You may have trouble getting all of the paste off with a damp cloth. If that’s the case, use a spatula to get the rest of the paste off of the oven. There may be some leftover residue, but that’s okay because you will use vinegar to remove it.







, Pour white vinegar into a spray bottle. Spray the vinegar over the areas where residue remains from the paste. The vinegar will cause the baking soda to foam up.







, Use a damp cloth to wipe off the foamy areas of the oven. If residue remains, use more vinegar and then wipe again. Continue to wipe until your oven is clean.







, Sprinkle baking soda over the oven racks. Then, pour or spray white vinegar onto the racks. The baking soda should begin to foam. When that happens, submerge the racks into a tub or hot water. Allow the racks to sit in the water overnight.







, Once you are finished cleaning, put the oven racks back into the oven. You can also put back in whatever you’ve taken out of the oven. Your oven is now ready for use.

Ask a parent or other adult to help you do it. Easy Bake Ovens are recommended for children over 8.Never, ever use a plugged in oven around water.;
, Put the oven on a towel when cleaning it so you don’t get the floor wet. You might want to clean it outside on a patio or sidewalk.


Don’t forget to clean the other parts of the oven, such as the spatula, cupcake pan, and baking pan. The toymaker recommends that you hand-wash and dry all pans and tools before using them for the first time and after baking.The Easy Bake Oven works by putting baking mix on a tray you insert with a plastic spatula into the baking compartment on the side of the oven., You probably won’t need to take the oven apart for cleaning. In fact, most pieces of the oven are not supposed to be removed. Instead, try covering the baking pan with aluminum foil when baking to reduce the chances of spills.


You can’t use a regular screwdriver to take apart the Easy Bake Oven. You do use a standard Phillips screwdriver to take off the panel at the bottom of the oven in order to change the lightbulb.The other parts of the oven are not designed to be removed. That’s why the screws won’t work with most common household screwdrivers. You would need a specialized screw driver to take the other pieces of the oven apart.

, You need to gather something to use when wiping the oven. There are many different things you can use to wipe off an Easy Bake Oven.


Easy Bake Ovens can be cleaned with basic tissues. Or you could use a dry washcloth, paper towels or other rag.
You might need a long, thin tool to reach inside the baking compartment to knock off crusted food. Then you could turn the oven upside down to shake it out. You could use a chopstick for this purpose.You could also use a Q-tip to reach into the oven to dislodge any chunks of food inside it. , You can easily clean an Easy Bake Oven with a little bit of water and a dash of soap. You don’t need much soap or water to clean an Easy Bake Oven. It’s not like a conventional oven. Don’t douse the oven with water! Instead you want to lightly apply the cleaning solution to the rag or tissue.


Or take some dish soap, and mix it with window/glass cleaner. Then dab this concoction onto your rag or tissue. You could try soap and water first, but if you’ve got tougher stains or old food stuck in the oven, you might want to try the other approach.
Take a wet towel, adding a little amount of dishwasher gel. Or add soap suds to the cloth. Wipe the inside and outside of the oven. Repeat this several times.

, Cleaning the bottom of the Easy Bake Oven is easy. Soak it in diluted laundry detergent that you mix with a dash of water, and then spread out in a wet paste.


Leave the wet paste on the bottom of the oven for a couple of hours, depending on how greasy and dirty it is.
Spray the oven with the same mix diluted to spray or with 20 Mule Team Borax, which can also be used in place of laundry detergent. Be sure to rinse well. You could also try using Clorox wipes. Clorox wipes are great to clean with, as well as magic erasers.

, If you desire a chemical-free option, replace the dish soap with white vinegar in an equal mix with water.


Spray the vinegar. Put a little vinegar in a spray bottle and spritz everywhere.
Another chemical-free option is to use lemon juice to clean the oven. Lemon juice will make it smell good and, if you add a bit liquid soap to the lemon juice, it will help to remove stains.

, Only adults should use this. Spray the oven cleaner by holding it a little ways away from the oven. You don’t want to get it in your eyes.


Leave the oven cleaner for 25-30 minutes. Then, simply wipe the cleaner off your oven, and it should be clean.
Or make a baking soda paste. In a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water. Adjust the ratio of both as needed until you have a spreadable paste. Coat your oven. Spread the paste all over the interior surfaces of the Easy Bake Oven. Let it sit overnight, and then wipe it clean.

, Dip a clean rag into hot water, and wipe off the Easy Bake Oven. The goal is to remove any soapy residue from the oven.


You may need to repeat this process several times, rinsing out your rag each time.
Stop when you see no remaining streaks of detergent, soap, or any other cleaning product that you used on the oven.

, Once you’ve wiped the oven with the soapy mixture, and cleaned it off with the water, you need to dry the oven.


Wipe the oven with a dry towel to remove the moisture. You could also use paper towels to dry off the oven.
Remember to dry both the outside and the inside of the Easy Bake Oven. You could also use a dry rag. If you live in a warm climate, you could let it sit outside for a time to dry it.

Opt for a stainless steel grill brush.,
Keep the grill hot.,
Scrub the grate.,
Apply vegetable oil to the grate.",How to Clean Grill Grates2," The bristles are soft enough to protect the surface of the grate. Choose between a roll brush or a straight brush. Both will clean the grill effectively, but the roll brush will more easily clean the sides of the grates., This will soften any leftover grease and make it easier to clean up. Turn the grill to its “high” setting if it's not at that setting already. Let it heat up for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the temperature gauge reaches 500 to 600 °F (260 to 316 °C). Then, turn off the burners., Scrub using a back-and-forth motion along the first bar. Continue until the bar is free of grease and food particles. Repeat the process on the rest of the grate., Dip the towel into a container of the oil to pick up about a teaspoon (5 mL). Place the towel in a pair of tongs and wipe it along each bar. This will prevent your grate from rusting.

Don't apply more than a teaspoon of oil. Too much can cause a dangerous flare-up if it drips onto any smoldering food particles below the grate."

Turn on the oven's self-cleaning mode.,
Open the oven door.,
Clean the oven door.,
Clean the oven racks.",How to Clean the Oven1," There are a few standard types of ovens, and they each require slightly different cleaning methods.


Self-cleaning ovens have a feature that allows you to heat the oven to such a high temperature that the built up food and grease gets turned to ash.
Textured ovens, or continuous cleaning ovens, have a porcelain layer that is designed to burn spilled food away while you are using your oven to bake.
Regular ovens without these cleaning features must be cleaned regularly by hand.

, Choose a time to clean the oven when your kitchen area is at its least active.


Keep children and pets away from the kitchen while the oven is cleaning, since it heats to a very high temperature and tends to give off a burning smell.
Open your windows to ventilate the kitchen, so your family won't be inhaling the fumes.

, Place them in a sink full of warm water mixed with a few drops of dishwashing liquid to soak.

, This should lock the oven door and heat the oven to between 800 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit (427 and 482 degrees Celsius).


Make sure the oven door is locked before leaving the oven to clean. If the lock isn't working, put masking tape or some other kind of barrier on the oven door so your family knows it is not to be opened.
The oven will clean itself for 2 to 6 hours, during which the grease and burnt food will turn into a light gray ash.
Let the oven cool for at least 2 hours following the cleaning cycle.

, Sweep out the ashes with a small brush and dustpan. Wipe the oven clean with a wet rag.

, Scrub the inside of the oven door with a clean rag and a misting of a kitchen cleaning product. You can also use a vinegar and water solution to do the job.

, Scrub the oven racks in the soapy water. Rinse them off and dry them, then replace them in the oven.

Clean the oven racks.",How to Clean the Oven3," Place them in a sink full of warm water mixed with a few drops of dishwashing liquid to soak.

, Load a 1-liter spray bottle with 4 tablespoons (56.7 g) of baking soda and fill the rest with water. Shake the spray bottle to moisten and dissolve the baking soda.

, Spray the interior of a cold oven, focusing on the charred and stained areas, until the carbon is completely saturated.


For particularly dirty ovens, increase the ratio of baking powder to water so that you have more of a paste than a liquid. Spread the paste all over the charred areas.

, After an hour, test to area to see if the charred part has loosened.


If it's still hard as a rock, douse it again with baking soda solution and allow it to sit for another hour.
If it's loose enough to chip off, proceed to the next step.

, The type of scraper you would use to chip ice and snow off your windshield works well. Keep scraping until most of the carbon is gone.


Wear rubber gloves if you don't want your hands to get black from the soot.
Spray the area with more baking soda solution as you go to make the loosening process easier.
Sweep out the debris you chipped off. Use a small brush and dustpan.

, Allow it to soak in for an additional hour, then use a scrubber to remove the remaining carbon.

, At this point the interior of your oven should be clean. If caked-on carbon remains, try the following alternative methods:


Use an industrial-strength oven cleaner. These contain chemicals that may be harmful to breathe, so use with caution. They typically instruct you to let the solution soak into the charred sections and then scrub out the oven.
Use ammonia. Pour it on the caked-on areas and let it sit for thirty minutes before scrubbing it off with a scrubber and then wiping with a damp sponge.

, Scrub the oven racks in the soapy water. Rinse them off and dry them, then replace them in the oven.

Remove the racks from your oven.,
Activate the oven’s self-cleaning cycle.,
Leave the room.,
Wipe away remaining residue by hand.",How to Clean a Convection Oven1," Before you get started, be sure to slide out the removable racks arranged in the center of the oven. This will get them out of your way and give you more room to work comfortably. It will also make the racks themselves easier to clean separately later on.Scour the oven racks in the sink using hot water, liquid dish soap and an abrasive sponge or scrubbing brush.
If your oven’s racks have seen a lot of drips and spills, you can soak them while the oven is cleaning itself to loosen whatever residue happens to be clinging to them.;
, Program your oven to the desired time and temperature setting. Make sure the oven door is completely shut and locked before initiating the cleaning process. Otherwise, heat and noxious fumes may escape into your kitchen and spread through the rest of your home.Self-cleaning ovens use extreme temperatures to burn food particles off of their smooth interior surfaces.Do not use any other chemicals or cleaning products in your oven while running the self-cleaning feature.

, Because of the intense heat generated during the oven’s self-cleaning cycle, it’s best not to be around while cleaning is in progress. Set a separate timer or use the countdown on the oven display to let you know when it’s finished cleaning.Keep small children and pets out of the kitchen while the oven is being cleaned. The fumes released as chemical residues and burnt food are incinerated can be dangerous.If possible, keep the doors and windows open, and exhaust fans on to provide proper ventilation to the room.
Self-cleaning ovens typically take between 2-4 hours to complete a full cycle.

, After the self-cleaning cycle has ended, open the oven door to release excess heat. Give the oven a few minutes to cool down to a safe temperature before cleaning out the inside. At this point, you can simply use a damp cloth or paper towel to lift away the ash that’s settled at the bottom of the oven. It’s that easy!The inside of the oven door can be doused with an all-purpose cleaner or liquid dish detergent and scrubbed separately."

Turn the oven off, and leave it off for at least 20 minutes if it has recently run. Higher heat will not help you clean – it usually just dries out the food and causes it to stick to the stovetop.






;
, Using your fingers, a paper towel, soft cloth, or a gentle sponge, get off as much as you can before you start scrubbing. This will help lower the risk for scratches and pits during the cleaning process.








, For tough, large food debris that’s clinging to the stovetop, use a silicone spatula to loosen it. Rub the spot with the spatula in small circular motions until the food stops coming off the stove.







, Hardware stores and some grocery stores will carry cleaners specifically designed for a glass top stove. Some products are available as a pourable liquid, while others come in a spray bottle. Choose whichever type of product you prefer., Apply the cleaner liberally. Pour or spray the product onto various areas across the stove, focusing particularly on areas where you can see or feel grease build-up







, Use a non-abrasive scrubbing pad to rub the cleaner into the grease and stuck-on food. If you need extra scrubbing power, use the edge of a silicone spatula to scrape at the burnt-on food.







, Use a paper towel or a microfiber cloth to wipe up the excess cleaner and buff the stove. You may need to swap the towel out for a fresh one if it becomes saturated. Polish the stove until it's dry and shines enough for you to see your reflection.







, Create a sudsy, soapy mixture to dip your towel into. Soap chemically reacts with oils to break them up and make them easier to remove, and hot water will help to speed up the process.







, A microfiber towel is gentle enough to clean your glass top stove without scratching the stove’s surface. Let the towel soak until it’s saturated with the soapy mixture. Make sure that the towel is big enough to cover the whole stove, and if it’s not, use two towels.







, You can just sprinkle it over the stained area, or you can sprinkle it across the entire stove top for a more thorough clean.







, Take the towel out of the soap mixture and wring the excess water out. The towel should be damp enough to moisten the baking soda, but not so wet that you create puddles on the stove top.







, The towel should lay flat over any areas with baking soda to prevent it from drying out as it sets into the leftover cooking debris. Wait 15-30 minutes before removing the towel to give it ample time to soak into the most stubborn stuck-on food.







, Once the time is up, scrub in a circular motion for the best results, picking up all of the weakened bits of food on your stove. The baking soda will act as a gentle scrub to remove any remaining residue.








, Use another dry, clean microfiber towel to wipe away any extra residue and to dry and buff your stovetop. If there are still areas with stuck-on food or oil, repeat the baking soda process until they’re gone.







, The longer you allow food spills to sit on your stove top, the more likely they are to harden and become difficult to remove. If you’re worried you’ll forget to return once the stove is cool, set a timer for 20 or 30 minutes once you’re done cooking.







, Create the same soapy solution as above (a bowl of warm water with a few drops of mild dish soap) and use a non-abrasive scrubber to wipe up food and oil.Doing this once a week will help you keep up with the cleaning and avoid grease build-up.

, If your glass stove top has streaks or water spots after cleaning, wipe the stove down with a soft cloth doused with 1-2 tablespoons of vinegar.You can also use a regular glass-cleaning product as well.

Wipe it down with cooking oil and towels.,
Scrub with mild soap and warm water.,
Use salt for tougher crud.,
Use special tools if needed.,
Scour off any rust.",How to Clean a Cast Iron Dutch Oven1," If the cast iron isn’t all that dirty and you use it a lot, simply pour in enough cooking oil to coat the insides. Then use cloth or paper towels to wipe away any loose bits of food. Use fresh paper towels to wipe away any excess oil. If it looks clean after that, that’s all you need to do, so call it a day!Cast iron becomes sterilized once it reaches 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), which should only take a couple minutes the next time you use it.However, if you don’t use your Dutch oven frequently, it’s a good idea to give it a more thorough wash than this. The cooking oil may turn rancid after a few days of non-use.;
, Wet a sponge with warm water. Add a few drops of mild dish soap. Scrub off all traces of food and then rinse thoroughly with plain warm water.A popular myth is that you should never, ever use soap on cast iron. Manufacturers definitely advise against using strong detergents, scouring pads, and dishwashers, but handwashing with mild soap is fine., To remove more stubborn bits of food that have scorched to your Dutch oven, shake some salt into it. Then place it on a burner and turn the heat to high. Use cloth or paper towels to scrub the abrasive salt around to loosen and dislodge the scorched bits. Then repeat either Step 1 or 2 to remove the salt and loosened crud.The heat from the burner should also help loosen the crud as you work. However, cast iron heats up pretty quickly, so switch the burner off after a minute or two (or less if it feels too hot to handle safely).
Wiping more cooking oil over the cruddy bits can also help loosen them as it heats up.

, For especially tough crud, pick up some tools specifically designed for cleaning cast iron. Scrub your Dutch oven with steel mesh instead of a sponge or towels.If you think that might be a little too abrasive, pick up some plastic scrapers so you can chip away at burnt food.

, Expect prolonged exposure to water to rust your Dutch oven pretty quickly. If your cast iron develops any, use steel mesh or fine-grade sandpaper to scrub it off.If the rusted area was relatively minor, rinse it with warm water, dry it off, and then wipe it with cooking oil.If the rust returns soon afterwards, or if the affected area was pretty large, you will need to reseason your Dutch oven.

Mix the juice from one lemon with about a cup of water.,
Microwave the mixture.,
Wipe out the microwave.,
Wipe the microwave down with a clean rag and admire.",How to Clean a Microwave With a Lemon," Citric acid is a natural, and powerful, cleaner. When mixed with water, you dilute it enough to make it easily applied and to your microwave.









Squeeze the juice into a microwaveable dish or container and mix with roughly 300ml (1 1/4 cups) of water.
In a pinch, white vinegar can be easily substituted, though it doesn't smell quite as appealing.;
, Place the container in the microwave and put the power on max for 5-10 minutes. This allows the steam to condense on the walls and roof of the oven.









If the dish starts running out of liquid, you can stop the microwave and move on. This may only take 2-3 minutes depending on the strength of your microwave.
If you have a microwave with automatic venting, it may take a long time to get noticeable condensation ,or the vapor may not condense at all. Some microwaves are designed to vent the air inside to prevent vapor buildup. If this trick hasn't worked after 10 minutes of microwaving water, it probably isn't going to work at all.

, Once the time is up, carefully remove the bowl. Grab a soft dishcloth and wipe that microwave out with unparalleled ease. Dip the cloth in some clean water and ring it out, then wipe everything down with one last clean sweep.








, Your kitchen will also smell fresh and clean.For best results, repeat this every few months, or whenever your microwave gets nasty. This works because the steam from the water moistens and loosens the cooked, dry food-splatter particles. The lemon imparts a delicious, fresh aroma.

Smear the baking soda mixture over the inside of the oven.,
Let the mixture sit for several hours.,
Scrub the oven thoroughly.,
Wipe out the oven with clean water.",How to Clean a Convection Oven2," Shake one cup of baking soda into a large container and add enough water to thicken it. Pour in the water gradually, stirring as you go. The resulting mixture should be roughly the same consistency as cake icing.The exact measurements aren’t important—the baking soda paste just needs to be thick enough to stick to the walls of the oven.
Should you happen to be running low on baking soda, you can also use a combination of cream of tartar and hydrogen peroxide., Use a spatula, soft sponge or similar implement to spread the paste in a thin layer over every accessible surface. You can apply the baking soda mixture more freely in areas with heavy grease stains or crusty, stuck-on buildup.Don’t forget to cover the top of the oven as well.
Keep the baking soda mixture away from the internal fans and heating elements.

, As it sets up, the baking soda will begin to break down stubborn residue so that it can be wiped away with little difficulty. The paste should remain in place for a minimum of one hour. Leave the oven door closed.For best results, allow the paste to sit overnight, or between 8-12 hours.If you’re dealing with particularly troublesome messes, spray the baking soda paste with a small amount of vinegar. This will produce a natural chemical reaction that will help dissolve hardened grime., Using a damp cloth or abrasive kitchen sponge, go over the inside of the oven from top to bottom. Following the baking soda treatment, any remaining food particles should come right off.Dig in and be persistent to chip away at lingering messes.
Apply additional baking soda and water (or vinegar) and continue spot-cleaning as needed until the oven is pristine.

, Now that the worst of the mess has been lifted, you'll want to make sure that no traces of either baking soda or loose residue is left behind. Wet a second cloth and use the fresh water to rinse out the oven. Repeat once more using a clean towel to wick up standing water, or leave the oven door open to allow it to air dry.Wring out the wet cloth occasionally to clear it of dirty water.
Turning the oven on to a low temperature for a few minutes will help it dry faster.

Wipe out the inside of the oven.",How to Clean a Convection Oven3," Apply the solution generously, focusing on areas with the thickest buildup or discoloration. While spraying the oven cleaner, be careful not to let it come into contact with your eyes or skin—this may cause severe irritation.Traditional oven cleaning products are often formulated using toxic chemicals. For your own protection, wear a pair of thick rubber kitchen gloves, keep your nose and mouth covered and work in a well-ventilated space to minimize your exposure to fumes.If you own a fume hood, use it.
Remove all objects nearby, including pots and pans, cooking utensils and kitchen storage containers, to avoid getting oven cleaner on them.

, Close the oven door to prevent fumes from leaking out. Set a timer for half an hour and relocate to another room of the house to wait for the time to pass.The powerful chemicals in commercial oven cleaners can melt through hardened messes more effectively than most other solutions.

, Work carefully and make sure you’ve removed every last trace of both oven cleaner food residue. Turn on the ventilation hood or overhead fan while you clean so the chemical fumes are not overpowering. By the time you’re done, your oven will sparkle like it’s never been used before!


Use a disposable cloth or sponge to wipe out the oven and throw it away once the project has been completed.
In general, chemical oven cleaners should only be employed when other methods don’t produce satisfactory results. After deep-cleaning your oven, try to maintain it using gentler natural ingredients."

, Dip a sponge in the cleaning solution and use it to wipe the inside of the microwave. Remove the spin tray and wipe the base of the microwave until all the spots and stains have been removed. Wipe the vents of the microwave oven from the inside to remove any gunk that has collected there.









Make sure the microwave is unplugged while you work.
Soak tough stains and spots in the window cleaner solution for 5 minutes before scrubbing them away.
Make sure the upper shelf and ceiling get wiped down, since food tends to splatter onto the top of the microwave.

, After the inside is sparkling clean, soak a clean rag in fresh water and wipe it out completely. Make sure to clean up all of the residue left by the window cleaner, since it contains chemicals you don't want in your food next time you use the microwave. Go over it one more time with a clean, dry rag.









If a few tough spots remain, using a cloth soaked in olive oil to clean them.
Be careful what other cleaning products you use inside your microwave. For example, you should not use pre-soaked scrubbing pads inside the microwave because the loose particles will catch fire and explode your microwave.
Using unsafe chemicals can also cause the unit to catch fire or cause other safety hazards. Stick to window cleaner or a natural solution like vinegar or lemon juice.

, Leave the unit to dry after wiping it out with a clean rag. Smell inside the unit to see if it is safe to use. If you smell window cleaner, take a clean rage soaked in fresh water and wipe it out again.

Prevent moisture from building up during storage.",How to Clean a Cast Iron Dutch Oven2," Expect wet cast iron to start to rust pretty quickly. If you used any water to wash it out, wipe it dry immediately. To really ensure that all moisture has been removed, heat it in the oven or on the stovetop until all traces of water have evaporated.This is only necessary for water, not cooking oil. Cooking oil will actually act as a barrier to water.

, Give your Dutch oven a quick reseasoning. Wipe it down with a light application of more cooking oil. Then wipe up any excess with fresh paper towels. Set the Dutch oven on a burner, set the heat to high, and let it heat up until it starts to smoke a little bit.It should only take a couple minutes to start smoking at high heat.

, Always store your Dutch oven and its lid separately. Allow air to circulate inside it when it’s not in use. For double protection, stuff a few sheets of paper towels inside so they absorb any moisture that might accumulate during humid weather."

Regularly change your water.,
Save the pots and pans for last.,
Dry your dishes.,
Check your dishes to make sure they are clean.,
Rinse out your brush, sponge or rag.,
Turn your gloves inside out to dry.",How to Wash Dishes1," Wearing rubber gloves (although is optional) is highly recommended when washing dishes. They may be especially helpful if you have dry hands or another skin condition. If you're wearing long sleeves, roll them up or put them under the gloves. Aprons too, are optional.


Wearing rubber gloves will protect your hands from germs. Also, it will prevent your skin from drying out due to the constant scrubbing and exposure to water.;
, Dump all the large pieces of food into the compost bin or disposal. This will prevent your brush/sponge and drain from becoming clogged.








, Set the temperature as high as you can tolerate it without burning yourself. The hotter the water, the better its sanitizing and grease-cutting properties will be. If the water is scalding, use rubber gloves to protect your hands. Once the sink is filled, add dish liquid.









Soak the bigger items - such as plates, mugs, and items caked with food - in hot water at the bottom of the sink. Later on, you will be able to clean them with ease.

, Since it goes into the mouth, it needs the cleanest, hottest water possible.









Plunge the dirty item underneath the hot water while vigorously scrubbing it.
Remove it from the water before examining it. If muck still remains, scrub it with a sponge until it is clean.
If the muck is very difficult to get out, fill the item with water. Then, use your fingers (not your nails) to rub the muck off.
If this doesn't work, use the iron wool. Do not use the back of a sponge because that will cause morsels of food to stick to it.

, They will be able to benefit from the hot, clean water.








, This will clear away any germs and maintain a hygienic environment for washing dishes. Be sure to add more dish liquid every time you refill the sink.








, Since they are larger and may generally contain more residue, let them soak first. If anything was burnt or cooked in pots or casserole dishes, add a little extra soap and water into it before allowing it to soak.








, Lay them out on a rack to drain before drying them with a clean, dry towel.








, When clean, there should be no visible matter or feel of grease. Run a hand over the dish to ensure that it offers some resistance. If your fingers slide over the item too fluidly and without squeaking, there may be some grease remaining. You might consider rewashing the item.








, Allow to dry. It is recommended that you sterilize your equipment every so often by using boiling water or bleach. Likewise, throw it into the laundry or automatic dishwasher. When a sponge or brush starts to smell unpleasant and the smell cannot be removed by rinsing, throw it away.








, Peel them off so they are mostly inside out. Grab by the glove wrist. Blow into ""neck"" and choke it off like a balloon. Give it a squish till the fingers ""pop"" inside out. When the insides are dried, reverse it. The outsides can dry till they are ready to go for the next wash.

Check for leaking hoses.",How to Unclog a Dishwasher," Most of the supplies you'll need to break up dishwasher clogs can be found around your home. In the event that you need to purchase any supplies or replacement parts, do so at your local hardware store. For this project, you'll need:

Clean rag
Flashlight (optional; recommended)
Garden hose
Pan (to catch water and debris)
Pliers
Screwdriver
Wire coat hanger (optional);
, Unplug your dishwasher from the wall outlet. Dishwashers that are wired into your home's electrical supply may require you to remove a fuse from a fuse box or flip a breaker in the circuit breaker panel to ""Off"" to disconnect the power.Some fuse boxes may be poorly labeled. Verify power has been cut to your dishwasher by making sure it can't turn on after removing a fuse or switching off a breaker.

, The kickplate is a piece of metal or wood below the door of the dishwasher. Use a screwdriver to remove the fasteners connecting the kickplate if necessary. Once removed, set the plate off to the side and keep the screws where they won't be lost, like in a plastic baggie.


Depending on your dishwasher model, your kickplate may use different kinds of fasteners, like snap fasteners, which generally release when pulled firmly.
Some models of dishwasher may need to have the door open for you to be able reach the screws. After unscrewing, close the door and remove the kickplate., The drain hose usually ties into the sink drain. Behind the kickplate, locate the drain hose, which should run between the dishwasher pump and the drain. The dishwasher pump is usually located underneath the lower spray bar. The hose is generally made of flexible, thick, corrugated plastic.


Some dishwashers may be designed so that the drain hose runs between the pump and the air gap found at the top of the sink near the faucet or directly to a garbage disposal.The spray bar of most dishwashers looks like a thin strip of metal with jets on top. Some dishwashers may have a lower and upper bar, one for each inner basket.
You should notice a second hose alongside the drain hose. This is a recirculation hose, which may also have a blockage. Leave this hose for now and focus on the drainage hose., If the plastic shows signs of brittleness, cracking, or other kinds of deterioration, the hose should be replaced. Replace hoses with kinks, as well. Replacement parts can be found at your local hardware or appliance store.Kinks usually form in a hose when it is poorly supported. Use zip ties or a water resistant cord, like one made of nylon, to support areas of the hose that sag.
Some models may require a special hose or connector. These parts can be ordered from the manufacturer. Find information on ordering in your owner's manual.

, Place a shallow pan beneath the point where the hose connects to the dishwasher. To catch whatever might remain in the line, use things like baking sheets, paint trays, or casserole dishes.Keep a dry rag handy as you work. Water can make hardware slippery. Wipe wet hardware as necessary with your dry rag.

, Lay your flashlight so you can see where the hose connects to the pump. At this connection, there will be a wire clamp. Pinch this clamp with pliers to loosen it, then slide the clamp up the hose. Pull the hose free of the pump and remove it from underneath the dishwasher.You may need to wiggle the hose back and forth to loosen it before you are able to pull it free, particularly with older models.
Take the wire clamp off of the hose to prevent the clamp from being lost while unclogging it. Keep this in a safe place with the screws for the kickplate.

, Take the hose in your hands and bend it back and forth every few inches for the entire length of the hose. This will loosen severe blockages and may even resolve light clogs.

If you feel more resistance than usual when bending the hose, there is likely a blockage. Target these areas.
While you’re physically breaking up clogs, keep the end of your hose positioned over your drip pan or a bucket to catch anything that falls out., A directed stream of water should be able to flush out your clogs. Hold a garden hose to one end of your drain hose and turn on the water supply for the garden hose to eject blockages.


Faucets with similar pressure to a garden hose can be used in the same way as garden hoses. Hold one end of the drain hose to the faucet and turn it on full pressure to flush out blockages., Use pliers to straighten a wire coat hanger. When completely straight, pass the hanger through the hose and push it out through the other end. This technique is especially useful for severe blockages.Take care to completely straighten your coat hanger. Bent ends can catch on the corrugation of the drain hose, damaging it.

, The recirculation hose should be fastened to the pump in the same way as the drain hose. Position your catch pan, remove the hose, physically loosen the clogs, and apply flushing and snaking techniques as necessary., In the rare case that your blockage is too severe to be removed by flushing or wire hanger snaking, you may need to replace your hose. Replacement hoses can be bought at your local hardware store, home center, or by ordering them from the manufacturer in the fashion described in the dishwasher’s manual.


If there don’t seem to be any issues with your hose or if you’ve replaced it and it still drains poorly, the issue may be with the drain. In this case, you’ll likely have to unclog it., Use firm pressure to push hoses back onto the pump connections. Slide the wire clamps back up hoses to their original position at the hose/pump connection. Pinch clamps with your pliers until they are firmly fastened.

, After replacing the hoses, return power to the dishwasher and then run a normal cycle while it is empty. Watch it as it runs to verify everything that is properly connected and nothing is leaking.

If you notice any abnormal leakage while running your dishwasher, turn it off immediately and disconnect it from power.
Refasten the hoses that leak. Persistent leaking may be an indication you need to replace a hose."

Stop the machine and cancel the cycle.,
Grab several towels to soak up the suds.,
Remove all of your dishes.,
Use a small bowl or container and the remaining dry towels to remove excess water and soap suds from your dishwasher.If the water is very hot, throw in a tray of ice cubes to cool it down.,
Dry the bottom of the dishwasher with a towel.,
Run the rinse cycle for a few minutes.,
Pour ½ to 1 cup of vinegar inside your dishwasher.,
Sprinkle a layer of table salt over the soap suds.,
Add ice cubes to the mix.,
Pour a cup of olive oil into the bottom of your dishwasher to clear out the soap suds.,
Add a capful of liquid fabric softener to your dishwasher.",How to Remove Dish Soap from a Dishwasher," Once you realize dish soap has been added to your dishwasher, immediately stop the machine. If the soap suds haven’t started seeping out of the machine and all over your kitchen floor, then stopping it quickly will either keep that from happening or allow you to place towels on the floor to control the mess. Stopping the machine quickly will also keep the remaining dish soap from working its way through your dishwasher’s system. The dishwasher should start draining out once you cancel the cycle.;
, If suds have spilled onto your floor, grab several towels and start cleaning up the mess. You want to keep the mess from possibly causing water damage if it seeps behind your dishwasher or cabinets. You’ll also want to clear up the mess to keep yourself from slipping when you start cleaning out your dishwasher.

, Once the dishwasher has finished draining, open it, and take out all of the dishes you were trying to clean and place them in the sink. Getting them out of the way will make things easier once you start cleaning up the mess. There’s likely dish soap residue all over the dishes, and you need to get rid of as much leftover dish soap as you can in order to gain control of the overflowing soap suds.

, Remove as much water out of the dishwasher as possible. And then wipe the walls, top and bottom of the dishwater to get rid of any leftover suds and dish soap residue.


Make sure to wash out the soap dispenser thoroughly, if that's where you put the dish soap.
You can also use a wet-dry vacuum, if you have one, to suck out the water and soap suds. But make sure it is rated for wet pickup, and make sure to use only the wet filter.

, The heating coil may be very hot, so very carefully dry the bottom of the dishwasher as best you can to wipe away any remaining dish soap.

, Let the rinse cycle run for a few minutes to wash out the remaining dish soap. Soap suds may or may not continue to foam, depending on how effective you were at hand cleaning out the machine and how much dish soap was added to the machine.


If you have enough heavy, dry towels that you don’t mind suds continuing to spill out of your dishwasher, you can keep running the rinse cycle repeatedly until all of the dish soap washes out.But if you’d rather a quick fix, try one or more of the following remedies.

, One way to calm the out of control soap suds in your dishwasher is by using distilled white vinegar. Start by pouring ½ cup of vinegar directly into the bottom of the dishwasher.Let your dishwasher run for a few minutes on the normal setting. After a few minutes, check inside to see if the soap suds have begun to dissipate. If they haven’t, pour another ½ cup and start the normal wash cycle again.
If that still doesn’t help, try adding another cup of vinegar, and repeating the normal wash cycle. Move on to another method if that still doesn’t seem to be working.

, You can use table salt in conjunction with vinegar to deactivate the foaming agent in the dish soap, or you can use table salt by itself.


If you’d like to use the vinegar and salt together, then pour 1 cup of vinegar and about two tablespoons of salt across the soap suds or bottom of the dishwasher. Start the normal cycle of your dishwasher and let it run for a few minutes. If the soap suds appear to be dissipating, then you can allow the cycle to run through. If not, repeat the process until it works.
If you are using only table salt, then pour a generous amount atop the soap suds. The salt will break down the soap suds, and work as an anti-foaming agent to prevent more suds from forming. Let the normal cycle of your dishwasher run for a few minutes before checking to see if it’s working.
If the soap suds still seem to be growing, pour more salt over them and turn the dishwasher back on. Check again after a few minutes to see if the additional salt is helping. If not, repeat the process until it does.
Once you notice either method working, allow the normal cycle to run all the way through in order for the remaining dish soap and suds to wash completely out of the dishwasher’s system.

, Using ice cubes along with heaps of table salt may also help to get rid of the overflowing soap suds.If your dishwashing cycle was set to hot, then the hot water is likely helping the soap suds to grow. Pouring in a couple trays of ice cubes will cool down the water and help to settle some of the soap suds.


Add the ice after you add the salt and let the two work together as an anti-foaming agent. Allow the ice to melt.
Drain your dishwasher of the melted ice and salt, and then start your dishwasher on a rinse cycle. You may need to repeat the process if you still see soap suds after the cycle completes.

, Olive oil works also as an anti-foaming agent. In fact, several dishwasher manufacturers recommend it as an effective solution if you happen to pour dish soap into your dishwasher. If you don’t have olive oil, any other cooking oil will also work.


Once you’ve cleaned out your dishwasher, removing as much dish soap, suds and water as you can, pour a cup of olive oil into the bottom of the dishwasher.
Let the dishwasher run for an entire normal cycle. The heavy oil should break down the soap suds and work to clear out the remaining dish soap residue.

, Another method for clearing dish soap from your dishwasher is to add liquid fabric softener to the machine.Only a capful is needed to help break down the soap suds. After adding the liquid fabric softener, let the dishwasher run on a normal cycle for about a minute to activate the softener. Either press the button to cancel the cycle to allow solution and suds to drain, or change the cycle to the drain cycle.

Load up your dishwasher.,
Fill your dishwasher logically.,
Don't crowd the dishes.,
Add detergent.,
Turn it on.,
Dry the dishes.",How to Wash Dishes2," Although washing dishes in the sink by hand may be faster for some, you may want to keep your hands clean and soft.








, All dishwashers are different, and every person has a different method of loading theirs. Establish a routine, and stick with it for most loads. Here are some things to consider:


How does your dishwasher operate? Some have one set of arms blasting water up from the bottom, while others have an arm for the lower shelf blasting up, and an arm on the upper shelf blasting down.
Many dishwashers have a variety of spacing to accommodate large bowls, small bowls, utensils, dishes, and plates of varying sizes on the bottom shelf. The top shelf is given to shorter items such as glasses, mugs, jars, and long utensils such as spatulas and stirring spoons.

, Fill your dishwasher till it's full but not crammed. You'll maximize the cleaning capacity of your dishwasher and minimize excessive water usage.

, Fill the detergent dispenser with your preferred cleanser—liquid, powder, or capsule—and close it up.









You can add extra cleanser in a secondary cup should your dishes be excessively filthy.
Add a rinsing agent to prevent spotting, if necessary.

, Set the timer as necessary—a shorter time for lightly-soiled dishes, or a longer time for heavily-soiled pots, pans, and dishes.








, You can use a heated dry (but be careful of plastic dishes or containers), or use air drying. Dishes will still dry relatively quickly, as dishwasher water is usually heated to 140 °F (60 °C).

Washing cast-iron pots and pans requires a different method.,
Fill the pan with enough water to almost fill the pot.








,
Place the pan on a burner, turn the heat to med-high, and cover.








,
Wait until the water in the pan is boiling.,
Dump the bilge-water out and put the pan back on the burner, turned down to low.








,
Quickly wipe off any remaining water on the bottom of the pan with a paper towel, being careful not to burn yourself.,
Coat bottom and sides of cast-iron pan with a thin coat of oil, preferably an oil-spray, and wipe off excess oil with a paper towel.








",How to Wash Dishes3," You want to develop what's called a patina, or a coat of oil, on the surface of the pan. Washing the pan with detergent and water will prevent a patina from developing.

,,, With an iron spatula, scrape the food from the bottom and sides of the pan.

,, Turn off burner.

Check the dishes for a high proportion of fat or sugar on them.,
Check the dishes for a high proportion of flour or eggs.,
Use cold water over hot water when you're unsure of the origin of the sticky dishes.

,
Soak sticky plastic dishes in hot water with your usual detergent.,
Treat burned on food with a little fabric conditioner prior to washing.",How to Wash Sticky Dishes," This kind of stickiness is caused by such foods as honey, butter, cream, oils, etc. This sticky dish can be fixed by washing in warm to hot water because this will melt the fat or sugar. It is best to leave the dishes to soak for five minutes in the warm/hot water before scrubbing.;
, These kind of sticky dishes have a different need for removing the stubborn stain. They need to be washed in cold water because hot water will simply cook the mixture onto the dish or utensils. If these dishes have been in hot water, they'll be much harder to clean.

,, For plastic, it is important to use a non-abrasive scrubber to prevent marking the plastic. If the sticky substance doesn't come off with direct scrubbing, pour a little vegetable oil over it and leave to stand overnight, then wash again the next day. If the plastic smells, soak in vinegar to remove the odor.

, Burned on food can be very hard to remove, especially when it's mixed up with other sticky food pieces. It benefits from being soaked in hot water with a little fabric conditioner first. Be sure to cover the mess.

Rinse your dishes.,
Load the bottom rack.,
Load the top rack.,
Use the correct amount of detergent.,
Be careful when loading plastics.,
Avoid loading certain items.",How to Use a Dishwasher1," If you simply toss dirty dishes in your dishwasher, they will not come clean. Before placing your dishes in the washer, run them under tap water from the sink to remove bits of food, condiments, and other substances.This dishes do not have to be completely polished before you place them in the sink. However, they should be free of excess food before washing.;
, On the bottom rack, load dishes like pots, pans, casserole dishes, bowls, and plates. Make sure all your dishes face the spray nozzle of your dishwasher. Angle everything down slightly. This will help ensure a more thorough cleaning.You should also load silverware in the silverware rack.
Flat pots and platters should be placed near the back of the dishwasher.
Make sure stainless steel and silver dishes do not touch. If they touch during the wash, this can cause a chemical reaction that will damage your dishes.

, Glasses and mugs go in the top rack. Place these face down in the dishwasher and angle them as much as possible to get the insides washed. When washing wine glasses, make sure to angle them so they do not wiggle in the wash. Wine glasses can break easily in the dishwasher.It may be best to hand wash expensive wine glasses.

, You do not need a lot of detergent. Too much detergent can cause soap residue to stick to dishes. Check your detergent's label to see how much to add. Do not add more, even if your dishes are very dirty., Plastic items are lightweight and can move around easily during the wash. Make sure to place them on racks that keep them secure. They should not wiggle in place, as this can cause them to become dislodged during the wash., Not everything should be washed in the dishwasher. Refrain from placing the following items in a dishwasher:Materials like wood, cast iron, pewter, sterling silver, and aluminum
Children's glasses with designs
Nonstick dishes
Expensive dishes

Rinse glasses that have had milk in them in cold water prior to washing them in the usual dish washing water.,
Allow glasses to air dry after washing in the dishwasher.",How to Remove a Milk Film from Glasses," If the glasses are placed straight into the hot water, the heat will cook the proteins in causing them to adhere to the glass. While you can clean this off with elbow grease and scrubbing, it's much harder work than it needs to be.;

Coat the bottom of the pan with baking soda and soap.The amount of baking soda and soap you’ll need depends on the size of your dish.,
Cover the bottom of the pan with warm water.Usually just a shallow layer of water over the bottom of the pan will be enough.,
Scrub the pan.After 15 minutes, your pan is ready for cleaning.",How to Remove Stains from Bakeware1," The best way to gauge how much baking soda you’ll need is to just sprinkle a light, even coating of baking soda across the bottom. The best way to gauge how much soap you’ll need is to squirt your liquid soap along the inner edge of the pan, then apply three or four evenly spaced stripes of soap from one end of the pan to the other.


Use an antibacterial liquid soap.
This method also works on enameled bakeware like ceramics.When cleaning enameled bakeware, use one quart of water and two tablespoons of baking soda for your mixture. You shouldn’t need soap.;
, If you have a lot of water in the pan, you might end up with a big mess later when you scrub it, since the water might splash back. Wait 15 minutes for the baking soda, soap (if cleaning glass or Pyrex), and water to mix and loosen the grime on the glass bakeware.

, Place the dish in the sink so that any water that splashes up over the sides of the dish will drain down the sink. Depending on the severity of the stain, you might use a regular dish sponge, a green scrubbing pad, steel wool, or even a toothbrush. Use vigorous circular motions to remove the stains.


Some people like to use balled-up aluminum foil to scrub stains off their glass bakeware.Add more baking soda to spots that are especially stained.
Don’t be discouraged if your stain doesn’t come out immediately. It often takes several passes for stained glass bakeware to look truly clean again. Some people advise giving the dish a preliminary scrubbing, letting it sit for 30 minutes in soapy water, then going at it again.
Once you’ve removed the stain, wash and rinse your bakeware out with soap and warm water.

Run the lightest cycle, if possible.,
Choose a more intense cycle for dirtier dishes.,
Let the dishes air dry in most circumstances.",How to Use a Dishwasher2," To save water, you should usually opt for the lightest cycle on your dishwasher. If your dishes are not extremely dirty, this should clean them thoroughly. The dishes you normally use in the week for eating, drinking, and cooking should come clean on a light cycle., Very dirty dishes, such as those used for heavy cooking or baking, may need a stronger wash. Usually, switching from a light wash to a normal wash should clean off most built up residue. Dishes with set in stains can be washed using a heavy wash. Greasy dishes would benefit from a hight-temp wash., Skipping the dry cycle saves energy. Unless you need to use the dishes immediately, allow them to air dry in the rack before putting them away."

Clean the exterior.,
Clean the filter.,
Remove and clean the accessories.,
Wipe down the tub.",How to Use a Dishwasher3," To start, you want to scrub off the exterior of your dishwasher. This will remove things like spilled food and fingerprints. Plastic dishwashers should be wiped down with a sponge and soapy water. Stainless steel dishwashers should be wiped down using glass cleaner.If you're using glass cleaner, do not spray it directly on the dishwasher. Moisture can cause harm to electronic coils. Apply the glass cleaner to a paper towel or a rag first and then use that to wipe off smudges, spills, and fingerprints.

, Dishwashers have built-in filters that should be cleaned regularly to keep the dishwasher running smoothly. The filter is found on the bottom rack and can be easily pulled out. For precise instructions on removing your filter, refer to your dishwasher's instruction manual. Clean the filter in your sink. Use a sponge or the spray setting on your faucet to clean out food and debris stuck in the filter. When you're done, put the filter back in place.If you notice anything grainy, like coffee grounds, these can be cleaned out using a small brush.

, Take out any removable parts of your dishwasher, such as utensil holders. Transfer them to the sink and rinse out any stuck on food using tap water.If accessories are only mildly dirty, you may be able to remove foods with running water alone. You may need to use a brush or sponge to remove foods from very dirty filters.

, Before cleaning the tub, use paper towels to remove food scraps, dirt, and debris from the bottom of the dishwasher. Then, set a cup of white vinegar on the top rack of the dishwasher. Make sure the cup you use is dishwasher safe. Run a full cycle with the cup in place. This should clean and deodorize your dishwasher's interior.Wipe down the interior of the dishwasher with a paper towel after running a cleaning cycle.

Apply vinegar and baking soda.Sprinkle an even layer of baking soda over the bottom of the cookie sheet, tray, or other stainless steel bakeware.,
Pour hot water over the pan.Boil a small pot of water on the stove.,
Heat water and vinegar in the bakeware.Prepare a mixture of one part vinegar to three parts water.,
Use baking soda and water.If your stainless steel bakeware is still stained after using the vinegar and water mix, mix baking soda and water in equal parts.",How to Remove Stains from Bakeware2," The larger the surface, the more baking soda you’ll need. Then, add some vinegar to the pan. Again, the amount of vinegar you add should be proportional to the surface area of the stainless steel bakeware. Start with ¼ cup of vinegar. If that isn’t enough to evenly coat the bottom of the tray, add more in one-tablespoon increments.


When you mix the vinegar and baking soda, you’ll notice them fizzing. This is normal and not cause for concern.
Wait two to three minutes for the mixture to work its way into the stain.

, While it’s boiling, dump the vinegar and baking soda mix out of the bakeware and rinse the tray off. Place the tray in the sink face-up and slowly pour the boiling water over it.


Don’t pour the boiling water too rapidly or you risk splashing it onto your skin.
Wait a few minutes for the hot water to cool, then start scrubbing with soap and water to loosen up as much of the stain as you can. Use vigorous circular motions with the sponge or scrubbing pad to loosen the grime.
If you can remove the stain completely at this point, great! If not, continue on to the next step.

, For instance, you could mix one cup of vinegar and three cups of water. Or, for more shallow trays, you might mix half a cup of vinegar with 1½ cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil in your bakeware.


If you have a deep pot, this is easy to do on the stovetop. However, if you’re cleaning a shallow bakeware item like a tray or cookie sheet, you’ll need to add a thin layer of this mixture and heat it in the oven to about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) inside your oven.
Once the mixture is boiling, turn off the heat. Let it cool for 10-15 minutes. Then dump the mixture down your sink and give the stainless steel bakeware a good scrubbing with soap and water. Any stains should come right out.

, For instance, you could mix ½ a cup of water and ½ a cup of baking soda. The mixture should resemble a thick paste. Coat the stains on your stainless steel bakeware with this paste and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then, rub the paste away with a sponge and give the bakeware a good washing with hot, soapy water.


Some people find that scrubbing the baking soda paste away with aluminum foil helps remove the stain.You could also soak a sponge in vinegar to help you remove stains treated with the baking soda paste. Use this vinegar-soaked sponge to scrub away the paste or after you’ve washed the pan with soapy water.
This method is also effective when cleaning cast iron bakeware. However, it is recommended that you let the paste coat the stain on cast iron for closer to eight hours rather than just 15 minutes."
"
Use water and vinegar.To clean aluminum baking trays, pots, and other bakeware, mix water and vinegar in equal amounts.,
Use salt and lemon slices.If you don’t want to clean your aluminum bakeware with vinegar and water, slice a lemon lengthwise into four equally-sized wedges.,
Use cream of tartar.If salted lemon slices and vinegar alone don’t work against your stained aluminum bakeware, you could try a cream of tartar cleaner.",How to Remove Stains from Bakeware3," For instance, you might mix half a cup of water with half a cup of vinegar. Bring the mixture to a boil inside the bakeware item you want to clean.


For deeper pots and trays this will require a larger amount of vinegar and water. The mixture, in this case, can be boiled on the stovetop.
For shallow bakeware items like cookie sheets, you might have only a thin layer of water and vinegar in the pan. You’ll probably have to boil this mixture in the oven. Set the tray in the oven to a temperature of about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius).
If you wish, you could throw in a whole sliced lemon into your boiling mixture. The natural acidity of the lemon juice works wonders on aluminum bakeware.
Once the mixture gets boiling, turn the heat off and wait 15-20 minutes for it to cool. Dump the mixture out and wash the bakeware item with warm, soapy water in the sink. Scrub the pan with a sponge and/or scrubbing pad. Use vigorous circular motions to remove the stain.

, Dip the fruit sides (not the peel) in salt. The salt should stick to the juicy flesh of the lemon.


Grip the lemon wedge by placing your thumb on one end and your ring and middle fingers on the other end.
Apply the salted fruit to the stain and scrub it away with a gentle back-and-forth or up-and-down motion.
When you’ve removed the stain, wash the bakeware item with warm, soapy water.

, Simply mix one quart of water, ½ cup of vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar. Boil the whole mixture inside the stained bakeware item.


Let the mixture boil for 10 minutes, then turn the heat off, dump the solution out, and wait 15 minutes. Scrub the bakeware item clean in the sink with warm, soapy water.
Use steel wool. Move it back and forth across the surface of the pan. Do not be too vigorous with the steel wool, as it can scratch aluminum.If you cannot easily boil the mixture in the bakeware itself, you could boil it in a separate pot, then wait for the mixture to cool and dip a sponge in it. Use the sponge to scrub the stain away.
Alternately, you could pour a small amount of the solution in a shallow bakeware item and boil it in the oven at a temperature of about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) for 10 minutes.

Confirm the cause of cloudiness.,
Clean with white vinegar.,
Soak in vinegar.,
Run the dishwasher with a special supplement.,
Prevent hard water films in future.",How to Remove a Film from Glasses1," Rub a drop of white vinegar onto the cloudy surface with your finger. If the cloudiness clears or moves around, you're dealing with a hard water film. Continue to the next step. If it stays cloudy, the glass is probably scratched.This is almost always permanent, but there are ways to prevent it from occurring.


Do not skip this step. If you mistake scratched glass for hard water film, the treatments can make the scratches worse.;
, Hard water films are caused by alkaline minerals in the water.A mild acid will neutralize these minerals and dissolve the film. Here's how to apply it:


Rinse the glass in plain water. Traces of soap can react with vinegar and leave a greasy residue.Soak a sponge in vinegar and rub thoroughly over the cloudy area.
Rinse in hot water.

, If the film is still there, give the vinegar more time to work:


Wrap vinegar-soaked paper towels inside and outside the glass. (For large loads, submerge the glasses in vinegar instead.)
Wait 15 minutes.
Rinse in hot water.

, If vinegar won't cut through the film, try this treatment instead. The heat of the dishwasher should help.


Remove all metal objects, dishes with metallic paint, and dishes with delicate patterns.Add citric acid crystals or a film/spot remover instead of dishwasher detergent. (Check product label for specific instructions.)

Adjust your water heater setting to 140ºF (60ºC). If the dishwasher is hooked up to a sink supply, run the hot water until hot.Run the dishwasher as usual. Run a second rinse cycle with plain water if the product label directs you to.

, The hard water will continue leaving film on your dishes. Take steps to prevent this:Try using more detergent. Fill both of the detergent dispensers if you need to.
Test the hot water in your house with a thermometer. If it doesn't reach 140ºF (60ºC), raise the temperature of your hot water heater.
Buy a ""rinse aid"" and add it to each load according to label instructions. This product helps the water roll off your dishes, carrying minerals and food away before the dishes dry.Install a water softener in your home for severe problems.

Wash dishes thoroughly.,
Spot-clean stained dishes using a baking soda paste.,
Use a soaking solution of baking soda and vinegar to remove deeper stains.,
Rinse the dishes, and evaluate any remaining stains.,
Try a more powerful solvent.,
Use care when bleaching ceramics.",How to Remove Deep Stains from Dishes1," Leftover foodstuffs can cover up stains, shielding them from your cleaning efforts. Rinse and dry the dishes before continuing.;
, To remove deep stains from your dishes, you'll need to introduce a solvent to dissolve the stain so that it can be washed away. Baking soda is a popular and convenient option and is significantly less caustic than industrial solvents. Start with a tablespoon of baking soda, and add just enough water or white vinegar to make a sticky paste. Using a clean dish rag or scouring pad, scrub the stains vigorously with the solvent paste, then rinse.Lemon juice is another common household product which can function as a mild solvent, and is a good substitute for white vinegar.

, If a baking soda paste has proven ineffective, you may need to allow the solvents more time to deeply penetrate any stains. In enough hot water to completely submerge your dish, dissolve roughly 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of baking soda and 1 tbsp of white vinegar per cup of water, then allow the stained dishes to soak in the solution for 1-2 hours., If the stains have faded somewhat, but not completely, you may repeat the baking soda and vinegar soak. If the soak has not been effective at removing the stains, you'll need to consider more heavy-duty solvent options.

, If common household solvents have proven ineffective, you may need a more potent solvent to remove the stains on your dishes. Many brands and varieties are available. Whenever working with chemicals, be sure to follow any instructions on the product's package closely. Work in a well-ventilated area, and avoid exposure to any caustic chemicals by wearing rubber gloves. Rinse your dishes thoroughly after applying the solvent to ensure that none of it remains on the dish.


Not all commercially available heavy-duty dish cleaners are appropriate for all types of dish. Read the packaging carefully, and familiarize yourself with your options before purchasing.

, Chlorine bleach, or any product containing it, should not be used on ceramics or glazed china, as it may interact with, and ruin, the glaze. Oxygen bleach (usually used for laundry) can be used instead. Mix oxygen bleach powder in hot water, allow it to cool to room temperature, and allow your dishes to soak. This will remove most stains, even the crack-like ""crazing lines"" which may begin appearing as ceramics age.A common alternative for removing stains on china is 20% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is available in most pharmacies. Simply apply the solution to the affected area of the dish, then wash and rinse thoroughly.

Hand wash the glass.,
Scrub again with dishwasher detergent.,
Rinse off protein-rich food in future.,
Use a rinse aid.",How to Remove a Film from Glasses2," If a food film survived the dishwasher, give it a thorough hand scrub. Use plenty of soap and hot water. Most likely, this film is protein that has set onto the glass., If necessary, try again with a spot of dishwasher detergent instead of dish soap. Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from irritation.

, Eggs, meat, and dairy products are common, protein-rich foods. The high heat of the dishwasher can cause their proteins to set onto the dishes. To avoid this, rinse off most of the food residue before you load the dishwasher.


If a deep or round glass often ends up with food film at the base, the dishwasher spray may not reach it. Wash these glasses by hand.

, A ""rinse aid"" product added to your dishwashing cycle will help the water roll off your dishes instead of beading up. Try this if your dishwasher fails to remove all the food gunk.

Accept that the damage is permanent.,
Polish away iridescent areas.,
Prevent etching in your dishwasher.,
Avoid worn brushes.",How to Remove a Film from Glasses3," Sometimes, the cloudy ""film"" is actually many tiny scratches. This damage is permanent. There is no great way to hide this damage, either, so don't expect to restore it to full shine. Keep reading to give it your best shot, and prevent this happening to your other glasses.


Do not continue until you have tried wiping off the haze with vinegar. These solutions can make hard water films worse.

, If you notice a rainbow sheen to your glass, this is a related problem, called ""silica film."" Typically, the sheen is interrupted with white or solid-colored lines. Those lines are sites of irreversible damage, but you can scratch away the rainbow film.Add water to a bit of baking soda or toothpaste until it forms a paste. Rub gently onto the glass, then rinse.


You can scrape it away with a knife or pin as well, but take care not to chip or scratch the glass.
You can use commercial glass polish instead.
Different brands of toothpaste have different levels of abrasiveness. Look up your brand's ""radioactive dentin abrasiveness"" (RDA) rating online.Ideally, find an RDA between 200 and 250.

, You can still save your undamaged glasses. Etching is typically caused by very soft water, or very hot water. Make one or more of these changes:Let your sink run until its hottest point, then put a thermometer in a cup of water. If it's hotter than 140ºF (60ºC), lower your water heater settings.
Use a no-heat dry cycle, if possible on your model.
Do not pre-rinse dishes, unless necessary for your dishwasher.
Use very little detergent, especially if pre-rinsing. (As little as ¼ full if your water is below three ""grains"" of hardness.)
Switch to a detergent designed for soft water.
Hand-dry valuable glassware.

, If your dish scrubbing brush is so worn that the plastic or metal head butts against the glass, throw it away. This could be causing the scratches.Etching is uncommon on hand-washed dishes if you are not physically scratching it. If you still have this problem with a new brush, try reducing water temperature and the amount of soap you use.

Wash dishes thoroughly to ensure that no food remains on their surfaces.,
Set the dishes in strong sunlight for at least two hours.,
Try applying a solution of baking soda and vinegar.,
Try using an oxygenating agent, like denture cleaner or a fizzing antacid tablet.,
Soak the dishes in a solution of chlorine bleach.",How to Remove Deep Stains from Dishes2," If washing in a washing machine, make sure the dishes are placed on the uppermost dishwasher rack to avoid exposing the plastic to high temperatures.Rinse and dry before continuing.

, Sunlight has a bleaching effect on plastic, and a few hours of exposure can remove stains, and will help deodorize your plastic dishes. Leave your dishes stain side up in front of an open window, or in a suitable outdoor location where sunlight is plentiful. After a few hours, check to see if the stains have lifted., Baking soda and vinegar are convenient options, and are effective at dissolving many common varieties of food stains. Either soak your plastic dishes in a solution of baking soda, vinegar and warm water (roughly 1 tbsp each of baking soda and vinegar for every cup of water) for 1-2 hours, or scrub the dish using a baking soda paste (made by combining a small amount of baking soda with just enough vinegar or water to make it sticky).Alternately, you can use salt and lemon juice, instead of baking soda and vinegar, to create a scrubbing paste.
Another common household alternative to baking soda and vinegar is rubbing alcohol, which can be applied via soaking, or simply by scrubbing the alcohol into the affected area of the plastic dish.

, These products can be surprisingly effective at lifting stains out of plastic dishes, especially cups and bowls. Simply fill the cup or bowl with water and drop two denture cleaner or antacid tablets inside, and soak overnight before washing and rinsing., Bleach is potent and somewhat hazardous, but is a good last-resort when other approaches have failed to remove stains. Carefully combine bleach and water at a ratio of roughly one part bleach per two parts water, then allow the plastic dishes to soak in the solution for 30 minutes, then thoroughly rinse the dishes. Bleach is a very caustic substance, and you should be sure to wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from contact with it. Also make sure the space you are working in is well ventilated, so that the fumes produced by the bleach are safely dissipated.

Avoid scratching or chipping your dishes.,
Warm ceramic dishes before serving hot food.,
Wash dishes promptly.,
Wash dishes properly, using hot water.,
Avoid water marks on glass dishes by using the correct amount of detergent.",How to Remove Deep Stains from Dishes3," Breaks in the surface of a glass, china or ceramic dish will allow food and drink to enter, leading to deeper, more difficult-to-clean stains.

, Sudden changes in heat can cause tiny fractures in the surface of ceramic dishes or china. You should avoid causing this by warming the dishes (for instance, by placing them near or on a warm oven) before serving hot food on them., This will prevent any food or drink remaining on the surface of the dish from setting in. Coffee and tea cups are especially important to clean immediately, since stains from these beverages tend to set in more quickly, and be much harder to remove. If you intend to store leftovers for a while, put the food into a container or dish you don't mind staining before putting it in the fridge. , Washing and rinsing dishes in water that is too cold makes it more difficult to remove grease, or food particles from a dish during washing, potentially leading to staining. , Using too much detergent in your automatic dishwasher can result in water marks. If your glasses frequently become water marked after washing, consider reducing the amount of detergent. If this doesn't work, consider trying a new detergent. "

, Once the soap and water mixture has cooled for several minutes, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the pan. Stir well to ensure that the vinegar is fully incorporated.You can substitute fresh lemon juice for the vinegar if you prefer. Both will help cut grease when you’re washing dishes.
The amount of vinegar you should add to the soap depends on how thick the mixture is. If it is extremely thick, add approximately 2 tablespoons (30 ml) to help loosen it up. If the soap mixture is already liquidy, just add approximately 1 tablespoon (15 ml).

, Allow the soap to sit in the pot until it is completely cooled, which may take 15 to 20 minutes. Next, pour the soap into a soap dispenser or pump bottle, and place beside your kitchen sink.It’s often easier to transfer the soap from the pan to the dispenser with a funnel.

Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the mixture to heat until the soap completely dissolves, which should take 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the stove.Stir the mixture as it’s heating to help the soap dissolve more quickly.

, Once the soap has dissolved completely and the mixture is off the heat, mix in ¼ cup (60 ml) of liquid castile soap, 2 ¼ teaspoons (10 g) of super washing soda, and ½ teaspoon (1.5 g) glycerin. Stir well until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.Washing soda is usually found in the laundry aisle of large grocery stores. If you can’t find it locally, you can order it from a variety of online stores.

, Leave the soap mixture in the pan, and let it sit for 24 hours. Stir it periodically during this period to get a feel for the consistency. The soap will thicken up over time so it’s okay if it’s a bit runny. If it seems too thin, though, you can warm the soap up, mix in additional washing soda, and let it set again.If you’re adding extra washing soda, start by mixing in ¾ teaspoon (3 g) and letting the soap sit again. If it’s still not thick enough, mix in the washing soda in ½ teaspoon increments (2 g) until it’s the right consistency.
If your soap has chunks or lumps, smooth it with a blender or an immersion blender.

, When the soap has reached your desired consistency, add 15 to 40 drops of your favorite essential oil. Stir well to ensure that the oil is blended throughout the soap for a fresh fragrance, and pour it into a soap dispenser for use beside the kitchen sink.You can use any essential oil that you like, but citrus oils, such as lemon, lime, and orange, are particularly effective in cutting grease.

Fill the soap container on the bottom section of the dishwasher or the dishwasher door with powdered dishwasher detergent.",How to Load a Dishwasher1," Face them toward the center and, if they lean at all, lean them inwards and downwards. This is because the tubes, jets and rotating devices spray water outward from the center; down and outward from the top; and, up and outward from the bottom of the dishwasher.


Try to keep all surfaces separated and accessible to the stream of water from the sprayers.;
, Stack the bowls neatly on an incline, so that the washing solution can reach inside the bowl and so that they will drain. This also allows you to fill in more space.

, Because the heating element in most dishwashers is on the bottom, placing plastic items in the bottom rack could cause them to melt or warp.

,


Do not crowd or overload the dishwasher.
If necessary, hand wash large items or run the dishwasher a second time.

, Place knives, forks and spoons in the cutlery basket, handle down. In general, dangerous or sharp knives should be washed by hand, as they dull in the dishwasher. Any wood handled or wood utensils should not go in the dishwasher.


Distribute the cutlery loosely, and position the soiled surfaces of the spoons and forks apart so that the water can reach them. Separation is key.
Long pieces of cutlery can block the spray from tubes, nozzles and rotating devices. These items should be laid down in the upper basket.
Lay larger serving utensils in the top section of the dishwasher. Arrange serving spoons with the bowl facing down so that water does not collect in them.

, It may be better to just hand wash your cutting boards though as the heat from the dishwasher often warps cutting boards.

, If you have a plastic, mesh-like piece that folds up and down on the top rack, this is lightly meant to hold onto wine-glass stems. This is a great way to keep fragile pieces from getting scratched or cracked.

, Also, make sure that the detergent cups can open fully. If any of these things are obstructed or blocked, it will make it much harder to get a good wash.

, Fill to the designated line.If you use pellet-style detergent, simply use one pellet by placing it on the bottom edge of the dishwasher door before closing, Depending upon the temperature of the water and the length of the washing cycle, some of the wraps from the pellet bag may not completely dissolve which eventually plugs the drain. For this reason, some dishwasher manufacturers may not recommend the use of pelletized soap.


Fill the soap container on the door of the dishwasher first if you have two. It is timed to open after the dishwasher does some pre-rinsing to soften up the dirt on its own.
Only fill the second soap well if you have had issues with cleaning before, or you know a load is particularly dirty.

While you don't want to wash your dishes, wiping off with a dirty fork or napkin will lead to much better results later.


Pre-rinse, but only if it is necessary. Most dishwashers and dishwasher detergents actually do a better job if they have something to remove. If your dishes aren't coming out clean, though, it might be best to use a quick spritz of water before the food hardens onto the dishes.

, Proteins such as eggs and cheese; cooked- or baked-on foods; and starches that have dried onto the dish often require extra attention. A light pre-wash and scrub can make your dishwasher much more effective. You could also soak the plates in the sink before starting the dishwasher.

, This will help to reduce water spots, especially if you have hard water. The rinse aid may not need refilling every time you run the dishwasher, but do top it off every couple of weeks to a month, or according to the instruction manual.


You can replace commercial rinse aid with white vinegar in a pinch, with little difference in quality.
Some dishwasher detergent has rinse aid in it. Read the label.
If you have a water softener, or if your water is reasonably soft to begin with, you may find that rinse aid is unnecessary.

, Dishwashers often drain into the same pipe as the sink, so it's important that the pipe is clear. If you don't have a garbage disposal, use a strainer in the sink drain to stop crumbs and debris from accumulating in the pipe.

, Modern dishwashing detergent actually eliminated dangerous phosphates, replacing them with enzymes that react at any water temperature. This saves you energy and money.

, Dishwashers can heat up the water somewhat, but they usually work best when the water starts hot. If water is scarce, run the water into a container and use it to water plants or other purposes.

, You should never be stacking things, or forcing everything into weird angles. Load the dishwasher up so that it is snugly packed, but not terribly crowded. Note any issues if you end up with a ""bad wash."" Did you overcrowd the trays and prevent anything from getting the best clean?

Give yourself some kind of reward. This can make dishwashing feel like a game, with fun treats at the end.You can have an easy reward system. For example, you get a piece of chocolate if you finish the dishes. However, you can also make your system more complex.
For example, you can earn a point every time you wash dishes. You can have different numbers of points translate to different rewards. If you earn 5 points, you get to watch an episode of your favorite TV show. If you earn 10 points, you get to order takeout. You can choose to cash in on your points early, or save them up.

, Washing dishes alone can be boring. Enlist the help of a sibling or friend, or simply have someone sit in the room with you while you wash.You can incorporate this into your schedule. For example, every weeknight when you wash dishes, have your spouse stay in the room. The two of you can talk and catch up while dish washing is happening.
If someone is willing to help, have someone wash dishes with you. The two of you can joke around and talk while washing the dishes.

, Dishwashing can be a reward in and of itself. Instead of thinking of it as a chore, think of it as a way to make life easier for yourself. Clean dishes can make navigating your kitchen less stressful. It can also help keep bugs away. Do not think of dishwashing as a chore. Think of it as doing yourself a favor."

Remove heat streaks or residual stains.",How to Clean Stainless Steel Cutlery1," Throwing your cutlery straight into the dishwasher can sometimes cause stubborn bits of food or sauce to cake onto it. You can prevent this from happening by lightly cleaning silverware before putting it into the dishwasher. Using dish soap and hot water:


Thoroughly clean the cutlery. Avoid using abrasive scrubbers or brushes, as these can scratch the finish of your stainless steel. A soft dishcloth or sponge, however, is fine.
Pay special attention to cracks, crevices, and other places food easily builds up when cleaning, including the tines of forks and the bowls of spoons.;
, Choose the setting on your dishwasher that best reflects the condition of your cutlery. In most cases, a normal cycle should be sufficient, but especially dirty flatware might require a heavy cycle. Turn off the drying cycle, if you are able.Then add a suitable detergent to your dishwasher, close its door, then start the washing cycle.


To make it easier to return the cutlery to its place in your kitchen, you may want to separate your spoons, forks, and knives in your dishwasher.
Some cutlery, especially certain kinds of spoons, can nest together in your dishwasher, making them difficult for your dishwasher to clean. You may want to spread out utensils like this, so your dishwasher can work most effectively.

, Stainless steel sometimes requires several wash cycles before it is completely clean. Older dishwashers and severely dirty cutlery, especially, might require a second run through the dishwasher.


Inspect your cutlery after each cycle for remaining food, stains, or dirtiness. If you spot any, your utensils likely need a second cycle.
Be careful when removing cutlery from your dishwasher to inspect it. Just after cleaning, the utensils can be very hot.

, After your dishwasher's cleaning cycle is complete, remove your cutlery from it. Even if the cutlery is mostly dry, thoroughly wipe each utensil with a soft, dry cloth or a piece of paper towel.Drying by hand reduces spots left on your cutlery., Stainless steel cutlery can become streaked due to food stains or overexposure to heat.In most cases, these kinds of blemishes can be buffed away with a soft dishcloth or polishing cloth. You can add a polishing agent to improve the end polish, like:


Olive oil, which will help remove streaks from cutlery. Use a soft dishcloth, rag, or paper towel moistened with olive oil to gently rub your cutlery with it to remove streaks.
Mineral oil, much like olive oil, helps to reduce streaking. Moisten a soft dishcloth, rag, or paper toil with the oil, then gently rub the cutlery until streaks are gone."

There are usually at least some leftovers after a big dinner. While you're cooking, get out any Tupperware, plastic wrap, and other supplies you'll need to store leftovers.Set out Tupperware containers, plastic bags, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap somewhere in your kitchen. After dinner is over, you'll be able to quickly store leftovers.
If you plan on sending leftovers homes with guests, keep this in mind. You may want to set out some disposable Tupperware containers that you can give to guests at the end of the night.;
, Dishes are easier to wash if you don't let food get stuck on. Make sure to soak dishes as you're done using them. As soon as you finish a dish while cooking, soak it in warm, soapy water.Before dinner, prepare a sink full of warm, soapy water. This way, guests can simply transfer their plates and utensils to the sink and let them soak. This will make cleanup easier for you.If you have a dishwasher, empty it before dinner.

, Spills and stains should be addressed in the immediate moment. While you organize for cleaning, set things out near the table, like paper towels, you can use to quickly wipe up anything that spills. This will allow you to clean as you go along.If you're serving something like wine, that can stain a carpet, keep supplies on hand to address this. Wine can be removed with hydrogen peroxide mixed with a few drops of dish detergent. Make a mixture like this ahead of time and set it in a plastic spray bottle near the table.

, If you're cooking for family members or friends who don't mind helping out, assign tasks ahead of time. If everyone has something to do in the aftermath of a dinner, things will go smoothly for cleaning.Everyone can have their own task. One person can be in charge of clearing the table, another person can put away leftovers, someone can remove excess food from dishes, and a team of people can wash them.
If you quickly designate tasks ahead of time, things will go easier during the cleaning process.

, While you're cooking and serving people, strive to clean up what you can as you go. This way, there will be less to clean up when the meal is completely over.As you're cooking, wash any measuring cups and measuring spoons as soon as you're dong using them.
Clean other dishes as you go during the meal. If the mashed potato bowl is empty, for example, quickly duck into the kitchen to place it in the sink.
Wipe up any stains and spills as they occur throughout the night.

, After dinner is done, let guests know how to clear their plates. If everyone clears their plate after dinner, this makes cleanup a lot easier for you.Instruct guests how to clear their plates. Let them know where the garbage is, so they can scrape off any food, and which sink to place dirty dishes.

, After dinner, the food should be the first thing you clean. For safety reasons, food should be put away promptly after dinner commences. As soon as everyone's cleared their place, remove and store any leftover food items.Gather any food from the table. Store them properly using your prepared storage containers.
Aim to remove food that should not be left out, like dairy products and meets, before other items.
You should also remove any excess food from serving bowls and dinner place. If food sticks on, it's harder to clean so make sure to scrape off any excess food just after dinner.

, You should tackle the dishes next. The longer dishes sit, the harder they will be to clean.If you're hand washing, clean the easiest dishes first. Dishes that are dirtier need more time to soak before they can be clean.
If you have a dishwasher, load it effectively. Keep glasses near the top and load the dishwasher as full as you can before running it.

, Remember, many guests will be eager to help to show their appreciation. If you need help with something, politely let your guests know. Say something like, ""Could someone help dry the dishes and put them away so I'll have space to dry what's left in the sink?""Younger children can help you with basic tasks, like clearing the table. Do not hesitate to enlist the help of kids, as this can help teach responsibility.

, Once you've put away the dishes and food, finish the rest of the cleanup. Take out the garbage, put away any dry dishes, and wipe down the table and countertop. Once you're done, take a break and enjoy after dinner conversations with friends and family members., Before you start cooking, try to prepare your fridge and dishwasher. This will make clean up go quicker as you won't have to be scrambling to make room in your fridge.Prior to a big dinner, clear out your fridge. Remove any items you don't need, throw out anything that has gone bad, and try to create empty spaces for leftovers.
Empty your dishwasher before a big meal. If your dishwasher is completely empty, you'll be able to fit more dishes in it. This will minimize the amount of times you need to run the dishwasher after dinner.

, Try to minimize the amount of pots, pans, and measuring cups you use when cooking. This will result in there being less to clean after dinner.Try to use only one or two measuring cups, cleaning the cup out in between ingredients.
Wash mixing bowls as you go. You can reuse the same bowl for preparing different foods rather than dirtying a single bowl.

, Move your trashcan near where you're cooking. This way, you can toss items quickly. Things like potato skins, paper towels, and other items of garbage can be thrown away as you go along. This will greatly cut back on cooking time., Trays and tablecloths can prevent mess from getting on your counter.

, You can find the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher. It’s usually circular and can be found by the spinning water spout. Grab the top of the filter, rotate it counter-clockwise for a quarter turn. It should then come free from the assembly with a light pull.Some older dishwashers have a hard food grinder (or macerator) instead of a filter.

Check to see if your kitchen is dishwasher ready.,
Get a portable washer if there is no hook up.,
Measure the space intended for dishwasher.,
Decide between integrated or freestanding.,
Choose between compact and standard.,
Make sure it has all of the cycles you want.,
Consider stainless steel for the tub.,
Look for adjustable upper racks.,
Get a quiet model.,
Think about the details.,
Choose the right dishwasher.,
Check several appliance stores for brands and prices.,
Buy during the right time of year.",How to Choose a Dishwasher," Look at all of the water fixtures to make sure you are able to add in a dishwasher. Most homes should be dishwasher ready with only an installation needed, which is usually done by the company the dishwasher is bought from. Old homes, however, may need some electrical work done to comply with new rules for new dishwashers.Dishwashers now must be on their own dedicated circuit.
A shut-off needs to be within four feet of the dishwasher.
A GFCI breaker (protection from moisture and sparking) needs to be on the circuit breaker panel.;
, If there is no dishwasher hook up in your apartment, choose a portable dishwasher that can be hooked up to kitchen faucet. Once you are done using it, you can store it away in a closet or another area of the home. You can also choose to buy a small, countertop dishwasher, though it will provide less space for dishes.Brands such as Kenmore, SPT, Whirlpool, and Danby offer portable dishwashers.
SPT also offers countertop dishwashers.

, Dishwashers come in multiple sizes. You will need to pick out one that is appropriate for the size of your home or apartment. Take a tape measurer and measure the depth and width of the area you plan to install a dishwasher into. Write down the measurements, take them to a home improvement store, and ask which dishwasher will work for those measurements.You can also look through online catalogs to see which dishwasher will work with your measurements.

, Freestanding dishwashers are more common than integrated dishwashers. Freestanding dishwashers are more common because they can fit into any kitchen that has enough space for them. Integrated dishwashers are designed to be incorporated into built-in kitchens. Fully integrated dishwashers are hidden behind a cabinet door, and semi-integrated dishwashers are mostly covered, except for the control panel.Freestanding dishwashers are a great choice because you have the option of taking them with you when you move.
Integrated dishwashers are a good choice if you want the look of a streamlined kitchen.

, Compact dishwashers are good for smaller spaces. They are typically 18 inches, which leaves extra room for storage. A standard dishwasher is typically 24 inches, and it is ideal for homes with families.A compact dishwasher is a better choice if you live alone, or with one partner or roommate.
A standard dishwasher is ideal if you or someone else will be cooking for a family of three people or more almost every night.

, Modern dishwashers typically have more cycles rather other wash and dry. Think about what needs you will have when using the dishwasher, and what type of dishes you will be putting into the dishwasher. Look for dishwashers that meet your needs. A good dishwasher should have a delayed wash, rinse and hold, wash program, quick-wash, and sanitize cycle.


A delayed wash cycle allows you to set a start time anywhere between one hour and twenty-four hours ahead of time.
A rinse and hold cycle will rinse food off of a partial load of dishes to remove bacteria and bad smells without using detergent.
A wash program allows you to choose a custom setting for things like fragile dishes and oven racks.
A sanitize setting will kill 99.9% of bacteria.

, There are several options for materials for the interior tub of the dishwasher. Plastic tubs are common and found most often in affordable dishwashers. This is a durable choice. A gray or slate color is another option, and it is good at hiding stains. Stainless steel is a great choice because it resists stains and odors and transfers heat better than other materials, which makes for a faster dry.A stainless steel tub is usually more expensive. A plastic tub will do if you are looking for an affordable dishwasher.

, Adjustable racks allow you to put together your washer in a way that best fits your needs. This would come in handy when you are washing particularly large items. Look for a height-adjustable rack with two quick-release clips. This allows you to move the rack even if there are dishes in it. A roller rack is another option, but you can only move it when the rack is empty.Make sure to take a good look at the inside of the dishwasher before purchasing to see what type of racks are used.

, A noise is often a factor considered when buying a dishwasher. A loud dishwasher can be annoying in a kitchen where conversation is taking place. Check the decibel level if you are concerned about noise. A decibel level of 45 or under will be almost silent. A decibel level of 50 is equal to the volume of a normal conversation. 44 decibels is the ideal level.You can also add extra insulation around the washing tub, door, toe panel, and access controls to reduce noise., A basic dishwasher may be okay with you, but you should still consider what details you would like to have before purchasing. Details such as a child-safety lock, anti-flood protection, sensor wash, and detergent sensor may come in handy. Dishwashers that feature most or all of these details will likely be more expensive than your average dishwasher, however.Anti-flood detection has two main settings. A float switch detects when water is at the bottom of the machine and stops it from filling further into the tub. An aqua-stop prevents flooding if the hose spills or leaks.
The sensor wash detail determines how dirty the water is and adjusts the temperature and length of wash depending on that reading.
A detergent sensor can prevent you from washing with too much detergent. The sensor releases as much detergent is needed for the wash.

, You only need a dishwasher that has the capabilities you desire and that is within your price range. Different dishwashers have different features, so choose wisely, and make sure you don't spend your life's savings on a fancy dishwasher. A lot of extra sensors and details are great to have, but they are not necessary if you are on a budget. All you really need are places to put in your silverware, glasses, plates, and bowls. Be reasonable.A good price for a new dishwasher is around 800 to 900 dollars.

, Don’t buy from the first place you look at dishwashers. Look at websites like Reviewed.com and Consumer Reports to see which models are best. Prices may vary depending on the store, and some stores may be having sales when other are not. Some different stores that sell dishwashers could be Home Depot, Lowe's, or even eBay. Make sure that if you are ordering one, check to make sure everything works, such as the sliding rack.

, Certain times of year are better for buying dishwashers. For example, dishwashers will often go on sale around the holidays and when new models are being unveiled. Any holiday weekend, September and October, January, and the end of the month are good times to look for a dishwasher.September and October is a good time to look for a dishwasher because manufacturers unveil the new models during this time, so older models will often go on sale.
The selection may be limited in January, but all of the remaining models from the previous year will often be discounted even more than they were during the holidays.
Employees will often have a quota they have to fill by the end of the month, so the end of the month is a good time to negotiate price.

The lower your price range, the simpler your dishwasher will be. Budget dishwashers can clean dishes very well, but might not have as many features and might be louder. More expensive dishwashers tend to be quieter and have more features.


Budget dishwashers cost around 200-600 dollars, but more expensive dishwashers can be as much as 2,200 dollars.;
, Before going to the store, measure the amount of room you have for your dishwasher. Standard dishwashers are 24 inches, but there are more compact dishwashers that are 18 inches. When deciding the size of the dishwasher you will need, consider the size of your family and how often you do dishes.A standard size family should opt for a standard size dishwasher if they have room in their kitchen.

, Before you buy it, make sure your kitchen is prepared for a dishwasher. Make sure the floor is even and that there is enough room for the dishwasher. If you are installing cabinets, make sure to keep in mind the width of the dishwasher., You can purchase dishwashers in many different stores (such as Sears, Lowes, Costco, and Best Buy).

Find a dishwasher with good reviews about performance and reliability. Amazon is a good place to find reviews about dishwashers, but also check the website of the dishwasher manufacturer for more input.Consider buying a dishwasher model that has at least 3/5 stars.

, You might want to buy a warranty for your dishwasher in case anything goes wrong and your dishwasher breaks. Your dishwasher might come with a warranty that last from three months to one year. After that time period the manufacturer is not responsible for any problems unless you buy an extended warranty or service plan.


You might want to consider buying a warranty if your dishwasher costs more than 500 dollars., A standard dishwasher measures 24 inches (61 cm). This is the dishwasher that most people with a standard size kitchen need. If you have enough room in your kitchen for a standard size dishwasher and do regular size dish loads than you should purchase this dishwasher., If your kitchen is low on space you can purchase a dishwasher that is 18 inches (45.7 cm). Compact dishwashers are great if you are low on space in your kitchen. If you have a large family, you might not want this dishwasher because it does fill up faster than a standard size dishwasher., If you do small dish loads and want a sleek and modern dishwasher, consider dishwasher drawers. You can purchase multiple drawers (usually two) to put your dishes in. These are best if you are doing a full kitchen construction or renovation., If your kitchen has no room for a dishwasher, but you still want one, then purchase a portable dishwasher. You can roll the dishwasher into your kitchen whenever you need it and hook it up to your sink. Portable dishwashers save room but can be a hassle to pull out and hook up whenever you need to use it., When purchasing a dishwasher, you should keep in mind the noise level. If you often do dishes when you are home or if your kitchen is in the center of the house, you might want to look for an especially quiet dishwasher. If you always turn the dishwasher on before you leave for work, noise level might not be as important to you.


You will pay more for a quiet dishwasher, but not every expensive dishwasher is quiet., When you look at dishwashers, bring a few of your own plates and bowls to the store to make sure they fit in the dishwasher. There are machines with adjustable racks available to help make your dishes fit comfortably. If your dishes don't fit, move the adjustable racks to see how many of your dishes the dishwasher can accommodate., Decide if cycle time is important to you. For the most part there is not usually a correlation between cycle time and dishwasher performance. If you find yourself needing items out of the dishwasher often, but it is still running, cycle time might be important to you. An efficient washer that has a short cycle time is best for people who do dishes often or cook a lot., The decor of your dishwasher is an important part of your kitchen. Dishwashers come in black, white, or stainless steel. You can also buy dishwashers with the option to match your cabinets.


The tub inside your dishwasher can be plastic or stainless steel.
Some dishwashers have the buttons hidden on the inside of the dishwasher.
You can get dishwashers that have a window so you can see your dishes being cleaned., When purchasing a dishwasher, you might want to keep in mind the amount of energy and water the dishwasher uses. Choosing a dishwasher that uses less energy is good for the environment and your utility bill.


Standard dishwashers use no more than 355 kWh per year and no more than 6.5 gallons of water per cycle.
Energy Star dishwashers are more strict and use no more than 295 kWh per year and 4.25 gallons of water per cycle.A dishwasher that uses less energy and water saves you money in the long run because it lowers your utility bill.

, You can purchase dishwashers with racks that you can move up and down, movable tines, and silverware holders that you can rearrange. Being able to reconstruct your dishwasher is great for big loads or when washing strangely shaped dishes. You can even purchase dishwashers with a third rack for large utensils and small cups., These make your dishwasher's cycle time adjustable. The sensors change the time and the amount of water used depending on how dirty your dishes are. This improves dishwasher efficiency but can make the dishwasher more expensive. , If you don’t fill your dishwasher up quickly, you might want to get a dishwasher with a rinse and hold cycle. This allows you to rinse dishes when it is not a full load to prevent food from setting in and to reduce bad smell., These keep the water that cleans your dishes clean. This way no old food is getting back on your dishes. Self-cleaning filters grind food particles and flush them. They are convenient, but they can be loud. There are manual filters that don’t have a grinder. They are quieter but they need to be hand cleaned., Standard dishwashers come with three cycles (light, normal, and heavy). On newer dishwashers, you can get fast working cycles (such as quick and express). There are even cycle options on some dishwashers for pot scrubbing, china, crystals, steam cleaning, and sanitizing. Most people will only need the basic three cycles, but consider special cycles if you have specific needs., Less expensive dishwashers will dry dishes in a few hours using heat in the dishwasher tub. More expensive models will heat the water during the rinse period to make the dishes dry faster or heat the dishes to dry them. Opting for these options will save you time, but they do make your electricity bill higher."

If you are using a vacuum, anything other than a soft brush attachment runs the risk of scratching or scraping your blinds.Use this method if you are low on time and are already vacuuming.

, You can mix a quarter cup of olive oil in a bowl with warm water to create an extra shine on your wood blinds. Use the washing method but replace the warm water with your new solution.Do not use olive oil if your blinds are cracked. The solution may seep past the finish and warp your wood., Lemon oil or commercial wood cleaners can clean wood blinds without damaging them.If you are trying to achieve shiny wood blinds, you can use products found at a home goods or department store made specifically for wood.


Lemon oil is the oil that is secreted when the lemon peel is pressed. It is a natural disinfectant.You can purchase wood cleaners like Murphy Oil Soap, Orange Glo, and other commercial wood cleaners to keep your wooden blinds safe.Remember to always wipe your wood blinds dry after using any cleaner.

Prepare the area for cleaning.,
Fill a small spray bottle with a mixture of vinegar and water.,
Spray the window's surface.,
Rub the window's entire surface with a cloth to work the vinegar in.,
Dry the window's entire surface.",How to Clean Windows With Vinegar2," Before you apply a vinegar solution to the window, make sure you remove any dust from the window using a cloth or paper towel. Eliminating this layer of dust before you clean can help prevent you from simply moving dust around on the window.









If there are small objects near the window, consider moving them to keep them from getting wet with vinegar.You might also want to place a bath towel on your windowsill or the floor under your windows to catch any solution that drips., Select your solution strength based on the dirtiness of your windows and fill a small spray bottle with it. Using a spray bottle for small windows is particularly effective because it allows you to spray a small area that you can easily dry before moving on to the next window.








, Use the spray bottle to mist the entire first window that you want to clean with the mixture. If you’re cleaning more than one window, only apply the vinegar to the first window.








, The best tool for this is a lint-free towel, but paper towels also work well. Concentrate especially on spots that have visible stains or grime. Work quickly to help avoid streaks from appearing.







, This is best done with a microfiber cloth, and should be done after most of the moisture has been collected by the lint-free towel. Dry the window vigorously and quickly, as this will prevent streaking.









If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, paper towel will also work. Don’t use towels with lint in them – like regular hand and dish towels – to dry your windows because it will cause your window surfaces to streak.

Touch the window up with a microfiber cloth.",How to Clean Windows With Vinegar3," For large windows, you’ll need a larger amount of your vinegar solution than what will fit into a spray bottle. You can use the same formulas listed above, again depending on the state of your windows.








, If you’re cleaning outside windows, rinse them first with your garden hose to remove any excess dirt. You might need to spray certain areas for longer if there's caked on dirt.







, You should give your windows a quick clean before you apply the vinegar mixture, especially if there are a lots of stains on the outside windows.








You can scrub particular problem areas, but make sure you're using a sponge or mop head, not steel wool or anything similarly abrasive. It can scratch your windows.
After you’ve washed the windows, rinse again with the hose.

, Using a sponge, apply the vinegar mixture to one window’s surface. You can gently scrub at any stubborn spots if you need to.









Load the sponge by dipping it in the bucket, and rub it across the entire surface of the window. As with smaller windows, working quickly will help prevent streaking.You can also use a scrub brush attached to a multi-purpose extension pole that has a universal threaded end that brushes can screw into.This lets you reach upper story windows or the tops of tall first story windows., Using a spray bottle (if you’re washing large inside windows) or your hose (if you’re washing larger outside windows).







, Because the windows need to be dried quickly to keep streaks from appearing, a squeegee is essential for large windows; it also saves you from having to use a lot of towels. Dry the entire window with the squeegee as quickly as possible.







, To get the remaining moisture out of the corners of the window, use a microfiber cloth to rub the vinegar away. Rub any areas that begin to streak with the microfiber cloth before moving on to the next window.

",How to Clean Windows With Vinegar4," Using a small amount of baking soda – no more than a tablespoon or two per track – sprinkle your windows' tracks. Once you add vinegar, this will lift the dirt off your tracks without having to wipe it around., Use a small amount of pure vinegar for this step. You should get some fizz when the vinegar hits the baking soda, but you shouldn’t let it fizz so much that it comes up over the top of the window track.








If you like, you can open the window screen and let the excess run off outside.

, Using a q-tip, rub at the dirt in your window tracks to loosen it. This will force it to mix with the baking soda

Lemonade drink mix or lemon-flavored Kool-Aid mix. (Don't use strong colors that might stain. There is no need to add the sugar.)
Lemon juice
A dishwasher cleaning product ;
, The two ""shelves"" of the dishwasher should be removed, along with the utensil holder and any other pieces that aren't a part of the racks. If they're small, place them into your vinegar-water sink for cleaning. If they don't fit, wipe them down with a rag damp with the same vinegar solution.


Check for food bits! If any are stuck on, use a toothpick or similar small, sharp tool to pry away at what's been caked on.

, Look to make sure all the holes are open so that water can run through them freely. If you have this problem, those holes will need to cleaned in order for your dishwasher to run efficiently. Use fine pointed or needle-nose pliers if you have some; otherwise, try a toothpick or something similar. Take care not to scratch anything if you're using a tool with a metal point. Remember to take your time and be careful.


If these holes are very small, bend a fine wire with a tiny hook on one end. Thread the wire through the opening most distal from the center of the arm. Each time you do this a small amount of debris will come out.
Another option is to drill a much larger hole at the end of the arm. Run the washer to eject the matter, then plug the bigger hole with a stainless steel screw.

, This space doesn't get washed during the dishwasher cycle. Use a damp cloth and the vinegar solution (or, if you like, a bit of mild spray cleaner). An old toothbrush or other soft, household brush can help get into corners and up under the gasket, too.


Don't forget under the bottom of the door! In some dishwashers, this is a dead spot where water doesn't go, so it can accumulate debris. Wipe this off with your vinegar rag. If anything is caked on, bust out your scrub brush as necessary.

, Run a separate cycle from any acid cleaners you have used and never mix bleach with other cleaners or with dishwasher detergent. Bleach is a very strong chemical, both on you and on your dishwasher, so use it sparingly and only when necessary.

If mold and mildew is a problem, leave the dishwasher loosely open for a while after each cycle to allow it to dry out.
Avoid using bleach and detergents containing bleach if your dishwasher has a stainless steel interior or door.

, If your water has a lot of iron or rust in it, rust may be beyond your control. If possible, address the problem at its source. If the problem isn't rusty pipes, water softeners can remove a limited amount of iron from water but they mostly work by exchanging minerals that are hard to clean off surfaces for salts that are relatively easy to clean. Filters do exist to remove iron from water and might be worth looking into if your water is extremely high in iron.


Use a dishwasher-safe rust remover for the stains themselves, but seek out a professional to ask how they got there in the first place.If the finish is chipping or flaking off the wire baskets in your dishwasher, try a paint-on sealant made just for dishwasher racks. Pull out the racks and check the bottoms, too. If the damage is severe or widespread (not just a few tines but all of them), see if you can replace the entire rack. Online stores sell a wide variety of appliance parts, so your replacement part may be very easy to find.

, Once the grate, filter, arms, and all the insides have been given their thorough cleaning and the smaller parts have had a chance to soak, place them back in as normal. Or proceed to the next section -- if your dishwasher is really bad, you can take apart the bottom and really get down to business., Look for a plug under your sink. Make sure to unplug the dishwasher and not the garbage disposal! Follow the cord back to your dishwasher to make sure.


If your dishwasher is at all mobile, move it around to see the proper cord move.
Turn off the circuit breaker to be completely sure.
Look out for the heating element in the bottom, if it is still hot you will get a bad burn.

, Take care not to drop them! The cover of the filter will lift off, leaving the area exposed.


As you disassemble this section, take care to notice what you take off and where. Take photos along the way and set the pieces someplace safe, in the order they came off. When you start reassembly, there will be no question of what you should do.

, This is to prevent debris from getting in it as you clean it. You want the debris out of the dishwasher completely -- not clogging up the pipes even further.

, Be careful of handling broken glass if that is part of what you find here. Rubber gloves are a good idea, too.

Use a brush or a cloth to loosen and remove deposits. For dishwashers that have not been properly cleaned recently, you'll need a strong cleaning agent to get at the years of buildup.
Never use steel wool with soap, it embeds minute particles of iron and you will never make the rust go away.

, It'll be easiest to do the reverse of what you did to get it apart. Don't over-tighten the screws, especially if they are going into soft plastic.


You may want to give it a quick run to see if everything works like it should.

, It will help to prevent food and other debris from building up in there, reducing the need to clean it. Occasionally run it empty, too -- on the short, water-saving cycle, of course!, You will get cleaner dishes if the water starts hot. You can collect the water you run and use it for watering plants or other purposes. Run the water until what comes out of the tap feels hot.

Set the thermostat on your water heater to 120F (50C) . Water that is cooler than this won't be very effective for cleaning. Water that is hotter than this may scald people.

, The dishwasher drains into the same pipe as your sink, so that drain must be clear. If you're experiencing problems with your dishwasher, it may actually be stemming from your garbage disposal. Here are some applicable reads:

How to Maintain a Garbage Disposal

How to Fix a Garbage Disposal

, Place 2 cups of vinegar in the bottom of your dishwasher and run it on low, or the energy-saving setting. Halfway through, stop the dishwasher and let the vinegar soak on the bottom for 15 or 20 minutes.


After the time is up, turn it back on to finish. If it's really bad, you can let it soak overnight.
If smell is an issue, sprinkle 1/2 - 1 cup of baking soda around the bottom and run the washer as normal., Wipe it down with a sponge or soft cloth. Pay particular attention to the controls and the handle. Also, don't miss the little ledge between panels; they tend to collect dirt.

, Rinse aid helps to prevent spots on your dishes. Unscrew the round knob in the dishwasher door and pour in rinse aid according to package directions or your dishwasher's manual.


Don't use rinse aid if you have a water softener.Solid rinse aids are available. If you forget to refill liquid rinse aid, the solid ones are more visible, so they may help you remember.
If you prefer, some dishwasher detergents now have built-in rinse aid.

Some of the pieces, especially the spouts, may be difficult to pull apart, but make sure you separate all parts.Many of the sippy cup spouts will easily pull apart. Others may have special tabs or levers on the side of the spout that will pop them apart.
Other sippy cup spouts may need to be forced apart. For example, the Sistema Wave and Gripper Bottle Cap needs something like a butter knife to help pull the two parts of the spout apart.;
, Another way to check for mold is to break apart the anti-leak pieces of the cups. Many parents have found mold growing inside these pieces. Although you can detach the pieces and clean the outside, the inside is hard to get to in some sippy cups.You may need to take a hammer or other tool to the piece to get it to pop open or break apart. It depends on your type of sippy cup. For example, the Tommee Tippee sippy cups have an anti-leak spout which most parents had to break open to check for mold.The sippy cup will be unable to be used after breaking these parts of the cup.

, Some companies, like Tommee Tippee, are offering clear replacements for sippy cup valves. This allows for parents to be able to see any mold build up in the hard to clean anti-leakage spout.If your child has this type of sippy cup, you can contact the company and request a replacement valve.
When you buy a sippy cup, you can look for a sippy cup with clear parts. This will allow you to be able to see any mold that starts growing.

, According to the manufacturers of the sippy cup, mold can occur if the wrong kind of liquids are put in the cup. However, using correct liquids in the cup shouldn’t lead to mold.Recommended liquids include cold, thinner drinks, like water, milk, and juice without pulp.Liquids that shouldn’t be used in the sippy cups include formula milk that is thick, carbonated beverages, juice with a lot of pulp, and liquids that are hot.

, Manufacturers of sippy cups claim that liquids should not be left in the sippy cups for long periods of time. If liquids are left in the cup, even if they are cleaned later, mold may form.Think about how often you have cleaned your child’s sippy cup. Do you clean it right after she uses it? Do you leave liquids inside it for a long time?
If you think you have left liquid in the cup for long periods of time, consider tossing the cup and buying a new one. They are hard to clean after liquids have been left in them for a long time., Mold may occur in cups that have not been properly washed. It is recommended to thoroughly clean sippy cups after each use to prevent mold from building up. It is also recommended to take all sippy cup’s parts apart before each cleaning. Most cups can be washed in the dishwasher. You can also soak them in hot water. Consider washing them by hand with a brush to get inside hard to reach places.When you wash your cup, make sure you take it apart fully.
Follow the manufacturer’s recommended cleaning instructions. If your sippy cup does not come with one, go to the company’s website for videos on how to clean the cups.

, Proper washing and use may help you prevent mold in a sippy cup. However, if you are concerned about mold in your child's cup, you can buy new sippy cups every month or two. You can also switch to different types of cups that are less likely to mold.


You can buy disposable sippy cups. These cups have fewer parts, so they are easier to clean. Plus, they are cheap, around $3 for a pack of six.
If your child is old enough, switch your child to a straw. Straws may be better for your child since sippy cups have been linked to lisps and speech impediments., One major symptom of mold exposure is nasal problems. This includes a stuffy or runny nose. You child may also have a nosebleed due to this sinus irritation.Some people won’t be affected by mold. However, other people have allergies to molds and will develop symptoms due to exposure.
If you think your child may have mold in her sippy cup, switch it with a new one and monitor her for sickness.

, The most common problem associated with mold exposure is upper respiratory tract problems. Mold may cause difficulty breathing or asthma, or worse asthma if your child already has it.Another symptom could be tightness in the chest.
Your child may develop a cough or start wheezing.

, Mold exposure may cause a few other allergies or irritations in the face and head. Mold exposure can cause a sore throat and a headache.Mold may cause topical irritation, like a skin or an eye irritation.

, While you don’t want your child drinking out of a moldy cup, you shouldn’t panic if you find mold in your child’s sippy cup. If your child is allergic to mold, she may develop some mild, unpleasant symptoms. Limited exposure, however, shouldn’t cause any major illnesses.If your child develops symptoms connected to a moldy sippy cup, replace the cup and monitor your child’s symptoms. They should go away shortly after removing the source of the mold.

, If your child has symptoms related to mold, or you are worried about her wellbeing after discovering mold, you can take her to the doctor. You may consider waiting a few days after changing her cup before taking her to the doctor so you don’t waste a visit.


A check up by the doctor can ensure that your child is fine and that she did not get any secondary bacterial infections from the sippy cup.

Vacuum dusting will be sufficient for cleaning lightly dusty or dirty blinds.;
, Extend the suction hose on your vacuum cleaner and place a circular or rectangular brush attachment over the end. The brush attachment is excellent for serious dusting jobs due to its construction. The heavy bristles will dislodge dust as they sweep over the blinds and the hose will suction it up.If you don’t have a brush attachment for your vacuum cleaner, invest in one. They are indispensable for dusting tricky, hard to hit areas like horizontal blinds.

, Turn on the vacuum to a low suction setting. Start at the top of blinds and run the brush along their length, making sure to hit each slat. You may need to make several passes to remove thick dust.Don’t press against the blinds with the brush as you dust. A light sweeping motion with the bristles will suffice. Too much force may damage delicate slats.

, Rotate the stem to turn the blinds upward at an angle. Keep them slightly open. Suction as much dust as you can from the underside of the slats. Assuming your blinds don’t have a lot of built up dirt, grease or discoloration, this should be all you need to get them looking as good as new.

, Combine a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Take a microfiber towel or coarse washcloth and soak it in the soapy water solution. Wring out the excess water. The towel should be just slightly damp to help dust stick to it without wetting the blinds.Avoid using abrasive cleaners on blinds, even the synthetic types. Harsh chemicals can eat through the finish of the slats.
Wooden blinds, especially, should not get too wet. Standing water can soak into the wood and cause it to warp and discolor., With one hand, take hold of the outer edge of the top blind slat. Pinch the slat damp towel and drag your hand from one end to the other, cleaning the entire length. Repeat this process with each individual slat, moving from top to bottom, left to right. Go over particularly dirty spots as many times as needed.Stop and rinse the towel after every few slats to wash away the dust and grime that has built up on it. You may be surprised how much dirt you’ll pick up cleaning this way!
Grip the blind slats lightly to keep from bending them out of shape.

Take the blinds off of their setting.,
Close or unroll the blinds.,
Wipe the blinds with warm, soapy water.,
Spread out the blinds to dry.",How to Clean Horizontal Blinds3," Remove the blinds from their setting and take them down. The correct way to do this will vary depending on the type of blinds you have. It is necessary to take down fabric blinds in order to clean them because they will usually require more than a simple wipe down to clear away stains.Most of the time, blind settings and mountings will be fairly simple to figure out, but some types may be more complicated than others. If you’re uncertain how to remove your blinds, consult a professional.
Fabric blinds may need to be deep-cleaned more frequently than smoother varieties because their porous surfaces trap dirt and stains and don’t wipe clean as easily.

, Unfurl one-piece blinds and stretch them out. If you have fabric Venetian or “accordion”-style folding blinds, close or extend them but keep them from bunching or twisting to preserve their shape. Place the blinds on a broad, flat surface. Remove loose dust with a vacuum or dry duster.Use a vacuum with a brush head attachment to dust the blinds before cleaning them with soap and water.

, Fill the sink with warm water. Mix in a small amount of mild dish detergent. Soak a microfiber towel or washcloth in the soapy water and wring out the excess. Go over the spots on the blinds where dirt and grime have accumulated using a light blotting, wiping motion. Don’t scour the blinds, as this can harm the fabric.If the blinds you’re attempting to clean are brightly colored or made of a temperamental material, perform a color test by dabbing the fabric with the corner of a wet paper towel to see if the colors bleed before you clean them. If significant bleeding occurs, you may need to have them treated professionally.
Make sure the towel you’re using isn’t too wet when you begin wiping down the blinds. Too much moisture might oversaturate and damage the fabric., Lay out the damp blinds flat on the floor after cleaning them. Allow them to sit overnight or as long as it takes for them to dry completely. You may be able to speed up the drying process by leaving them in direct sunlight, turning placing them under a ceiling fan or keeping them sandwiched between two bath towels to help wick out the remaining water.Don’t wring out wet blinds by hand. This can cause the fabric to stretch or wrinkle.
Fabric blinds can be ironed to straight out wrinkles before you rehang them. When ironing folding blinds, take extra care to keep the creases even.

Check the manufacturer's label.,
Vacuum the drapes.,
Machine wash drapes if possible.,
Hand wash drapes when necessary.,
Air dry your drapes.",How to Clean Drapes1," To deep clean your drapes, remove them from the window and lay them on a flat surface. Remove any hardware from the drapes, such as wood polls, so you can focus on just cleaning the fabric.If your drapes are very dusty, open a window before removing them. This will prevent you from inhaling too much dust and debris.;
, There should be a manufacturer's label somewhere on the inside of your drapes. This should give you instructions on cleaning. Before washing your drapes, know what cleaning methods will not damage the drapes. Some drapes, for example, are hand wash only and others require dry cleaning.If you can't find a manufacturer's label, it's best to opt for professional cleaning. Professional dry cleaners will have a better sense than you of what kind of cleaning methods are safe for drapes.
Drapes are expensive, so it's important not to damage them in the cleaning process. Follow the instructions on the manufacturer's label carefully and never machine wash drapes that are hand wash only. Wool, cotton, and very sheer fabrics are usually not machine washable.

, Before washing your drapes with detergent and water, vacuum them to remove excess dust and debris. Lay your drapes flat on the floor. Run a vacuum over the drapes until your remove layers of dirt and dust. Use the crevice tool of your vacuum to get into any folds or hard to reach places.If your vacuum has a detachable upholstery brush, use this utensil to vacuum the drapes.
Sheer fabrics may not hold up under vacuuming. Remember to follow the instructions on the manufacturer's label and do not vacuum drapes if it advices against this. You can shake drapes outside if you cannot vacuum them.

, Some drapes are machine washable. Using a washing machine to wash your drapes can save you time and labor. Only wash one panel of drapes at a time. Use a gentle cycle and use cold water to wash drapes.Remove your drapes from the machine immediately after washing them to prevent wrinkling.

, Wool, cotton, and sheer fabrics like lace usually require hand washing. Never put hand wash only drapes in a washing machine, as this can cause damage. To hand wash drapes, fill a sink with cold water and add one teaspoon of liquid dish detergent. Place one panel at a time in the water. Allow the panels to soak for 10 minutes before removing them. Then, swirl the drapes to remove the debris. Drain the sink and refill it with clean water. Repeat the process to dry your drapes.Make sure to swirl your drapes until all soap residue is removed. If necessary, repeat the rinsing process twice.

Remove stubborn dust with a mild detergent and microfiber cloth.",How to Clean Faux Wood Blinds1," For routine dusting, start by closing the blinds completely. Run a feather duster or dry microfiber cloth over each slat, starting at the top corner and working your way down to the bottom slat. Open the blinds again and then close them in the opposite direction. Use the cloth to dust the slats on the other side.


Run a dryer sheet over the slats every couple of days to prevent dust from sticking to them.Avoid pushing dust into the cords running through the slats.;
, Close the blinds face down. Use one hand to hold the edge of the blinds steady, and use the other to vacuum. Start at the top corner and run the brush attachment from one side of the slat to the other. One pass is usually enough but, for extra dirty blinds, run the brush attachment back and forth across the slat.


Move down to the next slat and repeat the same actions.
Use the vacuum’s lowest setting. Too much suction can twist or damage the slats., After working your way down to the bottom of the first side with the brush attachment, flip the blinds so they’re facing the opposite direction. Start at the top again with the brush attachment and work your way down to the last slat. After you’ve cleaned all the slats, lift the blinds up and vacuum along the windowsill underneath them.

, Sometimes dust is too thick to whisk it away with a feather duster. If you live in a very humid climate, dust may settle on your blinds and stick to them. In these situations, mix a small amount of warm water with a mild detergent. Slightly dampen a microfiber cloth with the cleaning solution (don’t soak the cloth, you only need a small amount) and run it over each slat.Close the blinds in the opposite direction and repeat the same actions.

Add flashing to the roof.,
If BUR is legal as some cities do not allow BUR, especially on residences, then ""build up roofing"" layers held in place by mopping molten, hot tar or asphalt -- coal tar is a known carcinogen.Installing asphalt BUR roofing typically uses LP gas as heat, contributing to air pollution, and toxic, green-house gases are released during installation).,Cut a 12 inch (30.48 cm) starter strip to mop it down as the first row of the starting edge, often the lowest edge and working up to the higher elevated part of the roof.,
To apply the first coat of hot asphalt over the nailed felt base, spread the hot asphalt with a large mop -- as the felt is rolled out into the mopped hot ""cement"", one row at a time.,
Continue laying each row with a 24 inch (61 cm) overlap of the one before it, using full width felt, over the entire roof for the first complete layer.,
Hot mop each felt as the next layer is rolled on.,
Optional: Finish it by spreading crushed granite aggregate (called ballast/gravel) after you've installed all of the desired layers.",How to Replace a Flat Roof," There are five basic types. All require periodic inspection and can need maintenance to fix any punctures, tears, cracks or cuts. They are all in rolls of 1 yard (91.44 cm), or in 1 meter width (39.4 inches) except for Single-ply Membrane which come folded:


Built-up Roofing: This method, known simply as BUR, is done by overlapping rolls of treated felt using hot (molten) tar or asphalt. It becomes brittle and cracks up over the years.
Single-Ply Membrane Roofs: This type is excellent but requires propane torch heat to install the seams. The membrane may be injured, cut, etc. and with only the one layer that can be problematic.
Sprayed Polyurethane Foam: This kind of roofing material is sprayed, or squeegeed flowed onto the surface and may be protected by a special second coating.
Modified Bitumen (Asphalt) Roll Roofing: This is a method in which a single layer of asphalt-treated, granule coated felt is cold cement sealed or hot sealed to the primed decking or to a base sheet.
""SA"" Self-adhesive (SBS, APP or modified bitumen) rolls: These often include (1) both an SA base sheet and the SA cap sheet, both come in rolls -- or (2) only a single cap layer is applied to a primed decking. (The material has a split backing where after a length of it is rolled-out and aligned, then half the backing is pealed off and that half smoothed down; next the other half of backing is peeled and smoothed down as well.)

, Different roof types require different materials. The amount of each material depends on the surface area of the roof.

, Use a special scraper, square nose spade or shovel, or such to loosen the old roofing material., Check for and repair low areas because they will not drain well. The roof rafters are like joists; there is not much pitch, or incline, and they may warp and sag. Repair any sagging rafters and decking to prevent ponding/standing water. Some roofs have drains, such as having walls around the roof and have drains to be keep cleared and intact.

, Can't strips should have 2 45 degree cuts and be fitted into inside corners of the roof surface. The felt used in BUR cannot bend at right angles. The can't strips help ameliorate the problem.

, It is made of paper, polyester OR fiberglass saturated with asphalt. It is set down with a 2 to 4 inch (5 to 10 cm) seam, or overlap, between sheets.


Fasten the sheets with special (large, thin-headed) roofing nails (in appropriate length for your process and thickness of deck or sheathing), spaced about 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart along the overlapped edges and staggered 12 inches (30.48 cm) apart elsewhere (""in the field""). The edge of roof nailing of roofing (if required) is staggered (to not split deck) close, 2 inch (~ 5 cm) spacing.
Cut the base sheet to fit around vents in the roof and lay it over the can't strips.

, Flashes are material you apply around vents and other areas to prevent water damage. You can further protect the roof from water damage by applying plastic roofing cement at these sites.

, There are several types of felt you can use to replace your roof. Most are either coal-tar or asphalt saturated paper or fiberglass fibers (all may be called fabric or felt). The felt material comes in rolls that are 36 inches (91.44 cm) or 1M (39.4 inches) wide.


Read labels. Consider the type of roof and climate before choosing the felt and the asphalt, tar or other roof cement so that you select the correct types for your roofing process.;
,, Asphalt works to seal the asphalt-saturated felt to make the roof waterproof.


Mop and lay another strip 12 inches (30.48 cm) wide, over the first such strip, forming a double thick, starter edge-seam.
Mop full width felt over that double thick 12 inch starter across the roof.

,


Keep the asphalt at optimum temperature as the roll is unrolled onto the mopped, hot, liquid asphalt little by little. It is important to immediately roll felt paper into it to ensure effectiveness, as that hot liquid is the adhesive, and becomes less liquid and finally solidifies as it cools.

, You can repeat the entire process of laying the asphalt saturated felt and mopping each layer with hot asphalt 3, 4 or up to 5 layers over the entire roof.

, To do this, give the roof a heavy final coating of hot asphalt and then cover the entire surface with crushed-granite aggregate. The covering protects the roof from the effects of the sun, and helps protect the roof from objects such as fallen limbs.


Alternative covering: Sometimes the BUR roof is topped by spraying or rolling on a silver colored, metallic aluminum, asphaltic ""paint"".
Another alternative: White elastomeric (rubbery) plastic coating may be used to cover the BUR.

Position the spray applicator of a can of compressed air at the mouth of a cell. Press the applicator and spray air through each cell to clear out bugs and dust.


In some cases, this may cause dust and bugs to fly out the opposite end of the shade. You may want to lay down a drop cloth or newspaper to catch ejected matter and contain a potential mess.
You can also spray the outer fabric of your shades with compressed air as a dusting measure. Spray each row/pleat of the fabric from top to bottom, end to end with the compressed air.If you don’t have compressed air, you can use a blow dryer set to “Low” on “Cool.” Avoid using hot air, which can cause the glue used to make the shade to weaken.;
, Alternately, you can substitute a lint roller or feather duster in place of the microfiber cloth. Apply cleaning tools to the shades in a side to side motion. Follow the direction of the pleating to prevent the fabric from becoming deformed or misshapen.Use gentle, short strokes when wiping your shades with a cloth, duster, or lint roller. Take your time when wiping, dusting, or rolling the fabric. Too much force could deform its appearance.
The microfiber cloth dry-wipe, feather dusting, and lint rolling are ideal cleaning measures for regular, light cleanup and dust reduction. , Apply your brush attachment to the shades in the same fashion you wipe with a cloth or roll with a lint roller: side to side. Clean the shade from top to bottom to prevent yourself from accidentally knocking dust onto lower parts of the shade.Ideally, you should only vacuum your cellular shades on the medium or low setting of your vacuum. Vacuums that are too powerful should not be used, as the suction of these can deform your shade.
This cleaning technique works best for gently but thoroughly lifting dust and dirtiness out of the fabric of the shades. If this technique fails, you’ll likely have to wash the dirty area of your shades., If your cellular shade is equipped with a track on its sides, this will have to be cleaned regularly as well. Dust, dead insects, and other grime builds up in the track over time. Use a clean rag dampened with warm water and a mild detergent, like dish soap, to wipe the tracks clean.Tracks that are narrow may be difficult to clean inside. Use a narrow tool, like a screwdriver, to push your rag into the track to clean it.
Cotton swabs are usually small enough to fit easily into side tracks. Dab the cotton end of the swab into warm water mixed with liquid dish soap, then clean the track. Replace dirty swabs as necessary with fresh ones.

Coastal areas that experience higher winds and hurricanes have different requirements for load and structural design than more centralized locations. If you live on the coast and want to roof your own house, you need to take extra care to obtain the proper permits to ensure the safety of your project.;
, Check with your local government agency regarding the need for a building permit before re-roofing your house. Permits are often offered by the Building Services Department of the city you live in.Generally, you'll be able to get the project approved over the counter if you provide:


Proof of property ownership
Permit application worksheet (provided)
A statement of repair, stating that you'll replace the roof you remove to keep the building up to code
Construction drawings
Elevation drawings

, Shingles are available in many varieties, some of which are more appropriate for particular climates and roof styles. Pick something that works in your area, on your house, and with your particular style of project.Asphalt shingles are the most common type of roofing shingle. They're quite durable, and can last for 20 or 30 years in the right conditions. Reinforced with fiber glass, asphalt shingles often feature dabs of roofing agent or tar that stick to the shingles above it.

Slate shingles are the heaviest and most durable shingle you can buy. Because they break easily, require special pressure cutters to cut, and are about three times heavier than other shingles, using slate on your roofing project is only recommended if you're an experienced roofer looking for a challenge. Slate roofs are great if you want to create a unique and durable roof for your house and are willing to make the extra effort.

Laminated shingles look somewhat like slate tiles, but are really layered asphalt shingles. They're similar, but somewhat more thick, to asphalt shingles, so working with them would be a similar project. If you like the look of slate, but want to make the job a bit easier, consider these types of shingles.

Wood shingles are often hand-split shakes of cedar, spruce, or pine. Common in New England coastal regions, wood shingles allow for expansion and a natural weathering look that some people really enjoy. They need to be spaced slightly differently to account for expanding, but these types of shingles will typically last 30 years if installed properly.

, The surface area that shingles cover is defined as a square of 100 square feet (9.29 square meters). However, shingles are normally sold in bundles, with 3 bundles usually required to cover 1 square.


To figure the number of bundles to purchase, measure the length and width of each section of the roof and multiply them together to get the area. Add the areas of each section together, then divide by 100 to get the number of squares the roof consists of. Multiply this number by 3 to get the number of bundles you'll need to buy.

, This will help determine how the shingles will lay on the roof width. Most asphalt shingles are 3 feet (91.4 centimeters) in length. If your roof's width is not an even multiple of the shingle's length, you will have a partial piece on one end of each row.


The bottom row of shingles must hang past the edge of the roof. For a wood shingle roof you would have to cut the shingles that go on the edge to create a straight line to accommodate this.

, Many roofs are at a high pitch and require roofing jacks to make the job safe. Scaffolding and toe boards help to secure the area on and around the roof to keep dropped tools and equipment from sliding off the roof and hitting passers-by.


Set 2 x 10 jacks about 3 feet (0.9 m). up from the edge of the roof. Make sure you wear a good pair of rubber-soled boots to keep your traction while working on the roof. Work glasses and gloves are also useful., It's useful to rent a large trash container to throw the old shingles into. usually, this costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $200. If you keep it as close as possible to the house and cover AC units, porches, and other things you don't want to dent or litter with roofing nails and other debris, you can cut down on clean-up time later.

, Use a garden fork or a specially-designed roofing shovel to work your way under the shingles and pull them off more quickly, or you can go by hand and use a hammer. Pry up the nails, loosening the ridge caps first and then the shingles and shoveling them off toward the roof jacks. Take frequent breaks to shovel them off into the garbage. Don't worry about getting all the nails at first, some of them will come up with the shingles and some won't.


This is usually the most physically-demanding and dirty part of the job, so make sure you plan for enough time and elbow grease to get it done. The shingles are often heavy and grimy, so don't let them pile up too much before shoveling them off the roof from the jacks and into the garbage.
Be extremely careful with your footing and make sure to work in pairs. Consider investing in a safety harness if you're on a particularly tall roof.

, Some roofers will reuse the metal flashing if it's good shape, in which case you'd want to carefully remove the nails and pry it up. Flashing in the valleys is almost always trashed, though, so be judicious. Consider replacing all of it while you're in the middle of the project. If it looks suspect, toss it and install new flashing.

, Sweep the roof as clean as possible, taking the time to remove any stray nails that didn't come up in the removal of the shingles. Reattach loose boards in the sheathing. Examine the sheathing for damage and rotted boards, replacing the damaged sections accordingly.

, This underlayer will serve as a temporary weather barrier. If you have gutters, you'll want the ice and water barrier to cover all of the gutter flashing that's on the roof. Tack it at the top with staples every few feet to hold it in place. Once the entire section is tacked along the chalk line, lift up the bottom part, peel off the backing, then let it fall back into place. The ice and water barrier will immediately stick to the roof.


Unroll and staple down 30-lb. felt over the rest of the roof. Use plenty of staples (5/16 in.) to make the felt safer to walk on and keep it from blowing off. This is where the hammer-type stapler (about $30) pays off., Use tin caps, approximately 2 inch (5 cm) round metal discs, under roofing nails to keep felt from tearing and blowing away, if there might be wind before shingles are put on.


Keep the paper lined up straight by snapping a chalk line on the roof deck using marks measured up from the bottom. Do not use the bottom of the roof as a straight line. Doing so will most likely cause you to get the paper crooked, leaving you with wrinkles in the material. Allow the felt to extend 1/4 inch (6.5 mm) to 3/8 inch (1 cm) at the bottom roof edge.

, Use roofing nails, spaced 12-inches (30-cm) apart, extending 1/4 inch (6.5 mm) to 3/8 inch (1 cm) beyond the edge of the roof, over the felt paper.

, Nail this down as you did the drip molding. Flashing either comes premade, bent to fit or flat and ready to be cut.


Some roofers like to salvage old flashing that's reusable. Valley flashing is almost always worn out, but use your judgment to see if it's still in good shape. Generally, you'll want to replace it.

, Use the chalk marks to maintain straight course lines for the shingles.

, Follow the chalk lines, nailing your shingles down at intervals of 6 inches (15 cm). Space each nail 3 inches (7 cm) from the top edge of the shingle. Depending on the kind of shingles you purchase there may be a special starter row of shingles or a roll of strip material that you cut to the length of your roof.


If you're using 3 tab shingles, put in your nails about 3/4 inch (1.8 centimeters) above the cutouts, near where the tab meets the upper part of the shingle. Also place a nail 2 inches from each end of the shingle, in line with the other two. In all, you'll use four nails for each 3-tab shingle to make them secure.







, Snap a horizontal chalk line over the starting row to use as a guide and remove the plastic strips on the back of the shingles in the package. Cut six inches off the length of the first starter shingle nailed on, then use the rest of them full size. Shifting them in this way will join the ends of the first regular row of shingles placed over the starter shingles.


Alternatively, you can use a starting row of full-sized shingles by turning them with the tabs pointing upward.

, Set the first shingle of the second row back a half tab, 6 inches (17 centimeters), from the edge of first shingle on the first row and so that the bottom of its tabs just touches the tops of the cutout slots on the shingle below. This 1/2 tab has to be cut off where it hangs off the left edge of the gable roof.


Continue laying your shingles in this same basic manner, trimming shingles to fit the extra space you leave at the end of each row. Leave space around vents, chimneys, and flashing to take extra time around those areas.

, Cut a square of flashing that extends about 6 inches from the pipe, with a hole in the center big enough for the pipe to fit through. Shingle over the flashing, using adhesive to hold it in place, and cut a special shingle to fit over the pipe and finish the job.


Vent pipe ""boots"" (really just flashing) are available that you can slide over vent pipes, offering added protection. A rubber gasket makes it fit snugly and keep the joint from leaking.To shingle around chimneys, cut several strips of flashing to bend and create a joint between the wall of the chimney's outside edge and the roof. Install them into place normally and shingle up to the edge of the flashing. Use roofing adhesive and shingle over the flashing as normal.

, Use roof adhesive cement at any exposed nails per manufacturer's instructions. Ridge shingles or caps are used to connect your courses on one side and the next, finishing the peaks with a uniform look.


While pre-formed ridge caps are recommended, it's also possible to cut and form your own ridge shingles from regular three-tab shingles. Cut them to size and fold them over the peaks, installing as normal., Roofing results in a lot of mess, so it's important to save enough time in the job to clean up sufficiently afterward. Nails, stray shingle pieces, and other debris will probably be littering the yard and surrounding area of the house, all of which can be dangerous if left laying around.


Some roofers keep roller magnets (sort of like analog metal detectors) to roll around and pick up stray nails. You can sometimes rent these from roofing suppliers, or even borrow them for a couple hours to make sure any dangerous nails are out of the way., If you've gone to all the effort to put a new roof on your house properly, pencil in a regular inspection to make sure it stays up to snuff. Wait for warm weather days to inspect and also do an inspection after a period of rain to check for leaks or other issues. Especially in areas with high winds and nasty weather, it's very important for any homeowner to haul out the ladder and carefully check their roof.

, Metal is especially susceptible to the elements. Examine any exposed flashing for signs that it might be wearing some and re-caulk any effected areas.

, Properly-laid shingles should stay relatively flush throughout their lifespan, but will start to blister and curl up at the edges as they start to wear. This shouldn't be a problem for the first several years, unless some of them were loosely installed. It's a good idea to go over and reattach any shingles that appear to be come up loose.


Hammer any loose nails back, or pull them out and use new roofing nails to secure the shingles. Keep your roofing adhesive for patch-up jobs later on and add a little dab here and there where it's necessary. Seal any flashing you see coming up with caulk.

, Mosses and lichens are the bane of the roof's existence. They harbor moisture and can decrease the life span of your shingles. Brush dead moss away with a broom and consider applying a commercial ""moss killer"" (usually in the neighborhood of $30) to the roof.For a natural alternative, sprinkle your roof with baking soda. Some moss killers have copper oxide or zinc that are harmful to the groundwater, not to mention pets and other animals. Sprinkling some baking soda on areas prone to moss build-up helps to keep the moss at bay., When your shingles start to wear out, you'll start seeing the little protective beads from the shingles come off in the rain and end up in the gutters. This is a sign that the shingles are nearing the end of their life span and will need replaced soon, because they're no longer able to stand up to the sun's UV rays. Start planning for another re-roofing.

, Inside your house, keep an eye out for signs that you might have a leak. It's best to catch it as early as possible before it becomes a major structural problem for your house. If you have a leak, consider getting a roofer's assessment and determine what fixes need to be made. Look for:


Paint peeling under overhangs
Damp or dark areas on the ceiling or around fireplaces
Water stains around any vents

"
"
Locate the source of the leak.,
On the roof, look in the suspect area.,
Recognize the signs of a shingle problem:


a shingle is entirely missing






a shingle is ripped






a nail head is misplaced, and visible to your eye (all nail heads should be hidden under other shingles).







,
Recognize the signs of a flashing problem:

flashing has pulled away from masonry or pipes






flashing is missing






flashing has corroded because of galvanic reaction with nails; etc.,
Wait for warm weather.,
Take off the shingle.,
Slide a new shingle into place.,
Carefully bend back the two overlapping shingles in the upper course.",How to Repair a Pitched Roof," If the leak is through an unfinished ceiling, look at the rafters and sheathing and look for the drip. The source on the outside will either be in the corresponding location, or uphill from there. If the leak is through a finished ceiling, the location of the flaw is less clear - the drip could be coming through shingles at one point, and then moving along rafters or other structural members, before staining the Sheetrock. Once up on the roof, you'll have to inspect a larger area.;
, The flaw will likely either be a missing or damaged shingle, or damaged flashing (sheet metal that connects features like chimneys, pipes, etc., into the waterproof structure of the shingles).

,, If the problem is flashing, that should be covered in a different article.







, (but not too warm) If there's a problem with the shingle, wait until a warm day, or better yet try to do the job in the morning before the roof gets too warm but cool enough that the adhesive strip on 3-tabs and built up types are not sticking so aggressively. Use a shingle ripper (a long bar with a hook on one end) to reach *under* the damaged shingle, and grab on to one nail that holds the shingle down. Use the shingle ripper to rip the shingle free of the nail / shear off the nail. There will be four or more nails per shingle. Normal asphalt shingles are ""three tab"" type, or built up ""Heritage"" type, or ""T-Locks"": there will be one nail above each tab-division slit, and one at each end of the shingle on the three tab type, one at each end and two nails equally spaced in the field on the ""Heritage"" type (Note: This type of shingle is becoming ever more popular. It is a built up type of shingle without any slits or cutouts or tabs. Because it has no tabs if an odd length is required to fill a space it can be cut to fit without affecting the roofing pattern), and one nail above the slit on the ""T-locks"" type. All nails will be in a row, about one inch further up the shingle from the ""weather"" portion. That is the nails on a shingle are always covered by the shingle in the next higher row. As each shingle is nailed down the nail not only penetrates that shingle, it also penetrates the shingle underneath-the shingle from the previous row. That means you not only remove the nails from the desired shingle, you also have to remove the nails from the shingle/s above it.

, Once all of the nails holding the defective shingle have been removed, remove the shingle. Pull out any broken or flawed bits, then wipe the area clean.

, The tabbed end of the shingle goes downhill; the other end, which usually has less granulated material on it, goes uphill. If the shingle is too wide, it can be trimmed with a utility knife. Put the shingle on a hard surface (NOT the roof that you're trying to repair!) upside down, then score it with the knife. Break away and discard the excess. Remove a tad more than necessary to get it to fit! You don't want it jammed and too tight because when it gets hot it will tend to buckle. A good 1/8"" gap on each end is fine.

, Use four high quality galvanized roofing nails (short, with broad heads). Tap them gently through the new shingle, in the location described above (note that most new shingles have a thin strip of asphalt like material on the top side, running left to right. Your nails MUST be further uphill than this line.

Know your stairs.,
Find the squeak.,
Have a partner.",How to Quiet Squeaky Stairs1," Expect them to consist of three main parts: treads, risers, and stringers. A tread is the horizontal piece of wood that you actually step on. A riser is the vertical piece of wood rising from the back of each tread. Stringers are the framework that your treads and risers rest on.Expect your staircase to have at least three stringers: one on each side of your staircase, plus one running down its middle.
Very wide stairs may have additional stringers for extra support.;
, Walk up and down the stairs. When a stair squeaks, test the whole tread by stepping along each part of it, from front to back and side to side. Determine exactly where the squeak is originating from. Expect it to be caused by a gap that is beginning to grow between the stairs’ parts at that precise spot. This gap allows the stair to grow loose, so that one part rubs against another and/or the nails or screws holding them together.If you don’t have access to the underside of your stairs, locating the riser by sight is easy, but finding the stringers requires your ear. Gently tap the tread with a hammer. When one area sounds duller than the rest, this indicates a stringer running below.Expect each stringer to be about 1.5 to 2 inches thick (3.8 to 5.1 cm)., If you have access to the underbelly of your stairs, have them find the squeak by walking up and down the stairs. Stand under the stairs so you can see and/or hear when a step moves and squeaks.Save yourself some time instead of running up and down the stairs to repair each squeak as you find them.

Clean spills from the laminate flooring as soon as they occur.,
Don’t use a vacuum with rotary brush heads.,
Make repairs quickly.",How to Protect Laminate Flooring," Furniture tends to move slightly across flooring with daily use. Pads will help prevent the bottom of your furniture or other sharp parts from scraping or scratching against your laminate flooring. You can purchase pads made out of several different types of materials, like felt, plastic, carpet, and cane. You can purchase protector pads from most home improvement and flooring stores.Purchase protector pads, or discs, with adhesive on one side that you can stick to the bottom of your furniture.
Periodically examine the felt protector pads you attached. The pads may need to be replaced when the felt becomes compressed due to regular wear of the furniture.;
, “Lanes” can often form in areas of laminate flooring that are often used. Rugs or carpets can be placed in areas with heavy foot traffic to avoid this problem. You can place rugs under furniture to prevent scratches and scrapes from marring the laminate flooring, too. Rugs can also be placed in areas that are likely to come into contact with water, like under the kitchen sink.Place rubber or non-slip pads beneath your rugs in heavy foot traffic areas to prevent them from sliding around.

, Dirt, pebbles, and sand from shoes can easily scratch laminate flooring. Putting mats at your doorways can prevent this from happening. This will allow you, your family, or other visitors to wipe their feet before entering your home. You can also place mat at other areas in the home that are at risk of being scratched by debris .You can enforce a rule that bans people from wearing shoes inside your home, which may help eliminate any debris that is tracked onto the laminate flooring from shoes.

, Chairs are probably the most often moved pieces of furniture in the home, especially those at kitchen tables and desks. Take the plastic casters off of the chairs and replace them with rubber wheels. This will prevent scratching and damage to the floor.Make sure to buy soft rubber wheels. You can buy this online from websites like castercity.com, and from many home improvement and office stores., Do not drag or push furniture across the floor when you move it around. Instead, lift the furniture if possible. Lifting your furniture will prevent the scratches and scuff-marks that can be caused by dragging your furniture. If the furniture can’t be lifted, it is also an option to place slide it across the floor with something underneath it.Do not do any lifting on your own if you feel that the furniture is too heavy. Ask a friend or family member for help.

, If you have difficulty moving large or heavy pieces of furniture, place plastic discs with padding on one side (also known as furniture sliders or moving discs) underneath your furniture. These discs will allow large and heavy furniture to glide across the laminate flooring without causing damage. Soft, thick towels or heavy blankets can also be placed underneath heavy or large furniture as an alternative to plastic discs.Ask friends or family to help you with lifting furniture that is too large or heavy for you to move by yourself.

, This will prevent your laminate flooring from warping due to the expansion or contraction of the laminate flooring materials. Use a humidistat to measure the humidity levels in your home. You may already have a humidistat built into your thermostat or humidifier, or you can purchase one from a retail store that specializes in home repair.Use a humidifier during dry conditions to prevent your laminate flooring from shrinking, and use an air conditioner or dehumidifier in wet conditions to prevent your flooring from expanding.

, Long nails on your pet can cause extra damage to the floor. Make sure to keep your pet’s nails trimmed, but do not cut them so low that it injures the animal. Take your pet to a groomer, or trim your pet's nails using nail clippers designed for use on pets.You should also check the pet’s paws when they come from outside to inside and remove any dirt and/or gravel.

, Wet mopping will cause extra water to seep into the floor, which will damage it over time. Mopping with water should also be avoided because soap and detergent based cleaners used with wet mopping damages laminate. Instead, purchase a spray on cleaner specially made for laminate floors and wipe the floors with a cloth, or use a dry mop.Manufacturers of laminate flooring will often put out their own brands of cleaning products. It is best to use what is specifically made for your type of flooring.
Generic brands are sold at supermarkets and flooring stores. Generic brands are typically okay to use, though you should test it on a small spot of your floor first.

, This will prevent liquids from entering any cracks or joints in your flooring, which can eventually weaken your laminate flooring or cause it to warp. Use a soft cloth or mop to clean up spills instead of an abrasive sponge or other material that can scratch your flooring. Clean it up with the cloth alone, or with a cleaning product recommended by the manufacturer of your flooring if possible.If you are required to use a cleaning product other than water to clean up spills and can’t find a product made by your manufacturer, use a commercial window cleaner that does not contain ammonia. Ammonia contains properties that may strip away the protective sealant from the laminate flooring.

, Do not use a vacuum with a rotary brush or beater bar head on laminate floors. These types of heads can damage the flooring. Instead, use a felt or brush type vacuum. Before vacuuming, check to make sure the wheels are clean and haven’t collected any dirt or grit.Vacuum and sweep daily to minimize the amount of dirt and grit on the floors.

, You can repair minor damage on your own by purchasing a repair kit made specifically for laminate floors. Kits will typically be made up of silicon filler and wax sticks. More extensive damage may require a replacement of tiles or planks. It is best to seek a professional for extensive damage that will require replacement.Companies like Precision, Liberon, and Picobello offer laminate repair kits.You can buy repair kits at home improvement stores and online from websites such as Amazon.

Clean the subfloor as necessary.,
Ensure that the subfloor is as level as possible.,
Check the moisture level of the subfloor.,
Assess the subfloor's structural integrity.,
Proceed with the flooring installation.",How to Prepare a Subfloor for Hardwood," Before installing the hardwood flooring, the subfloor must be as clean as possible. Spilled paint, adhesives, or other coatings, as well as dust and debris, can mar the flooring installation if not cleaned away.


If you will glue your hardwood flooring down, the subfloor must be completely clean. Any coatings of paint or adhesive should be sanded away with an electric sander. Extra care should be taken to vacuum away dust created from the sanding.
If you will be installing nail-down, floating, or locking hardwood, you do not need to sand away spills and coatings. Simply use a vacuum to remove all dust and dirt.;
, A level subfloor will ensure that your hardwoods fit together neatly and do not creak or sag.


Use a long spirit level to check the levelness of the subfloor in multiple areas and in multiple directions. A good guideline is that only 3/16 inch (4.7 mm) of height variation is permissible per 10 feet (3 m) of floor length.
High spots can be sanded down with an electric sander. For especially difficult or large areas, a special floor sander will be more suited to the task.
Low spots should be filled in with cementitious leveling compound. However, this compound is not appropriate for nail-down applications, as the nails can cause the compound to crack and crumble. Consult the flooring manufacturer's directions for filling low spots in this case.

, Excess moisture in the subfloor can cause hardwood floors to warp, while excessively dry subfloors can lead to cracked, creaky floors. You should assess the moisture level of the subfloor before installing the hardwood.


This process is best done with a moisture test kit, which can be purchased in the flooring section of a home improvement store. These kits usually consist of a test strip that you place on the floor and cover with a plastic enclosure. The test strip will change color depending on the subfloor's moisture content.
If the subfloor's moisture content is not within the acceptable range, consult the flooring manufacturer's instructions for possible solutions. The safest route in this case is to install a different type of flooring with a higher tolerance for moisture levels.

, The subfloor's job is to spread the load of everything in the room (including the flooring, furnishings, and people) evenly across the floor joists. It should be structurally sound before the hardwood flooring is installed.


Check to make sure none of the plywood sheets are loose or squeaky. If they are, screw them into the floor joists until they are firmly secured.
Determine the thickness of the plywood subfloor. A thicker subfloor will be more stable; your flooring manufacturer will have recommendations for subfloor thickness. Typically, plywood subfloors should be 3/4 inch (2 cm) or thicker. You can check this thickness easily by drilling a small hole through the subfloor.

, Once your subfloor is clean, dry, level, and structurally stable, you can install the hardwood floors. Make sure to install a moisture barrier underneath the flooring if specified by the manufacturer.

Sweep out all dirt and debris.,
Prepare a previously painted floor.,
Degrease the floor.,
Protect the walls.",How to Refinish a Garage or Basement Floor1," Make sure to get all the corners of the garage or basement floor clean, as well. Use a small paint brush to sweep dirt from corners.;
, If the floor already has a coat of old paint, you will need to rough up the surface. Sand the floor to scuff up the glossy surface, and sweep away all dust and debris.

, Use a floor degreaser to remove all old stains from oil, antifreeze or any other substances on the floor. Rinse the cleaner with water, and let the surface dry thoroughly.

, Put up plastic protective sheet on the walls around the entire floor to protect them from the epoxy coating you will paint on the floor.


Use the duct tape test to make sure the floor is completely clean before painting it. Stick a piece of duct tape to the floor. If there is any dirt on the bottom when you pull it off, sweep and clean it again.

Stick a shim into tiny gaps.,
Use glue for longer gaps.,
Support the tread with extra wood.",How to Quiet Squeaky Stairs2," When your partner steps on a tread and causes a squeak, look for a gap between the tread and riser or the tread and stringer. If you see a small one, worm a shim’s thinner edge in between the two parts.Use a hammer to gently tap the thicker end until the shim is firmly in place. Be careful to insert the shim only far enough to fill the existing gap. Avoid driving it in to the point that the thicker end begins to separate the stairs’ parts even more.
For extra security, apply carpenter glue to both sides of the shim before inserting.
A shim may also be referred to as a wedge.

, If you find that the gap under the tread stretches along the entire length of the riser or stringer, or almost the entire length, use carpenter glue or construction adhesive to fill the space. Tell your partner to step off of the tread. Insert the nozzle into the gap if you can. If not, draw a bead of glue along its length and then push the glue into the gap with any long object that is thin enough to fit into the gap.Carpenter glue and construction adhesive are different products. Carpenter glue typically works best for wood-on-wood projects. However, in this instance, construction adhesive is also suitable if your stairs are exposed to a lot of moisture, since its formula is more water-resistant than carpenter glue.Place a heavy object on top of the tread while the glue dries so it is flush against the stringer or riser underneath.

, If the stringer or riser has lost its original shape due to wear-and-tear or warping, give the tread a fresher piece of wood to rest on. Cut a wooden board to the length needed. Use carpenter glue or construction adhesive to line the side that will make contact with the tread. Place the board flat against the stringer or riser, with the top pressed flush against the tread. Then nail or screw the board into the stringer or riser.This method is only meant to eliminate gaps caused by slight warping or wear-and-tear, not to reinforce the strength of weak stairs.

"
"
Apply lubricant between boards.,
Use nails to tighten gaps.,
Buy a kit to deal with carpeted stairs.",How to Quiet Squeaky Stairs3," If each step to your stair is made of more than one wooden board, the squeak may be caused by those two pieces rubbing against each other. In this case, pour lubricant in between them. With a clean cloth, use your foot or hand to rub the lube further in.Suitable lubricants for this method include: powdered graphite, powdered soapstone, and talcum powder.

, Place a heavy object on either side of the area that squeaks so the tread makes contact with the stringer or riser below. Use two 8- or 10-penny finish nails to secure the tread in place. To ensure that it remains flush with the stringer or riser over time, hammer the nails in at 45 degrees, with the sharp end of each one pointed toward the other.First, mark two spots on the tread, along the stringer or riser underneath, to drill starter-holes for your nails.
Make sure these spots are separated by a wide enough margin so that the nails don’t intersect.
Using a drill-bit with a smaller diameter than your nails, use a drill to create a shallow starter-hole for the tip of each nail.
Hammer the nails in until their heads are slightly lower the tread’s surface.
Use wood putty to cover the nail heads and fill in the dents.

, Ideally, time your house projects so that you can repair squeaky stairs while replacing carpet. If this isn’t possible, find a kit for screwing through carpeting. Such kits come with screws, drill bits, and a tripod device specially designed for this task.Set the tripod on the tread where it needs to be screwed to the stringer or riser underneath.Place one of the scored screws into the hole at the tripod’s center.
Drill the screw through the center of the hole, through the carpet and tread, into the stringer or riser.
Pick the tripod up and find the screw head sticking out of the carpet.
Use the tripod’s screw gripper to break off the specially designed screw head, in the same manner you’d remove a bottle cap with a bottle opener.

Check all areas of your home for places where warm air could leak into your attic and plug up any areas or gaps that you find to prevent this.

,
Cover any attic hatchways with a layer of stiff polystyrene insulation.

,
Ensure that your attic is properly ventilated and that you have sufficient insulation to prevent further ice dams from forming from the warmer attic air.

,
In warmer seasons, you can re-shingle sections of the roof... and place an ice/moisture barrier membrane under your new shingles to prevent water entering into your attic.

Pour the etching mixture over a 10-by-10-foot (3-by-3 m) section.,
Work in the etching solution.,
Rinse the etching solution off the floor.",How to Refinish a Garage or Basement Floor2," A plastic watering works well for pouring the solution on the concrete. Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands while etching the floors.


All newly poured concrete or bare concrete floors must be etched for the garage or basement epoxy coating to stick properly.

,, Start in a corner away from the door to avoid working yourself into a corner.

, Work a bristly utility broom back and forth in one direction. Then scrub the same area a second time, working the etching solution across the same area perpendicular to the first direction. Etch the entire garage in small sections.

, Start in the farthest corner, rinsing the floor until it is completely clear of etching solution. Let the floor dry for at least 4 hours.

Identify the type of vinyl floor covering involved.,
Evaluate the scope of the damage.,
Fill in scratches and cuts using a simple sealing product.,
Remove the damaged section of vinyl.,
Clean the exposed floor before proceeding with the patch.,
Install the vinyl flooring patch.,
Seal the patch.",How to Patch a Vinyl Floor," The covering may be vinyl tiles that are laid in a specific pattern or sheet vinyl that forms a rug covering the expanse of the floor. Keep in mind that vinyl rugs are often thinner than tiles and may require more delicate handling during the repair process.;
, The exact process used will vary, depending on the condition of the floor covering. Problems like scratches or cuts can be managed quickly while burns or larger tears will require removal and replacement of the tile or rug section.

, For deep scratches, you may be able to patch the vinyl flooring by simply cleaning the area with a good quality sealing compound, also known as liquid seam sealer. By cleaning the section with lacquer thinner, any residue collected in the cracks is removed, making it possible to fill them with the sealing compound. The dried seam provides a secure patch and will be relatively hard to notice.

, When the area is severely ripped or burned, use the utility knife to cut out the damaged section of the vinyl rug. Alternatively, use the knife blade to carefully pry and loosen the edges of the damaged tile. Once the damaged section is loose, remove from the space and discard.

, Using lacquer thinner will help remove any residue of tile or the underside of the vinyl rug, as well as rid the area of any adhesives applied when the vinyl was installed. Follow up with a little soap and water to make sure all the residue is removed, and then allow the area to air dry.

, Apply a thin layer of vinyl adhesive to the exposed area. Then slide the patch or replacement tile into position. Make sure no adhesive product leaks from the edges onto the surrounding floor covering. To aid in creating the seal and prevent curling, place a book or other heavy object on the section.

, A thin layer of vinyl lacquer applied to the surface once the adhesive has dried will give the new section a similar patina as the rest of the flooring. As a result, the vinyl floor patch will blend in easily, making it difficult to tell the repaired section from any other area of the floor covering.

Determine the size of the pieces you need to replace.,
Visit a lumberyard, home-improvement store, floor-covering store or mill workshop.,
Research a stain color that will match your floor, at a home improvement store.,
Bore a hole through each end of the damaged board that is about 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, using a sharp spade bit on your drill.,
Using a straight edge, draw lines connecting the right edges of the holes and then connecting the left edges.,
Take your circular saw and adjust the blade so that the depth of the cut you will make will be equal to the thickness measurement of the boards.,
Remove the blade guard, place the nose of the saw down at the top edge of the line.,
Use your hammer and chisel to pry out the middle section.,
Trim a new board using a saw.,
Use a urethane adhesive on the tongue of the new board and on the tongue and groove of the surrounding boards.,
Stain the replacement board until it matches the surrounding boards.",How to Patch a Damaged Hardwood Floor," Locate a threshold or a heat register and lift it out. Measure the thickness and width of the board. Next measure the length of the piece you want to remove.;
, Buy pieces of wood that match your flooring measurements. You want to buy pieces that are the same width, but they do not have to be the same length, since you will cut them down. The board should be retrofitted with grooves to fit into place in your floor. If not, you will bevel the board using a saw.

, Test them on scrap boards and compare against your floor. Buy a polyurethane finish. You will stain after the work has been completed.

, Upon installation, tongue and grove hardwood floors are locked into place; this step will allow you to remove them.

, This is where you will plunge cut with your circular saw.

, Wear eye protection and plug the saw into an outlet.

, Raise the saw above the floor, turn it on and then cut along the right line. Then, cut along the left line.

, Carefully, lop off the remaining edges. You do not want to hit the surrounding floorboards. The tongue section is nailed in place, so you must remove it in small pieces and then use the hammer to remove the nails. Remove any remaining parts of the tongue. This is likely to be the hardest part of the process.

, Measure carefully to make sure it is a perfect rectangle. The tongue will fit into the existing tongue groove. However, the other end will drop into place, rather than fit into the tongue. Remove a section of the groove using your saw or a chisel. Test the board.

, Place the new board in the empty space. Tap it into place by using a scrap of wood for protection. Cut a sheet of wax paper and place it above the board, then use heavy books to weight it down.

, Cover with 2 coats of polyurethane varnish using a foam applicator to avoid getting varnish or stain on other floorboards. Some floors may not be stained, but be sure to still cover the board with the varnish to protect it from future damage.

Go to the area where the floors is buckled, and observe the conditions there.,
There are several likely sources of the water leak, and until this has been located and corrected, repairing the floor will not give good long lasting results.,
If your problem area is adjacent to a bathroom or kitchen wall, open the cabinets under the kitchen sink and bathroom vanity and look for water dripping.,
Hopefully, the preceding search has found the source of the leak, and you will be able to handle the repair.,
If you have found water in the space in the wall behind your air conditioner air filter, the evaporator coils may be dirty or the condensation drain pipe may be clogged, causing the drip pan to overflow.,
Finally, we reached the point where we may be able to address the original question.",How to Locate a Leak and Repair a Buckled Wood Floor," Determine if the floor is built on a concrete slab or built off grade, on wood joists with sub flooring. Each condition will require different approaches to repair, and this article will attempt to deal primarily with wood floors installed on a concrete slab.;
, The most likely source of the leak is the plumbing located in the wall adjacent to the damaged floor. By observing how close to the nearest wall the damage is, this may be ruled out or confirmed immediately. Look for walls which you know have plumbing pipes located in them, such as bathroom, kitchen, and utility (washer/dryer) rooms. Look for a return air register for the HVAC (air conditioning system) and if there is one nearby, remove the air filter and see if there is water present in the return air plenum. If this is the case, go to step 5.

, Also, look behind the water closet (toilet) for dripping valves and signs the bowl has overflowed. Look at the toilet tank and see if there is condensation on it. During the winter, after the toilet is flushed, cold water refilling the tank can even cause condensation to occur on the tank and drip, but it is unlikely enough would find its way to the problem area to cause the floor to buckle unless the toilet is flushed very frequently. If you have a dishwasher, you may have to remove the screws under the front edge of the cabinet above the door and slide it out to inspect the area behind it.

, Often it is simply a valve or coupling which can be tightened with an adjustable wrench. The wall stops (valves) located on the supply tubing to sinks and commodes are less likely to leak if they are turned on completely. Clothes washers can have leaks in the pump, tub, and flexible water supply hoses, so it might help to pull the washing machine out away from the wall and look there, as well.

, Using a wet/dry vacuum and a soft brush, you can try to clean the inside of the evaporator coils, but this is a difficult job and it is normally not easy to get to it. Here, calling a plumber or HVAC technician may be your best bet.

, Often, wood floors that are bulged will dry out and return to their normal condition on their own, especially laminated floors or parquets which have not been exposed to moisture too long. Simply towel up or vacuum out all the water you can, and allow to dry. Placing a fan or space heater near the wet spot will speed the process. If the floor is discolored or permanently buckled, you will have to pry up the area beyond the damage and go to a home center to find a matching product to replace it. Tongue and groove solid wood flooring will have to be cut with a saw and chisel, and this requires considerable skill and proper tools, so again, consider calling a professional for this.

Gather all the paint brushes, rollers and trays you need to paint.,
Mix the concrete epoxy paint.,
Paint the edges.,
Paint the floor using a roller brush.",How to Refinish a Garage or Basement Floor3," You must use epoxy within 2 hours for it to work, so make sure everything you need is ready to go and work quickly.

, Concrete epoxy coating will come in 2 cans: an epoxy paint and a hardener. Stir the paint until it is completely mixed and let it sit for the amount of time the manufacturer recommends -- usually 30 minutes. As it sits, the chemicals in the mixture will warm up, making the can feel warm.

, Use a paint brush to paint the trim area around the entire garage or basement surface.

, Use extension handle so you can easily stand.


Start at the farthest corner and work in the same 10-by-10 foot (3-by-3 m) sections you used to apply the etching solution. Roll the paint on one direction, then go back and paint the same area in a perpendicular direction before moving on to the next section. Let the floor dry completely.
If you are adding any color flakes to the paint, do this in the sections as you paint. Sprinkle the flakes on sparingly at first, then add more layers until you get to the consistency you desire. Color flakes cover up flaws in the concrete.

"
"
Mix the top coat paint with the hardener and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes.,
Apply the top coat using the same technique you used with the epoxy coating.,
Let the top coat dry 24 hours before walking on it, and 72 hours before parking a vehicle on it.

",How to Refinish a Garage or Basement Floor4," Stir the mixture for 1 more minute before beginning.


If you want an anti-skid surface, add the anti-skid granules during the last 1 minute mixing time. Anti-skid additives are a good idea for floors that may get wet from foot traffic and snow-covered tires.

, Paint all the edges, then work in sections until you have the entire surface covered. The top coating is a milky color when applied, but it dries clear.

Put a second coat of primer on the floor, and allow it to dry for 48 hours.,
Select a paint.,
Paint the vinyl floor.,
Apply a second coat of paint.,
Seal the floor.,
Apply a second coat of sealer.",How to Paint Vinyl Flooring," Start by cleaning the floor with a standard cleaning solution and a mop. Once the floor is cleaned, it must be stripped of its gloss. Use an ammonia-based solution, and clean the floor again. Allow the floor to dry completely.;
, This will ensure that the vinyl's natural shine is removed from the material. Stripping the shine will provide a smooth surface that can do a better job of absorbing the primer and the paint.

, Use a water-based primer that has a sealer included. Apply a thick coat with a roller brush. Cover the entire floor, including corners and edges. Use a brush to prime detailed areas around baseboards. Allow the primer to dry for 48 hours.

, This additional coat will help the paint stick to the vinyl flooring, which is otherwise resistant to paint.

, While the primer spends 4 days drying, go to a hardware store or paint shop to select a vinyl paint color appropriate for the flooring. Choose an oil-based paint, or porch paint that includes urethane.

, Use a brush or a roller to apply the paint to the floor. Paint with even strokes and cover the entire floor. Be careful around any baseboards or molding. Allow paint to dry.

, Two coats will ensure the paint lasts, and will give the floor a bright, even color. Allow the second coat to dry, and if desired, apply a third coat.

, The sealer will give the floor a clear finish, and will protect the paint. Use a paint roller to cover the floor with a polyurethane sealer. Allow the sealer to dry completely.

, Let it dry completely. For extra protection on the floor, apply a third coat of sealer and allow it to dry completely.

Sand the wooden floor completely.,
Apply three coats of a light-coloured, flat, oil-based paint.,
Lay a grid of squares to create the black and white checkerboard square appearance.,
Work in small areas at a time.,
Start to create the mottled marble effect.,
Leave these squares to dry thoroughly for 48 hours.,
Use a sponge to dab on black and dark green paint on the uncovered squares.,
Sprinkle over a little turpentine and white spirit.,
Remove the paper from the border.,
Use a fine brush to add very thin faux white lines to the border.,
Remove the paper from the entire floor.,
Do any additional touch-ups required.",How to Marble a Wooden Floor," Remove all furniture from the room or area and any rugs. Be sure to sand every part of the floor that is to be marbled.;
, Apply across the entire floorspace.

, Measure exact squares across the entire floor space using a measuring tape and pencil. Draw over the lines using a felt tip pen so that you can see the borders of each square easily when painting. Leave a general border space of 20 centimeter (7.9 in); this will ""frame"" the entire floor feature.

, Start by painting the light or white coloured squares using off-white white paint.

, While each off-white square is still wet, create small brush streaks using a combination of black, tan and grey. Use a dry brush to blur in the streaks.

, Once dry, use masking tape and paper to protect them from the next step, painting the the dark colour. Cover each light square completely in paper and be sure to make the masking tape meet the edges exactly. It takes a bit of work but it is worth doing well.

, This paint should not be brushed on, as you want it to appear streaked. Hence, some of the base colour should also show through. The only brush strokes should be fine ones to soften the look as the paint is still wet.

, This will create patchy streaks on the dark paint of the squares. Leave the dark squares to dry.

, Paint entirely in black paint. While it is still wet, use a paint cloth to wipe turpentine in it here and there, to create a mottled effect. Don't do all of the border, just parts to give the effect of old marbling.

, Only do this part once the paint has dried.

, Seal the floor with five thin coats of a low-gloss polyurethane varnish. Allow each layer to dry before adding the next.

, Stand back and admire your work; it should appear as a marbled black and white checkered floor!

, Lay plastic lining on the floor of the room that will be covered with the laminate flooring. Tape the plastic together with a moisture resistant adhesive tape. The plastic may overlap, but you must cover the entire floor. If you have a concrete floor, run the plastic up the walls an inch or two (not extending above the baseboard).








, Cover the plastic lining with a foam floor padding. This is to prevent any residue left on the floor such as small rocks and sand from causing dimples in the flooring and to give it a cushion. Cut the foam lining to fit the floor and tape it down. Do not allow the foam to overlap.








, Place a board at the top left corner, finished side up, ridge side facing the wall.








, Wedge a spacer between the end and edge of the board and the wall. You can buy spacers or make your own.









If making your own, they should be 3/16"" to 3/8"" thick, L-shaped, and a foot long or so. You will need several, six or more for the first two rows.

, Place the next board the same way, laying it end to end, occupying the next spot along the wall. For the best results, make the entire first row parallel to the longest wall in the room.








, Shorten the first piece of laminate flooring so the joints in this row will be offset (staggered) in relationship to the first row. Use a wooden block to tap the next row of boards into the first. Hold the block securely with your left hand and hit the block with a hammer in you right hand. The gap between the first and second boards should be closing. Keep hammering until the gap disappears.








, Make sure that the gaps between the boards are properly closed.








, When you reach the opposite wall or have to do odd shaped rooms, you will probably have to trim boards. Measure how much you need and then cut the plank with a table saw.








, Don't forget to place spacers along all the edges of the room and remove them when the whole floor is done.








, You can finish your floor by placing baseboards, thresholds, or other finishing touches. Scuffs or holes can be covered with special crayons available at your local hardware store.

, Washing machines prove too rough for sensitive memory foam, so pillows of this material must be hand washed. Fill a tub (or your sink) with warm water. You only need enough water to cover the pillow.

, For each pillow, add a tablespoon of liquid clothes detergent to the water. Swirl it around with your hands a bit to bubble it up and get it evenly mixed.

, Place your pillow in the water, and move it around the bit to help the detergent to work its way in. Massage and squeeze the pillow with your hands to help get dirt out and to freshen it past the outer layer.

, Run the pillow under fresh water. It is important to get as much of the soap out as you can, checking for suds in the runout. Rinsing the pillow may take several minutes longer than washing it.

, High heat levels can ruin the memory foam and cause it to crumble, so do not put your memory foam pillow in the dryer. Instead, lay it out on a clean white towel in a dry area. If possible, allow it to dry in the sun.

, Memory foam is especially susceptible to holding water for a long time, as it is made out of a sponge-like material. Make sure that there is absolutely no water left in the material before bringing it back for use on your bed, otherwise it will begin to grow mold and mildew.

Draw out your project using a pencil, chalk or can of spray-paint depending on the type of surface that you are working on.,
Select your slabs.,
Dig out the ground that will be beneath the slabs.,
Fill the base of the sub-grade layer with gravel or limestone.,
Pour construction sand on top of the sub-base layer to make the bedding layer.,
Install the leveling layer.,
Lay slabs gently and evenly over the leveling layer to create the final paving.,
Sweep jointing sand into the gaps between the slabs.",How to Lay Slabs," The layout of the project should be drawn on-location with exact measurements.;
, You can choose from a large variety of patterns, colors and surface textures. You also need to decide the thickness of the slabs that you want to use and the material they are made of since this will affect their durability. Slabs for outdoor driveways and sidewalks are 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) thick whereas the slabs used for indoor porches and garages are 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) thick.

, This is known as the sub-grade layer and should be the same depth as the combined thickness of the slabs, the sub-base layer, the bedding and the layering.

, This will create the sub-base layer that should be at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) thick.

, This will fill gaps in the sub-base layer and also give a smoother surface since the construction sand is finer than the gravel or limestone under it. Pat the construction sand to make it compact and level it to create a fine and smooth surface. The final depth of the bedding layer should be approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm).

, The leveling layer needs to be installed with great precision because the slabs will be placed directly on top of it. If the leveling layer is installed incorrectly the slabs may wobble, which will not only make them difficult to walk on but also cause damage to the slabs. You can install a leveling layer successfully using the following steps.


Use fine sand to create a smoother surface.
Pour the leveling sand slowly so it has enough time to spread evenly.
Shape the leveling layer so it is slightly concave. If the slab rests at the edges it will not wobble whereas any bumps near its center point underneath will cause wobbling.
Make the leveling layer approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick to create the concave shape without exposing any of the bedding layer underneath.
Do not compact the leveling layer. It is better to leave this layer soft so it can adjust easily as a sort of padding under the slabs.

, You may need a partner for laying slabs evenly so you can lift each slab from the edges and lower it together while keeping it as flat as possible.

, This locks the slabs together and prevents them from bumping into each other.

Remove the laminate, linoleum or wood finished floor.
Remove the subfloor.

, Remove all of the adhesive and old material until you reach the concrete base. Once clear of all material, grind the slab as needed to provide a solid surface to bond to., The purpose of the PVA glue is to consolidate the porous slab surface so that good bonding with the leveler/screed will occur.

Put the glue in the paint tray and apply with the foam roller using the telescopic rod.
Let the floor dry thoroughly for three or four days.

, Check the level of of the slab for any differences and, if necessary, apply self-leveling floor screed.

Mix the screed according to the package directions:

in a bucket by hand or
in a bucket using a mixing blade attached to a powerful drill or
in a commercial cement mixer.


Keep working until the mixture achieves a uniform consistency.
Immediately the pour mixture onto the floor and, using a board or float, distribute the mixture evenly over the surface.
Roll with a special purpose screed roller with spikes.
Let the floor dry completely.

,

Put down a polyethylene film with a thickness of 100 microns over the whole floor.
Overlap the joints at least 10 cm (4"").

,

Use solid polypropylene insulating panels.
The installation is simplified by an interlocking design from the factory consisting of docking slots.
The panels are easy to adjust to any room, because they are easily cut to size or trimmed using an ordinary utility knife.
Don't forget to glue the edges of with Liquid Nails or a similar adhesive.

, It is best to use OSB or fiberboard with tongue and groove joints and leave a gap of 0.5 cm (1/8"") between pieces and along the walls to allow for expansion. You can use purchased plastic wedges as spacers. Tap the sheets with a hammer to fit the tongue into the groove, making sure to protect the edge of the sheets with a wooden block.

To secure the subfloor, use screws and anchors at 35 centimeter (13.8 in) spacings (14"" centers).

,

Remove the plastic wedges.
Apply wood putty (dispensed from a tube with the caulk gun) to all joints and screw heads, smoothing it with a putty spatula as you go.
Let the putty dry and start laying a linoleum or laminate or parquet floor.

",How to Install Wood Stairs," Measuring the area where the stairs will be constructed is the best way to determine the kind of wood staircase you need. If there is plenty of space, you can choose a traditional split level with a landing, or a straight set of stairs.


For a small, or more crowded area, you may need to install a spiral staircase. For the purpose of this article, we will choose the simplest, a diagonal up and down wood staircase.;
, If possible, keep the lowest step away from doors or other obstacles such as vents, or busy passageways. The staircase can add beauty to a home as long as it isn't located in an inconvenient part of the room. Ideally, the staircase should be placed against a wall, which will give it more stability.

, With 1 person on the floor, and another on a ladder, use a pencil with a straight edge or chalk line to mark a diagonal line for the stringer. The stringer is the part of the stairs that the steps, or threads, and risers will be attached. The risers are the vertical pieces perpendicular to the threads.

, You will need 2 stringers and boards for the threads, as well as the risers, which can be purchased precut at a lumberyard. Ensure that you measure for the correct length and width. Avoid stringers and lumber for the threads and risers that is warped or splitting.

, With the help of at least 1 other person, place the stringer against the line on the wall. Place a level on the stringer where the thread will be attached. Locate the horizontal studs in the frame inside the wall.


Using a framing hammer, nail the stringer to the wall studs, making sure each nail is securely in the stud. Further secure the stringer with braces all the way to the floor.
Align the second stringer for the correct width and height. The second stringer should be supported by a standard frame wall. Brace the wall under the stringer and secure with framing nails.

, Place the precut threads across the stringers and fasten with nails. Nail the precut risers vertically, between the threads to the stringers.

, Fasten entire assembly to the stringers and to the wall at the top of the stairs.

If the label states “Dry Clean Only” or “Not Washable,” then you may want to consider taking it to a dry cleaner or leather specialist.If your pants do not have a label, or if you’ve cut it off, and you know the manufacturer, then you may be able to contact them directly for cleaning advice. Go to the manufacturer’s website and look for customer information or help contact information.;
, Before you expose your pants to any cleaning process, it is a good idea to apply a damp cloth to a small, less noticeable part of your pants. Then, wait to see if you notice any discoloration, fading, or wrinkling. This will let you know how well your pants will tolerate being wetted down via steaming or in a washing machine.If your pants do wrinkle or stain in the test area, it would be a good idea to take them to a leather specialist for cleaning.

, Turn your pants inside out and place them directly into the washing machine. Add a small amount of color-safe liquid detergent and nothing else. Choose the “delicate” washing cycle and set the water temperature to cold. If you can choose the spin speed, set it to the slowest setting.For extra protection, place your pants into a garment bag and then toss this bag into the washing machine.

Carefully heat up the beeswax in a saucepan until it is warm, but not liquefied. Add any scents that you prefer, such as almond oil. Place this balm onto a microfiber cloth and massage it into the surface of the leather. Get a fresh cloth and wipe away any excess., Get a fresh banana peel. Place the inside of the peel onto the surface of the leather. Move the peel around, so that the natural oils inside fully cover the leather. You may need more than one peel, depending on the amount of surface that you need to clean. The oils of the peel will attract dirt away from the surface, leaving the leather looking and smelling clean.If you notice any peel residue on the leather, then get a fresh cloth and wipe it across the surface.

, In a bowl, add together one part cream of tartar and one part lemon juice. Stir them together until they form a paste. Place the paste directly on top of any stains or problem areas. Wait a few minutes and then wipe the paste away with a damp cloth. Repeat as necessary., You can get a kit of this type at a clothing store or online. It will generally contain a cleaning solution, a cloth, and a direction sheet. Make sure to follow any enclosed directions very closely. Read the ingredients list closely as well, if you are concerned about only using natural products."

Consult the manufacturer’s instructions, if available.,
Wipe off any dirt beforehand.,
Do a test spot.,
Dampen the leather.,
Wipe with the grain.,
Dry it off.",How to Clean Leather Naturally3," If your leather product has a label, read it carefully before following any cleaning routine. In the case of clothing, the label will tell you whether or not the item is machine washable. For furniture, the label may direct you to a customer service contact for more information. You may have also received paper instructions after purchase.If you don’t have a label to consult, but you know the manufacturer’s name, then you can visit their website. If they have a website, they will likely list a customer helpline or support center.

, Get a dry microfiber cloth and go over the surface of the leather. This will help you to remove any dust and surface debris. In the case of furniture, run a vacuum brush attachment over the surface. Doing this step before every cleaning will prevent you from working dirt deeper into the leather, which could give it a gritty appearance., Before you apply any cleaning solution, find a spot that is small and out-of-the-way and use it to test the cleaner. Place a small amount of the solution on the area and wait a few minutes. Wipe it off and then look for any discoloration or wrinkling.If you notice damage to the leather, then you may need to talk with a cleaning professional, such as dry cleaner for clothes, before proceeding., Excessive moisture on leather can cause it to wrinkle and fade. When you apply a cleaning solution or balm to any leather product, make sure to wipe away any excess immediately. Always use a damp towel or cloth, not a soaked one, as this will allow you to control the moisture applied to the leather., Look over the surface of the leather and see if you can discern any pattern. If the grain of the leather heads in one direction, apply any balm in line with this pattern. This will let the moisture of the cleaner go into the grooves of the leather to remove any dirt or debris found in those pockets., As the finishing touch, get a dry sponge or microfiber cloth and go over the leather a final time. Look to see if there are any stains that need additional treatment. Removing any cleaning residue will help to prevent dust from sticking to the surface."

Wipe up spills immediately.,
Combine mild soap with warm water.,
Wipe down the surface with a cloth.,
Rinse the surface with warm water.,
Dry with a cloth.",How to Clean Leatherette2," If you spill on a leatherette surface, the best thing to do is wipe up the spill immediately using a damp cotton or wool cloth. This will help to prevent the development of stains.For example, if your child spills juice on your leatherette car interior, you can dip a cotton cloth in water, wring out the water so the cloth is damp, and then wipe down the surface with the cloth.
Once the spill has been wiped up, dry the leatherette using a clean dry cloth.

, In some cases you may not be able to remove a stain by simply wiping the leatherette with warm water. In these cases you will need to use a soap and water mixture. In a small bowl, combine warm water with a tablespoon of mild dish soap or hand soap., Then, dip a soft cloth into the water and soap mixture and wring it out so that the cloth is damp, but not dripping wet. Using the damp cloth, wipe the entire leatherette surface with soapy water., After you have wiped the entire surface with soapy water, take a new cloth and dip it in a bowl of plain water. Wring out the towel so that it is damp, but not dripping wet. Once the cloth is wet, wipe the entire leatherette surface. This will help to rinse away any soap that remains on the leatherette., Once the leatherette has been rinsed, use a clean dry cloth to dry the surface. Rub the cloth over the entire surface until it is completely dry."

Dry with a cloth.",How to Clean Leatherette3," Use a cotton swab to clean hard-to-reach areas. For example, some couches may have buttons or grooves that are difficult to clean with a regular cloth. Dip a cotton swab into the soap and water solution or directly into the soap., Use the cotton swab to clean around buttons, zippers, and seams. Cotton swabs have small ends that can reach into tiny crevices. As a result, this is a great way to access those hard to reach places. Avoid cleaning with water directly along a seam. You don’t want the water to get under the fabric because it could damage the material., Once you have fully cleaned the leatherette, dry it using a clean dry cloth. Rub the cloth in a circular motion around the entire surface.

The mixture should have the consistency of a paste when you are done., Microfiber cloth is ideal for sanitizing surfaces. Apply the mixture to a microfiber cloth. Use enough solution to cover one section of the cloth. Wash off and reapply as necessary when the rag becomes overly dirty.

, Rub with a circular motion. Clean until no dirt remains., Rub down the handrail with a new, clean, dry microfiber cloth. Continue until it has picked up all the moisture., If you have any serious rough spots or blemishes in the wood, consider using a sanding sponge. Start at the top of the rail and sand your way down, always rubbing parallel to the gain of the wood.A sanding sponge is flexible so it will conform to the shape of your rail. One side will be rough, allowing you to rub the surface and scrub out imperfections.

, To preserve the wood, use a three-inch wide foam brush to apply a polyurethane varnish to the surface. Dunk the brush into the varnish and then run the brush along the surface, applying a light layer. Do not apply so much that the varnish clumps up or runs., After about 8 hours the polyurethane should dry. Use 180-grit sand paper to lightly sand the handrail. Use a dry rag to clean dust off the rail., Begin by wiping the handrail with a clean cloth to pick up dust. Alternatively, you can attach and use a dusting tool on your vacuum., If any rust has accumulated on the wrought iron, rub down problem spots with steel wool. Scrub roughly until all of the rust has been picked up., Use a mild cleaner, either an all-purpose cleaner or a combination of baking soda and water. Rub down the whole handrail.For a baking soda solution, mix 4 tablespoons of baking soda with a quart of water.

, Use a new, clean cloth to wipe down the handrail. Be sure to pick up all moisture and soap from the surface., Use a soft cloth to spread liquid car wax over the iron. This will protect it from the elements and help prevent the formation of rust., Use an all-purpose cleaner to rub all parts of the handrail. Be extra careful to get to the hard to reach underside of the rail., For hard to pick up spots, use a plastic scouring pad that is non-abrasive. Apply EHC handrail cleaner to it and spot clean the tough stains., If the handrail is not moving, there are parts that you will not be able to reach. You will need to rotate it to reach all parts of it."

Dust ivory using a paintbrush.,
Grate a white vinyl eraser.,
Rub the eraser shavings on the ivory.,
Remove eraser debris with a brush.,
Rub the ivory with Groom stick.",How to Clean Ivory1," Start off cleaning your ivory by brushing with a paintbrush, which is the most delicate method. Be sure to use a soft, clean paintbrush, and to work in one direction so that you don’t spread dirt or impurities around the surface of the object.Before handling ivory, wear clean, white cloth gloves. Without gloves, the oil from your fingers can transfer to the ivory and affect its coloring.
Brushing ivory works especially well if you are trying to remove a small amount of dirt or impurities.
Work the bristles of the paintbrush into any crevices on the object to remove dirt;
, If you are trying to remove a significant amount of dirt, you may need to use more than just a brush. A white vinyl eraser is a very effective tool for cleaning ivory. Use a zester or grater to grate down the eraser into small shavings.Make sure that the vinyl eraser is white. An eraser of any other color could contaminate and discolor the ivory.

, Wearing your gloves, gently rub the grated eraser over the dirty areas of the ivory. Use your gloved fingertip or a soft brush to work the eraser shavings against the ivory.Using eraser shavings is gentler than using a whole eraser, and it is easier to work into the nooks of an object.
You can also use a non-grated white vinyl eraser to clean ivory, just be sure to be very gentle.

, After you use the white vinyl eraser, you should notice that most or all of the dirt has been removed, but that the eraser shavings may still be covering the object. To remove them, brush the ivory object with a clean soft brush until the shavings have come off.

, Groomstick is a museum-standard conservation product that is highly effective in cleaning ivory and other precious materials. To use it, pull off a small piece of the Groomstick from the stick and rub it against the surface of the ivory. You should see that any dirt sticks to the Groomstick.Groomstick is made of a non-abrasive rubber that pulls off dirt from the surface of an object. It doesn’t leave debris, so you don’t have to brush off the ivory after using it.

Combine eight parts water, one part soap, and one part ammonia, then mix the solution until it’s fully dissolved.If you’re cleaning a piece of jewelry, make sure ammonia won’t harm its other gems or metals.

, Use your soft brush or microfiber towel to gently scrub your jade piece. Remember to use small, circular motions. Rinse your piece under warm water after scrubbing if you’ve successfully removed the grime., Sometimes debris or mineral deposits can accumulate in small crevices. If you have trouble flushing them out with a cleaning solution or toothbrush, try to carefully pick them out using a toothpick. Go slowly and take care not to damage any settings or prongs., After rinsing, shake or blow off any excess water. Use a dry microfiber towel or other soft, lint-free cloth to dry the piece completely. Avoid harsh cloths or rags, and don’t press too hard as you hand dry your piece., Drying a ring or necklace in maple wood chips will prevent liquid stains on its metal setting. Cover the piece in a bed of dry maple wood chips, then blow them away once the piece is completely dry.This drying method works best for jewelry pieces with large stones.

, Once your piece is completely dry, you can polish it with a store-bought jewelry polishing cloth.Alternatively, you can dab a bit of canola oil on a lint-free cloth and rub the stone with it. Let the oil sit for five to ten minutes, then wipe it off with a clean, dry cloth."

Dry the ivory.",How to Clean Ivory2," If brushing the ivory and cleaning with an eraser don’t work to clean the ivory, you will need to do a deeper clean with soap and water. In a small bowl, pour in a few tablespoons of water. Then add in a squirt of mild soap and stir to mix the soap and water together., Dip a cotton ball swab or a Q-tip in the soapy water, then squeeze out any excess liquid and blot with a paper towel. Gently rub a small section of the ivory with the cotton ball or Q-tip. Don’t make the ivory too wet; try to just barely dampen the surface.You should notice that the section of ivory you cleaned looks whiter.
Use a Q-tip if you are working on small, delicate object or one that has a lot of intricate carving. Use a cotton ball if you are working on a large, smooth object.

, Keep dabbing the ivory with the Q-tip or cotton ball, working on small sections of the ivory at a time. If the Q-tip or cotton ball you are using ever becomes noticeably dirty, throw it away and use a new one.


Be sure not to cover the ivory with excess moisture. By the time you move on to the next section of ivory, the section that you just cleaned should be dry. If it is still wet, dry it with a clean cloth.
If your ivory object is cracked, make sure not to apply water above the fissured or porous surfaces.
Never soak a piece of ivory, as soaking can weaken and compromise the material by causing cracks and swelling., If you have cleaned correctly, the ivory object should look considerably cleaner and be dry. Before putting away the object, wipe it down with a clean, non-abrasive white cloth to be sure to soak up any excess moisture from the cleaning.

Finished.

",How to Clean Household Surfaces Efficiently," Work from top to bottom, and from back to front (i.e., toward an exit or opening.;
, Vacuum it or wipe it off with a dry towel. Don't start by making it wet and sticky. Use a hard plastic vacuum nozzle and take it off and wash it first if you're concerned it has been somewhere dirtier than the surface to be cleaned (such as a kitchen counter).

, A few dozen terry-cloth white towels such as those sold for automobile-related uses are excellent for wet and dry cleaning. Avoid colored ones, which hide dirt but bleed and stain surfaces they are used on and clothes they are washed with. The terry cloth loops absorb a great quantity of dirt rather than smearing it around, so avoid non-fluffy towels. Keep them in a bin or stack so they need not be folded. Use a different part or another when one may be spreading dirt around rather than simply removing it. Wash them with detergent, bleach and hot water with other things normally, by themselves if they're somewhat gross, or throw them away as they become potentially uncleanable and hazardous to other items (such as extremely greasy).

, A heavy dampening with dish soap, water, time and multiple passes with a rag to remove each layer of newly-softened dirt can be very effective. It also avoids introducing dirt-collecting scrapes. Work on another area while one sits. Electrical items generally can be surface-cleaned with soapy water but not immersed; if any water gets inside, let them dry for a long time before using them.

, Your arm and hand weigh quite a bit and have significant internal friction. Little dirt particles weigh next to nothing and, if loose or loosened by water and chemicals, take next to no force to move. If you swing your arm or twist your wrist each time you move a few little bristles or a wadded corner of a towel over a small area, you'll tire after cleaning a small area and removing an insignificant mass of dirt. Cover a wide swath with each pass with a wide cleaner, such as a broom, mop, or broadly folded cloth. Scrub it well with each pass with a broad cleaner, such as a push broom, big, floppy mop, or a cloth allowed to trail out widely behind your hand. Use an implement that doesn't fill up with dirt quickly, such as terry cloth or (again) a big push broom so a pass isn't interrupted by a loss of cleaning effectiveness. For something with corners, choose an implement that can conform to maintain broad contact, such as a cloth or scrubbing sponge rather than a stiff brush much of which will be held up by an edge or point. For a big space, such as a floor, use leverage to cover a greater area with each pass where possible. For instance, hold the end of a mop handle fixed in one hand, and move the middle modestly with the other. The working end will swing far., Hard scrubbing and gritty cleaners (even ""gentle"" ones) can introduce dirt-gathering, dull scrapes. Use them as a last resort only.

, Dangerous chemicals are generally not more effective. Hand dishwashing liquid and water dissolves grease and loosens most dirt very well. It is extremely cheap and works great; it's even enough on glass. Use just a little soap where thorough rinsing is impractical. Use a proper mop to apply it to waterproof floors such as tiles (be careful not to fall) -- a sponge mop applies and removes it slower but can work OK; a floor wiper is not very good. Most surfaces have been made with the possibility of contacting them in mind. Use other cleaners only for specific purposes, and with careful protection and ventilation. Do not mix them because they can sometimes react in hazardous ways.


Acid-bearing toilet bowl cleaner should be used only in the toilet bowl and squirted under the edge of the rim and scrubbed with a plastic brush to remove malodorous uric acid crystals.
Acid-bearing shower cleaners such as ""soap scum"" removers are good for removing deposits left mostly by hard water. (Actual soap and mildew not in water deposits will remove easily with soapy water).
Specialized mixtures such as glass cleaner are often available inexpensively in bulk packages or concentrated forms. Try hardware and warehouse stores, or mail-order maintenance supply dealers that focus on commercial customers.
Bleach solution kills mildew and hides residue. Wear only expendable clothes when using it. Mildew spores are ubiquitous and need very little to eat. Mildew will return and live in damp environments. Keep the shower curtain open all the way and use a fan or keep the bathroom door propped open when the bathroom is not being used to hinder its growth.
Alkali such as lye (the solid crystals are much cheaper) removes residual drain clogs after a blockage has been removed by plunger, snake or hand (such as a hair blob). It just leaves a dangerous corrosive clog if put in standing water.
Hydrophobic, volatile solvents such as acetone are good on certain kinds of paint and grease but attack many finishes and are flammable and not good to breathe. Rubbing alcohol is often effective and somewhat less risky though still somewhat flammable.

,,, Do this when they are clean; don't seal the dirt in. Modern wood finishes generally don't need any treatment. Worn finishes such as wooden floors can be sealed with wax to reduce penetration of dirt and water which can weaken them further. Unfinished wood surfaces can be sealed with drying oil such as linseed oil (whose application and soiled rags involve a fire hazard beyond the scope of this article). Fabric can be protected with treatments such as ""Scotchgard"". Materials exposed to direct sunlight can be protected from deterioration which tends to attract dirt with ""Armor All"" or other UV-blocking protectants and materials exposed to moisture can be protected with water-resistant protectants such as leather treatments.

Sand the inside of the gourd.",How to Clean Gourds," Submerge the gourds in buckets of water. Allow the skins to soak. If you do not have buckets, other options include covering them with wet towels or letting them sit out under a sprinkler. Allow them to sit for 30 minutes and the hard gourd skin will soften.Avoid using hot water, as this can cause the gourd to crack.;
, Before cleaning the gourd, take safety precautions. Work in a well-ventilated area. Put on rubber kitchen gloves and a dust mask to protect against the mold that grows on the outside of gourds., Use a copper dish scrubber, a non-scratch scouring pad, or other similar cleaning utensil. Press hard while scrubbing to remove the skin, but try to hold back a little to avoid scratching the gourd itself. This can be done while the gourd is wet or in water. Water exposure makes the skin come off easier and, as long as the gourd doesn’t have holes in it, won’t damage the gourd.Avoid using steel wool. It tends to leave metal particles on the gourd.

, When the mold forms a white film that’s tough to get out, try squirting liquid dish soap over it. The gourd is tough, so any regular dish soap you use will work. Scrub the gourd again. When the mold still won’t go away, try dipping the gourd in a 10% solution of bleach (ten parts water to one part bleach) or about two cups (473 mL) of chlorine bleach to five gallons (18.9 L) water and scrubbing the gourd., When washing and scrubbing doesn’t seem to work, a sharp knife or sander may work. Carefully place these objects against the skin of the gourd. Scrape off the mold, taking care not to cut into the gourd., You can rinse the gourd again to make sure all the skin is gone. Once this is done, leave the gourd in a shady, ventilated area. It should dry quickly.

, This is not required, but can be done to ensure the gourd is skinless or even extra smooth. Use a sanding block, sandpaper, or a sander. Start with 80 grit paper and switch to a higher grade of sandpaper for a smoother gourd., Rubber gloves are useful again for handling gourds that may still have mold or other harmful substances on them. Work in a ventilated environment and wear a dust mask because of the dust inside the gourd. Finally, wear eye protection when using power tools.

, The way you cut the gourd and the tool you use depends on your intended use. For example, a power drill can be used to make a hole for a birdhouse, or you can cut an opening using hand saws and rotary cutters to make a decorative container., Birds don’t mind the papery pulp and seeds inside the gourd, but you will have to get rid of them when making something other than a birdhouse. Tools with long handles, such as clay sculpting tools, spoons, and screwdrivers can help you reach the seeds and scrape pulp off the walls of the gourd.


When the opening is too small or the seeds are in a tough ball, you can soak the gourd in warm water for 30 minutes. However, it will take several hours for the gourd to dry.Pulp and seeds can be saved for projects such as replanting or pulp sculptures by straining them and letting them dry in a single layer., Depending on your product, such as when making a bowl, you may wish to make the inside of the gourd smooth. Use your sanding tool. Afterwards, you may wish to add primer, dye, or paint to decorate the gourd.Gourd Ball cleaner or a mushroom tool, which is used to cut off the caps of mushrooms, can also be used to sand the inside of the gourd.

Cut a section of metal hardware cloth.,
Shape the sieve.,
Position a tarp on the ground near the gravel.,
Sift the gravel.,
Place the clean gravel in a bucket.,
Transport the clean gravel.",How to Clean Gravel2," Use tin snips or heavy shears to cut a 2x2 foot section of cloth. The section of hardware cloth will act as a sieve so you can sift your gravel.Hardware cloth is metal or plastic wire mesh that is sold in rolls at your local hardware store.

, Once it is cut, roll or fold two edges of the cloth to make handles. Using your hands, slightly bend the rest of the edges up and inward to mold the cloth into a bowl-like shape. Shape it just enough so that the gravel will stay in the sieve as you sift it., Stabilize the tarp with rocks or another heavy object. Place your sieve on top of the tarp. The tarp will catch the debris as you sift your gravel.The tarp will enable you to easily discard the dirt and debris without too much mess.

, Use a flat-bottomed shovel to place the gravel on the sieve. Shake the sieve to remove dirt and other debris from the gravel. Shake the gravel until all of the dirt and debris are removed.Remove large chunks of dirt and debris with your hands.

, Use a gallon bucket, or another type of container. Only fill the bucket a third of the way with gravel. This way, the bucket will not be too heavy to lift when you transport the gravel.Alternatively, you can use a wheelbarrow to transport the gravel.

, Do this once the bucket is a third of the way full. Place the clean gravel on a tarp or a geotextile fabric while you can clean the rest of it.If you are cleaning the gravel to be placed somewhere in your yard, then transport the gravel there instead.

Line the perimeter.,
Use landscaping fabric.,
Apply a weed killer.",How to Clean Gravel3," Use pavers, bricks, or another type of decorative stone to line the perimeter of the gravel. This will help keep the gravel in place and prevent leaves and other debris from mixing with the gravel., Landscaping fabric is a great way to keep plant growth, dirt, and debris out of your gravel. Lay landscaping fabric on the bare ground before arranging the clean gravel., To keep weeds at bay, spray the surface of the gravel with a weed killer. Do this once every 10 to 15 days. Additionally, use a rake to remove any weeds and other debris from the gravel as they surface."

Shake the fur to remove any dirt or debris that has settled onto the coat.,
Hang the fur properly.,
Brush the fur while it hangs.,
Remove any light stains by using a homemade solution.,
Rub the stain gently with a white cloth and allow to dry.,
Brush the entire coat with a fur brush once the fur is completely dry.",How to Clean Fur1," Take the coat by the shoulders and, as you would when changing a bedspread, swing the coat out in front of you.


You may want to do this outside, or an area of the house that can be easily swept. Once you begin flinging the coat, debris will fly in all directions.;
, Furs should always be hung on broad, padded hangers to prevent the shoulders from losing their form. Because of the nature of the fur, it can easily be stretched and deformed.Never fold your fur coat.

, Using a proper fur brush, begin at the top of the coat and begin working your way to the bottom. Be sure to brush the direction of the hair, and to use small and even strokes as you work a small section at a time. Fur brushes have wider spaced teeth and soft edges, which prevent the brush from damaging the skin of the fur.


If you do not have a proper fur brush, you can run your fingers through the fur to help clear-out any dirt or debris.
Never brush your fur with a ""normal"" brush. This will damage the coat as the teeth on a normal brush are too fine.Avoid making long strokes the length of the coat. This can cause the coat to stretch.

, Mix one-part isopropyl alcohol with one-part water and apply directly to the stain. Because fur coats are delicate, you should always avoid using any type of cleaner or solvent. .

, Do not rinse the solution out, instead, place the coat in a well-ventilated area and allow it to dry thoroughly. The alcohol will prevent any water stains from forming on the coat.


Never use heat on a fur coat. Heat will damage the coat and lining.Be gentle as you rub and be careful not to stretch the skin.
Be sure to use a white cloth or rag or else you may transfer color to the fur.

, Again, work in the direction of the fur and work small sections at a time.

Apply the paste to the grout with a brush.,
Mix vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle.,
Spray the vinegar mixture onto the grout.,
Let the baking soda rest for five minutes.,
Scrub the grout.,
Wipe up the cleaner.,
Mop the floor.",How to Clean Grout with Baking Soda1," In a small bowl, combine equal amounts of baking soda and water. Stir the ingredients together until they form a paste that is easy to apply to the grout., Pick up the paste with your brush and spread it over the grout. You can apply it with the same brush you’ll use to scrub the grout later. Grout brushes and other stiff-bristled scrub brushes can be found at home improvement stores.If you don’t have a scrub brush, a sponge with a scouring side or an old toothbrush also work well.

, Make sure the water is warm before you add it to the spray bottle or a bowl. Combine the water with an equal amount of vinegar. Place the mixture in a spray bottle to make applying it easier., Spray vinegar directly upon the baking soda. A single spray will be enough to cause the baking soda to begin to fizz.

, You'll see the vinegar reacting with the baking soda, causing a fizz. During these five minutes, the fizz will loosen the grime on the grout., Use a grout brush to work the baking soda further into the grout. Alternatively, scrub with a stiff-bristled brush, scouring sponge, or toothbrush. Scrubbing takes some muscle power, but the effort removes most of the grime.Look out for dark areas indicating where grime remains on the grout. Try scrubbing these areas again or clean them with hydrogen peroxide.

, After scrubbing, you’ll be left with dirty vinegar and baking soda. Apply paper towels to pick up the mess or use old rags if you wish to save on paper. A sponge can also help you loosen any bits of grime and cleaner on the grout., Optionally, you can give your floor a shine. First, sweep or vacuum up any baking soda still left on the floor. Afterwards, mop the floor as you normally would. Grout you cannot reach by mop can be wiped clean by a rag dampened in clean water.

Move all of the furniture.,
Vacuum the room thoroughly.,
Treat specific stains that you found.,
Make sure you know how the machine works.,
Fill the machine with the directed amount of water.,
Add the carpet soap.,
Start in a corner and make strips.,
Pull the machine slowly.,
Pay attention to the motor sound.,
Empty dirty water into the toilet or outside.,
Run the shampooer a second time with cold water and no soap.,
Allow the carpet to dry completely before putting furniture back in the room.,
Rinse and empty both tanks of the machine after each use.",How to Shampoo a Carpet," Anytime you shampoo your carpets, move all of the furniture completely out of the room, if possible. If you can’t move it out of the room, move it all to one side of the room. At the very least, move any small pieces of furniture and remove any other clutter from the room.If you have large pieces of furniture that are difficult to move, it’s your decision to leave them in the room. If you leave furniture in the room, it will be harder to shampoo because you have to work around it.
If you can’t or don’t want to move large furniture, you can place squares of aluminum foil, wood blocks, or plastic film under the legs or base to protect them from water during shampooing.;
, Carpet shampooers have a vacuuming feature, but they are meant to suck up water and small dirt particles. Vacuuming the room will remove larger dirt, hair, and dust balls, leaving the carpet ready for shampoo. It will also fluff the carpet up, which makes shampooing more effective.Since you are going to the extra effort of shampooing, vacuum a little more than you usually would. Go in straight lines up and down the room and then do a another set that crisscrosses the first set.
As you vacuum, look for stains that need pre-treatment before shampooing. Set a sticky note or marker of some kind on the spot so you can easily find it.

, With a basic carpet stain remover, spray any stains and let the cleaner work as directed. If it says to blot it up with a wet towel, do so. If it says to leave it and let the shampooer pick it up, do so. Some stains may require something besides stain remover.Some carpet shampoos are meant for tough stains, so you may not need to use a stain remover.

, If the shampooer is new or you are renting it, read the instructions for use. If there are no instructions, at least examine the machine to see the various parts, buttons, and settings. There are many kinds of carpet cleaners and they work in various ways. It is important to know how yours works.


Some shampooers work if you push them forward like a vacuum, but many others require that you walk backwards and pull the shampooer along with you. If you try to use the shampooer in a way besides how it was designed, your carpet won’t get clean.
Look up tutorials online to learn the most effective way to use the specific shampooer you have.

, Some shampooers have a removable clean water tank and others have a fixed water tank. Pay attention to the max fill line and do not add more water than it says. The line is there to make sure the machine runs properly.Follow any instructions regarding hot or cold water. Hot water activates soap better, so it is usually best.

, Choose a soap that is designed to work with the shampooer that you have because not every soap will work with every machine. Pour only the amount of soap that is directed, as using more can clog the machine or leave soap scum on your carpet. Pay attention to whether the soap is added to the clean water or into a separate compartment on the shampooer.


Read reviews online of the best carpet shampoos and consult the instructions on the shampooer to determine if there is a specific soap that works best.
Most shampooers will work without soap and will still clean the carpets to an extent, so it is better to put less than enough soap than too much.

, Choose a corner of the room to start in, getting the shampooer as close to the walls as possible. Walk from that corner to the wall on the other side of the room. Then turn around, move the shampooer to a new line that slightly overlaps the first, and walk back towards the wall you started at. Repeat this process across the entire room.


Shampooers are not meant to be pulled back and forth in a random pattern like vacuums are. Making straight lines across the room is the most effective cleaning method.

, Shampooers take more time to work than vacuums. They have to shoot soapy water down into the carpet and immediately suck it back up. If you pull the shampooer too fast, it will not suck all of the dirty water up, leaving your carpets wet and still dirty. Be patient and pull the shampooer at a rate of one step per second, give or take.It may feel like you are going too slow and that it is taking too long, but the slower you go, the deeper the machine can clean your carpet.

, Most shampooers have a float valve in the dirty water tank to warn you once the tank is full. The motor will distinctly change sounds when the float valve engages. Stop immediately when the tank is full or you could damage the machine. The machine might have a visible light or gauge that shows you that the dirty water tank is full.You can also watch the machine and notice the water level of the clean and dirty tanks. If you notice you are almost out of clean water, go ahead and stop.
You may need to empty the dirty water and refill the clean water multiple times before you are finished shampooing the room. It depends on the room size, the tank sizes, and exactly how slowly you are moving.

, Shampooers pull up dirt and debris that can clog sink and shower drains. The toilet has a larger pipe and can handle this material, but dumping the water outside is usually the best option when available.If you have to dump dirty water down the sink or shower drain, dump it slowly with hot water running the entire time. This will help keep the drain from clogging.

, While the shampooer is designed to suck up all of the soap and dirty water, it will sometimes leave more behind than you want it to. A second pass over the entire room will get any soap residue and remaining dirt. You can go a little quicker on the second pass than you did while you were shampooing.The emphasis is on cold water because hot water will activate the soap that remains which could cause it to suds up again.
On this time around, take off your shoes and socks so that you don’t leave any dirt on the freshly cleaned carpet.

, It can take six or more hours for the carpet to fully dry, depending on the carpet thickness and room size. Your shampooer may have instructions about drying time. Turn on an overhead fan or place fans and blowers at intervals around the room to decrease drying time.If you put furniture back on wet carpet, it can cause bad indentations and mildew can build up because the wet carpet has no airflow on it.
You may want to hang a sign saying that you have just shampooed the carpet so that people will not walk around on the wet carpet.

, After your final pass, dump any remaining water out of both water tanks. Rinse the dirty water tank out thoroughly so that no grime remains in it. Emptying the tanks all the way keeps mildew from growing and keeps the machine in top working order.


If the tank has a cap of any kind, leave it off for a day or two to allow the excess water to completely evaporate.

Rinse with water.,
Dry the surface with a cotton cloth.,
Use a baking soda and water mixture.,
Blot the stain with a damp cotton cloth.,
Dry the surface.,
Wipe up spills immediately.,
Avoid placing hot items directly on the surface.,
Use a cutting board.",How to Clean Formica," To clean Formica, apply a mild dish soap to the surface. You can either apply the dish soap directly to the surface or mix with water and then dip a sponge into the solution before rubbing it on the surface., You can also use a white vinegar and water solution to clean formica. Mix together equal parts white vinegar and water and then apply to the surface.







, If your counter tops have a high gloss finish, you may need to use a simple glass cleaner to remove any streaks or smears that may become present after a normal cleaning. To do this, spray glass cleaner on the streaky area and then wipe with a paper towel or cotton cloth., These can etch, corrode, or discolour the surface. As a result, only mild and gentle cleaning agents should be used. Read the ingredients on your cleaning products to ensure they will not mark the surface., Gently rub the cleaning agent onto the surface, using a damp cotton cloth or soft sponge. Using a circular motion and a little elbow grease, you should be able to remove most spills.








For matte, sparkle, or dimensional finishes, you may need to use a nylon bristled brush to adequately clean the surface.
Do not use an abrasive pad or scouring cloth. These can permanently scratch or dull the surface.

, Once you have rubbed the cleaning solution over the surface, soak a clean cloth in water. Wring the cloth so that it is slightly damp and then rub the surface to rinse away any remaining soap.








Do not flood the surface. If you pour too much water onto the surface to rinse away the soap, it may seep into the seams of the Formica. This can cause the surface to warp.

, Using a dry cloth or towel, thoroughly dry the surface and remove any excess water.







, Some tough to remove stains will respond well to a baking soda and water mixture. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking soda with one quart (liter) of water. Apply the mixture to the desired area.








Leave the paste on the stain for approximately five minutes. For really tough stains, leave the paste on the stain overnight.

, Baking soda can be corrosive, as a result, you should not rub the mixture onto the Formica surface. Instead, use a damp cloth and blot the stain. This will prevent you from scratching or damaging the surface and will remove the baking soda and water mixture.







, Once you have rinsed away the stain remover, dry the surface using a clean and dry cotton cloth or towel.








, The best way to prevent the development of tough stains, is to wipe up any spills immediately as they happen. The longer a stain stays on the surface, the more likely it is to cause permanent damage.

, Dishes or pans that have been removed from the oven or stovetop should not be placed directly on a Formica surface. These can leave permanent scorch marks or warp the plastic finish. Similarly, you should not place a curling iron or straightener directly on the surface.Always use a trivet or insulated hot pad to protect the surface from direct heat.

, Do not use a Formica countertop as a cutting board. Sharp knives can scratch the surface causing permanent damage. As a result, you should always use a cutting board when working with sharp objects."

Make a conditioning solution.,
Remove the lining of the coat.,
Condition the coat.,
Massage the skin gently.,
Hang the fur properly and allow to dry.",How to Clean Fur2," To do this, mix one-part vinegar with two-parts olive oil and mix thoroughly. The oil will recondition the skin of the coat and help prevent it from drying out and becoming brittle.Flaxseed oil will work as well.

, You will be applying the conditioner directly to the skin or pelt, so you will need to remove any lining that may be on the inside of the coat.Typically, these linings are made from leather.

, Using a clean cloth, dab the solution onto the inside of the coat one section at a time, directly to the skin of the fur. Coats that are dry and brittle may need to be conditioned several times. If the skin hasn't been dried out too harshly, you may be able to restore it's soft texture.


Do not apply to the fur.
Make sure the liner is removed.

, Continue using a clean cloth to rub the conditioner into the skin. This will help the coat absorb the oil. Do not overwork areas that are particularly dry. Instead, try conditioning the area again once the coat has dried.


Coats that have not been conditioned may be stiff and brittle.

, It will take a few days before the vinegar has evaporated and the oil has properly been absorbed by the skin.When the coat no longer smells of vinegar, it is ready to be worn.


Remember, furs should always be hung on broad, padded hangers to prevent the shoulders from losing their form."

Check after one day.,
Stir the coffee grounds.,
Remove the coat from the garment bag and store properly.",How to Clean Fur3," Be sure to use a garment bag that can be sealed so that it is as close to airtight as possible.


Never use a garment bag when storing your coat for long periods of time. It prevents the skin from breathing.If the skin of a fur coat is not allowed to breath, it can develop mold or mildew.
Remember, furs should always be hung on broad, padded hangers to prevent the shoulders from losing their form., Do not seal the container.

, Be careful when setting the container at the bottom of the garment bag. Since it really isn't designed to be holding anything but a flat article of clothing, chances are there will be spillage. Simply do your best to minimize the mess.


You can put the coffee in a brown paper lunch bag and fold it up, but it will take quite a bit longer for any odor to be absorbed.

, Depending on the type of odor that you are trying to eliminate--smoke, mildew, etc.,--it may be gone in as little as 24-hours., If the odor hasn't been removed in 24-hours, simply stir the coffee grounds and allow the coat to continue to sit in the garment bag for another day.Be sure to check daily.

, Once the odor has been eliminated from your coat, be sure to remove it from the garment bag so that it can breath and be stored properly.


45-degrees fahrenheit is the optimum storage temperature for fur coats.Avoid cedar closets or chests. Cedar oil will harm your fur coat.Avoid heat. Heat will dry out the skin of the fur.Never fold your fur coat.

Remove them and check the results., If the vinegar dip didn’t help clean your foggy plastic cups, sprinkle them with a handful of baking soda. Alternately, apply a dusting of baking soda to a damp sponge and scrub the cups. The baking soda and vinegar will react, dissolving the film that causes the plastic to appear foggy., Combine white vinegar and water in equal parts. For instance, if you have a large load of foggy plastic, you might fill your sink with one liter of vinegar and one liter of water. Place your foggy plastic items in the water, and let them soak for one hour.Scrub the plastic items with a damp rag until they become clear.
Rinse the no longer foggy plastic in the sink under warm water. Dry with a soft cloth.

, Instead of using baking soda and vinegar, mix equal amounts of water and baking soda to form a paste. For instance, you might mix one tablespoon of baking soda with one tablespoon of water. Dab a paper towel into the baking soda paste. Apply the paste to a small area of the cloudy plastic using a steady circular motion.As the paste removes the cloudiness from the inside of the blender or cup you’re cleaning, you will see the paper towel darken with grime.

, Combine the juice of one lemon and two tablespoons of baking soda. Fill your foggy plastic cup or blender up the rest of the way with water. If you’re cleaning a foggy plastic blender, run the blender on high for a few seconds, then turn it off and remove the blade (if possible). With your cup or blender bottle still filled with the lemon juice mix, scrub the inside of it with a non-abrasive sponge or microfiber cloth. Pour the juice out when the fogginess has been corrected."

Check Your Results.,
How to Replace a Broken Flame Sensor.",How to Clean Furnace Flame Rod Sensors," There will usually be a light switch (toggle switch) on or near your furnace. If this switch is not present, furnaces have a dedicated breaker; locate your furnace breaker and shut your unit down.

NOTE: Turning off the thermostat does not shut down the power to your unit. Also, there are many different types of furnaces and appliances; if your gas valve is not electrically controlled, you will need to shut off the gas to the unit as well. Should you be confused about any of the information provided here, because it does not match with what you see on your unit, STOP! Do not guess or assume anything when dealing with your heating system. Call an HVAC professional in your area, in order to complete the repair on your unit.;
, In the video, you can see 4 burner ports. Between the 1st and 2nd burner ports (from left to right), you can see the wire leading to the flame sensor.The sensor is easily accessible and typically mounted by one 1/4” hex head screw. Upon removing this screw, the sensor will slide out so that you can easily clean it. Carefully remove the sensor; it may be necessary to detach the wire fixed to the end of it to get more room to work, but this is not usually necessary., Once you have removed the sensor, gently rub the metal rod (only) with a very light grit sandpaper. Remember, you are not sanding down an auto body, but simply ridding the sensor of any build up it may have. Then, use a clean paper towel to wipe clean any dust left behind by the sanding., Once you’ve cleaned the sensor, simply reconnect the wire if you’ve taken it off, remount the sensor to the burner assembly using the 1/4” screw, replace the door(s) on the unit, and turn the power back on., If the unit takes a few extra seconds to start up or the fan immediately kicks on and runs for a bit, this is normal. Shutting down the power to the unit can cause it to reset and run through a short series of checks before trying to fire again. Once this check is complete, the unit should begin to operate by command of the thermostat. Make sure the unit re-fires and runs properly until the thermostat is satisfied, at least once before being confident your problem is solved., If cleaning your flame sensor did not work, it’s possible that the sensor is broken and that the furnace is operating as it should. You may need to replace the sensor, in which case you can follow these same instructions with the exception that no sanding is involved; just remove one sensor and replace it with a new sensor. Of course something else could be causing the problem and at this point, you should contact a service repair technician."

Apply a finishing polish.",How to Clean Foggy Plastic3," Before cleaning your foggy headlights, place the sandpaper in water. You should have at least one piece of 1000 grit paper and one piece of 2000 or 3000 grit paper. Allow the sandpaper to soak for 15 minutes., Before you begin cleaning foggy plastic headlights, you’ll need to protect the metal area surrounding the headlight with tape. Painter’s tape is usually blue, though it might be available in other colors, and works just as regular masking tape does. Apply the tape in a border around the headlight you wish to clean., Fill a spray bottle with water and a bit of car soap. Spray the headlights liberally with the mixture. Alternately, you might dip a cloth into the soapy water and wipe the headlight down using that., Spray the headlight with the water and soap mixture while simultaneously rubbing it with the 1000 grit sandpaper. Move your hand from one side of the headlight to the other with firm, even pressure. Continue spraying the headlight with the soap mixture throughout., After you’ve sanded the entire surface of the headlight, wipe it off with a clean, dry towel. Conduct a visual inspection of the headlight. The surface should be free of scratches and damage. The plastic will still look foggy. If some scratches or damage are still visible, spray the headlight again with water while sanding it down with 1000 grit sandpaper., Spray the headlight with more of the soapy water. Alternately, you could use a damp sponge saturated with soapy water to wipe the headlight down., Continue spraying the headlight with soapy water. Use 2000 or 3000 grit sandpaper to further reduce the plastic headlight’s fogginess. Move the sandpaper from side-to-side while spraying constantly with your other hand., Once you’ve rubbed the finer grit sandpaper across the headlight’s surface, dry it with a clean cloth. The headlight lens should have a uniform and slightly cloudy appearance.If the headlight’s surface is not uniform in appearance, wipe the headlight down again with 2000 or 3000 grit sandpaper while spraying it with soapy water.

, Apply two small dabs of regular polish to a rotary sander-polisher equipped with a four-inch (eight-centimeter) polishing pad. Wipe the pad about the surface of the headlight before turning it on. Then, set the polisher to a speed between 1500-1800 rotations per minute and move the pad slowly across the surface of the headlight.Use only a slight pressure when applying the polisher pad to the headlight.
This step will remove any haziness that remains from the sanding process.

, If the initial coat of polish does not improve the foggy plastic, wait a few moments to allow the plastic headlight to cool. Apply another two small dabs of polish to the polishing pad, then polish the headlight with the rotary sander-polisher again., Applying a finishing polish will further refine the plastic headlight’s clarity. Once you’ve successfully polished the headlight, apply two small dabs of finishing polish to a clean four-inch (eight-centimeter) rotary pad. Just as before, wipe the rotary pad about the surface of the plastic headlight before turning the rotary sander-polisher on. Set the polisher to 1200-1500 rotations per minute. Turn the polisher on and move it slowly and evenly across the surface of the headlight.When you’re done, wipe the headlight off with a dry hand towel. Remove the tape surrounding the edges of the headlight.
At this point, no fogginess should remain and the plastic headlight should be clear. If some fogginess remains, apply another coat of finishing polish, then wipe it away with a clean hand towel.

Work from one side of the room to the other so you don’t miss any spots. Dirt can cause wood floors to wear unevenly and lose their shine., Use a soft feather or cloth duster to remove surface dirt from your finished wood accents. Be sure to dust in any areas of detail, such as molding on a mantel or scrolling on your chairs.

, Put a drop of dish soap on a clean cotton ball. Rub this on an inconspicuous area of your finished wood to ensure that it does not damage the finish. Dish soap is a mild cleaner and should cause most finishes no issues.If the soap test deteriorated your finish at all, wash your wood with just a wrung, water-dampened sponge.

, Put a few drops of kitchen dish soap in a bucket of lukewarm water. Carry your bucket and a soft sponge over to the wood you’ll be cleaning.

, Use a soft sponge to wipe your finished wood with the soapy mixture, cleaning any crevices. Wring your sponge frequently while cleaning, as pooled water can cause haze and staining. If your wood surface is three-dimensional, work from the top of the item to the bottom so any dirty water moves downward, away from the already cleaned areas.
If you are cleaning a wood floor, start in the corner farthest away from the exit of the room and work your way to the exit. This way you can leave the room without stepping on your clean floor when you’re done working.

, Be sure to work your cloth into any areas of detailing that might retain water. When your finished wood is dry, it is ready to use as normal. , Mineral spirits are a great way to remove stubborn grime from finished wood. However they are highly toxic and should be handled with care. Before cleaning, ventilate the area well and secure all pets and children elsewhere. You will want to wear rubber gloves., Use a cotton ball soaked in mineral spirits to test the finish of your wood. A corner of your floor or the finished underside of your wood furniture piece are good, hidden places to experiment. Rub the cotton ball gently on an area of about 1 square inch (2.5 square cm). If the finish holds, you are good to proceed with cleaning.If the finish deteriorates, it is likely a shellac finish, and you should not continue with a mineral spirits clean. Only clean shellac with light soap and water per normal routine cleaning.Shellac finish is more common in very old or antique pieces of furniture made before 1920. Consider the age of the piece before performing a mineral spirits cleaning., After a successful spot test, wet a clean cloth with mineral spirits until it is damp, but not saturated. Rub the grimy area of the wood with the grain until the cloth no longer picks up any dirty residue. There is no need to rinse. The wood can simply air dry., Mineral spirits are highly flammable.To keep from storing mineral-spirits infused cloths somewhere that could be dangerous, wash your cloths as soon as you are finished cleaning. You can wash them alone in the washing machine with normal detergent. Hang to dry., For deep staining that simply will not come out, there is the option to sand and refinish your wood. This will effectively polish out surface stains by removing a fine layer of wood particles. It will require that your wood be refinished. Consult with a professional contractor to discuss your particular piece of wood and what options are available to you.

, Standing water can damage the integrity of your wood’s finish. Be diligent about wiping up any spills or standing water right away to keep your finished wood in good condition., Removing dust from your wood a few times a week will keep your wood looking bright and new. The less dirt on your finished wood, the fewer surface scratches you will get. Perform routine cleaning with soap and water once a week and mineral spirits cleaning as needed.


Creating a calendar reminder can help you remember to clean your wood regularly.

, Apply a wood wax liberally with a cheesecloth in the direction of the grain after cleaning once a year. Buff with a clean cloth to finish. Wax will make your wood more resistant to staining to preserve your wood’s finish for years to come."

Check for loose tiles.Lightly tap on each old tile with a wood mallet.,
Mark high and low spots.,
Grind off any high spots.,
Roughen the rest of the tile.,
Remove any difficult grout.,
Clean the surface.,
Apply thin-set mortar to the floor.,
Add more stability with mesh tape, if necessary.,
Apply thin-set mortar to each tile.,
Lay the tile.,
Add extra mortar to raise up a low spot.,
Let dry for 24 hours.,
Grout in between the tiles.,
Clean the surface again.",How to Tile over Tile," If the sound is solid, the tile is fine. If the sound seems hollow, the tile is loose and needs to be fixed.


Chip away the old caulk or grout around the tile and use a crowbar to lift up the old tile. Work carefully to avoid damaging the old tile.
Mix a small batch of thin-set mortar according to the manufacturer's instructions and apply it to the back of the tile. Lay the old tile back in its place.
If you had to adhere old, loose tiles, wait 24 hours for the mortar to dry before moving onto the next step.;
, Using a 4-foot (1.2-m) level, look for any abnormal high spots or low spots on the existing tile surface.


Mark high and low spots with chalk. Use different symbols to distinguish one from the other. For instance, an ""L"" or flat line for a high spot and an ""H"" or triangle for a high spot.
Make sure that all four corners of your high or low spot are marked.

, Use a right-angle grinder with a masonry wheel attachment to grind down any old tiles currently creating a high spot in your floor.


Periodically check your work using a level to verify that the spot is roughly even with the rest of the floor.
Note that you can only fix high spots during this stage. You can remedy low spots later on.

, Sand down the entire tiled surface using a belt sander or orbital sander with an 80-grit belt.


Make sure that any surface glaze or finish has been thoroughly scratched.
A rough surface has more grooves in it for mortar to sink in, allowing the mortar adhere better. For that reason, roughing up the surface of the old tiles will make it easier for the new titles to stick in place.
Alternatively, you could roughen the tiles by using a bundle of steel wool if an actual belt sander is not available to you., Most of the old grout will likely be fine to keep, but you should dig out any moldy or loose grout using a rotary tool or carbide scraper.

, Vacuum the surface with a heavy duty shop vacuum, then scrub down the surface with detergent and warm water to remove any further traces of grime and other debris.


The detergent must have the ability to degrease ceramic surfaces.
Rinse the surface with clear water and dry up excess moisture with clean towels or rags. Let the remaining water dry by air for one to two hours.

, Mix a batch of latex-modified thin-set mortar and apply it in a thick, even layer over the working surface, using a notched trowel.


As a general rule, it is better to work in small sections that you feel you can complete within 30 minutes or so. If you mix up too much mortar, it could start to skin over and become less effective.
Apply the thin-set adhesive in a single direction. Do not swirl it around. There should, however, be small groves in the thin-set.
If there is a crack in your old tiled surface, you may need to use a little more thin-set than usual to fill in that crack.
The thickness of the mortar should be about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).
Consider using powdered thin-set mortar mix and combining it with liquid latex bonding additive instead of water.

, When you are tiling over a cracked surface, you should embed a strip of mesh tape into the fresh mortar over the crack. Only use enough mesh tape to cover the crack.The tape will help stabilize the thin-set. As a result, the underlying crack is much less likely to reappear in the new layer of tile.

, Mix up additional thin-set as needed and apply a thin, even layer to the back of each tile using a trowel. Make sure that the adhesive completely covers the entire back of the tile.


Again, it is often best to work only with the number of tiles you think you can go through within a 30-minute period.
Apply the thin-set in a single direction, creating small grooves with the trowel.
The thickness of the mortar on the back of your tiles should be no more than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick, if not a little less.

, Slide the tiles in place along your surface, positioning them according to your pre-planned arrangement. The thin-set strokes on your surface should run perpendicular to the thin-set strokes on the backs of your tiles.


You must lay the tile by locating the center point of your surface and working your way out to the outer perimeter, just as you would when tiling over any non-tiled surface.

, When you reach areas of the floor marked as low points, apply enough extra thin-set to the back of the tile you expect to place there to raise that tile up to the level of the tiles around it.Check the new level of your tile with a level to verify that it is now at the same level as the adjacent tiles. Since thin-set dries slowly, you should be able to remove a newly placed tile and adjust the amount of mortar as needed to fix the issue if you do not get it right on the first try.

, Before doing anything else with your newly tiled surface, you need to let the thin-set dry for a full 24 hours at minimum.


Note, however, that you can gently clean off any wet mortar from the surface of your tiles with a wet rag before 24 hours pass. Doing so is even advised, since dry mortar is more difficult to clean off.
When dry, gently tap each tile with a wooden mallet to make sure that it is secured properly. As before, loose tiles can be found by listening for a hollow sound. There should not be any loose tiles at this point, but if there are, remove the problem tiles and reapply thin-set to the back of the tile. Place the tile back in its correct position in your floor and let the mortar dry for another 24 hours.

, Mix the grout according to the manufacturer's instructions and swipe it over the joints in between your tiles, sealing them together. Force the grout in between individual tiles using a trowel.


Use a sanded grout if you are tiling over a floor and a non-sanded grout if you are tiling over a wall.
Let the grout cure for about three days.
After the grout has cured, consider coating it with a silicone grout sealer to protect it.

, Use detergent and warm water to scrub any ""grout haze"" from the surface of your new tiles once the grout has cured.


This extra step will improve the overall appearance of your newly re-tiled space.
This step should also complete the process.

, Use a current tester to check an outlet that you know still has power running to it. This allows you to check your tester to ensure that it’s in proper working order before trying it on the inactive outlet.

, Now that you know your tester is working, try it against the inactive outlet(s) to ensure that they have indeed been powered down.

, The cover can be removed by loosening the screws securing it to the outlet. There will either be one screw in the center, or two screws on the top and bottom of the outlet cover. Place the outlet cover and the screws aside.

, There will be two long mounting screws securing the electrical outlet to the blue electrical box. Remove them so you can insert the outlet extenders.

, Since the tile adds additional depth from the wall, the original outlet location will be sunken back from the tile surface. You can use either accordion-styleor box-styleoutlet spacers to raise the outlet flush with the tile.


The accordion design spacers fold over with 1/8” added for each segment. If the depth of your new tile is 5/8” thick, then you can add five segments to raise the outlet 5/8”.An outlet box extender is a rectangular ring that fits over and behind the outlet to add additional space between the original outlet box and the outlet., Regardless of which type of extender you use, the design has a hole, so you can feed the mounting screw through the extender and back into the outlet box. You won’t tighten it down until after you place your tile.


This will also allow you to test if your current screws are long enough to reattach the outlet with the extender in place. You may have to purchase longer screws.

, Depending on the size and placement of your tile up to the outlet, you’ll likely need to make either an L-shaped cut from the corners of four tiles or a U-shaped cut closer to the centers of two.By attaching the outlet faceplate, you can easily measure the distance between the next closest tile(s) for the length and width up to the faceplate. Since the cut tile needs the faceplate to overlap it, add roughly an additional 1/4” to the measurement—enough so that the tile reaches under the faceplate but not so much that the tile runs into the outlet or mounting screws.

, Since you obviously can’t fit the uncut tile into the space to trace the measurement, you’ll have to copy the measurement onto the tile before cutting. Remember—measure twice, cut once.

, Using either a tile cutter or wet tile saw, cut the tiles along the measurements you have marked. Do not attempt to cut the tiles using a snap tile cutter, as this tool cannot make partial cuts.


If you haven’t had to cut any tile for the project yet, then you can read Cut Tile for steps how.

, After cutting the tiles to fit underneath the faceplate of the electrical outlet, you may still need to cut a small piece away to fit around the screws securing the outlet to the electrical box. Mark the area that needs to be trimmed with a pencil, and use your tile snips to clear away enough material to accommodate each screw.

, Apply tile mastic or quick-set mortar to the area around the outlet, being careful not to get any into the electrical box. Push the cut tiles firmly into place. Use appropriately sized tile spacers to keep consistent space between the tiles as they set.

, You have to finish grouting the space between the tiles before you can tighten down the electrical outlet in the box.

, You may have to hold the outlet in place as you tighten to stop it from twisting and misaligning with the faceplate., Once the tiles are installed and grouted, replace the outlet cover. The outlet cover should hide all the cut edges of your tiles.

Apply a sealer.",How to Tile a Wall," In order to make sure you get the exact number of tiles for your location, you need to take precise measurements of the area of wall you’ll be tiling. To find the area of your wall, multiple the ‘length x width’; divide this number by the size of the tiles you are using in order to determine how many to purchase.








Keep in mind that when you purchase your tile, it is best to buy a bit extra rather than too little.;
, Just like tiling the floor, you must prepare your walls to be tiled. Start by washing down the walls with soap and water, and wait for them to air-dry completely. Take down any wallpaper, sand-down glossy walls, and patch any holes that might be present. If you’re tiling in a bathroom or on a wall that comes into regular contact with water, you’ll need to put a backing of cement fiber-board on the wall to protect it.








, When placing your tile on the wall, you will do so in a pattern. You can test each style of pattern out by laying your tiles out flat on the floor. There are two general patterns that people choose to use for tiling walls:









Jack-on-Jack Pattern: this pattern involves rows of tiles lined up like a checkerboard. Every-other tile is the same color, but the rows and columns are aligned. This is the easiest pattern to accomplish.













Running Bond Pattern: this pattern has an imaginary vertical line in the center from which all the other tiles are aligned. The pattern switches between each row so that the vertical line is going between two tiles, or it goes through the center of one tile. Overall, the appearance is that each tile is offset by a few centimeters.













, Because it is unlikely that your walls are perfectly square, you’ll need to start tiling in the center in order to create a pattern that is symmetrical. Determine where the center of your wall is, and mark it with a pencil. You can also use a laser level to mark your vertical/horizontal starting points for the tiles to be placed.









Mark off any areas that you intend to hang cabinets or other wall attachments where you do not need tile.

, You may not actually want to cut all of your tiles till later on in the process, but keep in mind that you will likely have to cut some of your tiles to fit your wall. For large tiles, you’ll need to rent a tile-cutting saw from a local home and garden store. Small tiles (1-inch or so) can be cut with ‘nippers’ - a shears-like tool used for cutting small pieces of glass. Measure all your tiles prior to cutting to make sure you’ve got the precise sizes of everything.








, Unlike tiling a floor, when tiling a wall, gravity is not working in your favor. In order to prevent your tiles from sliding down the wall, you’ll need to install a temporary board for support. This is just a small strip of wood that goes along your wall horizontally at the center. When you’ve finished the top half of the wall, you’ll remove the support strip and finish the bottom half.







, If necessary, mix your tile adhesive prior to use. Otherwise, scoop out a bit of the adhesive onto a notched trowel. Spread the adhesive in a thin layer (the smaller the tiles, the thinner the layer) over the starting section on your wall. Hold the trowel at about a 45-degree angle from the wall, applying consistent pressure as you spread. This will create the necessary ridges in the adhesive to allow for the tile to stick to the wall.








, Carefully line up your tile with the location on the wall it will go, and press it into the adhesive. Wiggle it back and forth a little bit to help create suction, so that it does not slide or move from its position.







, Work your way along the wall, following your pre-set pattern, and add adhesive and tiles to fill up the space. Any adhesive that oozes out between the tiles should be wiped off with a damp rag as soon as possible. Use small spacers between each tile to guarantee even spacing over the entire wall.









Some tiles have built in spacers; make sure you know whether or not yours do before you start tiling.
When you’ve finished the top half of the wall, remove your support board and move onto the bottom half.

, Using the tile that you have cut to fit, carefully work around the edge of the room, applying the tile in the remaining spaces. If you are working in a bathroom or kitchen area, you will need to add waterproof caulking around the seams on the wall.








, Grout is the finishing touch to a tile project; it fills in the space between each tile, protecting and securing them onto the wall. Choose a grout that matches your tile and color scheme, and mix it according to the package directions (if necessary). Use a grout float to spread it over the entire surface of the wall. The grout will cover up the color of the tiles, but don’t worry; you’ll wipe this away later. Wait 30 minutes for it to set.








, Use a large sponge soaked in water to carefully wipe down the surface of the tile. Don’t worry about scrubbing all the grout off yet, simply wipe down all the excess. Wait about an hour after this for the grout to continue setting, and then clean off the rest of the grout covering the tiles.








, You don’t have to apply a sealer to your tile if you don’t want the added step, but it is particularly helpful in a room that has high levels of moisture. Follow the directions with the sealer to apply it correctly to the tile wall. Allow for it to dry completely before putting the room back together and into use.

Measure out your tiling plans in advance, getting all of your dimensions and marking problem areas like sinks.,
Remove the sink, stove, and any other appliances.,
Prepare the tile countertop base if not purchasing or using a preexisting counter.,
Use your plywood template to cut the concrete backer boards with a wet saw.,
Screw the plywood base into the countertop, then adhere the concrete board with thinset mortar and an electric drill.,
Alternatively, cut and sand down laminate countertops to adhere tiles to them.,
Mark out a backsplash, or set of tiles along the corner of the counter and wall, if you want one.",How to Tile a Countertop1," Break down your counter into workable sections, dividing up the room by large obstacles like the sink or oven. Clean everything off the countertops and empty the kitchen so that you can move and work freely.Know your planned tile size, how many tiles you need total, and how the tiles will fit into rows ahead of time. If you can get a tile size that requires minimal cutting and fitting your life will be much easier.
Remember to account for the grout when planning your tile size.;
, If you plan on tiling a countertop in a wet area, then you will need to take out the sink in order to lay the new tiled countertop. You should also remove the stove, though this is much easier to simply slide out than a sink. To remove your sink:


Turn off the water supply to the sink.
Disconnect the plumbing hoses from the sink.
Unscrew the sink from underneath the countertop, if there are screws holding it in place.
Pry the sink loose from the countertop, then remove it completely and set it aside., If you're crafting a new counter from scratch, the following bullets detail how to build a new countertop using plywood and concrete boards. In most cases, your counter top will already have a solid base -- click here to skip ahead if it does.


Measure the existing countertop.
Use a carpenter's pencil to outline the dimensions of the existing countertop on a piece of 3/4 inch (2 cm) plywood. Be sure to trace the sink opening, too.
Cut the plywood using a circular saw. Clamp a straight edge along the marked lines to guide the saw so that your lines are perfectly straight.
Place the plywood base on top of the existing countertop. From underneath the existing countertop, trace the sink opening onto the plywood base. Cut out the sink opening using a jigsaw., Put the plywood base on top of a piece of concrete board. Use the plywood base as a template to make an identical countertop piece out of the concrete board. Cut the concrete board to the shape of the countertop using a spiral cutting saw with a masonry bit. Don't forget to cut out the sink opening as well.


These boards sometimes come pre-cut, or you can have them cut at a local hardware store if you cannot cut the concrete.
Sometimes sold as ""fibercrete,"" a ""backing board,"" or sometimes a ""tile backer."", Screw the plywood base onto the existing countertop using wood screws. Then, apply thinset mortar to the plywood base using a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) trowel. Place the concrete board on top of the plywood base and screw it into place with galvanized screws.When done, reinforce any corners and edges with fiberglass mesh tape. This prevents chipping, cracking, or crumbling along the cut edges of the concrete.


, If you have a laminate (popular, smooth, plastic-like surface) countertop, you only have a little preparatory work to do. You must simply get the surface ready to absorb the mortar and adhere the tiles. Most laminate is non-porous and a bad adhesive surface. To get your counter ready for tiles:


Use an orbital sander and 50 grit paper to rough up the surface. Do not gouge any big holes.
Use a circular saw and a straight-edge to saw off any rounded, overhanging edges. You want square, 90-degree corners to fit your tiles into., Make sure you prep the area as well with a light sanding. Mark the height of your backsplash -- usually just one tile high. Be sure to account for the width of the tile below it, however, on the countertop. Because of this, the backsplash usually comes last."
"
Do a dry run to ensure your tiles fit.,
Mix up your mortar according to the manufacturer's directions.,
Using a notched trowel, lay a roughly 1/4"" thick layer of mortar on the countertop.,
Lay the tile in place, then push it firmly into the mortar to adhere it in place.,
Check for consistency as you work with a straight edge.,
Cut tiles as you go to fit any problem areas.",How to Tile a Countertop2," Arrange the tiles on the countertop base. It is important to determine the appropriate placement and spacing of the tiles before you tile countertops. Position your tiles on the concrete board countertop as you want them to be set, making sure to account for grout lines. Use spacers to make sure your tiles are properly placed.


Whenever possible, start from the center. Place a tile in the middle and work out, cutting the end tiles when necessary. This makes everything look evener.In general, grout lines range from 1/16"" to 3/16"" in thickness.
It can help to use a marker and a straight-edge to draw out your rows of tiles in advance. Start nearest to the wall, then work to the edge., Follow the specific instructions on the back of the bag. Only make as much mortar as you need, opting for a little bit less if you're unsure how much to pour. You'll need to use it all while it is still wet and well mixed, and you can always pour and mix more.


Mastic -- a flexible adhesive -- is often used for the backsplash, not the counter.Be sure to purchase a mortar able to handle the moisture of the kitchen or bathroom., Give yourself enough mortar for 3-4 tiles at once. Lay the mortar down so that it evenly covers the surface, moving in mostly one direction.


Apply thin set mortar to the top of the countertop.
For the edges and backsplash, apply tile mastic, which is flexible, along the outside edge of the countertop. This will allow for expansion so that your edge tiles do not crack., Lay the edge tiles first, then lay the countertop (field) tiles, using vinyl spacers to account for the grout lines. Keep moving in this pattern -- mortar, tile, press, spacers, repeat -- until you need to mix more mortar or finish your section.

, Use a straight edge to determine that your lines are straight, and place a level on top of the tile countertop to determine that your tiles are uniformly set into the grout. If not, you still have some time to adjust the tiles while the mortar sets.

, Use a tile cutter to cut any irregular edge and sink pieces if they only require trimming, then set those in place last. For larger cuts, or making many cuts, you should invest or rent a wet saw, which is made to cut tile without deforming or cracking it.


When done with the counter, set any backsplash tiles using mastic. The process is the exact same."
"
Allow the mortar to set overnight.,
Grout the tile countertop using the grout of your choice.,
Clean the tiles with a damp sponge when finished.,
Allow the grout to dry before adding a finish to the counter.",How to Tile a Countertop3," After tiling a countertop, you should let the mortar dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. While it may be only a few hours, waiting overnight ensures that everything is well set when you get back to work., Remove the vinyl tile spacers. Then, use a rubber float to press grout into the grout lines. Work smoothly and methodically, using a rubber float to spread the grout and wipe up any excess.


Remove excess grout by holding the rubber float at a 45-degree angle and dragging it across the tiles in a diagonal direction.

, Once the grout is evenly distributed in the joints, clean the grout off the tile faces using a damp sponge. This should wipe off any residue or grit that got on the tiles while installing.


Only swipe over the surface of the tiles -- do not dig into the grout lines.

, To protect your tiles for years, you'll want to apply a finishing solution to the grout. Find a grout and tile sealer that works for you at your local hardware store and apply according to the directions on the bottle."

Be aware that they are both made from a mixture of clays and other materials, then kiln-fired to approximately 1400 degrees.,
Consider which fits your needs most.",How to Tell The Difference Between Porcelain and Ceramic Tiles," In general, both porcelain and ceramic tile are called “ceramic tile”. These tiles are divided into two groups: Non-porcelain tiles and porcelain tiles. The non-porcelain tiles are referred to as ceramic tiles by themselves, separate from porcelain tiles. Now is that confusing? Let’s further define the two groups:


Group one: the non-porcelain tiles are generally made from red or white clay mixtures. They are finished with a durable glaze which carries the color and pattern of the finished tile; although an assortment of tile dyes are used for coloring. They are used in both wall tile and floor tile applications and are softer and easier to cut than porcelain. These non-porcelain ceramic tiles are usually suitable for very light to moderate traffic as they are more prone to wear and chipping than porcelain tiles.






Group two: the porcelain tiles are generally made by the dust pressed method from porcelain clays which result in a tile that is denser and more durable than ceramic tile. The finish is a finer grained and smoother with sharply formed faces. Glazed porcelain tiles are much harder and are more wear and damage resistant than non-porcelain ceramic tiles. They are excellent for light traffic and heavy traffic. Full body porcelain tiles carry the color and pattern through the entire thickness of the tile making them virtually impervious to wear and are suitable for any application. Porcelain tiles are available in matte, unglazed or a high polished finish. Porcelain tile usually cost approximately 10% more than the regular group one ceramic tile.;
, Whichever tile you choose they will add elegance to your home and that is why DIY homeowners prefer tile over other types of wall and floor coverings. Before choosing a ceramic or porcelain tile consider where you are going to use it.


Stay with a good quality ceramic tile if it is going to be in a high traffic area such as an entry way or heavy used hallway.






For bathrooms or laundry rooms, use a porcelain tile. Not only is porcelain tile more durable because of their hardness, they are more resistant to moisture. It is the best choice for tiling bathroom floors, bathroom walls, shower stalls, and when tiling around bathtubs.

Use water in regular washes.",How to Seal Travertine," Polished travertine often doesn't need sealing, but you don't need to guess whether or not it's a good idea. It's easy to test whether sealing is required by dropping a few drops of water in a few inconspicuous areas. Let the water stand five to ten minutes, then blot dry. If the travertine stays darker in color for more than a few minutes, sealing is probably a good idea to protect it from other liquids that could leave a permanent stain., If the travertine was recently installed, wait at least two or three weeks before sealing. This gives any moisture that may have gathered in the travertine during storage or installation time to evaporate.Applying sealer may not be as effective if there is any moisture trapped deep in the travertine.

, If a travertine floor has an old coating of finish or wax that adds a separate, protective layer above the travertine, it will need to be removed with a floor stripper. Unlike floor finish or wax, an old sealer application would have just soaked into the stone, so there is no need to treat it.


If the finish or wax has not become discolored, cracked, or otherwise worn out, and you like its appearance and feel, you may simply leave it on the travertine floor rather than applying a sealer. The finish or wax should provide protection against spills and scratches on its own.

, Use a dust mop or soft broom to sweep travertine floors, then pick up remaining dust with a vacuum. Use a handheld duster to remove dust from other travertine surfaces such as countertops.

, Use any mild household cleaning solution, such as soapy water, or equal parts isopropyl alcohol and water. Avoid acidic cleaning solutions, such as Windex or vinegar, as these can etch permanent marks into the travertine.Remember to dilute the cleaning product if necessary, as instructed on the packaging.


If the travertine is heavily soiled and mild cleaning products can't do the job, use an alkaline cleaning solution such as diluted bleach. These are not recommended except when absolutely necessary, as the harsh chemicals can mark the stone.

, Use a mop to clean a travertine floor with the cleaning solution. Use a sponge or other small, clean object for travertine countertops and similar, smaller surfaces. Let the wet travertine sit for ten to twenty minutes to pick up as much dirt as possible.

, Use a large push brush or deck brush to scrub floors, focusing on stained or dirty areas. Any stiff handheld brush can be used for smaller surfaces, or for nooks and crannies. Scrub until all dirt particles and stains are removed.

, Rinse the travertine three or more times to remove the last traces of dirt and cleaning solution. If particles or dried cleaning product remains on the stone, the sealer may not be absorbed evenly.


Rinse at least three times, then keep rinsing until the water has no traces of color, smell, or particles.

, Wiping the rinse water off with a soft cloth, such as one made from cotton or microfiber, also helps pick up the last traces of dirt.You will be leaving the travertine to dry out fully in the next step, so you do not need to make the surface bone-dry. Just wipe up obvious puddles and damp spots as best you can.

, The travertine needs to be completely dry before you apply the sealer. Leave it to dry overnight, or even for up to 72 hours if the stone is unpolished and in a damp area.

, Look for a sealer specific to travertine, or at least suited for natural stone. Use a penetrating sealer, not a topcoat or surface sealer, since the latter kind are easily scuffed or flaked when applied over travertine.Decide whether you want a sealer with a matte or gloss appearance, if applicable. Many stone sealers do not significantly affect the appearance of the travertine, but this is not universally the case.


Water-based and solvent-based sealers are both safe to use on travertine. Water-based sealer is more environmentally friendly and may apply better to travertine in damp locations., Ensure that the space you are working in is well ventilated. The penetrating sealer can produce noxious fumes.

, Rub in a small amount of the sealer in an inconspicuous area of the travertine. Let the sealer sit 24 hours. The wait is worth it to see if the final appearance and level of protection meets your standards. If you are not satisfied, find another sealer.


To test the protective abilities of the sealer, after it has sat for 24 hours, apply a few drops of water to the sealed travertine. Blot after five or ten minutes. If the travertine does not return to its original, dry color within five minutes, the sealer may not provide enough protection. Keep in mind that you can apply multiple coats of sealer to provide additional protection.

, Once you've tested a sealer and are satisfied with the results, rub it across the entire surface of the travertine. Use a soft cloth, or a lamb's wool applicator to save you time on large floors. Completely saturate the pores, but avoid leaving excess sealer on the surface of the stone.

, If puddles form, wipe them up with a dry cloth or mop. Puddles of excess sealer may stain the stone if left to dry.

, Most travertine surfaces require at least two coats. You may follow the recommended number of coats listed on your sealer's label, or test the sealer once a coat is dry.To test the sealer, drop a few droplets of water in several locations on the travertine. Let sit for five to ten minutes, then blot dry. If the travertine doesn't return to its original, dry color within two or three minutes, apply another coat of sealer.

, Make sure that the sealer has been given plenty of time to soak in and dry before heavy traffic or use occurs. Optionally, you may buff the travertine with a cloth to speed up this process and reduce the chance of streaks from dried, excess sealer.

, If the sealer left streaks or trails on the travertine as it dried, there is a simple way to remove them. Apply more sealer over the streaks to dissolve the dried crust, then buff the wet sealer with a cloth. Buff until all puddles and excess moisture have been removed to avoid a repeat of the original problem.

, Abrasive grit can damage the stone surface of travertine floors.Keeping mats or rugs near the entrances, especially to the outside, helps remove some of this grit from the bottom of shoes and feet.


Non-slip undersides are recommended to prevent the rug from slipping on the travertine.

, For regular dusting, use a dry dust mop or duster to avoid scratch marks from broom bristles. If you use a vacuum cleaner, make sure the wheels or frame aren't worn down and scraping the floor.

, Mild household cleaning products can be used from time to time, but for regular washing, mopping with plain warm water is often enough and carries no risk of leaving marks on the travertine.


Never use vinegar or other acidic cleaners, which can etch patterns even into sealed travertine.

",How to Repair Tile," Flooring contractors often leave spare tiles in the garage or storage room for when the homeowner might need to repair tile mishaps.;
, Borrow colored grout samples from a well-stocked flooring supply store and bring it home to find the closest match.

, Be careful not to damage any of the surrounding tiles.


Use an electric drill with a masonry bit to drill a diagonal series of small holes into the cracked tile, keeping drilled holes less than 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart.
Split the tile through the horizontal hole-line by using a ball-peen hammer to tap a cold chisel into the tile. Tap very lightly so as not to crack neighboring grout joints.
Remove the loosened pieces. Use a flat bar to pry up any shards that you cannot get up by hand.
Scrape the remaining old mortar from the subfloor using a stiff-bladed scraper. It is not important that you get every last bit up. Just make sure the area is fairly clean of mortar.
Vacuum up any loose dirt or debris.

, Use a notched trowel to spread mortar onto the subfloor and lay the new tile in. Use a level to ensure tile is laying perfectly flat and also to determine that the newly set tile is flush with surrounding tiles.

Wait at least 2 days for the grout to cure before sealing it.",How to Tile a Bathroom Floor," Buy a tile that's durable and aesthetically pleasing to you. Purchase more tile than you'll need. A good rule of thumb is to get 15% more tiles to account for tiles you may need to cut to fit in narrow spaces and tiles that will break in the shipping process.There are many different types of tile available:


Ceramic and porcelain tiles cost around a dollar per square foot and are attractive, long-lasting, and durable. For that classic look in your bathroom, it's hard to beat ceramic or porcelain tiles. Make sure the tile you purchase is rated for use on floors.
Vinyl tiles are also common, easy to install, and cheap. It's also self-adhering, so you won't need anything beyond the tiles themselves to do it yourself. Other kinds of tile will require more work and materials. If you use vinyl, you won't need to buy anything else. Just follow the adhering instructions on the package and following the alignment guidelines below.
Plastic laminate and linoleum tiles generally come in planks, rather than tiles, but are sometimes popular. They are also more expensive, ranging upward of 4 dollars per square foot.
Other tiles made of wood, cork, stone, or glass are also available but tend to be more expensive. These require other sorts of polyurethane coatings to avoid dings and dents, but are a good option if you like the look.;
, To lock the tiles in and create a solid floor for your bathroom, you'll need to first layer a thin amount of mortar to set the tiles and grout to connect them to one another.


Mortar usually comes in two varieties, pre-mix and unmixed mortar that comes in a box. All you need to do to mix it is add water and the pre-mixed tubs are usually more expensive, but buy whichever variety works for you.

, In addition to the tiles, mortar, and grout, you'll also need:


Measuring tape
Cement board
Utility knife
2 large buckets and a large sponge
Notched trowel
Hammer and roofing nails
Tile cutter or wet saw
Tile spacers
Level, square, and chalk line
Grout float and sealant
Knee pads

, Make sure the surface you're going to tile is swept and clean of any debris, especially if you're in the middle of more major renovations or construction.


Make certain the existing floor is flat, solid, and well bonded to the sub-floor. The floor and subfloor together should be at least 1-1/8"" thick.

, Follow the manufacturer directions, mixing the appropriate amount of water with the mortar in a bucket. The mortar should be thick, a similar consistency to mud, but not so thick that is doesn't fall off a trowel.Don't mix more thin-set than you can use within an hour, or it will begin to dry out.

, Spread the mortar quickly, but also evenly. Use firm sweeping motions with the trowel.

, If you want to reinforce the floor with cement board, score it with a utility knife before laying it over the thin-set mortar.


Pound in roofing nails along the edge to secure the backer board to the floor. Continue until the floor is covered and apply a thin layer of thin-set mortar over the joints.

, In the meantime, you can prepare the reference lines to make sure the tile will be laid evenly.

, If you simply start laying tile along a crooked wall, it will look really crooked by the time you reach the opposite wall, so you need to use a mason's chalk line (a piece of string covered with chalk dust that you can snap into place) to establish easily-removable reference lines.Identify the most visible wall when you walk into the room. This is the wall with the longest area of continuous tile.
Determine a 90-degree angle from that wall, using a square, and snap a chalk line across the room.
Use the square again to mark a perfect 90-degree angle from that chalk line and snap another chalk line that's perpendicular to the first one. Now you have two intersecting chalk lines as a reference to lay the first tile.

, Shift the tiles, if needed, so any cuts that must be made by the wall are against the least noticeable wall. You also don't want cut tiles at the entrance to the bathroom, so adjust the tiles so cuts are against the far wall.


You can snap additional chalk reference lines, once the tile layout is finalized, if you wish.

, You won't want to step on the newly laid tile before the mortar has a chance to dry. Work on laying the tile in small sections at a time.


Mix up a small batch of thin-set mortar and spread a thin layer on the cement board with the notched trowel.
Lay several pieces of tile with tile spacers to establish even grout lines.
Firmly press the tile into the mortar so there are no air bubbles underneath.
Set a level across the top of the tiles to make sure they are perfectly flat.

, As you work toward the walls, you may not be able to use a perfect number of tiles. You may also need to make cuts for tiles that sit around toilets and other rounded objects in the floor.

, Follow the instructions recommended by the manufacturer before grouting.

, Mix the sanded grout with water in a bucket, according to the manufacturer directions.

, Firmly press it into the grout lines with the grout float, working in small sections at a time. Remove the excess grout from the surface of the tile before it has a chance to dry.


Fill a second bucket with water and use it to wet the large sponge with rounded corners. Wring out the sponge and then wipe over the tile so that you are moving at a diagonal to the grout lines. If you wipe parallel to the grout lines, you might gouge out some of the grout and leave an uneven surface. Rinse the sponge in the bucket of water and repeat until all the grout is removed from the surface of the tile.

, Sometimes its smart to leave a humidifier on during the two days you're letting it sit, to help the grout gain in strength."

Protect ceramic shower pans and bathtubs from falling tiles by covering them with cardboard.;
, The rest of this section is dedicated to removing grout, which somewhat reduces the chance of breaking the tiles, and makes them much easier to remove. While removing more grout will always help, most people save time and only remove it in the most important areas:

When removing a single tile, remove the grout on all sides of it to avoid damaging the others around it.













If you are removing an entire wall of tiles, just make sure to remove grout next to the ceiling and floor.














, Wall grout is typically easy to remove, but a heat gun or blow dryer can soften hard grout if necessary.If you're only managing to scrape away tiny amounts a time, spend thirty seconds warming up the grout line and try again.








, This method takes a while, but comes with a low risk of damaging the surrounding tiles. Fit your utility knife in a sturdy holder if you have one, and run it carefully and repeatedly around the tile or tiles you plan to remove.








An ordinary grout saw typically does not work for wall tiles, because of lug spacers that connect adjacent tiles underneath the grout.

, A dremel or other small rotary grinder can remove grout faster than a knife, but can break tiles much more easily if your hand slips. Set the tool to the lowest setting and move it slowly along the grout line.If you have firm control over the tool and the tiles don't crack when you nick them, you can consider increasing the speed of the rotor.









You may need to purchase an extra-small head attachment in order to fit between the tiles.

, You don't need to remove every speck of grout, but get rid of most of it to make tile removal feasible. At minimum, scrape away grout until the metal spacer lugs are visible.







, If you plan to remove a whole wall of tiles, try tapping the edge of each one with a chisel for signs of looseness. The first tile is much harder to remove than the rest, so it's worth taking some extra time to see if you can get lucky. If you locate one, use either of the methods below to remove it.








Your best bet is in areas where you've removed the grout, and areas with signs of water damage.

, This approach should let you save more of your tiles for reuse, unless the tiles are unusually well-adhered or a relatively recent installation. Give it a try by inserting a chisel, putty knife, or other flat tool in between the tile and the wall, almost parallel to the wall.Tap the handle of the tool with a hammer until the tile comes away from the wall. You may need to pry it off in two or three places if firmly attached.









If the tiles break instead of coming away, try an air chisel instead.Have an assistant wearing leather gloves catch the tiles as they come away, before they fall.
The first tile is generally much harder than the rest. Take your time to tap out the first one, then attack the exposed edge of the next tile.

, If your tiles are set directly into the mortar, you'll probably need to give up on saving it and crack it into pieces. Start by using a hammer and chisel to make a hole in the center of the tile, then chisel the cracked tile pieces away, being careful not to damage the surrounding tiles.









Eye protection is especially important for this method.
Porcelain tiles will break into extremely sharp, glass-like shards. If this happens, consider breaking them from the side with a hammer and chisel instead, to reduce the number of fragments.

, Use a putty knife to chip away the setting material until the exposed wall surface is fairly even.You may not be able to remove all of the adhesive and grout, but you want to ensure that a new wall tile will sit flush with the surrounding wall tiles once it is installed.








, These are metal objects that may be left behind during removal. You can remove spacer lugs by snipping them off with utility clippers, breaking them off with pliers, cutting them with a utility knife or sanding them down with sandpaper.

",How to Repair a Chip in Tile," You may have extras on hand from when the floor was installed. You may need to go see a tile or flooring store to purchase another one of your tiles, or if that style is no longer available, you may need to settle on a complimenting style.;
, The grout is available at tile or flooring centers. Since there are so many varying shades of grout, if you do not know the name of the color, the best way to ensure a seamless tile repair job is to take home color swatches to compare with the existing grout. Most stores have these handy reference tools available to take home to find closest match.

, Gloves and safety glasses will protect your hands from any sharp edges and your eyes from dust and fragments.

,


Drill a line of holes diagonally across the broken tile. The holes should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Make sure the drill is dressed with a masonry bit. Use a chisel and hammer to split the tile. Tap the top of the chisel gently with the hammer so you do not disturb nearby grout joints. Loosen and pick up all tile pieces and fragments and its grout. Your goal is to maintain the quality and integrity of the surrounding tiles. Protect them by placing a thick layer of cardboard over them. Do not use them for leverage while working with the chipped tile.
Slice through the grout line surrounding the broken tile using a grout saw. You can then begin removing the tile using your hammer and chisel, breaking it into pieces and removing them from the work area. Start at the corner or at the point of the break.

,,,, Place the tile in the center of the prepared space. Rest a wood block on the tile and lightly tap the wood with the handle of your hammer to make the tile secure and level.

,, Use a grout float to spread the grout at a diagonal into the gaps.

, The grout will leave a coating on the tile.

, Wipe a damp towel across the face of the tile to remove the residue left by the grout. After a few hours, wipe the area with a clean, dry towel.

For harder stains, you will need to resort to a professional response using acid. See ""Things You'll Need"".;
,, If you still have a few larger lumps try scraping with a blunt screwdriver to get the worst off and then the scourer.

, A grout haze remover may be of use. You can find this at a home store or tile shop. Follow the instructions on the container. You can use the stainless steel scouring pad as above, or you may try a man made scouring pad.

, If you have a lot of hard grout or tile adhesive on them, cleaning tiles like this calls for extreme measures. Tilers use diluted Hydrochloric acid as a last resort; it is also known as Muriatic acid. This acid eats at the cement base of the product you are trying to shift. It is important to read the warnings in detail before proceeding - cleaning tiles with acid must to be done in a responsible way:


Use a very small spot at a time and observe how it goes. This is important, as doing a small section at a time, you will be working safely and in control. Use a small bristle brush and dab a spot on at a time. When the bubbling stops wash it off with water, and try the spot with your scourer again and with a bit of luck it will come off easily.






Repeat the process as needed.






Wash clean and wash again, get rid of all traces of the acid.

, Here are your options:


Strike the tile with a small sledgehammer.
Rent a power scraper from a tool rental dealer or home improvement store. This has a wide blade mounted on two wheels that you can push along and pry up the tile.
Rent an electric demolition chipping hammer, which looks like a handheld jackhammer. When placed against the edge of a tile, the steel chisel bit moves in a rapid-fire action and pulverizes it.

Get all the items listed under the things you'll need at the bottom of this article.,
Section your floor into smaller work areas.,
Wet the section of the floor with water and cover the tiles with a nice layer of water (more is better as it provides lubrication for the pad).

Finally, after your tiles and grout lines are dry, use a stone/marble sealer to seal your tiles.",How to Refinish Marble Tile Floors,";
, If you use small 5 x 5 ft sections it will make your work easier to keep clean. Use rolled up towels or drop cloths around the 5′ x 5′ perimeter to limit the amount of kickback spray from the spinning motion that the angle grinder generates. If you don't do this, the milky colored spray will get everywhere.

,,


Be sure the water/compound mixture completely covers your work area.
Make sure the water/compound mixture is milky and pretty dissolved before buffing.
Be sure to wear gloves when doing this as the buffing compound is acidic and will dry up and irritate your skin.

, Let the angle grinder do the work and just hold the sucker steady. It will take a bit of getting used to at first, but you'll get the hang of it. Spend least 30 seconds on each tile to make sure the scrapes, scuffs, scratches are buffed down and smoothed as much as possible. Keep the grinder moving in small circles to polish the tiles evenly.

Cover bathtubs, counters, mirrors, and other fixtures with a drop cloth to protect them from flying pieces of tile. Carefully cover any drains with painter’s tape. Lay down drop cloth over any part of the floor you plan to keep as well.


For hygienic reasons, clean the bathroom thoroughly before you continue.;
, If the toilet (or a pedestal sink) is covering the tile, turn off the shutoff valve on the water supply line. Flush the toilet until the tank and bowl are both dry, finishing the job with a hand-operated pump, then a sponge. Detach the tank using a wrench. Set the tank and the toilet aside on old towels or other absorbent materials.Leave the tank and bowl attached, and remove both at once.
You may need to rock the toilet back and forth to break the caulk, or cut away the caulk with a utility knife.
Carefully remove the wax ring that creates a seal between the base of the toilet and the drainage pipe. You may wish to wear gloves during this process, since the wax ring is very sticky. Clean any remaining wax off the base of the toilet with a rag soaked in mineral spirits.
You will need to replace the wax ring with a new one when you re-install the toilet.Consider retrofitting your toilet with a wax ring that comes with an extension to accommodate higher flanges.
After removing the toilet, plug the hole with a rag to block sewer gases.

, Wear heavy-duty gloves, wraparound safety goggles, and long sleeves to protect yourself from sharp tile pieces. Wear a dust mask to protect against dust from pulverized tile. You should also wear work pants, a hat, and work boots.


Ceramic tiles and mortar commonly contained asbestos until the 1980's in the US, and the 1990s in some regions.Test old tiles and mortar for asbestos and, if asbestos is found, hire a professional to remove the tiles safely.
Even modern tiles often use lead glaze, which creates lead dust during removal. One tile removal project is unlikely to cause dangerous exposure, but to be on the safe side, ventilate the bathroom to the outside, and wash skin and clothes after completing the project.Buy a respirator mask rated for lead dust if you expect repeat exposure.

, Use a cold chisel and sledgehammer to break apart one tile, and deposit the pieces into a bucket. This will give you a look at the subsurface, which can help determine your approach. Read through the rest of this section before you decide how to continue.


If you want to preserve as many tiles intact as possible — which is difficult and time-consuming — first cover the center of the tile with masking tape and drill several holes through it with a carbide-tipped drill bit.This will reduce the number of flying pieces that can chip nearby tiles.

, If the material beneath the tiles is in good condition, you can save yourself some money and leave it intact. That said, this method is slow and often causes some damage to the substrate; use your best judgement. Remove the tiles with a flat pry bar, placing the edge low against the side of the tile and striking the base of the knife with a hammer. An electric chisel is another option. Periodically scrape adhesive off the exposed floor with a putty knife or a floor scraper.


If the tile only breaks in tiny pieces, or if you want to maximize the chance that the tile comes out intact, scrape out the grout lines around the tile first. You may use a handheld grout saw, a carbide blade fitted onto a rotary grinder or oscillating tool, or (less effectively) a utility knife with several spare blades.A little heat from a blow dryer or heat gun may soften the grout.

, Chip away a row of tiles to expose this substrate. Fit a reciprocating saw with a long blade (wood-cutting or carbide-tipped masonry cutting, depending on the material). Cut into the side of the substrate at a low angle, making a long cut to free it from the floor beneath. You can now lift the material and tile up in chunks with a flat bar.Cutting through cement board may damage the floor beneath, and roofing nails may interrupt your progress. A safer, but slower alternative is to break through the cement board with a hammer. You can then pry the cement board off the floor beneath using a pry bar., Floor tiles from the 1960's and earlier were often installed on a thick mortar bed. Mortar beds were typically installed in areas where the floor was sloped for drainage, e.g., in shower areas. This is a pain to remove, but chiseling out the tiles is slow and will likely cause cracks in the mortar anyway, so it's best to replace it now if you can afford it. Here's how to remove it:Most mortar beds are made of sand mixed with a small quantity of portland cement, and are not particularly difficult to break up.
Shut off the house's main water valve before you begin. Removing the mortar bed may damage a water pipe.
Break through a small area with a chisel and sledge to the surface beneath (usually wood).
Using a rotary hammer with a chisel bit (from a tool rental company), chisel around a chunk of mortar about 1 foot (0.3 m) across. Use caution when approaching the base of the bed.
Complete the job by using the hammer between the wood and the mortar bed, periodically chiseling the mortar from above.

, Shower tiles are usually installed over drywall and/or thin backerboard over drywall. Ripping the entire substrate away is much faster than removing the tiles piece by piece, but will break all your tiles. Here's how to go about it:Chip away the rounded bullnose tiles from the edge and top of a shower with a hammer and chisel.
Cut through the drywall along the edge of the tiles with a utility knife. Cut along the edge of the wall studs, if possible. A reciprocating saw is the best tool for this job.
Place a pry bar against this line and lever away large sections of the wall. Work it left and right to loosen the nails holding the drywall in.
Once the side walls are removed, remove the back wall of tiles by breaking tiles in a vertical line with a hammer, then prying the exposed edge.

, This method is slower, but allows you to save some of the tiles for reuse. Scrape away some of the grout in a long line using a utility knife, grout saw, or rotary grinder. Place a chisel against the edge of a tile in this line, almost flat against a wall, and tap with a hammer. If all goes well, the tile will pop out. If it doesn't budge or if a small piece chips off, remove grout from the sides and try again. This becomes easier once the first tile is removed.


An electric chisel can speed this job up.

, After chiseling away tiles, scrape away the adhesive with a putty knife or hand scraper. Try soaking the tiles in water first to soften the mortar.

Rule out whether your old floor tile may include asbestos.,
Wear a thick long-sleeved shirt and pants.,
Cut through the grout joints with a utility knife.,
Find a weak spot in the floor, such as a cracked tile.,
Use the chisel to pry up sections of tile and view what’s underneath.",How to Remove Tile1," You can consult with a home inspector or asbestos removal company if you don’t have a record of the material. If it does contain asbestos, hire a company to seal off the area and remove it to reduce your risk of harmful inhalants.;
, Put on your kneepads, gloves and glasses. Remember that ceramic tile can cut through skin easily.

, Once the grout is loosened, it will be easier to remove the tile.

, Drive a chisel and a three pound sledgehammer into the center of the tile as hard as you can. It should break the tile.

, The following are the best ways to remove tile depending upon your subflooring.


If the tile is adhered directly on the subfloor you will need to break it back by hand, instead of removing pieces of tile along with the underlayment.
If the underlayment is plywood, use a reciprocating saw and 12 inch (30.5 cm) wood cutting blade to cut through the plywood. Cut the plywood underlayment out and remove it along with the tile.
If the underlayment is cement backer board, use a reciprocating saw with a carbide-grit masonry-cutting blade and remove the backer board with the tile still attached.
Be careful to avoid cutting through the subfloor or you will have to reinstall a new subfloor before you place new flooring down."

Soak the mastic in hot water.,
Chisel the mastic off.,
Use a heat gun cautiously.",How to Remove Mastic1," This will only work on some types of mastic, usually in recent homes. It's worth trying first, as wetting the mastic can make other methods safer. You should notice the mastic loosening within 20 to 60 minutes.Mix the hot water with vinegar or citrus degreaser for extra strength.
Old, black mastic may contain asbestos. Keep it wet at all times during removal, to prevent dangerous dust.;
, Once the mastic is wet, try to break it off with a hammer and chisel. If it's soft, scrape it off with a wide putty knife.

Use a long-handled edge scraper on floors to save bending over.

, Some modern mastics or mastics containing linseed oil will soften when heated.However, these are also flammable. Wear heat-resistant gloves and use the heat gun for no more than a few seconds at each spot. Scrape up with a putty knife as you go."

Put on your safety gear before you start.,
Take a grout scraper and drag it through all the grout on the wall.,
Look for areas that have the most wear and tear.,
Stick a putty knife into the bottom or top of the tile and pry out the tile.,
Repeat throughout the wall until it is free of tile.,
Plan to replace the drywall if you can’t remove the tile by force.",How to Remove Tile2," Safety glasses and leather gloves are essential to avoid sharp edges as they fly off your walls. Lay drop cloths around the room to avoid mess and damage to the area.

, If your tiles are small, this will take a long time. Dig the point of the scraper into the grout to loosen it.

, It should be easier to start with weak spots and attempt to dislodge several tiles at once.

, If they don’t pop out, wedge the putty knife into the top of the tile and hit the end with a mallet to drive it under the adhesive.

, Then, scrape your putty knife horizontally across the remaining chunks of tile and adhesive to loosen them. Patch holes in the sheetrock with patching compound and drywall mesh tape.

, You can cut through the drywall with a reciprocating saw and remove the tile along with the wall. Install a new piece of drywall when the area is free of tile."
"
Purchase a multi-tool with saw attachments.,
Put on safety goggles, a long-sleeved shirt and leather gloves.

,
Use the electric saw attachment to cut through the lines of grout in your backsplash.,
Wedge a chisel beneath the tile using the cuts in the grout.,
Scrape along the backsplash with a putty knife to remove surface debris.

,
Patch the backsplash sheetrock with patching compound and drywall mesh tape.",How to Remove Tile3," Buy a grout cutting attachment. Secure it with a hex key.


If you can’t find a grout cutting attachment, try using a sharp and strong utility knife to cut through old grout.,, You can also do this by hand with a grout scraper, but a cutting tool will be more exact. You have to be more carefully with a backsplash since you may not be able to replace damaged drywall near your kitchen appliances

, Hit the chisel with a hammer to drive it further under. The tile should chip away slowly.

Clear the floor of furniture and other objects.,
Examine your scrub brush or polishing pad for cleanliness.,
Move to a back corner of the room to begin.,
Apply buffing solution or polishing cream on the pad or directly on the floor.

,
Turn the buffer on.,
Proceed slowly in a back and forth pattern across the room.,
Examine the pad 1 to 2 times during the process of buffing.",How to Use a High Speed Floor Buffer,"


Place chairs on top of tables and move them to the edges of the room. If possible, move everything out of the room into a hallway or another room. Buffers can clean spills and remove some dirt, but large pieces of debris should be picked up before buffing.;
,


Replace a buffer pad that appears used or soiled. Using a dirty buffer pad can scratch the floor, especially at such high speeds.
Check for defects in the pad such as missing portions of pad fabric or unevenness.

,


Locate the farthest corner from the entrance of the room you are buffing in order to prevent stepping on the freshly buffed floor as you work. Walking over a floor that has just been buffed might scuff or dent the surface.
Make sure there is a close electric outlet and that your high-speed floor buffer cord is long enough to span the entire room. If it's not, plan your buffing route around the location of the other outlets to prevent having to walk over a buffed portion of floor.

,,


Locate the ""on"" switch. This button is usually positioned with other control buttons on the arm of the appliance. Consult the owner's manual if you cannot find the controls.
Choose an appropriate setting for the type of floor and type of dirt. Some high-speed floor buffers have multiple settings that allow you to select different rpms.

,


Move laterally throughout the room starting from the right. Work very slowly and carefully. Change up your direction and begin working from left to right to guarantee even buffing.
Overlap about 1/3 of each row as you continue to buffer. This ensures you don't miss a spot.

,


Check for rips, large pieces of debris or an excessively grimy pad. Replace the pad as needed.

Purchase mastic remover.,
Open all of your windows and doors.,
Apply a thin layer of mastic remover.,
Wait for the mastic to dissolve.,
Cover with cat litter (optional).,
Scrape up the mastic.,
Repeat with another thin layer.,
Wipe up the liquid with rags or other absorbent materials.,
Clean the area.",How to Remove Mastic2," This is available online or at hardware stores, but may cost over $100 per 5-gallon (19L) bucket. Products made from citrus or acetic acid are safer than other mastic removers.


If you are removing mastic from wood sub-floor, look for a product that is designed for use on wood. Overuse of removal chemicals can make it difficult to bond future flooring.

, Use as much ventilation as possible. Limit your time in the area while the chemical reaction takes place.


Check the label of your chemical for more safety instructions. Some products may recommend a face mask.

, Load the mastic remover into a sprayer if possible, or apply it to the top of the mastic with a mop. If you are applying it to mastic that is above wood flooring, use rags instead.


Start at the far end of the room and work back to the door. Clean your footwear whenever you leave the area.

, Wait for the amount of time suggested by the product’s instructions. This can take anywhere from 1 to 12 hours, depending on the product and mastic., This will absorb the liquid and make cleanup easier., Wear gloves and scrape up any stuck-on mastic. You can use a razor scraper or putty knife. Place by-products in a bucket for disposal at a hazardous waste facility.


You can instead use a floor machine equipped with a 3M black scrubbing pad, with a speed no higher than 175 rpm. Using a different setup or letting the floor dry may expose you to asbestos.

, Apply another thin layer of remover to remove the remaining residue. Agitate the area with a mop or bristled broom.

, Dispose of them with the other hazardous adhesive and waste.


For large areas, rent a wet vacuum instead.

, Clean the floor with an industrial cleaner or soapy water. Let dry completely before laying down new material.

Test for asbestos.,
Wear safety equipment.,
Rent a rotary floor machine.,
Attach a mastic removal block.,
Remove nails from the floor.,
Wet the floor (optional).,
Move the machine over the floor.,
Apply a degreaser.,
Scrub or scrape the floor.,
Clean with a wet vacuum.",How to Remove Mastic3," Old, black mastic can contain asbestos, which causes illness or death when inhaled. Using tools to break up the mastic send the asbestos fibers into the air, which makes it more dangerous than the chemical method above. Find testing professionals in the US at the EPA website.

If asbestos is present, this method is not recommended, and may violate workplace safety regulations. Consider hiring a professional, or use the chemical method above.

, Even if there is no asbestos, you should protect yourself from debris. Wear safety glasses, a paper mask, and work gloves.


If asbestos is present, this method is not recommended. If you continue anyway, use a tight-fitting respirator mask, safety goggles, and disposable rubber gloves. Wear old clothing, and throw it away at the end of the project.Turn off all air circulation to the rest of the building.

, This should be available from any tool rental service. This is also called a floor buffer.

A floor grinder will work instead, with no mastic removal block required. Ask the rental service about its effect on wooden surfaces if necessary.

, This is a round base that attaches to your floor machine. It should have several blades at the base, to cut the mastic.This is typically safe for hardwood floors, but check with the tool rental service.You can also use a base intended to remove thinset from concrete. Avoid titanium blocks, which may melt the mastic and make removal messy.

, Nails, screws, and staples can damage the equipment.Remove these from the floor using a claw hammer., Lightly water the mastic. This will keep the dust cloud to a minimum.


Avoid electrical hazards with a ground fault circuit interrupter. This will cut off the circuit rapidly if water causes an electrical short.

, Plug in and turn on the machine. Push it over the mastic. Move slowly, and cover each area several times. You'll typically finish about 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) per hour.

Stop periodically and sweep up the broken mastic. This will make it easier to see where mastic remains.

, The machine should remove almost all of the mastic. Mop a degreasing solution over anything left. Let sit 10 minutes or according to the label.If you are cleaning a hardwood floor, check the degreaser label before buying. Some products may damage wood.

, Put a scrubbing brush or stripping pad on the floor machine. Turn it on and move it over the last pieces of mastic.

Alternatively, scrape it up using a putty knife.

, Rent a wet vacuum with a front-attached squeegee to vacuum up the broken mastic. Once finished, mop the floor with soapy water and use the wet vac again."

Lay the carpet down.,
Use the power stretcher to pull the carpet into place.,
Grab the knee kicker to finish the stretching.,
Trim the excess carpet.,
Secure the carpet at doorways.",How to Stretch Carpet," Remove all furniture and other items from the carpet you need to stretch. If you leave items on the carpet, they will weigh it down, preventing it from stretching properly. Then, thoroughly vacuum it before starting the stretching process. This will reduce the amount of dust you have to deal with.;
, Your carpet will be held in place by tack strips located near the edges. Starting in one corner, slowly pull on the carpet to ease it away from the tacks. If it doesn’t come up easily, try grabbing the corner of the carpet with a pair of pliers and then gently tugging it away from the tack strip. Once you get started, it should pull away like a zipper.Don’t pull the carpet up on all sides of the room. It needs to remain anchored along at least one wall.
Don’t pull too hard, as this could separate the fibers and damage the carpet. If you’re having serious trouble getting the carpet up, contact a professional.

, There will be a layer of soft padding underneath the carpet you just pulled up. Examine the padding. If it is held down by any staples or tacks, pry those out with pliers and a flat-head screwdriver. Lift it back from the edges of the walls as well to allow space for you to work with the tack strips.

, Use a strong flat-head screwdriver, the claw of a hammer or a pry bar. Wedge your tool underneath the old tack strips and pry them up and out.Wear work gloves while handling old and new tack strips as they are made of setting nails on one side and razor-sharp tacks on the other. It’s also a good idea to wear protective eye wear to keep you from being injured by flying splinters or tacks.
Place old pieces of tack strip in a bucket or cardboard box near you. This will keep your work area clear of these sharp objects to prevent you from putting a knee or hand down on the exposed nails.

, Once the carpet and padding are peeled away, your base flooring will be exposed, and is probably dirty. There might also be splinters or loose staples from pulling up the materials. Go over the floor with a shop vacuum to remove this debris., Set the new tack strips about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wall where you pulled up the old ones, using a pair of tin snips to cut them in lengths to fit. Lay them so that the gripping nails on top (the sharp nails that'll hold the carpet in place) are pointed toward the wall. Place a chisel or pry bar on top of the setting nails (those pointed down to the floor) and hammer them to sink them into the floor.You should be able to find tack strips at a flooring supply or hardware store, if you haven’t already purchased them.
Measure out the perimeter of the area you will be carpeting. It’s a good idea to buy enough tack strips to have a little bit more than the perimeter length, just in case there’s a problem and you need extras.

, Lay the carpet padding back down over the newly-installed tack strip. You can trim it along the tack strip with a utility knife, or wait to use a carpet cutter that you will rent with other tools from a hardware store. Finally, staple the padding to the floor about every three inches next to the tack strip and along all seams where one piece ends and another begins.


Cut diagonally at corners of the room and around door frames so it'll fall into place when you trim off the excess.
If the area you are working with is large enough that you need multiple pieces of padding, you can also use duct tape to secure the seams between them., You’ll need to visit a home improvement store to get these, but hold off on renting this equipment until you have the new tack strips in place. You will usually rent the tools by the hour or by the day, so you want to make sure that your floor is prepared and you are ready to use them as soon as you get home. Talk to the store staff if you have questions. You will need just a few tools:A power stretcher provides a lot of the muscle. It ""bites"" into the carpet with sharp prongs on one end and has a brace that fits against the opposite wall, allowing you to stretch the carpet in the largest areas of the room. This tool comes with extenders to allow you to adjust the stretching shaft to fit the length of the room.
A knee kicker can help you stretch the carpet in smaller areas that can't accommodate a power stretcher. It also comes in handy for doing the last bit of stretching after using the power stretcher.
A carpet cutter will make the job of cutting excess carpet much easier than trying to use a utility knife.

, Trim the padding with a carpet cutter if you haven’t already done so with a utility knife. Then, lay down the carpet over the padding. Set the power stretcher down over the part of the carpet you are working with and want stretched.


If you are installing new carpet instead of just stretching existing carpet, measure it out and cut it ahead of time to make it easier to lay down.

, Place the base of the stretcher against the wall the carpet is anchored to. Lengthen the adjustment rod of the power stretcher until its head is about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the carpet's un-anchored edge. Press down on the lever of the power stretcher to smooth out the carpet wrinkles.If the lever requires too much pressure to push down, you're stretching the carpet too tight.
Likewise, if it takes almost no effort to push the lever down, you aren't stretching it tight enough.

, If you are trying to stretch carpet in a part of a room where the power stretcher is too big to fit, you’ll want to use the knee kicker. This tool also comes in handy for going back over the carpet after the power stretcher has done the bulk of the work, to give any trouble spots some extra care. To use the knee kicker, place its head about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the wall and use your leg (just above the kneecap) to finish the stretch.

, Push the edges of the stretched carpet down into the tack strips. The carpet should also push down slightly (be embedded) in the space between the tack strips and the wall. Then, use the carpet cutter to remove any excess that is butting up against the wall.If you are using a utility knife, cut very slowly and cautiously so you don't over-trim.

, If you are stretching carpet over or through doorways, you’ll need to pick up some additional materials at the hardware or flooring supply store. Look for transition molding that can be nailed in place over the carpet in the doorway. This will help hold the carpet in the high-traction area.If you have questions about how to select or install transition molding, ask the staff at the hardware or flooring supply store for more information.

Choose a good broom appropriate for your task.,

Clear the area.,

Start in one edge or corner and sweep in overlapping strokes in towards the center of the room.,

Make sure the broom reaches into the angle of each corner so that you sweep out the dust from there.
,

Work your way around the room, collecting the debris into a small pile or piles.,

Collect the piles.",How to Sweep a Floor," You may not think about your broom very much, but it's worth getting a good one.







A broad end will make for faster sweeping, since you can cover more ground in one stroke.






For outdoor jobs, especially large ones, consider using a push broom. You can cover more ground with the broad brush, and the bristles are often designed to work on outdoor surfaces, such as concrete.






For large, indoor floors, such as a gymnasium, store, or office building, try a dust mop. Available in many widths, dust mops can thoroughly clean a large area in a single pass.






Whatever implement you choose, try it out to make sure the handle length, weight, and balance work for you.;
, If you can remove furnishings, throw rugs, or other obstacles, do so. If possible, also close it off to foot traffic., Pull the broom against the floor in one direction and lift it back to that edge in the other direction.,, It helps to be systematic, working generally from one direction to another.

When sweeping outdoors, try as much as possible to sweep downhill and with the wind. It will help to avoid breathing the dust created if you are allergic or sensitive to it. If possible, avoid sweeping when it is too windy.

, Use a dustpan and either the broom or a brush. Sweep the debris into the dustpan and dispose of it in the trash. If the dustpan leaves a line right under the rim, move it back and sweep some more. When the line doesn't seem to be getting any smaller, you can either sweep that part under the rug or pick it up with a damp cloth or other means. Outdoors, you may prefer the grass catcher from a push mower, an outdoor dustpan, or a shovel or rake to collect debris."

Check the label before buying to make sure it is safe to use on your type of floor. For best results, use a floor finish stripper that is the same brand as the floor wax you last used.


Some floor finish strippers are advertised as ""no rinse,"" which means you do not have to rinse them off the floor once you are done. However, floor finish strippers are powerful solvents, and some people prefer to rinse even ""no rinse"" strippers to make sure no damage or discoloration occurs.
Floor finish strippers that are environmentally sustainable may be marked with a special logo, such as ""Tera Choice"" in Canada or ""Green Seal"" in the USA.;
, Renting specialized equipment will make the task much easier. The floor scrubber scrubs away sealers and floor finish, and the wet-dry vacuum will suck up the stripper and sealer/floor finish residue afterward. Some floor scrubbers include squeegee attachments which can take the place of the wet vacuum as well.


Floor scrubbers come in various sizes. The larger sizes will strip the floor more quickly, and are recommended if you are stripping a large area rather than a room or two of a residential house.

, Move all furniture, rugs, and loose objects to another room. Sweep or vacuum the floor thoroughly to remove all dust.

, Floor finish stripper creates toxic fumes when applied, and should never be used in an area with poor ventilation. If you are not working in a space with good air flow, set up fans in front of window or doors, and/or wear a respirator mask.


Take care not to point fans directly at the floor, as this could dry out the floor finish stripper and interfere with the stripping process., Rubber gloves are mandatory, and goggles are highly recommended, as floor finish strippers contain harmful chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin and damage the eyes. Long sleeves and long pants should also be worn to cover as much skin as possible. Know where the nearest running water faucet is and be ready to flush out your eyes or rinse your skin for fifteen minutes in running water if you come into contact with the floor finish stripper., Test the floor finish stripper on a part of the floor that is not readily visible before you get started, such as an edge that is normally underneath heavy furniture. Some floors, especially older linoleum ones, will suffer damage or color bleed when stripped. If this occurs, you may need to try a different brand of floor finish stripper or contact a professional.

, You'll want to start in the corner that is farthest from an exit and work your way toward the exit. If you are doing this by hand, plan to strip 2-by-4-foot (60-by- 120-cm) sections of the floor. If you are using a floor scrubber, you can strip larger sections-generally 100 square feet (9 square meters) at a time.

, Line each bucket with a large, heavy-duty trash bag for easy cleanup, and to preserve the bucket for other uses.

, Pour floor finish stripper and water into one of the buckets according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most strippers require significant diluting before they can be used safely and effectively., This will be used to rinse off the floor stripping solution after it has removed the finish from the floor.

, This third bucket will be used to contain the used floor stripping solution, but to begin with you can use it to store your tools. You'll need two mops, one for the stripping solution and one for the water. Also include all scrubbers, scrapers, or other tools in this bucket. At least one scraping tool is usually necessary, such as a poll scraper or putty knife.A toothbrush and scrubbing pads are also recommended.


Do not use tools you wish to keep nice or use for other projects. The knife may be usable afterwards with a thorough cleaning, but the toothbrush certainly won't be.

, Use one mop to cover two 2-by-4-foot (60-by-120-cm) sections of the floor with the stripper. Apply enough stripper to coat the area thoroughly, but not so much that it floods the area and soaks between seams or cracks. Apply stripper more liberally in areas with a lot of wax buildup.

, Allow the stripper to soak according to instructions on the label, then use the scrub pads (with the floor scrubber if one is available) to scrape away the wax buildup.



Note: always wear rubber gloves.

, Use the toothbrush to scrub nooks and crannies and the putty knife to scrape away gobs or multiple finish layers in corners.

, Use a squeegee, floor scrubber squeegee attachment, or wet-dry vacuum to remove the wax residue and stripper. Soak up excess liquid with rags or the mop. Unless you are using a wet-dry vacuum, dump all of this into the third bucket after removing your tools.

, Apply stripper to a third 2-by-4-foot (60-by-120-cm) section before you begin scrubbing the second section, so the stripper can soak in and do its work while you scrub the second section. Alternate sections like this until you complete the floor.


As you strip sections of floor near the edge, look at the baseboard for dirty finish to see if it needs stripping as well.

, If you encounter a section where you can't scrub away all of the buildup, remove what you can and then reapply the stripper. Allow it to soak in while you work on another section and then scrub it again.

, Mop the floor to make sure all traces of the stripper are gone and no longer acting on your floor. Even a ""no rinse"" stripper may cause damage, so this step is highly recommended.


Allow the floor to dry completely before you wax it.

, Waxes are products made from natural substances that seal and protect the floor, while finishes are synthetic. The instructions here should work well for waxes and some finishes, but read the instructions on the label as well. Finishes come in several varieties, and may require special application.


Polyurethane finishes are among the most popular. Unlike a wax, they should be applied quickly in back-and-forth overlapping lines, not giving the edge time to dry., A brand-new mop is recommended to avoid introducing dirt into the new layer of wax or finish. A flat wax applier mop is best suited for this purpose, since the wax can be poured directly onto the mesh back of the mop.

, You likely already set this up when you stripped the floor, but make sure all windows and doors are still open and/or fans are still circulating air with the outside. Most finishes are not as harmful as floor stripping solution, but they can still cause damage if too many fumes are inhaled.

, If you are using an ordinary mop, you will need to dip it into a bucket of the wax solution. Wax is difficult to clean off, so lining the bucket with a heavy-duty trash bag first is recommended. A wax applier mop can let you skip this step and pour the wax directly on the back of the mop.

, Get your mop damp with wax, not soaked, using the wringer on a mop bucket if necessary. Apply a thin coat over the floor, working in sections from one end of the room to the other. Leave the section nearest the exit until last to avoid getting trapped.

, Depending on temperature and humidity, the wax or finish could dry in ten minutes or thirty. A fan providing good air flow will speed up the drying, but do not point it directly at the floor, as this could interfere with the wax's setting process., Most finishes and waxes require two to five layers for a good, protective seal. Read the label on your product to determine how many layers to use. Allowing each layer to dry completely before applying the next keeps the wax even and avoids buildup of excess wax.

, Many modern waxes and finishes do not require buffing, or polishing. If the product advertises ""no buffing"" or if the floor looks glossy and attractive once dry, you may skip this step. Otherwise, polish the floor in a circular motion with a buffing pad or a dry terry cloth towel tied around a clean mop. For large spaces, rent a burnishing machine to hasten the process.

Dust walls and hard-to-reach areas.,
Use the Swiffer along with a vacuum.,
Use Swiffer cloths as handheld dusters.",How to Use a Swiffer Sweeper Multiple Ways1," Use your Swiffer on more than just your floors. Take advantage of the easy handle and cleaning cloth to reach high-up or vertical surfaces of your home.


Try dusting dirty walls, baseboards, ceiling fans, cabinets, and more with a dry cloth on the Swiffer. Check to see how a given surface will respond to cleaner before using a wet cloth for this.
Remember that you can use the edge of the Swiffer head to gently scrub at more stubborn spots or dust. Just rotate the head until the edge rests against the surface you want to clean.;
, Dust with a Swiffer to pull out larger debris for a vacuum to pick up. Do this to access dirt and crumbs that a vacuum can’t reach but a Swiffer can’t necessarily pick up.


Try using the Swiffer first in corners of a room and under and between fridges, stoves, and other immovable furniture. Vacuum up the debris removed by the Swiffer.Clean off other surfaces with the Swiffer before you vacuum so the vacuum can catch any fallen dirt and dust.

, Take a dry mopping cloth for a Swiffer and use it as a handheld cloth to remove dust from surfaces around your home. Then attach it to the Swiffer to clean the floor, completing all your dusting with just one product.Swiffer the floors after you dust surfaces so you can catch any dust that may have been brushed to the floor in the process.
Try using the cloth on tabletops, TV screens and other electronics, lamps, baseboards, shelves, etc.

If you find moth activity in your rug, get it to your professional rug cleaners quickly.,
Don't panic or feel like you are not a perfect house cleaner if you find moth activity.",How to Spot Moth Damage on a Wool Area Rug," Prevention and cleaning are the best defense against getting a moth infestation. Before storing any wool rugs, blankets, clothing, etc get them cleaned. Moths cannot survive on clean wool as it does not have the nutrients it needs.;
, Moths live where there is a lot of organic dust and dirt. Check in your attic, crawl spaces, eves for abandon bird or insect nests, moths can live in them and then move on to another food source, such as your wool area rug.

, Moths love dark, undisturbed, dirty areas and it doesn't take long for them to damage to your rugs.

, Moths are sneaky and will crawl 2–6 inches (5.1–15.2 cm) under a rug to lay their eggs. Old moth larva casings look like flat pieces of rice and can be the same color as your rug.

, This will make your rugs undesirable to moths. Having food, drink spills and pet accidents cleaned right away aids in moth deterrent. The sugars and proteins in such spills are what moths like.

, Getting rid of the eggs and larva fast saves your rug from permanent damage and expensive repairs.

, Moths can fly in from outside through an open window or dusty air ducts and it takes a matter of days to weeks for them to do noticeable damage to your wool area rug. Keeping your rug clean is the key to deterring moths.

Use the other side of Swiffer cloths.,
Throw Swiffer cloths in the washing machine.,
Buy generic brand cloths.",How to Use a Swiffer Sweeper Multiple Ways2," Get more use out of the same dry Swiffer cloth by using the second side once the first has become dirty. While the sides are slightly different textures, they work equally well for picking up dust and dirt.


Simply shake out or gently wipe away any loose debris from the dirty side of the cloth when you notice it is no longer picking up dirt, then flip it over and reattach it to your Swiffer to continue cleaning.
Note that you can do this with wet Swiffer cloths, as well as your own reusable cloths., Reuse the standard dry Swiffer cloths as long as possible by washing them between uses. Put them in a gentle cycle or wash by hand to keep them clean.


Stick cloths in a mesh laundry bag meant for delicates before you put them in the washing machine. Set your washer to a gentle cycle setting to wash, then hang the cloth to dry before use.Cloths won’t come out perfectly clean from the washer, but they can be effective for several washes. Discard them once they are torn or no longer clean well.

, Purchase refills of dry or wet cloths from a generic store brand rather than Swiffer brand itself. This can save money while being just as effective.


Look in the cleaning supply sections of major chain grocery, discount, and big-box stores. You’ll find the store brand version of many items next to or near the name brand, typically at very reduced prices.
You should also be able to wash and use both sides of generic brand cloths to make them last longer."

Use microfiber cloth or socks.,
Sew or knit your own cover.,
Use your own cleaner for a wet pad.",How to Use a Swiffer Sweeper Multiple Ways3," Buy a small microfiber cloth, use an old rag, or cover your Swiffer with an old sock or other clothing. Use these materials to replace the standard Swiffer dry mopping cloths, and reuse them over and over by putting them in the washing machine to clean.


Try a fuzzy chenille sock for a great dusting material that you can simply pull on over the cleaning surface of the Swiffer.Buy or cut cloth to fit the Swiffer. You can use a standard Swiffer cloth to measure to the right size, though you may want your reusable cloth to be slightly larger to better attach the thicker material to the Swiffer.
Push a microfiber cloth or a rag into the four openings on the corners of your Swiffer head to attach it. If you have trouble doing this with thicker material, you can also use binder clips to fasten the cloth at the back of the Swiffer head., Make a custom reusable cloth for your Swiffer by knitting or sewing a pad that will fit perfectly over the head of your Swiffer. This can make it easier to attach and remove the cloth each time you use it.


If you like to knit or crochet, try creating your own textured “cozy” with a wool or cotton yarn. Attach it by pushing it into the holes on the Swiffer head, or create side pockets, baubles, or button closures to easily fasten it on.Sew fabric with a sewing machine to create a custom-fit cloth. You can create “pockets” on either end of a rectangle to fit onto the ends of your Swiffer head. Use a fleece fabric to catch dust best, or quilt regular cotton to create more texture for trapping dust.

, Use your own reusable microfiber or rag cloth with your favorite cleaner to recreate Swiffer’s standard wet mopping cloths. You can either spray or soak cloths in a watered down cleaning solution for use on your floors.


Try putting washcloths in a sturdy gallon Ziplock bag with 6 cups water, 4 cups white vinegar, and ½ tablespoon dish soap. Allow the washcloths to soak up the cleaning solution, then attach to the Swiffer head to use.You can also spray your floor directly with warm water or a watered-down cleaning solution before you use your Swiffer. This will help keep the wet cloth on the Swiffer damp to clean for longer.You can also use your own cleaning solution in another Swiffer product, the Swiffer WetJet, by cutting a small hole into a standard refill pack and filling it with a water and vinegar solution, or another cleaner of your choice."

Measure your rug’s width and length.,
Purchase the right rug pad.,
Lay the pad against the rug and mark it if needed.,
Trim the rug pad to size.,
Apply double-sided carpet tape to the rug.,
Remove the protective backing.,
Apply the rug pad.,
Lay the rug on the floor and test it.",How to Stop a Rug from Moving on a Wooden Floor1," Before you even think about going out to purchase a rug pad, you’ll need to know your rug’s dimensions. Use a tape measure to record the length and width of the rug. If your rug has fringes, leave them out of the measurement. The rug pad won’t need to cover them., You can get non-slip rug pads at any home improvement store or at dedicated carpet stores. If you can’t find a rug pad that matches your rug’s size, get one that has enough excess to comfortably fit your rug.Make sure to get a rug pad made of vinyl; materials like plastic or rubber might discolor wooden floors., If the rug pad is larger than your rug, you’ll need to trim it to fit. Set one of the rug pad’s corners up near the rug’s corners, leaving about an inch (2.5 cm)of clearance on either side. For each side where the rug pad hangs off, use a marker and a ruler to draw straight lines an inch (2.5 cm) away from the rug’s edge.


Make sure the rug is upside down for this, with the bottom of the rug facing upwards., Use scissors to cut along the lines you’ve traced in marker. General crafting or kitchen scissors should do fine. Make sure not to catch the rug as you cut; you may want to take the rug pad away from the rug for this step if you’re worried about cutting the rug.


You can keep the rug pad trimmings for future projects, but likely you’ll just want to throw them away., Start by cutting four strips, one for each side of the rug, sizing them so there’s about an inch or two (2.5 - 5 cm) of clearance on each side. Stick on the strips of tape.


While sticking tape on the perimeter of the rug is sufficient, you can cut a few extra strips for the center of the rug if you want a better grip on the rug pad., Carpet tape typically has a plastic backing covering one of its sides; this prevents it from sticking to your hands as you apply it and makes sure it’ll stay sticky when it needs to be. Just peel off this plastic covering when you’re ready to stick the rug pad on., Lay the rug pad on top of the rug, making sure to center it. Apply pressure where the rug pad meets the carpet tape in order to make it stick. You may have to make a few passes to get proper grip., Place the rug where you intend to leave it. Using your foot, apply pressure on the rug, trying to nudge it forward, backward and side to side. If you’ve applied the rug pad properly, the rug should stay in place.


If the rug still moves, you may need to reapply the rug pad. It’s also possible you need a rug pad of a different material, depending on your floors finish. Ask a home improvement professional for guidance."

Start in a corner.,
Push or pull the machine as directed.,
Walk the machine in long lines across the room.,
Move the machine slowly to allow it work.,
Allow the carpet to dry completely.",How to Steam Clean Carpet," Steam cleaning is most effective when you remove all toys, papers, and general clutter from the floor. Move all tables, chairs, and furniture out of the room. Clear as much of the floor space as you can.


If some furniture is too heavy to move, place squares of wax paper, foil, wood blocks, or plastic film under the legs to protect them from the moisture of the steam cleaner. You can’t clean the carpet completely if you leave furniture in the room.
If you don’t have room to move the furniture to another room, move it all to half of the room and do the room in two separate sections. Let the carpet dry before you move furniture back to the already cleaned half.;
, As you run the steam cleaner, you might knock dust off the baseboards if you don’t dust them beforehand. Use a dust cloth with wood polish or a long handled duster to remove as much of the dust as you can.


Dust ceiling fans and corners of the ceiling to prevent extra dust from falling on the carpet after you have steam cleaned them.

, Steam cleaners are meant to pull up small dirt particles that are down in the fibers of the carpet. They are not for removing hair and larger dirt pieces. Vacuum the entire room more slowly than you usually would. It is good to go over the room twice to get as much of the larger debris as possible.For extra cleaning, use a nozzle attachment to get right up to the baseboards and edges of the room.
Vacuuming also fluffs up the carpet so that the steamer can clean the fibers more effectively.

, Steamers can’t always lift deep, set-in stains, so it’s always helpful to treat stains before steaming the carpet. Use a carpet stain remover, or other natural solutions if you prefer. Blot the stain remover up with a cloth or leave it to be sucked up by the machine.When you do this, dab at the stains with a cloth. Never scrub at stains as this can cause them to work deeper into the carpet.

, Most machines have a heating mechanism for the water, but using hot water helps. Use water that is as hot as possible without actually being boiling. Only put as much water as the machine directs so that you don’t overfill the water tank. Look for a max fill line on the water tank.Some natural fiber carpet can shrink from hot water or be harmed by detergent, so always be aware of what type of carpet you are planning to steam clean., Steam cleaners usually use a detergent of some kind, so make sure to check the machine’s instructions to use the right kind. Only use the amount directed, as using too much soap will cause it to stay in the carpet.


Some machines will have a specific compartment where the soap goes, and others might direct you to mix the soap into the water.

, Steam is not actually what cleans the carpet, a detergent or cleaner is. If you are sensitive to chemicals or want a natural option, vinegar is great for cleaning. Mix a 50/50 solution of vinegar with the hot water., Find the corner that is diagonal from the door or entrance of the room. Start cleaning in the corner and slowly work yourself out of the room. If the room has an open concept or more than one entrance, you have more freedom regarding where to start. Wherever you start, don’t walk on the parts that have already been cleaned.If your steamer is one that you pull backward, put the head as close to the corner as you can. If you push the machine forward, clean a small area in the corner and then walk along the wall out of that area.

, Steam cleaners put hot water on the carpet and then immediately suck up the dirty water. Some are meant to be pushed to lay water and pulled back to suck it up. Others work only by pushing or only by pulling. It is important to read the directions for your machine before you use it.However the machine works, make sure that you don’t walk on the carpet you have just cleaned. If you must walk behind the steamer on the wet carpet, do so with bare feet so your shoes don’t leave marks.

, Steamers are most effective when you make long passes from wall to wall. Walk from the corner to the opposite wall and back. Pass over the same line twice if your steamer lays the soapy water going forward and sucks it up going backward. Don’t use short, back and forth strokes as you would with a vacuum.


When you start each new line, slightly overlap the line before it to make sure you don’t leave any lines of uncleaned carpet.

, Steam cleaners work slower than vacuums, so moderate your speed. Pulling the machine too fast will not give it time to suck up the water, leaving your carpets wetter than they should be. It’s better to go too slow than too fast.


As you walk in lines, a good rate is taking one step about every 2 seconds. This allows the machine plenty of time to work.

, Most carpet takes six to eight hours to dry all the way, but some may take 12-24 hours. Make sure you don’t walk on the carpet during this time. If you absolutely have to, put plastic bags over your feet so you don’t track any dirt onto the wet carpet.Place a sign at the entrance of the room to deter people from walking on it while it is wet.
You can also turn on the air conditioner and ceiling fans, as well as place standing fans or floor blowers in the room to dry the carpet out faster.

Flip the rug over and apply caulk.,
Let the substance dry.,
Flip the rug back and place it on the ground.",How to Stop a Rug from Moving on a Wooden Floor2," Follow the width of the rug when squeezing out strips of caulk. Lay strips at intervals of about 6 inches (15 cm) for the best grip.


Acrylic-latex caulk is best for this purpose.
Alternatively, you can use a hot glue gun to lay out grippy strips; the process will be essentially the same., Leave the rug in a well ventilated room where it won’t be disturbed. If you have children or pets, you should close the door so the rug isn’t disturbed.


Make sure to wait until the caulk (or glue) is completely dry. Placing the rug on the floor before everything’s dried will cause the rug to stick to the floor and damage it., Once everything’s dried, place the rug down on the floor. If you’d like to test it’s grip, just place your foot on it and try to slide it around. The dried caulk should prevent it from slipping around. If the rug doesn’t have enough grip, you can flip it over and add more strips of caulk with smaller spaces between them."

Flip the rug back over and lay it on the ground.",How to Stop a Rug from Moving on a Wooden Floor3," This will help with aligning the velcro on your floor, since they won’t be easy to move once placed. Use a pencil to trace the outlines of the rug’s corners. It’s best to use a light pencil that can easily be erased.

, For the sake of simplicity, you can flip the rug right over your markings., You can buy velcro in strips at any home improvement store, usually on a roll. Make sure you have both the hook and loop sides (one is rougher to the touch than the other). Cut four strips of the soft side and four strips of the rougher side., This plastic backing preserves the velcro strip’s adhesive properties. After peeling this off, lay the velcro strips on the ground, adhesive side facing upwards., Place each strip a few inches away from the corner, adhesive side facing towards the rug. Apply pressure to the velcro strips so they’ll stick. Repeat this for each corner of the rug. Be careful in placing the velcro strips, as they’ll be hard to remove once glued on., Use the placement of the velcro on the rug and the pencil markings you’ve made on the floor to help you align the velcro. Take your time applying the velcro to the floor; the adhesive is strong enough that you won’t be able to adjust the strips without completely ripping them from the floor. They’ll likely lose their adhesive property and leave glue on your floors., Align the velcro strips together, and apply pressure to each corner of the rug. The rug will now be securely held to the ground."

, You should use safety goggles, long shirts, long pants and gloves. Broken tile can be sharp and dangerous.

, It is inadvisable to try to tile over old tile, because your surface will not be even.


Use a chisel and a hammer to crack existing tiles. Once cracked, remove the tile in pieces, if it does not fall off automatically.
Chisel off remaining pieces. Beware not to gouge the wall too deeply, or you may create an uneven surface.
If the resulting wall is very uneven, you may want to re-plaster it. It is best to hire a professional to plaster the walls. If you are installing wall tile in a bathroom or other wet area, use cement fiberboard on the surface before you adhere tile.

, If you are not removing previous tile, you will still want to scuff up glossy surfaces with a fine-grit sandpaper to help the adhesive stick.

, Porcelain tiles are available through the Internet, home improvement stores and decorators. Buy extra tile for your project, since tiles will break in the process.


Take your tile to the home improvement store to try out glue. Different ceramic tiles require different types of glue. You do not want your glue to discolor the tile.

Use a clean, white cloth.,
Blot at the stain from the outside in.,
Rinse the stain with clean water.,
Blot the stain again with a second clean, white cloth.,
Block off the cleaned area to allow it time to dry.",How to Spot Clean Carpet1," When you clean up stains on carpet, always use a white cloth to avoid transferring any color from the cloth to the carpet. A white paper towel also works well for blotting stains, but make sure the paper towel does not have any printed designs.


The “clean” aspect is important, too, because a rag with old residue might transfer that to the carpet and make the stain worse.;
, Always gently blot at a stain rather than rubbing at it, as this causes the stain to spread farther and may damage the fibers of the carpet. Start at the outside of the stain and dab toward the center of the stain, which also controls spreading.Use a portion of the cloth to blot the stain once and a second portion to blot it again. This way, you pull up as much as possible without pushing anything back into the carpet.
This is the simplest method to spot clean carpet and often works without the use of stronger approaches or chemical cleaners.

, Use a spray bottle filled with clean, cold water, to spritz the stain. Soak the spotted area of the carpet thoroughly. Alternatively, if you don’t have a spray bottle, slowly pour water on the stain. Be sure not to over-saturate it.Cold water, rather than hot, is best because hot water may cause stains to loosen and spread more. Keeping the stain centralized is important.
This method is good for water-based liquids such as soda, some juices, lemonade, and tea. It may also work on foods stains like chocolate, fruit juice, gravy, milk, jelly, and syrup.
Water is least likely to cause damage to your carpet, so it’s best to try cleaning with water before you try anything else.

, Set the cloth you used the first time aside and grab a new, clean cloth or paper towel. Dab at the spot until all of the water is soaked up. It may be necessary to use a third cloth if the stain is large enough.


If you blot the stain, rinse it with water, and blot it some more with little or no results, move on to a method that uses a stronger cleaner than water.

, After you are satisfied that the stain has been removed, place something over or around the wet area to give it time to dry. Walking on damp carpet can press the moisture deeper. Damp carpet is also more likely to pick up new stains from shoes.


Set up a dinner-table chair or a step stool over the stain to keep people from walking on it.
Place a fan or blower on the spot to help it dry faster.

Hire a home remodel consultant.,
Above all, use caution.",How to Tell if a Wall is Load Bearing," To begin determining which walls in your house are load-bearing ones, it's best to start at the most basic load-bearing feature of any home - the foundation. If your house has a basement, start here. If not, try to start wherever on the first floor you can locate your house's lower concrete ""slab.""


Once you've reached your house's lowest point, look for walls whose beams go directly into the concrete foundation. Your house's load bearing walls transfer their structural strain into a sturdy concrete foundation, so any walls that interface directly with the foundation should be assumed to be load bearing walls and should not be removed.
Additionally, most home's exterior walls are load bearing. You should see this at the foundation level - whether wood, stone, or brick, nearly all exterior walls will extend right into the concrete.;
, Begin to look for thick, sturdy pieces of wood or metal called beams. These account for the majority of your house's load, which they transfer into the foundation. Beams often stretch through multiple floors and thus can be parts of multiple walls. If your beam spans from the foundation through any wall above it, the wall is load bearing and should not be removed.


Except for in unfinished rooms, most beams will be behind drywall, so be ready to consult construction documents or contact the builder if you cannot find them. Beams are often easiest to find in an unfinished basement (or attic) where portions of the structure are exposed.

, Look at the point where a beam meets the ceiling (if you're in the basement, this will be the underside of the first floor of your home, while if you're on the first floor, this will be the underside of the second floor). You should see long supports spanning the length of the ceiling which are called floor joists because they support the floor of the room above. If any of these joists meet a wall or a main support beam at a perpendicular angle, they are transferring the weight of the floor above into the wall and, thus, the wall is load bearing and should not be removed.


Again, because most walls' supports are behind drywall, they can't be seen. To determine whether certain floor joists in your house run perpendicular to a given wall, you may need to remove a number of floorboards in the floor above the wall so you have an unimpeded view to look down at the supports.

, Starting at the basement (or, if you don't have one, the first floor), locate your internal walls, which, as you can probably guess, are the walls inside your four external walls. Follow each internal wall up through the floors of your home - in other words, locate exactly where a wall is on a lower floor, then go to the floor above that spot to see whether the wall stretches through two floors. Pay attention to what is directly above the wall. If there is another wall, a floor with perpendicular joists, or other heavy construction above it, it is probably a load bearing wall.


However, if there is an unfinished space like an empty attic without a full floor, the wall probably is not bearing a load.

, The bigger a house is, the farther apart its load bearing exterior walls will be and, thus, the more load bearing internal walls there will need to be to support the floor. Often, these load bearing walls are roughly near the center of the house because the center of the house is the farthest point from any of the exterior walls. Look for an internal wall that's near the relative center of your house. There's a good chance this wall is load bearing, especially if it runs parallel to a central basement support beam., Internal load bearing walls can incorporate the house's main support beams into the construction of the wall itself. However, because these support beams are relatively large compared to non-load bearing studs, often, the wall itself will be designed to accommodate the extra size of the beam. If an internal wall has a large boxy section or an enlarged column at its end, this may be concealing a main structural support beam, a sign that the wall is load bearing.


Some of these structural features may appear decorative, but be skeptical - often, painted columns or narrow, embellished wooden structures can conceal beams that are highly important for a building's structural integrity., Sometimes, rather than rely on load bearing interior walls, builders use special load-bearing structures like steel support girders and and post and beam constructions to transfer part or all of a building's weight to the exterior walls. In these cases, there is a chance (but not a guarantee) that nearby interior walls may not be load bearing. Look for the signs of big, sturdy wooden or metal structures crossing a room's ceiling and intersecting a wall that you know is load bearing or an external wall, like boxy horizontal protrusions crossing the ceiling. If you see these, nearby internal walls may not be load bearing.


This method can give you a clue of where non-load bearing walls might be, but you can't be sure without checking the walls themselves. If you're unsure, check with the builder to be sure that this was the type of construction used.

, Many houses, especially old ones, have been modified, expanded, and remodeled several times. If this is the case with your house, a former external wall may now be an internal wall. If so, this innocuous-looking internal wall can be load bearing for the original structure. If you have any reason to believe your house has been significantly modified, it's best to contact the original builder, just to be sure that your external walls are your real external walls.

, Depending on the construction of your house, it may be impossible to accurately guess which walls are load bearing and which are not. In this case, your house's original blueprints or building plans can be a valuable resource. A house's blueprints can give you an idea of where support beams lie, which walls were the original exterior walls, and more. You can use this information to inform your decisions when it comes to designating certain walls as load bearing.


It's not at all uncommon for homeowners not to possess a copy of their home's original blueprints. Luckily, blueprints for your home may be found:

At the county clerk's office
In the possession of the original owners
In the possession of the original builder and/or contracting company


Finally, it's possible to commission a re-drawing of your home's blueprint from an architect. This, however, can be costly.

, Procure your house's original blueprint and invest an appropriate amount of time in determining whether a wall you're not sure about is load bearing. Look for the clues listed above - does it contain a major support beam? Are floor joists connected parallel to it? Was it an original external wall? Never tear down a wall until you're confident it's not load bearing, as even experienced home improvement experts can't always tell where a load bearing wall is solely based on visual cues. See wikiHow's guide on reading architectural drawings for more information.

, Generally, the more renovations your home has had, the harder it will be to tell which walls are load bearing and which are not. During home renovations, non-load bearing walls can be made to bear weight (and vice versa). For instance, hanging or cutting ceiling joists, adding stairways, and adding attic rooms usually require the changing of non-load bearing walls to load bearing walls. Take these changes into account when deciding which walls are load bearing - if your blueprints show walls that don't exist anymore or you see walls in your home which don't appear in the blueprint, figure out what kinds of modifications have been done before proceeding.


If you're unsure about your home's history of renovations, contact previous owners and builders for more information.

, The person (or company) that built your house can clue you in on the exact structure of the house. If construction was recent, they may not even charge you for a quick call or consultation. Even if they do, keep in mind that a relatively small fee is nothing compared to the disastrous structural damage that can result from tearing down a load bearing wall.

, If you can't figure out which walls are load bearing and no one you call seems to know, you may want to hire a professional building inspector. Paying for an hour of a building inspector's time is definitely worth it if you want to remodel safely.


Home inspections typically cost several hundred dollars.This rate can vary depending on the market and the size of the house - some high-end estimates can be as high as $1,000.

, Some independent companies offer their services to help would-be home improvers decide how to proceed with their project. These companies may employee construction managers, interior decorators, and other experienced home improvement experts. When it comes to modifying a wall that you're not sure is load bearing, these companies may be able to tell you what changes are possible, what changes are unsafe, or even answer the question of whether the wall is load bearing or not outright. If you're interested in this route, research companies in your area online to ensure you pick a credible, reliable company.

, Avoid removing a wall yourself unless you are extremely confident it is not bearing a load. As stated before, removing a load bearing wall can cause structural weakening and even potentially life-threatening structural collapse. Keep in mind that renovations are semi-permanent, so removing non-load bearing walls may change what additions you can make to your home in the future.

Understand the 3-4-5 method.,
Measure three units from the corner along one side.,
Measure four units along the other side.,
Measure the distance between your marks.",How to Use the 3 4 5 Rule to Build Square Corners," If a triangle has sides measuring 3, 4, and 5 feet (or any other unit), it must be a right triangle with a 90º angle between the short sides. If you can ""find"" this triangle in your corner, you know the corner is square. This is based on the Pythagorean Theorem from geometry: A2 + B2 = C2 for a right triangle. C is the longest side (hypotenuse) and A and B are the two shorter ""legs.""3-4-5 is a very convenient measurement to check because of the low, whole numbers. The math checks out: 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.;
, You can use feet, meters, or any other unit. Draw a mark at the end of three units.


You can multiply each number by the same amount and still use this. Try 30-40-50 centimeters if using the metric system. For a large room, use 6-8-10 or 9-12-15 feet or meters.

, Using the same unit, measure along the second side, at – hopefully – a 90º angle to the first. Mark this point at four units.

, If the distance is 5 units, your corner is square.If the distance is less than 5 units, your corner is less than 90º. Move the sides apart.
If the distance is over 5 units, your corner has a measurement of more than 90º. Bring the sides closer together. You can use a framing square as a guide when you do this.
Once you’ve got a square corner, you can check the room’s other three corners to ensure they’re the same.

Preparation: On unpainted concrete surfaces, proper preparation includes washing with trisodium phosphate (TSP).,
Application: After simple one-to-one mixing of my two part epoxy (I can mix one gallon at a time and easily apply it by myself without a problem), I apply the first coat with rollers and cut in with paint brush.,
The second coat adheres to the first for a pinhole free application.

,
Patching cracks, snap tie holes and the cold joint where the floor meets the wall is the only way sealing the basement will work.,
Avoid clear coatings, since they don't cover up the surfaces you have coated and repaired, which are likely unsightly.

,
Avoid coatings loaded with solvents and VOCs.,
Avoid coatings without money back guarantees in case of failure, including companies known to not honor theirs.",How to Seal and Patch Your Basement Walls and Floors," This will get your basement walls and floor ready for application of your coating. With the two-part water base epoxy coating that I use, an application over a damp surface helps the first coat penetrate into the concrete for a deep bond.;
, The material will seep into the porous concrete like a first coat of paint would. I like to apply with 1/2"" or 3/8"" nap rollers for a nice, thick coat that is applied at a rate of 125 to 150 square feet per gallon on walls and 175 to 200 square feet per gallon on floors.

,, I find that using hydraulic cement is only a temporary patch because the material is so brittle. Concrete by itself is worse. I use the two-part epoxy coating mixed with Sand Mix or Portland Cement and sand mixed with the epoxy for all crack-filling, unless it is actively leaking. Also, I prefer to patch the walls after applying my first coat of the epoxy coating, which acts a primer for patching. I then apply my second coat for a beautifully painted surface. A great trick for the cold joint or floor joint is to use the back of a spoon for a nice smooth cove. This method forces the mortar deep into the joint, the polymer in the mix allowing some flexibility and movement.

,, They can be dangerous to work with in tight areas.

Measure the size of the tiles you want to use and any tile spacers or grout.,
Ensure level tiles with the use of a batten, or wooden straight edge.,
Pin the batten on the wall.,
Use a vertical batten for your first tiles as well.,
Apply a layer of glue to the area above the batten with a notched trowel.,
Place a tile spacer between the tiles as you set them into the glue to allow space for grout.

,
Press the tile into the wall with a wooden board.,
Wipe away any excess glue with a wall scraper.,
Cut porcelain tiles to go near the edges of your walls.,
Allow the tiles to dry for at least 24 to 36 hours.",How to Tile a Wall With Porcelain Tile2," Decide how many tiles you will need to use to complete your pattern.

, Do not measure the tile according to the ceiling or floor, since these surfaces are not always level. Place a batten horizontally across the wall, and use a level to make it straight.

, Mark where the tiles will go with a pencil, including spacers or grout. The batten will help you to keep the tile straight and evenly spaced, so do not avoid this time-consuming step.

, Pin a level vertical batten in place. This will ensure your first tiles are at a 90 degree angle.

, You can use a vertical straight edge to help align the tile uniformly. In small areas, you may need to apply the glue with a brush, but make sure it has a notched surface.

,, Allow the tiles to dry according to adhesive directions in small areas, so that you can concentrate on making the tiles straight.

, Then, wipe away the tops of the tiles with a wet rag.

, You will need to use a wet cutter with a blade that goes in water. Measure each tile before cutting for a good fit.

, The glue directions should specify the necessary time.

Spread grout over the surface of the tile with a grout float.,
Clean the surface of the tile with a wet sponge.,
Polish the surface of your tiles with a dry cotton rag.",How to Tile a Wall With Porcelain Tile3," Choose a tile that is water and mold resistant.

, Run the wet sponge over the surface of the tile. Allow the grout to dry completely.

Pour vinegar into a spray bottle.,
Spray the spot with the vinegar.,
Dab at the stain with a clean, white cloth.",How to Spot Clean Carpet2," Find an empty spritzer bottle, or empty one and rinse it out completely. Fill the bottle with vinegar, or dilute it halfway with water.Some stains that vinegar will typically remove are soda, juice, milk, jelly, mud and various food-based stains.

, Test the vinegar in a hidden spot to make sure it won’t fade or damage the carpet. Then spray the spot so that it is totally soaked with vinegar. Allow the vinegar to sit for 10 minutes so that it has time to work., After the vinegar loosens the stain, apply pressure to the cloth with the palm of your hand. Rinse the cloth and repeat this process until the stain is completely removed from the carpet.

Blot and use water on the spot first.,
Soak the spot with white vinegar.,
Sprinkle baking soda over the spot.,
Let the mixture sit for one or two days.,
Place a plate or bowl over the spot.,
Vacuum up the dried out baking soda.",How to Spot Clean Carpet3," Just as you would with other stains, blot up the majority of the stain with a clean, white cloth. Rinse the stain with water and blot it some more. This process will get the majority of the stain up before you do anything else.

, Pour some vinegar into a spray bottle, or stick a spray nozzle directly into the vinegar bottle. If you don’t have a spray bottle, pour the vinegar directly from the bottle onto the stain. Use enough vinegar to cover the stain, but don’t saturate the carpet.Before you use vinegar on a visible spot on your carpet, test it on an hidden spot to check the colorfastness of the carpet. Vinegar will occasionally discolor carpet.

, Take the container of baking soda and use a spoon to scoop the powder out, or dump the baking soda directly from the container. Use enough to fully cover the area of the stain.Don’t be afraid to let the baking soda pile up a little bit, as it won’t hurt anything to use more than you need.
This vinegar and baking soda mix is effective on dried stains as well as fresh stains. It also works especially well for pet urine stains.

, Especially for tough stains like pet urine, let the mixture sit on the carpet for a day or two. This gives the vinegar and baking soda plenty of time to absorb the stain and any resulting smell. If you’re in a hurry, clean it up sooner, but know that it may be less effective.


Let it sit for a minimum of one hour so it has enough time to work.

, While the mixture sits for a couple of days, it presents an obstacle for anyone walking in your house. To avoid tracking baking soda all over the house, place a plate or bowl over the stain to keep people from walking on the spot.Another option is to place a chair or footstool over the spot to force people to walk around it.

, After you have allowed the mixture to sit a while and absorb the stain, use a vacuum cleaner to suck up the mess. It may require a few good passes to pull it all up out of the carpet fibers."

Mix one tbsp of grease-fighting dish soap into two cups of cold water.,
Pour the mixture into a spray bottle.,
Spray the stain with the water so it is totally covered.,
Dab at the stain with a clean, white cloth.,
Mix one tablespoon of ammonia with ½ cup warm water.,
Use a clean, white cloth to dab at the stain until it is removed.",How to Spot Clean Carpet4," In a bowl or bucket, add the soap and swirl it around in the water until it dissolves. It’s important to use cold water to prevent the blood from spreading farther into the carpet.Dawn is known for its grease-fighting formula.

, Use a spray bottle that is completely clean so you don’t transfer anything from it to the carpet. Pour the soapy water into the spray bottle. If you use a spray bottle that previously had another liquid in it, be sure to rinse it thoroughly.

, Using the spritzer bottle, soak the blood stain with the soapy water. Dried blood is likely to need more spraying than fresh blood will need. Don’t over-saturate the carpet, but make sure the stain is soaked., Take a cloth and put pressure on the stain, allowing the cloth to soak up as much of the blood as possible. It’s important to use a white cloth so that no color from the cloth transfers to the carpet.


A paper towel with no printing works great and allows you to toss it in the trash after the clean up.
If the first round of spraying and dabbing does not fully remove the stain, get a clean cloth and repeat the process as necessary.

, If the stain does not come up completely with dish soap and water, try the harsher cleaning power of ammonia. Mix the liquids in a cup that you can easily dip a cloth into., Make sure to use a different cloth than you used before so it is free of blood. Wet the cloth with the mixture and press it into the stain until it comes up completely.

Construct the framing as normal.,Install a sheet of drywall to the frame.,Before installing the next sheet apply acoustical sealant around panel perimeter and around any electrical boxes.,Then install the adjacent sheet of drywall, making sure to remove any excess acoustical sealant with a rag or putty knife as needed.,Repeat steps 2 through 4 until wall or ceiling is completely covered.,
Prepare to apply the second layer of drywall.,Make sure the drywall surfaces are clean and free of loose fibers like sawdust.,
Apply the damping material per the manufacturer's directions.,
Next, place the coated sheet over the already installed drywall and screw to framing members.,
Install the adjacent sheet of drywall being sure to remove excess acoustical sealant with a rag or putty knife as needed.,Repeat steps 6 through 11 until wall and or ceiling is completely covered.,
After the drywall is in place, apply dry-wall mesh tape along the joints between the two pieces of drywall.,Cover the screw heads with drywall compound.,
Allow the joint compound to dry, then sand it smooth.,
Apply a second coat of drywall compound, allow it to dry, and sand it smooth.",How to Use Viscoelastic Damping Glue and Drywall to Soundproof a Room," Your results will be improved if the framing is decoupled. Also consider a bit of insulation in the wall if there's none there now.
,,,,, Cut the drywall to fit around any electrical boxes or openings as needed.,, This is generally a 3/8"" bead of the damping material applied to the back of the second drywall layer., Damping glue will thus be sandwiched between 2-layers of drywall. It is important to screw (not nail) the second sheet of drywall to the original studs or joists to compress the damping compound. Damping glue is not a structural adhesive... you need screws to secure., Please note: acoustical sealant will remain viscoelastic, i.e. not dry, so it is necessary to tape and texture over these joints. Please see acoustical sealant instructions for more detailed information.,, The mesh tape helps hold drywall compound in the gap. Use a wide drywall knife to spread joint compound over the mesh tape. Don't try to fill the entire gap all at once; apply a little at a time, and allow it to dry before applying a second coat.,, Wear breathing protection during this step because the process generates a lot of dust., Repeat the process as necessary until the wall is perfectly smooth, then finish the walls as desired."

Clean up as much of the mess as you can.,
Spray or sprinkle a spot cleaning product on the mess.,
Let the cleaner sit for as long as directed.,
Soak up the cleaner with a dry, white towel.,
Spray the stain a second time if the first time does not remove it completely.",How to Spot Clean Carpet5," Anytime you spill on carpet, speed is the most important factor. The longer a mess sits, the more it soaks in. Lay a towel over a fresh spill and let the towel soak up the liquid. For solid messes, scoop or vacuum up as much as you can before you use a cleaner.

, Most manufactured spot cleaners come in a convenient spritzer bottle or aerosol spray can. You may also have a powder cleaner which you’d sprinkle on the stain. Cover the stain completely but don’t saturate the carpet.


Follow the specific instructions on the container anytime you use these products.
Look for spot cleaning products at most big-box stores, home improvement stores, and many grocery or dollar stores.

, Some cleaners may only need to sit for 10 seconds, but others may need 10 minutes or more to do their work effectively. Don’t be too eager to wipe them up. Give them time to work.

, Using either a clean rag or paper towel, gently apply pressure to the stain so the rag or towel can soak it up. Press a dry portion of the rag into the spot at least twice to pull up as much as possible.

, Some bad stains may need to be treated more than once, and this is up to your judgment. If you are not satisfied with how the spot looks after you clean it, repeat the above process as needed.

Install the basic frame and one side of the wall, leaving the wood studs exposed.,
Use putty pads, often sold as ""fire stoppers"" to seal up electrical outlets or boxes.,
Blast the exposed wall with damp-blown cellulose, a recycled insulation and sound proofing material.,
Press the cellulose down flat before it dries.,
Seal up the wall with the first layer of sheetrock.,
Use green-glue sealant to cover up all the edges on the sealant.,
Apply soundproofing compound to the back of your drywall sheet in a zig-zag pattern.,
Install the second layer of drywall (backed by the glue) like normal.,
Continue with construction like normal, as sound-proofed walls are no different than any other.",How to Soundproof a Wall or Ceiling1," You'll need the frame of the wall already installed, as well as one side of the actual wall. You will then stuff the wall with sound-proofing before sealing up the wall.


If you're working on a wall, you can seal up either side first -- it shouldn't matter.
If you're working on the ceiling, you want to soundproof it from the top. Seal up the ceiling of one room, then work on the floor of the room above it.;
, This material, though often used to prevent electrical fires, molds beautifully onto electrical boxes, wires, and other uneven items in the wall.

, Made from recycled newspaper, you spray this on the wall, where it naturally fills into cracks and holes for even, solid insulation. Cover up any outlets or pipes with electrical tape before beginning. Wearing a respirator, use the damp-blown cellulose hose to cover the entire wall, starting from the bottom up.









You'll need roughly 260 bags of cellulose for a 4000-square foot house.The fumes are not harmful, but you should still always wear a dust mask., Using the roller or scrubber provided with the damp-blown cellulose, flatten the insulation to the wall, filling in any gaps as you work.You will need to wait a day for the flattened cellulose to dry before proceeding.

, Clean up any excess insulation so that it is flush with the wall, then hang the first layer of sheetrock to cover up the insulation. A double sheet of drywall will significantly help dampen sound. If you're set on a single layer, however, apply soundproofing adhesive to the back of the drywall now.

, Use an acoustic-damping sealant to get every edge of the drywall. Don't skimp here -- any air path you have needs to be closed off to prevent noise. Acoustic sealant remains permanently flexible, making it a great soundproofing solution. Make sure you caulk:









The ceiling line
The floor line
Where the sheets of meet drywall.
Any outlet or electrical holes.

, Take your tube of green glue and cover the back of your sheetrock with the glue. You'll likely need 1-2 full tubes for each 6-foot sheet. While it looks like a thin, useless layer, the Green Glue forms a thin, sound-proofing layer to absorb vibrations and significantly dampen noise.

, Cover the back of the pad with zig-zagging acoustic glue, install the sheet, and repeat. Note that, if you're not double-hanging the drywall, you can still add this glue to your first round of sheet rock to dampen some sound.









Re-caulk over any exposed edges when done.
Good drywall installations never let the seams overlap between the first and second layers. They are staggered., Because of the double drywall, the room is about 5/8"" shorter than it would normally be.

"
"
Consider buying ""quiet rock"" instead of normal drywall.,
Try installing the simpler, easier ""dry blown"" cellulose.,
Fill the cavity between the studs with a fiberglass or mineral wool insulation instead of damp blown cellulose.,
Apply a single layer of drywall with soundproofing compound.,
Isolate or float your drywall off of the studs by using resilient channel or sound isolation clips.,
Understand Sound Transmission Class (STC) ratings when choosing construction materials.",How to Soundproof a Wall or Ceiling2," This is much more expensive, but significantly lowers the number of steps needed to sound-proof a room. You install like normal, and it is specially made to absorb sounds and frequencies.

, Dry blown insulation requires that you attach a netting to the exposed wall, which catches the cellulose and holds it on the wall. It takes a bit more time, but it is doable by yourself without expensive equipment. All you need is a standard hopper., Purchase it in bulk, then cut it to fit each panel of the wall. Slide it in place and attach to the back of the wall according to the manufacturing instructions. This is much harder to work with, and get right, but it can be cheaper and makes much less of a mess. To use it:


Wear a respirator at all times.
Seal any electrical boxes with soundproof caulk.
Cut your insulation (R-11 fiberglass works well) with a utility knife.
Screw backing boards, like 1/2 plywood, to the edges of the wall to provide a base for drywall nails.
Attach the resilient channels, long metal bars, horizontally across the wall., Instead of installing the first sheet like normal then proofing and installing the second, simply apply the glue straight to the first sheet. Work in a zig-zag pattern, covering the whole sheet and then install it like normal. Afterward, continue on with the noise-proof caulking.

, Basically, sound is transmitted through vibrations, so touching walls will vibrate each other more than walls that don't touch. Decoupling is when you separate the walls to prevent sound transmission. Keep in mind that resilient channels are prone to failure, and is not specified by the Steel Stud Manufacturers Association, so be careful. You could also:


Float the walls or floor
Isolating studs with joist gasket tape., STC is used to tell you how good a material is at soundproofing. A higher STC means it will do much better at soundproofing. Aim for materials with an STC between 30-40."

Lay down a carpet.,
Purchase and apply mass-loaded vinyl to the walls and ceiling.,
Use acoustic caulking to fill in any air holes in the room.,
Tack thick blankets up to the walls for a temporary solution.",How to Soundproof a Wall or Ceiling3," Springy, cushy carpet is great at absorbing sounds and frequencies in the room, cutting down noise significantly. Even several thick rugs can help keep noise down, and are an important step in soundproofing. Don't forget about the floor!, Mass absorbs sound, and this thin sheet is made to absorb a lot of it. You buy it by the roll, which you then cut and apply to the walls, ceiling, or floor. Make sure that, as you work, you don't leave gaps between the sheets. This significantly decreases effectiveness.

, Cracks, seams, and exposed bits of wall and duct will all pull sound in from other parts of the house. Even if the wall or ceiling is already built, a little sound-proof caulking can close out unwanted noises.


Cover up wide or open door and window frames with an adhesive weather strip.
Pay special attention to air ducts -- a lot of sounds often enter through them., Remember -- mass is your friend. Big, thick blankets on the walls will absorb sound from the outside much like insulation would on the inside. It doesn't always look great, but it will soundproof in a pinch."
"
Understand this method.,
Install insulation if needed.,
Apply damping compound to a new drywall sheet.,
Install the drywall.,
Fill all gaps with acoustical caulk.,
Wait for the compound to dry.,
Add an additional layer if necessary.",How to Soundproof a Ceiling1," This is a middle ground approach, moderately effective and relatively easy to install. You can expect it to add roughly 6 to 9 ""STC points,"" reducing loud conversations to indistinct speech or murmurs.If you're trying to block music and other loud noises, decouple the ceiling instead.Use the decoupling method for concrete ceilings as well.;
, Drill a quarter-sized hole in the ceiling and look for insulation. If none is present, blow in cellulose or medium density fiberglass insulation.There is no need to repair the holes afterward, since you will be installing new drywall underneath.


Do not install new insulation if there's any old insulation, even if it's worn out. The old insulation will prevent you from blowing in new insulation evenly.
Avoid foam insulation and expensive ""extra dense"" products. These can make low density vibrations worse., ""Green Glue"" or another damping compound will reduce vibration between the two layers of material. Apply it to the back of a new sheet of drywall, according to label instructions.


⅝"" (15.9mm) drywall is recommended, since extra mass blocks more sound. However, if the existing drywall is ⅝"" thick, choose ½"" (12.7mm) sheets for the new layer. Different thicknesses resonate at different frequencies, so two different types will block more sound.You can buy pre-dampened drywall, but this is expensive and no different from what you could make yourself., Screw the drywall to the underside of your ceiling. Try to keep the gap around the perimeter as small as possible.

, Even a narrow gap around the perimeter or ceiling fixture can let a lot of noise through. Before choosing an acoustical caulk, read the label carefully:


Confirm the caulk is suitable for use on your materials.
Check whether you can paint over the caulk. If not, make sure the color matches your ceiling.
Consider a fire-resistant caulk to prevent spread of fire between floors. This may be required by your local building code.

, The damping compound is a major part of this installation. It may take ten days or more for the compound to cure fully and reach its final soundproofing qualities.Check the compound label for a specific time frame.

, If soundproofing is improved but still not ideal, consider repeating the process. A third layer of drywall and damping compound can make a significant difference.If the room is not noticeably more soundproof, another layer is unlikely to help. It may be more effective to treat the ceilings in adjacent rooms, or to soundproof the walls.

Install sound curtains or thick blankets.,
Use bookcases.,
Mount shaky items.,
Install a door sweep.,
Use acoustic wedges panels.",How to Build a Sound Proof Room1," You can absorb a little sound by mounting thick blankets to the wall.If you're willing to spend a little money, purchase heavy sound curtains instead.








If you have thick, insulated walls, this will have little additional effect.;
, You can make walls thicker and more soundproofed by simply making use of bookshelves. Cover a wall in bookshelves and books for a fairly effective sound barrier. Plus, you get a nice library out of the deal.








, Have you ever had a neighbor turn their music up really loud and noticed that buzzing, rattling vibration sound more than anything else? Yeah, that’s why you’re going to want to mount items like speakers. Use vibration insulation pads when mounting to keep items like speakers from annoying everyone around you. 







, Nail this rubber loop to the base of a door to block the gap. If the gap is too large to cover with a sweep, nail a strip of lumber to the base of the door first.







, Purchase 12""x12"" panels with a 2"" depth curve relief. These do well to absorb low to high frequencies. Some panels come already with an adhesive peel. Use 3M spray adhesive to glue the panels to the walls and ceiling if it doesn't come with adhesive peel. You can cover all or just parts of the surface, depending on the amount of dampening you desire. This cuts down on the 'noise' inside the room and keeps your ears happy, especially if it is music rehearsal space.









Use a panel that is mostly fiberglass with a thin Mylar perforated facing. These types of panels have the highest ratings in sound absorption values among almost all but the most expensive specialty tiles. They will give you far more bang for buck than any other on the market.

Remove the existing ceiling drywall.,
Reinforce the floor above (recommended).,
Install insulation between the ceiling joists.,
Consider floating ceiling joists.,
Purchase hat channel instead.,
Install the hat channel perpendicular to the joists.,
Screw in resilient sound clips.,
Install drywall over the channel.",How to Soundproof a Ceiling2," The current drywall is in direct contact with the ceiling joists. This allows sound from the floor above to pass directly through the joists with little resistance. Once the old drywall is removed, you can install a new ceiling with an air gap between it and the floor above.

, Decoupling alone is very effective at reducing the sound of conversation and high-pitched noises, but it can make low frequencies (such as stomping feet) sound louder! To get the best of both worlds, apply damping compound to a new sheet of thick drywall and screw it onto the subfloor from below.See above for detailed instructions. Take care not to use screws that break through the floor above.
Alternatively, complete the rest of this method first, then reinforce the new ceiling with a second layer. Reinforce both ends if extreme soundproofing is required.

, Standard R19 fiberglass insulation is just as good as the more expensive ""acoustic"" insulation. Fill the gaps between the joists, but avoid over-compression, which can carry vibrations through the floor.Cellulose, mineral fiber, cotton, or polyester are effective alternatives. Do not use foam insulation.If you choose the floating ceiling joist approach (see below), install the joists before you insulate.

, This is the most effective decoupling method, but may not be feasible if the ceiling space is taken up by ductwork. To do this, install a new joist between each pair of ceiling joists. The new joists should extend 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) further down than the original joists.Ideally, the floating joist can rest on the inside layer of a decoupled wall. This creates another air gap between the joists and the outside layer of the wall.
If you choose this approach, you do not need to follow the rest of the instructions. Just install more drywall over the joists, then fill in the perimeter with acoustic caulk.

, Installing hat channel (furring channel) and sound clips is less effective than floating joists, but uses less vertical space. For best soundproofing, choose furring channel marked ""087F125-18"" or confirm that it meets these specifications: ⅞"" (22.2mm) depth; 25 gauge; hemmed long edge. Twenty gauge channel is more common, but significantly worse for soundproofing.Alternatively, you can purchase resilient channel, which is designed for soundproofing. However (at least in North America), resilient channel is not standardized, so it's difficult to guarantee it will work.Read customer reviews before purchasing.

, Install the channels no more than 24"" (61cm) apart, and position the end channels within 6"" (15cm) of the wall. If there is a vent in your ceiling, end the channel flush against the frame of the vent on either side. Place additional short lengths of channel on either side of the vent to increase stability.If the channel is not long enough to reach across the ceiling, overlap channel lengths by at least 6"" (15cm) and screw together. Do not install sound clips onto overlapped areas.
Place the channels within 16"" (41cm) of each other if you plan to support a triple layer of drywall.

, Hat channel alone is not very effective, especially under non-dampened drywall.Install soundproofing clips through the hat channel as follows:Place clips around the perimeter of the ceiling, within 6"" (15cm) of each wall.
Fill in the first channel with sound clips spaced 48"" (122cm) apart.
For best results, shift the next row's sound clip placement by 16"" and fill it out, spacing clips 48"" apart as before. Repeat the shift for each row. To save money (using about 10% fewer clips), arrange clips in a grid pattern instead, using the same positioning as the first channel.
See your clip product instructions for how to fasten. Avoid over-tightening, which can reduce soundproofing.

, Install drywall sections perpendicular to the channels for maximum strength. Fill in gaps around the perimeter with acoustic caulk.


Applying damping compound and adding a second layer of drywall is recommended, especially if you did not reinforce the subfloor above.

",How to Build a Sound Proof Room2," The thicker and denser the material, the more sound it will absorb. Consider using ⅝"" (1.6 cm) drywall instead of the thinner sizes.









If you are improving on an existing wall, build a basic wall frame and attach it to the surface, anchoring it to the existing studs. Cover this with a new layer of drywall or sheetrock.

, Whenever sound travels into a new substances, some of its energy is absorbed, and some is reflected. Increase this effect by building the wall from two sheets of drywall or sheetrock, with as much space between them as possible. This is called decoupling.









Decoupling actually makes the wall worse at blocking low frequencies, due to the resonance of the wall. If the gap is only 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less, a damping compound is highly recommended to fight this effect., Most walls contain a single row of studs touching both layers of wall. Sound travels easily through these studs, which can cancel out a great deal of work. When building a new wall, choose one of the following stud placements instead:








A double row of studs, one along each interior side. This is the most soundproof method, but requires enough space to leave a gap between the two rows.
A staggered row of studs, alternating placement along one interior side, then the other.

, These are placed between the studs and the drywall, providing an additional barrier for sound. There are two main options:


Sound clips are the most effective method, absorbing sound with heavy rubber components. Screw them into the studs, insert a hat channel, then screw the drywall into the channel.













Resilient channel is a springy metal channel designed for soundproofing. Screw this to the studs and drywall using offset screws.This may improve high-frequency blocking at the expense of low frequencies.












Note that hat channels are not effective at sound proofing.

, This magical substance converts sound energy to heat. This can be used between layers of wall, floor, or ceiling. Unlike most other methods, this should absorb low-frequency noise. This makes it ideal if you expect loud bass from music and home theater systems.








This is also sold as noise proofing glue or viscoelastic adhesive.
Some of these compounds may take days or weeks to ""cure"" to their full potential., Damping compound is one of the best all-purpose soundproofers, but there are many other insulation materials.









Fiberglass is cheap and fairly effective.Foam insulation is a poor soundproofer. Thermal insulation is its major advantage.

, Even small cracks and gaps between materials can undermine sound proofing. Special acoustical caulk (also sold as acoustical sealant) fills these gaps with an elastic, sound-resistant material. Fill all cracks, as well as seams around the walls and windows. Keep the following in mind:








Water-based caulks are easier to clean up. If using a solvent-based caulk, check the label to make sure it won't harm your materials.
If the caulk doesn't match the wall color, choose one that specifically says it can be painted over.
Consider using normal caulk for the smallest cracks, since acoustical caulk is more difficult to handle.

, Floors and ceilings can be soundproofed using many of the same systems suitable for walls. Most commonly, homeowners add an additional layer (or two) of drywall, with dampening glue in between.As a simple additional step, cover the floor with soundproofing mats, then install carpet.









You do not need to soundproof the floor if there is no room below you.
Heavy concrete ceilings won't benefit much from the additional mass of drywall and damping compound. Instead, add a drywall layer with an air gap in between, or fill the gap with fiberglass insulation.

, If the soundproofing in your completed room is not substantial enough, you can also use acoustic panels. Cheap options are available, but the more expensive panels may be more effective.









Be sure to attach these to wall studs or other strong structures.

Prime this mid-section of your wall with wallpaper primer.",How to Install a Wallpaper Border Halfway Down the Wall1," Measure the width of the walls you plan on applying the border to and add about 1.5 feet (0.5 m). (45.7 cm) for every 15 feet (4.6 m). (4.5 m) you measure. Many manufacturers sell borders in 5 yard (4.6 m). (4.5 m) spools, and having the extra length makes it easier to match the pattern when you start a new spool.;
, Focus on the middle section of the wall that you plan on applying the border to and correct any problems you find.


Fill in any cracks in your paint with joint compound, sanding it down and painting over it after the joint compound dries.
Glue peeling wallpaper down by applying a small amount of wallpaper paste to the back. Even though the peel may be at the top or bottom of the wall, away from where the border will be, pasting down the edges now will prevent the paper from peeling up toward the center or along the corners later on.

, Generally, borders placed in the middle of the wall are about 36 to 42 inches (91.4 to 106.7 m) above the floor, but the height you choose is up to you.

, Place the level in the corner of the wall, just below the height you want the top edge of the border to sit at. When the bubble in the level is centered, lightly draw a line with pencil along the top edge of the level.

, Slide the level along the wall, connecting the lines and making sure that the bubble of the level is centered as you go along. When you finish, there should be a light line spanning across your walls.

, Allow it to expand by applying paste to the back if it is un-pasted or by soaking it in water for 10 seconds if pre-pasted. All the moisture to soak into the paper border for 5 minutes before measuring the height of the border from top to bottom.

, Subtract 1/2 in. (1.27 cm) from the height of the border, and use this figure to determine how far below the top line to draw the bottom.

, Use a small paint roller to apply the milky primer to the section of wall in between the two lines, careful to avoid letting it stray outside the space.Primer will stain the wall, and you will be able to see any uncovered primer if it is hit by the right sort of light. Let the primer dry before applying the border over it.

Loosely fold the border into accordion folds.,
Allow the border to sit for five minutes.",How to Install a Wallpaper Border Halfway Down the Wall2," Reverse-roll it so that the underside faces out. This process helps to flatten out the paper. As you work with it, you should also check the border for scratches or other flaws. When finished, unroll the paper and allow it to lie flat with the underside facing up.

, The best paste to use will vary depending on the conditions of the wall you plan on attaching it to.


If applying the border to a painted wall, a standard wallpaper paste should be fine.
If applying the border to a papered wall, you may need to apply a specialized vinyl-to-vinyl paste.

, Do not let paste get on the front of the border. Folding the border keeps the paste moist.

, During this time, it will relax and expand.

Carefully unroll the paper.",How to Install a Wallpaper Border Halfway Down the Wall3," Keep the border rolled with the glue side facing up.

, Dunk the roll in a shallow tray of water. Allow it to stay submerged for about 10 seconds before removing it from the water.


Alternatively, you can unroll the paper without dunking it in water and apply a special paste-activating gel to the glue side of the border with a paintbrush., Fold the glue side inward without creasing it, and allow the border to relax and expand for about 5 minutes.

, Press it down as flat against the wall as possible as you move along the length of the wall, but do not press it so hard that you stretch the paper. Make sure that the top edge of the border stays parallel with your guiding line, as well.

, Cut the border so that there is an extra 1/8 in. (3.175 mm) extending onto the next wall.

, Do not start at the edge of the previous strip. Instead, allow the two strips to overlap, matching the patterns up as best as possible.

, You can use a specialized smoothing tool or a moist sponge to accomplish this.

, Often enough, a strip of wallpaper border may end in the middle of a wall instead of a corner. Splicing strips together makes the seam less obvious.


Place a small strip of wax paper under the end of the bottom strip.
Lay the new strip over the old strip, allowing for an overlap of 1 or 2 in. (1.27 to 5.02 cm). Match the design on your new strip with the ending design of the old strip.
Cut away excess paper at the overlap using a razor blade. Keep the cut straight down and do not cut through the wax paper. Discard the excess paper and wax paper when done.
Use a soft cloth or seam roller to flatten the edge.

, Gently wipe excess paste from the front of the border and from the wall using a damp sponge before the paste dries.

Measure your space.,
Disassemble your room.,
Prepare the walls.,
Determine your starting point in the room.,
Make your measurements.,
Create a plumb line.",How to Hang Wallpaper1," Wall covering retailers can help you calculate how much wallpaper you need, but here's a quick guide to a good calculation. Get a notepad and measure the room's height and width by wall section. For example, two walls 12' wide x 8' high, and two walls 11' wide x 8' high. The math is:


12x8=96, 12x8=96, 11x8=88, 11x8=88. 96+96+88+88 = 368 sq. ft.
Now you are thinking to yourself, ""what about doors and windows? I must subtract for that, right?"" Wrong. A certain amount of ""waste"" paper is necessary for calculated mistakes, so don't worry about counting out empty spaces.;
, Get your tools and remove all wall switch plates, metal air vents, towel rods, toilet paper holders, etc. Take down any wall mounted light fixtures (turn power off a breaker first). To avoid losing the screws or having to keep track of them, screw them back in their respective locations after the plates and covers are removed.

, Wallpaper has a difficult time sticking to dirty or greasy walls, so wipe down yours with a damp cloth. Patch any holes in the walls, and give time for both your patches and water on the walls to dry.


If you are wallpapering over pre-painted walls, add a coat of primer first.
If your walls have wallpaper already on them, take the time to remove it before adding your new layer of paper. This will guarantee a longer lasting application.

, Common advice is to start in the most inconspicuous corner of a room. For example, in a bedroom, this is usually in the corner behind the door. In general, don't start your wallpaper on a central wall, unless you're doing an accent wall. Choose an area to the side that won't be viewed first.


If you are hanging wallpaper in a bathroom, doing so behind an existing toilet can be difficult and tedious, so you may want to consider hanging those pieces first (most toilets will impact two strips of wall covering in one way or another) while you have the most energy and patience.
Put yourself in a good position to have a full length or two of wall covering to hang before you have to start addressing corners and obstacles if at all possible.

, Measure your first piece from ceiling to floor. Typically, in a house with 8 feet (2.4 m) ceilings, your measurement will be about 92 inches (233.7 cm) since most everyone will have a base board at the floor. Roll out your wall covering on a table or floor, pattern side up. Double-check all your measurements so that you don't make a mistake in cutting your paper. The goal is to keep your paper in as big of sections as you can to create a more seamless look.

, Take a measuring tape, 2 feet (0.6 m). level, and pencil and go to the starting point in the room. You want to establish a plumb line to ensure the first piece is hung perfectly straight up and down. Measure horizontally the width of the wallpaper strips from your starting point. Subtract 1/2 an inch from this, and draw a vertical line at this point.


Work your way around the room and create a similar plumb line at corners or new walls. This will ensure that your wallpaper is always hung in line.
Don’t use ink pens to create the plumb line as the adhesive will cause the ink to run and bleed and ruin the wallpaper."

Measure the distance between the edge of the last sheet of wallpaper and the corner.,
Hang the sheet, smooth it with the wallpaper brush, and carefully press it into the corner, being careful not to tear the paper.

Wallpapering a ceiling with intricately patterned wallpaper can be difficult if you're trying to match it to existing wallpaper on the walls.
Make sure the wallpaper you buy is neither too heavy nor too light. Cheap wallpaper is often too light and will tear when attempting to lift it to the ceiling. Heavy wallpaper can be a problem because it is difficult to maneuver above you.

,

Mark with a pencil the width of each section of wallpaper minus 2 inches (5.08 cm). For example, if each wallpaper segment is 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide, you would make a mark along the ceiling every 10 inches (25.4 cm). This ensures proper overlap.

,

Measure the length of your ceiling and add 3 inches (7.62 cm) to each end.
If the room you are wallpapering is not a perfect square or rectangle, you will need to take additional measurements.

,

Pre-pasted wallpaper need only soak in water before application.
For unpasted wallpaper, you must first mix the paste. Place the section of wallpaper into the paste and create pleats after the back surface is covered.
Wait a few minutes before applying either pre-pasted wallpaper or unpasted wallpaper, as the paste and water need time to settle.

,

Place your ladder in a convenient location and carefully climb up with one end of the wallpaper in your hands.
Your partner should be standing on the ground holding the bulk of the pleated wallpaper. He or she will be feeding the paper to you as you apply.
Begin in the corner, facing the wall. Place the edge of the paper into that corner and line the other end up with your marks from earlier. Leave a few inches of length for trimming.
Once the end is secure, use a brush to flatten out the wallpaper. Locate and brush out air pockets as they form.
Move along the length of the wall as your partner feeds you more paper.

Talk about any concerns right away.",How to Hire a Wallpaper Hanger,"


Ask family and friends for recommendations. The people with whom you are closest will be the most honest with you about their experiences with wallpaper hangers. They will tell you which wallpaper contractors were the most professional and which did a substandard job.
Find wallpaper hangers by asking contractors you have used for other types of jobs for their recommendations.
Call the Better Business Bureau to find out if there are multiple complaints filed against the wallpaper contractor you are considering.;
, The wallpaper hanger will come to the site of the job, assess the materials and labor necessary and provide you with a statement detailing how much the job will cost.

, You want to be certain that the work has held up over time, and find out whether the wallpaper contractor finished the job professionally, on time and on budget.

,, If the wallpaper hanger is legitimate, there shouldn't be any problem receiving proof of a contracting license and certificate of insurance. These documents will give you the information you need to be sure the wallpaper hanger is in good professional standing.

, Never hire a wallpaper hanger unless everything is in writing so that you have something concrete to refer to should a disagreement arise regarding any aspect of the work. A reputable wallpaper contractor will not hesitate to agree to, and should ideally insist upon, providing a contract.


The contract should include: the contractor's name, address, telephone numbers, email, website and insurance and licensing information; the cost of the job and the terms of payment with start and completion dates; a detailed list of supplies; warranties, guaranties and cancellation policies; and any other terms you feel are important, such as cleanup.

, If there are problems once the job has started, ask to speak with the wallpaper hanger in private for a few minutes to address what is worrying you. Waiting until the wallpaper job is finished will only serve to make you more frustrated as work continues when the problem could have been solved with a few words in a timely manner.

Look at the run numbers.,
Check for defects.,
Find the pattern repeat.,
Identify the pattern match.,
Find the top of your paper.,
Cut your wallpaper.",How to Hang Wallpaper2," Check all bolts to insure that they are all of the same ""Run #"". Sometimes the term is ""Lot #"" or ""Batch #"". This is important as the same pattern will be printed in production runs. It is very common for separate runs to have slightly different colors and backgrounds.

, Inspect the entire bolt for defects in the printing process. These are usually streaks of color, blobs of ink, or color voids. One small defect in an entire roll can usually be cut out and worked around. If there is enough defect in the paper that you may lose an 8 foot (2.4 m) strip then you should return the wall covering for a refund.

, Find an object near the edge of the paper, measure down the paper until you get to the exact same object. This distance is called the pattern repeat. Keep this measurement in mind, as you will use it later to line up strips of the paper.

, This is either a straight across match or a drop match. A straight across match is when two pieces of paper placed next to each other have the same pattern in grids horizontally. A drop match is when the pattern moves up or down a bit horizontally in each strip.


For example, you would have a straight across match if you see a butterfly on the left edge of the paper when you line up and pattern match the next piece beside the first and the butterfly is in the same spot on the left edge again.
A drop match means that the same object on the left edge (the butterfly in this example) will drop halfway down the length of the pattern repeat when the second piece is pattern matched to the first.

, Study the pattern of your wall covering and decide what you want your “top” to be. This is what will be hung directly at the ceiling. Some patterns will have a natural break in the pattern and in between this break usually makes a good “top”.


Try to avoid having a visually significant item in the pattern exactly at the top of the wall. Ceiling lines tend to rise and fall and if you have a visually significant item at the ceiling you will begin to lose the pattern if the ceiling dips.
Try to choose a “top” about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above any significant pattern items. This will allow for the ceiling to rise and fall without affecting the visibility of this item.
If you can, choose a “top” that has a small item in the pattern on the left or right edge of the paper that is easy to identify. This will make measuring and cutting much easier.
Drop match patterns will have two “tops”. You will alternate between “top A” and “top B” as you progress around the room. Most of the time with a drop match, you choose the “top A” and take what you get with the “top B”.

, On the table, cut your wall covering about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your designated “top” ensuring you do not cut a crooked line or wavy line that extends down into the pattern where your “top” is. This will give you excess while hanging and this will be trimmed away on the wall. Take a razor blade and cut the roll about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) beyond the total length measurement. This excess will be cut off on the wall.


There is a little more leeway with the bottom excess. When in doubt, add a bit more to the bottom than to the top.
Use a yardstick to help make your cuts smooth and even, and to prevent cutting at an angle.

Cut off the top excess.Get your 6 inch (15.2 cm) joint knife and a new razor blade and go back to the ceiling.,
Cut off the bottom excess.,
Wipe off messy adhesive.,
Continue adding strips.",How to Hang Wallpaper3," Using a paint roller, apply adhesive to the back of the wallpaper. The idea is to wet the paper, not drench it. It will take a few attempts to get a good feel for the right amount. Make sure you roll past the edges to get adhesive at the seams. Only apply your adhesive to the top half of the paper for now. This step may be skipped for wallpaper that is pre-pasted.

, Take your top and fold it down the table about 18 inches (45.7 cm), so that you have “glue on glue” for about 18 inches (45.7 cm). Align the paper’s edges so you do not have exposed edges. DO NOT crease the paper at the point of the fold. Gently rub or press the edges to seal against each other. Now, lift and pull the rest of the unpasted portion onto the table - the pasted/folded portion may hang off the edge - and paste the rest of the sheet.


Pick up the wallpaper and let it hang in your hands. If watery adhesive pours out of it, then you have definitely used too much adhesive or the paste is too thin. A few drops is OK, but you should not have a significant amount of dripping glue.

, Most wall coverings will expand due to the moisture in the adhesive; 20 and ½ inch wallpaper will expand and become 20 and ¾ inch wallpaper. If you were to try to hang this right away, you would discover that vertical bubbles would appear and will not smooth out. Let the paper sit in the folded position for around 10 minutes, to give the adhesive time to expand the paper completely., Get your ladder in place, smoothing brush in pocket, and booked piece of paper. You can quickly identify which is the top as it will be the shorter of the two folds. Unfold only the short fold and align only the right edge of the paper to the penciled plumb line taking care to ensure your “top” is at the ceiling where you want it.


Before you rub this section out with your smoothing brush, notice if you are able to move or “slip” the paper on the wall slightly. The slip indicates that you have an adequate amount of adhesive on the back of the paper.
If you have no slip, then you need to add a bit more adhesive at the pasting table. Slip is your friend as long as you don’t have too much.

, Once you have good alignment with the plumb line at the right edge. Take your smoother and gently rub the paper to the wall in a left and up direction. You want to apply the paper by smoothing, not before smoothing. Ensure that you have not slipped or rubbed the paper’s right edge away from the plumb line.


Never use significant force to smooth bubbles out or force alignment to plumb lines and seams with the smoother.
Get the top edge as close to the wall as possible, and don't worry about cutting off excess. Cutting the extra off too soon may cause a misalignment.

, Now you should have the top 36 inches (91.4 cm) of wallpaper applied to the wall with the rest of the paper still folded up. Carefully find the bottom edge of the paper, lift away from the wall slightly so the paper you are pulling down will not stick to the wall and gently pull it down the wall until it is completely unfolded. You may undo an inch or two of the initial work above but that’s no big deal.


Starting at the top right of this section, use your 24 inch (61.0 cm) level as a guide to stay plumb at the right edge and smooth out the rest of the paper starting from right to left.
Don’t force the paper over to the corner, let gravity help place the paper onto the wall.

, Work the edge of the joint knife blade into the ceiling joint. This should give you a nice little crease all the way across the width of the paper. Starting at the right edge of the paper, place the joint knife in the crease holding the handle down. Take the razor blade and press it into the crease on top of the blade – cut on the ceiling side of the joint knife - right to left.


Once you run out of joint knife blade, move the joint knife to the left and cut another 6 inches (15.2 cm). One more cut should get you very close to the corner.
If you can, go ahead and cut all the way to the corner. You may not be able to get the razor blade into the corner. If so, you can peel back the corner of the wallpaper and by using the already cut portion as a guide, cut the remaining excess wallpaper “off the wall” and then place the corner section of the wallpaper back into place.

, Cutting the excess at the base board works the same as the ceiling, except the joint knife handle will face up the wall. Remember to cut on the baseboard side of the joint knife, not the wall side. If you try to make these cuts on the wall side your razor blade can wander and give you an uneven cut. Again, if you cannot get all the way to the corner, pull the corner back, make your cut and then place the finished corner back into place.

, It’s guaranteed that you have some adhesive on the surface of your freshly hung paper. Using clean water and sponge, wipe down the wall covering – top to bottom. Take your time, wallpaper adhesive can be hard to see. Don’t forget to clean the glue off the ceiling joint and baseboard.


Avoid using terry cloth rags or towels. They can be too abrasive and can ruin the finish of your wall covering.
Smooth out any bubbles that might have formed in the wallpaper with your sponge. The strip of paper should be completely smooth when you're finished.

, Use the aforementioned steps to continue adding more strips of wallpaper. As you add each strip, take time to line up the pattern and overlap when necessary. Well hung wallpaper will lack any visible seams and discrepancies in the pattern.

Hang your paper above a window or door.,
Work around the window.,
Cut off the excess.",How to Hang Wallpaper4," Continue adding your paper towards the right until you hit the frame. Rub your finger against the wall covering and through the paper feel and locate the top left corner of the window or door trim. Once you locate the exact corner, take your razor blade place it at the exact location of the corner and cut at a downward at a 45 degree angle towards the center of the door or window.


Once you are about three inches down and away from the starting corner, level out your cut and cut toward the right until you have cut all the way across the paper.
Cut the excess paper just inside the frame all the way down the edge of the window. You will go back later and make exact cuts along the frame.

, Continue adding strips of wallpaper around the window, making sure to keep a plumb line so that your strips are perfectly vertical. At the areas that hit the window, cut downwards at a 45 degree angle and then around the inside of the frame. You should eventually get to a point at which your window or door has a rough cutout of wallpaper around it.

, Use a straight edge and a new blade on your knife to get a smooth cut around the frame. Press the wallpaper completely flat and smooth out any bubbles, and then use the straight edge to hold the paper to the frame. Use the knife to cut along the straight edge and create a perfect shape around the window."

,, Your cut should follow the seam where the two pieces of trim were fitted together at the corner.

, Smooth the sheet, then roll the edges with the seam roller.

, For a door, measure the distance from the frame to the ceiling and cut the sheet so it overlaps the trim as before. For a window, if the sheet doesn't reach the other corner, cut two pieces and hang them separately. Take care to match the pattern with the adjoining sheet.

, Avoid wee hours of the morning or when family is engaging in other activities like watching their favorite movie, eating dinner, etc.

, Although you can't soundproof it completely without great expense you can take measures to avoid some of the noise and vibration.


Soundproofing isn't pretty.
It's almost impossible to soundproof a ceiling without adding extra insulation so if you're on the first floor you won't be helping the people above you. Consider moving to an upstairs room.
You'll need to remove art from the walls and relocate clutter and non-essential items. Know where you can store items.
If you're sound reducing in your bedroom you can keep your bed, dressers, desks, etc. but you'll need to move all of your clutter, trinkets, and art work. The fewer flat surfaces the better.

,


Imagine the room without the furnishings and art.
Measure the wall areas of the room from floor to ceiling, the area of the doors, windows and the floor areas.

,


You will have to add product to the wall surfaces (if you are in a house you can get away with surfacing the walls sharing other interior walls and not worry about the walls between you and the yard).
Floors will also need to be covered. If you already have carpet, you're fine, but hardwood floors will need to be covered with a large rug.

Extra insulation is also beneficial but can be expensive. Do check to make sure insulation in the attic over the room isn't missing or damaged even if you don't opt for having extra added.
Carpeting is popular for soundproofing.

If you are concerned about appearances you can buy a large amount of the same color and pile. If not, just buy a large collection of whatever is cheap.
It is debated whether the rubber backed business type carpet or shag carpet work best. Usually the rougher the surface the more sound waves it will absorb.
Carpet is heavy so consider buying 24"" squares and applying them individually instead of a very heavy piece of carpet.
Try buying several remnants and have them cut into 24"" square pieces. Pick complimenting colors and attach to the wall with tiny nails or large pins.
Applying carpet with glue will be expensive to repair. Don't do it unless you own the home and can afford major wall repairs.


Egg crate mattress pads offer a wavy sine wave looking surface

Egg crate mattress pads can be purchased at any discount store or store that sells bedding.
Like carpet it can be heavy and difficult to keep from falling down. It may be best to cut it into manageable pieces before you apply in sections to the wall.


Fabric furniture pads are also a common soundproofing product

Don't use the flimsy furniture pads commonly rented by moving companies but the dual sided and sewn mattress pads that appear quilted.
Contact local furniture stores and moving companies and ask about buying new or used directly from them
Most furniture stores may offer you torn used ones but they may also agree to sell them to you at cost.


Heavy fabric, drapes and blanket can also be used but will not provide as much sound dampening as the above items.

Considering adding a drape on a curtain rod over doors to add extra soundproofing to doors and closet areas.
Heavy drapes can also be added to windows to minimize noise going out and coming it.



,, You will also need a friend to assist for a better look.

,, Only use liquid nails if this is a permanent studio and you are aware of the cost associated with repairing the wall damage once removed.

,
Apply duct tape to the back of the material to reinforce it

, Dust it regularly with a hand held vacuum cleaner.

,,, Get heavy duty weather strip seal and carefully apply around the door frame perimeter, where the door meets the frame.

Make your measurements.,
Make your first cut.,
Finish cutting.,
Hang the ""to the corner"" section.,
Measure the width of your ""after the corner"" section.",How to Hang Wallpaper5," Take your ruler or tape measure and measure the exact distance from your right edge of the last piece on the wall to the corner. Measure three times: at the top, middle and bottom. Take note of the longest measurement. If the three numbers are the same or very close, your corner is relatively plumb and you have done a good job keeping your wallpaper plumb as well.


Take the longest of the three corner measures and add about 3/8 of an inch. This will be the length you measure your wallpaper to.
Once you get good, you can consider using 1/4 of an inch in the cutting process instead of 3/8 of an inch.

, Place a previously pasted and booked sheet of wallpaper onto your cutting table with your ""top"" and ""bottom"" edges facing up. Place the ruler across the wallpaper just at one of the folded ends on the table and carefully measure from the left seam (if you are approaching the corner from the left) over to your ""length + 3/8"" distance. Take a razor blade and make about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) cut parallel to the edge (seam) of the paper at this mark.

, Repeat your 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) cut at the other end of the folded paper using the same ""length + 3/8"" distance. Now you should have a small cut at both ends. Hold the ruler down reasonably firmly so that it does not slip as you cut. Take a new razor blade and make a lengthwise cut in order to cut the wallpaper into two sections. You now have a ""to the corner"" section and an ""after the corner"" section.

, This piece should overlap the corner at least 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm), and if your walls are crooked it may overlap the corner by more at the top middle or bottom. The key is to have overlap ""top to bottom"" at the corner, but too much overlap can be noticeable.


If the overlap is greater than about 3/8 of an inch, take a fresh razor blade and making a freehand vertical cut, carefully cut away any overlap that is greater than 3/8 of an inch.

, Take your level and draw a plumb 36"" pencil line onto the new wall at this distance. Using the plumb line as a guide, hang this piece and get as good of a pattern match in the corner as possible. Again, it is most critical that this piece be plumb as it will set the stage for hanging the next wall nice and straight.


You want to avoid overlapping back onto the prior wall if you can. It's better for this piece to not quite make it back to the corner than overlapping.
The 3/8"" overlap from the first piece will ensure you have wallpaper in the corner. If by chance, there is a ""gap"" where the second section does not get to the first section's ""overlap"", then remove the full second section, lightly re paste, and rehang."

Return furniture and decorations.",How to Tissue Paper a Wall," Pull furniture away from the wall that you're going to tissue paper. Remove the furniture from the room temporarily, or push it to the other side of the room. Take down paintings, pictures, decorations, and light covers from the wall.


When you remove light and electrical covers from the wall, tape the screws to the back of the plate so you don’t lose them.;
, It’s a good idea to tape up any surfaces or items that are touching or near to the wall. This will protect adjacent surfaces from paint. Apply painter’s tape and press it down with your fingers to secure it in place. Items and surfaces to tape include:Adjacent walls
Ceilings and baseboards
Window and door casings
Switch plates

, Paint has a tendency to drip, so protect the floor below the wall you're painting with a large plastic or canvas drop cloth. Tape the edges of the drop cloth to the baseboards if you're worried about the sheet moving around.


If there's any large furniture near the wall that you weren't able to move, cover it with the drop cloth to protect it., Tissue papering a wall with gouges or nail holes will result in a messy look. Inspect the wall for holes, and mark holes you need to fix with a pencil. You'll need a putty knife and drywall compound or spackling to fill holes:Scoop some drywall compound onto the putty knife
Apply the compound to the wall, pushing it into the hole with the putty knife
Hold the blade edge of the putty knife flat against the wall and scrape off excess compound
Allow the compound to dry for 24 hours

, When the drywall compound is dry, go over the entire wall with 120-grit sandpaper using an orbital sander. This will smooth out the compound, remove excess dirt and grime, and give the primer an even and slightly rough surface to stick to.For small areas and tough to reach corners, use a sanding stone to sand the wall.

, Washing after sanding is important because it will remove dust and leftover dirt from the wall. Fill a bucket with warm water and add a tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid dishwashing soap or all-purpose cleaner. Dip a sponge into the water, wring out the excess, and wipe down the wall.When the wall has been wiped, empty and rinse the bucket and refill it with clean water. Use a clean sponge to wipe down the wall with plain water to remove soap residue.
Once the wall has been rinsed, allow it to dry for another 24 hours.

, A base coat, such as primer or a neutral paint, will even out the surface color of the wall you're tissue papering. Fill a paint tray with a latex primer or paint. Use a roller to apply a thin coat to the wall. Use a brush to get paint into corners and where the wall meets the ceiling.After applying the base coat, allow the wall to dry for about four hours.

, Tissue paper is thin and wrinkles easily, which is why it’s so great for adding texture to a wall. Take a piece of tissue paper, crumple it up gently into a ball in your hands, and then delicately unfold it again. The wrinkles will stay in the paper and will show up on the wall when you apply the paper.Repeat this process with several pieces of tissue paper and set them aside. How many pieces you'll need for your wall depend on the surface area of the wall.

, Use the same paint that you used for the base coat. It will act like glue and hold the tissue paper to the wall. Wet a roller with the base coat paint. Starting at the top left corner of the wall, roll a thin layer of paint onto a section of wall that’s about 4 feet by 4 feet (1.2 m).It’s important to work in small sections so the paint is still wet when you apply the tissue paper.

, Spread open a piece of crinkled tissue paper. Line up the side of the tissue paper with the corner where the two walls meet. Line up the top of the tissue paper with the corner where the wall and ceiling meet. Press the tissue paper flat against the wall.


Use your hands to flatten out the tissue paper. Don’t worry if there are some small wrinkles and creases., Take a dry paint brush and brush the tissue paper gently to secure it in place against the paint on the wall. Then, gently go over the paper with a clean roller to smooth it out and flatten down the wrinkles.


When you're brushing and rolling the tissue paper, be particularly careful at the edges, because you don’t want to scrape or tear the paper., Once the tissue paper has been rolled flat and into place, grab the roller that you used for the base coat again and apply a thin layer of paint over the tissue paper. Press gently to avoid moving or tearing the paper, and be careful around the edges.A layer of paint on top of the tissue paper will help secure it in place and protect it from damage.

, Move over one section to the right from the original tissue paper. Apply a thin layer of base coat to the next 4-foot by 4-foot (1.2-m) section of wall. Overlap the paint on the right side of the original piece of tissue paper by an inch or two (2.5 or 5 cm).Be very careful when applying paint to the tissue paper, as the edges can rip easily.

, Open a fresh piece of crinkled tissue paper. Line up the top of the paper with the ceiling and the left edge of the paper with the original piece of tissue. Overlap the tissue paper pieces by an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm), and press the paper flat onto the wall.


Use a dry brush to secure the paper in place. Go over the paper with a dry roller to smooth the paper and flatten wrinkles.
Paint over the tissue paper with a thin layer of base coat to protect and encase it.

, Continue working across the wall horizontally, painting small sections and applying overlapping pieces of crinkled tissue paper. When you get near the end of the wall, measure the final section of wall and cut a piece of tissue paper to size so it will fit.When you’ve applied the final piece of tissue paper to the top section of wall, go back to the left-hand corner of the wall and start again one row down.
Once you’ve painted the final piece of tissue paper, allow the wall to dry overnight.

, Fill a paint tray with a latex paint in a color of your choice to match the rest of the walls or the décor of the room. Saturate a clean roller with the new paint. Working in small sections, apply a thin layer of paint over top of the tissue papered wall. Use a brush to paint in the corners.


To achieve a more interesting effect with the paint, apply the top coat in a random pattern, overlapping the strokes until the entire wall is covered.Some of the most popular top coat techniques for tissue papered walls include using metallic paints and glazes to achieve a gilded look, or highlighting the raised wrinkles with a darker or lighter paint color than the rest of the wall to create more depth.

, As soon as your final coat of paint has been applied to the wall, remove the tape by pulling it toward yourself at a 45-degree angle. If you leave the tape too long, the paint may dry to it, and you'll rip paint off with the tape.


Once the tape is gone, you can remove the drop sheet that was covering the floor.

, Give the final coat of paint at least four hours to dry. When that time is up, you can return furniture to the room and rehang pictures, paintings, and switch plates.


Latex paint needs about 30 days to cure, or harden fully. You can rehang pictures as soon as the paint is dry, but there may be some stickiness. To avoid this, wait 30 days before rehanging pictures and decorations.

Clean the walls.",How to Strip Wallpaper from Plaster and Lath," Depending on how the wallpaper was made, it could be easy to pull off in dry strips or it could be quite difficult to penetrate. The method you use to take it off your walls will differ according to what type of wallpaper you're dealing with. Here are the possibilities:



Dry-strippable wallpaper. This is designed for easy removal, and should be possible to strip without using moisture. Try peeling back a corner of the wallpaper; if it comes off relatively easily, it's probably dry strippable. If it immediately tears, it probably isn't.

Porous wallpaper. This type of wallpaper may not come off in easy sheets, but it will quickly absorb water and loosen up, making it not-too-difficult to strip. Figure out if it's porous by using a sponge to apply some water to an area. If the wallpaper soaks it up, it's porous. If it drips right off, it's not.

Nonporous wallpaper. Lots of wallpaper has a decorative nonporous layer. You'll especially see this with wallpaper that's metallic or has raised parts. This type of wallpaper will need a bit of extra work; you'll have to score it before you apply water, to allow the water to soak in and loosen it.;
, One layer of dry-strippable wallpaper will take no more than a few hours to remove, but if you have more than one layer, things can start to get tricky. Peel back a corner of wallpaper and see what's behind it. Do you see plaster, or more wallpaper? Keep peeling until you reach the plaster, and count how many layers you've got to remove.


If you have more than 2 layers, it's going to be a very big job. You might want to consider getting someone to help you or renting wallpaper removal equipment to help the job along.
If there's a layer of paint on top of one of the layers of wallpaper, that will make things tougher, too. Again, you might need to gear up for some extra help.

, The same basic supplies will be useful no matter what type of wallpaper you're dealing with. If you've got a particularly tricky combination of nonporous wallpaper + 4 layers to remove + coats of paint in between, a few extras will be in order. Here's what you need:



For dry-strippable wallpaper:

Wallpaper scraper
Putty knife



For porous wallpaper:

Wallpaper scraper
Putty knife
Wallpaper remover solvent
Bucket of water and sponge
Spray bottle



For nonporous wallpaper:

Wallpaper scraper
Putty knife
Wallpaper remover solvent
Bucket of water and sponge
Spray bottle
Wallpaper perforating tool (or sandpaper)



, Wallpaper steamers can be extremely helpful when you've got an especially tough job on your hands. Instead of soaking your walls in water, you'll use the steamer to apply hot steam to the wallpaper, loosening it right up and allowing you strip it away. Steamers aren't expensive to rent for a half-day or day of work - you probably won't pay more than $15 - $30 for the job. You can also buy your own steamer for about $50 if you anticipate needing it for more than one day.

, It's not uncommon to find crumbling plaster underneath layers of wallpaper. Putting up wallpaper to hold plaster together is a cheap DIY repair that many homeowners use, rather than forking over the money and effort required to make real repairs. When you remove the layers of wallpaper, chunks of plaster might come off as well. Peeling back the layers may also reveal cracks in the plaster or other problems. Be prepared to fix these issues before you apply paint to your walls., Before you get going, take the time to set up your work area so that you can get the job done as quickly as possible without dirtying your house too much.


Lay down some newspaper or a tarp to protect your floor and catch drips and pieces of wallpaper.
Have a garbage pail nearby for the wallpaper strips, so you can easily collect them in one place as they come off the wall.
Have a ladder handy if your walls extend above where you can reach.
Put on some old clothes, as the dust from the old wallpaper and plaster will definitely cling to you as you work.
If you're sensitive to dust, you may want to wear a mask as you work.

, Fill your bucket and spray bottle with a mixture of water and wallpaper removal solution. The recommended ration is 5 ounces of wallpaper stripper diluted with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Dividing it between a bucket and a spray bottle will help you reach every corner of the walls.

, If you have nonporous wallpaper, start by using your perforation tool or sandpaper to perforate the wallpaper. Rather than doing it section by section, it's easiest to perforate all of the wallpaper so you won't have to go back and do more later. Make sure the wallpaper is evenly perforated, from top to bottom and side to side, to ensure it will all be able to take in water or steam.


Don't try to perforate the wallpaper using a knife or another sharp point. This could damage the plaster underneath the wallpaper.
Perforation tools work by rolling over the wall and puncturing the wallpaper with tiny points, never going deep enough to damage the walls.

, You can skip this step if your wallpaper is dry-stripping. If you have porous or nonporous wallpaper (not dry-strippable), it's time to wet the walls. Use your bucket and sponge or spray bottle - depending on which section you're working on - to thoroughly soak the wallpaper. Give it about 10 minutes to soak in and loosen the wallpaper.


Don't soak all of the walls at once. It's better to soak a section large enough that it will only take you about 15 minutes to remove the wallpaper there. Letting water sit in the walls for a longer period of time could damage the plaster.Try working on a 4' X 10' section at a time.
To reach higher areas, you can also use a paint roller or mop dipped in the wallpaper removal mixture.
If you're steaming the wallpaper, go over a section with the steamer, loosening the wallpaper along the way. When you're finished, rest the hot steamer head in a baking pan.

, Use the the putty knife and wallpaper scraper to pry up and strip the wallpaper. Pull it back at a sharp angle, rather than straight off the walls; this reduces the chance that you'll pull off plaster, too. Keep stripping until the wallpaper has been removed from the area you wet down.


While you're stripping one area, have another area soaking. This will move the job along faster.
You may find it difficult to peel back the wallpaper after one soaking. If the wallpaper is stubborn, soak it thoroughly again and wait another 10 minutes.

, Continue the process of soaking or steaming, letting it sit, and stripping until you've successfully removed every layer of wallpaper. Go back over the walls to get the pieces of paper that remain.


As long as the wallpaper is wet & malleable, work at it a while, and have your scrubby sponge handy to help it along.

, Once the wallpaper is off, down the walls with clean, fresh hot water. This will prep your walls for whatever you decide to do next, whether it's repairing your walls or painting them. You may even want to hang more wallpaper!

Perforate the wall.,
Spray DIF on the wall - LIBERALLY!,
Allow the solution to soak in for about 15 minutes.,
Immediately before you begin scraping, spray the area again, this will allow the paper & glue to remain moist.

,
Scrape the wallpaper off the wall.,
You must make sure that you get not only the wallpaper itself but also the backing paper as well.

,
Once you have the paper off, repeat the entire process again to remove as much glue as possible.",How to Remove Wallpaper with the DIF Method," It is important that you do not ""score"" the wall, as this will damage the wall and cause the paper to come off in small strips. Specialized tools are available at your local hardware store. Look for tools which have spur-like wheels on them. These tools will perforate the wall with thousands of little dots, so that the DIF can soak in. Make sure you do a thorough job of perforating the wall. You'll notice that areas with less perforation are harder to remove;
, It is recommended that you do not simply spray the whole wall down, as you'll waste the solution. The solution will dry before you get to it. Instead, spray the area you're going to be working with.

, If you attempt to remove the paper before it is given a chance to work, you'll be wasting your time fighting with the wallpaper.

,, You can use a regular scraper, a putty knife, pocket knife, or a specialized tool for this. Home Depot sells a special wallpaper scraping tool that helps prevent gouging the wall. I highly recommend it.

,, This will be quick - just spray the DIF and scrape again.

Wallpaper scoring tool. This is a small hand tool which has several small rotating wheels with small teeth to score the paper without damaging the surface underneath.
Wallpaper stripper spray or a solution of half vinegar, half water
Sponge
Spray bottle
Scraping tool
Tarp;
, If the room you're going to be working on is quite large, or if you're removing several layers of paint and wallpaper, it might be prudent to rent a steamer instead of trying to strip everything off by hand. Steamers can be rented by the hour from home and garden centers. They come with a steam canister and a nozzle that you run over the walls to help loosen the wallpaper with steam.Steaming typically makes the job easier and faster. However, if you're working with wallpaper that has been painted over by more than one layer of paint, steaming might not work, since it's difficult for the steam to penetrate all the layers. In this case you'll need to strip everything off by hand.
Steaming is a greener alternative to using a chemical wallpaper stripper. A steamer operates using plain water, no chemicals required.

, Taking paint and wallpaper off of the walls can get messy. Paint chips, strips of wallpaper and dust will pile up quickly and get into the cracks and crevices in your floor and furniture. Cover the area where you're working with a tarp and put a dropcloth or sheet over the nearby furniture.


Move smaller items like lamps and pictures out of the room or toward the center.
You might want to wear a mask to protect yourself from dust, too.

, This will make it easier to strip off the wallpaper from underneath them. If there are outlets or switches in the area where you are working, be sure to turn off the power.

, Dab a small amount of nail polish remover onto a paper towel, and rub onto the paint in question. If the paint comes off on the towel with remover, you have latex paint, if not, it is alkyd (oil) paint. Latex is water soluble and will be easier to work with; alkyd will be ""stickier"" and may require several attempts to get the paper to release., Run the tool over the area several times to create many punctures in the paper. Push only as hard as required to pierce the paper; try not to damage the surface underneath.Use a Brillo pad if you don’t have a tool.
Start with a five by five foot area, rather than scoring all of the walls at once. This could save you some work in the long run, since if the wallpaper won't come off with solution or steam, you'll have to pull it off in strips., Either down the wallpapered area with the removal solution or start using the steamer over the area you scored. Make sure the area is thoroughly soaked through with moisture.


To steam, move the steamer's hot plate slowly over the scored areas, checking to make sure the steam is soaking through the wallpaper.
To soak, use the sponge and spray bottle to completely soak through the wallpaper, then let it sit for a few minutes.

, The wet paper should release from the backing and come off in strips. If it doesn't, soak or steam the area again and try pulling it off once more. You may need to do this a few times if the paper and paint have been there for some time.


When the paper starts to release, use a plastic putty knife (or a nylon spatula) to pull all the paper off the surface.
Continue scoring the wallpaper and reapplying the wallpaper remover solution to the other areas until you've peeled off as much wallpaper as possible.

, Sometimes the wallpaper won’t absorb the steam or wallpaper remover, and you have to scrape most of it off by hand. Scoring it and soaking it can still help, but there's no way around pulling it off in tiny strips.


Use the scraping tool to pull up edges of wallpaper, then pull it off in strips.
The process can take several days unless you have help.

, When the area is free from wallpaper and backing paper, wash it down with detergent to remove any glue and softener. Give it a final rinse with clean water.


This helps prepare the surface for a new coat of paint or wallpaper.
Be sure the walls are completely dry before continuing., If there are gouges and places where parts of the wall came off, you might need to repair the walls. Sand the area and patch any damaged areas with spackle or wood filler. You may need to hang new drywall if there's serious damage.

, Cover the surface with a coat of primer if you intend to paint, or wall size if you are papering.


Be sure to prime the walls with wall size first, since this will help you remove the wallpaper if you choose to do so later.
Don’t be tempted to paint over wallpaper again.

Cut a small scrap of drywall.,
Cut the outline of the scrap piece away from the wall.,
Insert a piece of wood backing into the hole.,
Place the drywall patch into the hole.,
Tape over the joints between the patch and the wall.,
Apply the first coat of joint compound.,
Apply the second layer of joint compound.,
Sand and paint the drywall.",How to Patch A Small Hole In Your Dry Wall," Begin by finding some scrap gypsum board that is the same thickness as the wall you are repairing. Use a drywall saw to cut a small rectangular section of this scrap drywall big enough the cover the hole in your wall. Place the scrap rectangle over the damaged wall to ensure that it is large enough.;
, Place the scrap rectangle of drywall against the damaged wall and outline it using a pencil. Then, you will need to clear away the existing drywall along the outline you drew to make room for the new piece.


Begin by using a drywall saw to cut 4 lines from the hole to each corner of the outlined rectangle you drew. Then, use a utility knife to score the drywall paper along the entire outline.
One at a time, snap each of the 4 pieces of damaged drywall along the scored line. Clear them away with your utility knife, using the knife to clean up the edges of the cut if necessary.

, To help secure the scrap drywall rectangle into the hole, you will affix a scrap piece of wood behind the wall. 1""x3"" or 1""x4"" (25x75 mm or 25x100 mm) lumber works well for this.


Begin by cutting the scrap of wood to a length about 6 inches (15 cm) longer than the height of the rectangular hole. Apply a continuous strip of general purpose glue along the face of the wood.
Insert the wood backing into the hole, and then orient it so that it spans the hole with about 3 inches of overlap on the top and bottom. Press the wood against the wall to seat the glue against the back of the drywall.
Using an electric drill, drive 2 drywall screws through the wall into the wood backing both above and below the hole. This will secure the wood to the wall and give the new drywall piece a firm backing for support.

, Fit the rectangular drywall patch snugly into the hole. Press it firmly against the wood backing to ensure contact with the glue, and drive 1 or 2 drywall screws through the patch and into the wood.

, From this point on, the project should be finished just as you would finish a joint between drywall panels in a new installation.


Apply strips of drywall tape along the edges of the new drywall patch. Run your finger along the tape to ensure that it is firmly seated.
As an alternative to drywall tape, you can apply a cutout of window screening over the entire patch. This screening can be seated into a thin layer of joint compound.

, Use a 6-inch (15 cm) drywall knife to smear a thin layer of joint compound over the patch. Make sure to cover the entire patch as well as each of the 4 seams between the patch and the wall.

, After allowing the first coat to dry overnight, go back over the area using a 12-inch (30 cm) drywall knife. Apply a thin coat as before, extending the coverage area a few inches (cm) and feathering the joint compound as smoothly as possible into the existing wall surface.

, After allowing the final coat of joint compound to dry overnight, sand it gently using a fine-grit sandpaper. The drywall is now ready to be primed and painted to match the existing finish.

Prime the walls, then sand again.,
Don't over-sand.",How to Install Drywall," Larger 4'x12' sheets are available, but are harder to work with and are usually used by professionals with a few extra hands. These larger sheets tend to break easily during transport to the job site, although they typically require less work because the larger sheets mean fewer joints to tape.


Drywall is normally installed horizontally but can be installed vertically if desired.;
, The 1/4"" sheets are often used as overlays to existing drywall and are not intended to be used in new construction. Check your local building code for requirements in your area.

, When selecting drywall, use compositions that fit the environment they will be installed in. For instance, there are various moisture resistant products commonly called ""green rock"" designed for installation in high moisture areas such as garages and bathrooms. Check your local building supply store before committing to purchase.


Green rocking the whole house may be overkill, but could be helpful in high moisture areas, such as bathrooms, as long as it's not used to line the bathtub or shower. Green rock drywall is not great in places where it is likely to get wet. Use glass-reinforced cement board around the shower or bath tiles instead.

, Remove all old drywall, nails, screws and anything else that will prevent the new drywall sheets from laying flat on the studs.

, Check that loose blocking, moisture damage, termites, or other problems will not make installation a problem. Don't be surprised to find steel studs instead of wood. Steel studs are generally a good thing since steel provides added strength, and is termite-proof and fire-retardant. When using steel studs, the only difference is that you'll have to use drywall screws instead of nails when hanging the drywall.

, Use Kraft tape to repair tears in the paper backing to maximize your energy efficiency.

, Look for foams that are permanent, rigid, non-shrinking, and waterproof/water resistant. Do not apply foam in or around doors or windows.

, Never leave an end piece of drywall unsupported. The end piece of drywall should always be screwed down to a strapping piece or joist.


If your drywall does not end on a strapping piece or joist, try this:

Measure to the center of the farthest support piece the drywall gets to and transfer that measurement to the drywall.
Place a T-square along the line in your drywall and run a razor along that straight line created by the T-square.
Break the end piece off from the scoring line.
Double-check the end of the drywall makes it to the center of the strapping piece or joist.



, Do this right before you intend to hang the drywall.

, You want the edges to be perpendicular to the strapping or joist and tight against the wall.

, Repeat this process for each strapping or joist underneath the drywall.


Make sure the five screws are evenly spaced along the strapping or joist.
Leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) buffer zones on edges when driving screws. Do not screw too close to the edge of the drywall.
Drive the screw heads down past the top of the drywall, but not so deep that they break through the surface.

, Start the next row at the edge of the wall, next to the previous row, but make sure the end joints of the drywall offset the first row by at least 4 feet (1.2 m).

, Don't trust that your studs will all be on 16"" or 24"" centers, as they are supposed to be. Some studs are 1/2"" off in either direction, sometimes due to sloppy carpentry work by the builder. A good idea is to run masking tape along the floor while you have the studs exposed and mark the center line of each stud with a high visibility marker.

, Again, it's likely that you will have to cut some pieces of drywall in order to center the end pieces onto a stud.


When cutting drywall, use a T-square and razor knife to score a line on one side of the drywall paper. Place your knee on the opposite side of the cut and quickly pull the drywall piece towards you while at the same time pushing your knee outward, snapping the drywall in a clean line. Clean up the remaining paper along the newly formed crease with your razor.

, Do this right before you intend to hang the drywall.

, Start in the center and work outwards. Drive in five screws for each stud.


Extra screws may help in some situations, but are usually overkill; they will require extra mudding and sanding that may detract from the overall finish.
Consider using a spring-loaded drywall screw dimpler. They are designed to automatically countersink each drywall screw to precisely the same depth before ratcheting the screw bit, as a sign to quit and back off the drill.

, Continue installing drywall over window and door openings. You'll be able to trim off excess drywall later. At the same time, be mindful that no seams line up with a door or window corner, and do not fasten panels to framing around openings yet.


A good practice when installing drywall over protruding pipes is to place the drywall against the pipe and lightly tap with a flat block of wood to dimple the back. Next, pull the drywall away and use a drywall circle cutter or drywall hole saw to cut a perfect hole along the dimple. This should be much easier to finish than if you punch out a large hole that requires 3-4 coats of mud to finish.

, Start the next row at the edge of the wall, next to the previous row.

, Fasten the drywall down around the window or door, and then cut out the proper section using a rotary drill or drywall saw.

, Having the first coat of mud, which you'll apply directly over the seam, a bit runnier than normal will allow the tape to bond well with the mud.

, You don't have to worry about getting it perfect the first time through; you'll wipe off the excess after you apply the tape. Make sure you cover the seam entirely.

, Use your 6"" or 8"" drywall putty knife to flatten the tape, starting at one end and pulling towards you in one smooth motion.


Have your drywall tape pre-cut and lightly dampened with clean water. You don't need to soak it down too much.
Some contractors avoid the perforated and fiber tapes, as they don't produce a flawless finish and require gobs of extra mud and sanding to get the job done right. Do what works best for you and fits in your budget.

, Wipe off excess mud so the surface of the seam is smooth and flattened.

, Wet your blade and flatten then out with another swipe if needed.

, This will give your job a professional finish.


Apply mud and tape in a similar manner. Apply liberal amount of compound. If it isn't already, crease your tape perfectly in the center and reinforce the crease a couple of times. Apply the tape so that the center of the crease fits directly into the corner of the wall. Wipe away excess compound with your drywall knife.

, Let the mud dry between each coat. It will bubble if you rush it!


Many thin coats of mud will give you better results, but patience is required to let it dry.
Don't apply any mud over freshly taped joints. Allow them to thoroughly dry for one day between coats unless you are using hot mud that will dry in an hour. A great idea is to use pink mud that dries white, indicating it is ready for another coat.

, You shouldn't notice any edges after screening the mud over a joint line or screw dimple. Make sure to hold the blade flat against the drywall and pull towards you in smooth but firm strokes. Practice on an old piece of drywall to refine your technique.


Screed some mud over any small imperfections in the drywall that may occur during installation such as missed nail/screw holes.

,, Don't get carried away and sand until you expose the paper. This step goes quickly because the mud will sand off easily.

, Again, caution is key here. A quick couple of scrapes over the joints is all you need.

, The light will help you spot imperfections. Circle any problem areas with the pencil. Use a sponge sander or hand sander to briefly hit any flawed areas.

, Apply a coat of primer to the walls, then sand the entire area lightly using a pole sander. Although most beginners skip this step, it's critical for getting a nice, even finish and for avoiding fuzzy paper residue and fluff left over from the initial sanding.

, Sanding can be satisfying and fun, but sometimes people sand unnecessarily, sanding through tape. If this happens, apply some more mud and re-sand it when it dries.

Allow the surface to dry completely.",How to Skip Trowel Texture," This will be a messy project, so prepare to get dirty. Wear old ""work clothes"" that you won't mind messing up and avoid wearing any fine jewelry.


It can also be a good idea to wear safety goggles, especially as you prepare the wall and joint compound. Dust and other small particles can easily break away and may cause irritation if they get into your eyes.
Work gloves are also recommended, but not necessary. You should be able to wash off joint compound that gets on your skin, but gloves can help minimize the potential mess.;
, If you're working on a brand new drywall project with untreated or unpainted sheetrock, you will need to sand it down before you can apply skip trowel texture to it.Note that sanding is not necessary if you're working on a previously painted wall or ceiling. Skip this step and move onto the next one if that is the case.
If you do need to sand the wall, use a pole sander to work your way around the entire drywall surface. Apply pressure to sand away any edges, lines, or bumps. Make sure that you reach into corners and along wall seams, as well.

, Use a damp rag to wipe down the surface you plan to texture. Allow any moisture to dry before continuing.


If you don't remove the dust and dirt from your walls, the joint compound may not adhere properly when you attempt to apply it.
An air compressor can be used to clear dust from your walls, as well, but using a damp rag is usually easier and more thoroughly.

, Spread a drop cloth, newspaper, or plastic sheets over the floor and all other surfaces in the room. Tape it down so that it remains securely in place throughout the entire process.


Since applying compound textures to the wall or ceiling can be so messy, you definitely need to use a drop cloth to avoid getting excess compound on your floor.
Note that any removable object, like pieces of furniture, should be taken to another room as you work to further protect it.

, Priming your wall or ceiling isn't strictly necessary, and there is some debate on whether or not it offers any real benefit. Nonetheless, priming the surface won't hurt, so it might be worth consideration.


Use an acrylic PVA (latex-based) wallboard primer capable of sealing the pores in your drywall. Apply the primer in a smooth, even coat with a standard paint roller, then let it dry completely before continuing.
Those in favor of priming argue that the process can encourage even drying while also limiting the potential shrinkage of the applied joint compound. Good primer fills in and seals the pores of the drywall, thereby preventing the mud from seeping into those pores and shrinking in volume.

, Standard, all-purpose joint compound will work best for this project. You can use either dry compound or ready-mix compound.


Avoid compounds that contain sand or grit. Plain mud works best for this type of texture.
You should also avoid lightweight compounds. These formulas scratch more easily and may not accept the texture as well as all-purpose compound does., The best tool to use will be a heavy-duty electric drill fitted with a paddle or auger mixing attachment.


If you don't have an electric tool, you can use a large potato masher to mix the compound. Doing so will require much more physical energy and strength, however.

, Combine a full box or bucket of dry mix compound with approximately 1 cup (250 ml) of water in a 5-gallon (20-L) plastic bucket. Mix slowly until the mud starts looking creamy and smooth.


If using ready-mix compound, you do not need to add any water yet. Simply start mixing the compound on its own.
When using dry compound, check the package instructions and use the manufacturer's minimum amount of water. You may need to add more later, but you should start with the minimum.
Note that joint compound can dry quickly once you mix it, so you should only prepare as much as you can use. If necessary, more compound can be mixed later in the middle of the application process.

, Continue mixing and adding water until the compound develops the consistency of thick paint.


If the mud is too thick, it won't spread well. If it's too thin, it will drip. The mud must be stiff yet easy spread around.

, When applying the skip trowel texture, you should start at floor level and work up the wall until you reach the ceiling.


Divide the wall in half visually. Work on the floor to midway point first, then on the midway to ceiling section afterward.
If you're creating a skip trowel texture over a ceiling, you will need to start at one side of the ceiling and work your way across to the other side. It shouldn't matter which side you start on, though.

, Pour the prepared compound into a mud pan, then scoop some onto the widest edge of your trowel.


It should be easier to maneuver the trowel into mud that has been poured into a shallow tray. Working directly from your mixing bucket will likely be difficult and is not recommended.

, Apply the compound directly to the wall, smoothing it over the surface using a side-to-side stroke.


At this point, you simply need to apply the mud to the wall. You don't need to create any texture in this step.
The amount and thickness of the mud will change the final appearance of the skip trowel texture. More mud creates a heavier texture and less mud offers a lighter look.
As you create the skip trowel texture, the mud may spread and thin out, so you should make this initial layer of mud a little thicker than your desired finish.

, Hold the trowel over the applied mud at a 15-degree angle, then work in short, arching strokes across the smooth mud.At the end of each stroke, quickly bend your wrist away from the wall as you remove the trowel. This should help create a slight ""skip"" or dash at the end of each arching stroke.
Your arches should be random, and you can create arches running from either side-to-side or up-and-down. Continue working with each patch of applied mud until you're satisfied with the appearance.

, Follow the same procedure as you continue applying mud and creating the skip trowel texture across the entire wall or ceiling.


Work in small sections and try not to rush. You need to take your time on each section to perfect the appearance before it starts drying.

, Allow the compound to dry for 10 to 30 minutes. Give it just enough time to start setting.Once the compound just begins to set, you should look over your work. If there are areas that need to be fixed, fix them before letting the compound set completely.

, Most notably, if you see any compound that has begin dripping or dropping from the wall, you should knock it off with your trowel and work over the area again as needed.


Check the surface for even application, too. If certain areas look notably thicker than others, use the trowel to thin them out. Conversely, if some areas look notably thinner, you may need to work more mud over them.

, Once you're satisfied with the way the texture looks, allow it to dry for at least 24 hours.


After the mud is completely dry, you can prime and paint the compound as desired.
If you don't want to apply any primer or paint, you can remove the drop cloth as soon as the mud dries.

Mats with thicker borders work best.
Make several framed pieces in different shapes and sizes. Hang them in a cluster on the wall.

, Cut a strip of wallpaper into a skinny rectangle. Get two wooden dowels, at least 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wider than the narrow ends of your wallpaper strip. Cover the top and bottom narrow edges of the wallpaper with double-sided tape, then wrap them around each dowel. Make sure that the wallpaper is centered on each dowel. Cut a length of string or ribbon, and tie each end to both ends of the top dowel. Hang it from a hook or nail on the wall.Wallpaper with Asian-inspired designs works best for this. Other motifs that work well include birds, flowers, branches, and plants.

, Get enough scraps of wallpaper to cover your desired surface. Attach the largest pieces to the surface first with the edges touching. Add the smaller pieces on top, overlapping them in a scattered, patchwork design.

, Cut the tracing out with a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide boarder. Cut two 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) slits into the top and bottom edges; they need to be the same width as the spine. Fold the tabs down, then wrap the paper around the book. Fold then the top and bottom edges, then the side. Tape everything in place.


This is a great option for textbooks. Wallpaper is more colorful and durable than the usual brown paper bag.

, Wrap some wallpaper around a box, much like you would wrap a gift, but leave one of the narrow ends open. Tape the bottom and the seam, then pull the bag off of the box. Fold the top, raw edge inward. Punch two holes in the front and back of the bag, then add some ribbon handles., Clean and dry an empty tin can. Cut the wallpaper down so that it's the same height as your can, and long enough to wrap around it with a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) overlap. Lay down strips of double-sided tape along all four edges on the back of the wallpaper. Wrap the wallpaper tightly around the can.

Cut pieces of mesh tape in advance to cover cracks in plaster.,
Cover the cracks with your pre-trimmed mesh tape.

,
Premix your joint compound in your mud pan (this is the container you will work from).,
Remove any loose plaster and dust from the wall with a whisk broom.

,
Apply a very thin layer of joint compound, about one-eighth inch or (0.32 cm), thick, with a putty knife.

,
Remove about half of the joint compound you just applied.,
Allow to dry, following the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that the joint compound has properly set before proceeding with additional coats.

,
Apply the second coat of compound, after the first one has dried, in order to hide the tape.,
Allow the second coat to harden, again following the manufacturer's drying instructions, and then apply a third coat of joint compound.

,
Proceed with the following steps if you need to patch any holes.,
Moisten the surrounding area, using a damp sponge, and fill with joint compound.,
Proceed with the following steps if the hole is very large.

,
Trim any surrounding plaster away until the studs within the wall are visible.

,
Screw a section of lath into the exposed studs.

,
Follow the same steps for repairing cracks, applying additional one-eighth inch (0.32 cm) layers until you achieve the same thickness as the surrounding plaster.

",How to Repair Plaster," Most cracks are curved, so you'll need a variety of lengths.;
,,


The substance is mixed thoroughly when all of the lumps are gone.

,,, This will ensure there are no unsightly lumps in the end.


If you remove too much, leaving the first layer too thin, the tape will cause the compound to blister during the second coat.

,, Apply the second coat at about a one-sixteenth inch (0.16 cm) thickness.


Taper the second coat so that it blends smoothly between the tape and the wall.
Before applying the third coat of joint compound, scrape away any high spots, and then use a grout float to smooth the area even. Do this by dampening your grout float and sliding it over the patch until the surface is even.

,,


If the lath board is still present, you can start by, once again, removing any excess plaster and dust.

, Reapply as many coats as necessary, spreading no more than one-eighth inch (0.32cm) at a time, to achieve the proper thickness.

Clean the area around the seam.,
Consider applying a small amount of joint compound into the seam if the gap between the 2 sections of sheetrock is somewhat pronounced.,
Cut and apply the drywall tape to the seam.,
Apply the joint compound.,
Allow the joint compound to dry.",How to Use Joint Compound," This can be accomplished by lightly brushing the area or using a whisk broom to dislodge and remove any dust or other particles that may be clinging to the area where the joint compound will be applied. Before beginning to clean, put on the face mask as this will prevent inhaling any of the dust particles from the sheetrock.;
, To accomplish this, scoop a small amount of compound with the edge of the drywall knife. Work the compound into the seam gently, and then use the knife blade to smooth the area even with the surface of the wall. Using only a small amount of the compound will minimize the need to clean the area before moving on to apply the drywall tape.

, Measure the correct length of tape needed to adequately cover the seam, and cut a section of tape with the drywall knife. Gently but firmly press the tape into position over the seam, making sure that it adheres to the wall.

, Use the knife to apply the compound in sections beginning with the top of the covered seam. Feather the product over the seam so that the layer is thin but sufficient to cover the face of the tape. Feathering is accomplished by making light strokes that move downward and to each side in a steady manner. Once a section is covered, apply additional compound to the next exposed area, and repeat the process until the seam and tape are completely covered.

, Depending on the brand involved, this may take up to 12 hours. Once the compound is dry, lightly sand with the sandpaper, and then brush away any residue with the brush or whisk broom. If the tape is exposed as the result of the sanding, apply a second coat of compound and allow it to dry. Then sand again until the wall is as smooth as possible.

If you're unsure of where the water is coming from, look for drywall panels that are sagging or crumbling. You may also notice areas of the ceiling with coffee-colored stains., Putting down drop cloths or a plastic tarp will prevent your floors and furniture from getting wet. It will also help collect debris as you replace the water damaged portion of your ceiling., A bucket or container will be able to catch the water that's coming from your ceiling. This will prevent water damage to your floors and will help catch the water from your ceiling once you start draining the leak., Use a screwdriver and push it into the center of the location of the leak. This will cause the water to drain from the ceiling and can help relieve additional water damage. Keep the bucket under the water damaged ceiling so that it can catch the water when you puncture it.If water accumulates over your ceiling the water can weigh down your ceiling and create a large hole or cause it to collapse.

, Before you replace the portion of your ceiling that's leaking, it's important to fix the source of the leak. Common sources of ceiling leaks include faulty pipes or cracks in your roof. Once you drain the leak, it's important to call a professional roof specialist or handyman who can fix the source of the leak.Taking care of the leak quickly will reduce the cost of your repairs and could prevent future damage., Turn off your electricity before cutting your inspection hole. Before you replace your damaged ceiling, you'll need to know what's on the other side of your ceiling. Cut a small square hole that's deep enough to cut through the drywall, but not deep enough to penetrate anything on the other side. If you cut the hole and see electrical wires, plumbing, gas lines, or HVAC ducts you may need to hire a professional to replace your ceiling., Once you make sure that you won't damage anything behind the ceiling you can start to remove the water damaged ceiling. Use a ruler or straight edge to draw a box around the portion of your ceiling that has water damage.

If the damage is more than 6x6 inches (15.24x15.24 cm) then you should seek professional guidance to fix your leaking ceiling.

, Using the lines as a guide, cut into the ceiling with a utility knife and start to cut away the damaged drywall. Once you cut the lines, you can use a crowbar to remove the damaged drywall from the ceiling., Use a tape measure or ruler to get the exact dimensions of the drywall that you cut out. Measuring the cut-out piece of drywall will give you the needed dimensions for the drywall replacement., Use a saw to cut 2 pieces of 9x4x1/2 inch (22.86x10.16x1.27 cm) plywood. These pieces of wood will act as a brace for your drywall. If you cut a hole in your ceiling and you have a metal runner or ceiling beam, then you won't need to create these wooden braces because you can screw directly into the runner or beams instead., Put the wooden braces that you made out of plywood into the hole and lay it flat over your ceiling, so there is a two inch (5.08 cm) overlap over your hole. Then, screw in two screws through your existing ceiling and into the beam. The screws should be on the top and bottom of each piece of wood. Repeat the process on the other side of the hole., Cutting your replacement drywall two inches longer and wider will leave one inch (5.08 cm) of slack on each side., Turn over the drywall square and use a ruler to measure 1 inch (2.54 cm) in from each edge of the drywall. Then, use a straight edge to draw vertical and horizontal lines so that it looks like a 1 inch wide (2.54 cm) frame around the drywall piece. This slack will let you blend your replacement drywall in with your ceiling so that it lies flush., With a utility knife, cut through the back layer of paper and the drywall gypsum until you reach the front layer of the drywall. Use the marks that you made on the back of the drywall as a guide while you cut. Then, use a putty knife to carefully peel back the back layer of paper and drywall gypsum, so that the front side facing paper forms a 1 inch (2.54 cm) frame around your drywall patch.Make sure not to cut too deeply, or you will cut into the front layer of the drywall.
You will use the front layer of paper to help blend in your repairs.

, Your drywall patch can be held in place with lightweight or all-purpose drywall compound. You can purchase this compound online or at a hardware store.Apply the joint compound with a trowel to the edges of the hole. Then, with the trowel, carefully spread it around so that it's evenly distributed., On an angle, push your replacement piece of drywall into the hole. Then, adjust the drywall so that it lies flush with your ceiling. The beams that you screwed in earlier will act like a backboard for your new drywall., Use a power drill to attach the new drywall patch to the wooden braces that you created earlier. Put screws into each corner of the drywall patch to secure it fully., Use the trowel to spread the drywall compound over the surface of your drywall replacement piece. Work the edges of the front facing paper into the ceiling with the compound until there are no visible screws and you can't see the edges of the patch., You can check if it's dry by touching the surface of the drywall compound with your hand. You must let it fully dry before you can sand and paint it., Use a fine-grit sandpaper to sand down the surface of the new drywall. Continue to use a hand sander so that the new drywall lays flush with your ceiling and you can't see the edges of the patch.You can also use a drywall sanding sponge that's made specifically for drywall.

, Paint over the new drywall paint using the same paint that was used for your ceiling. If you don't have the original color, you may need to re-paint your entire ceiling so that the new drywall isn't visible."

Paint a priming layer on your ceiling.,
Mix your textured paint.,
Test your paint.",How to Texture a Ceiling1," First, remove as much furniture as possible from the room. Cover all remaining furniture, as well as your floors, with drop clothes. Tape off or otherwise cover ceiling fixtures. Finally, tape plastic sheeting around the ceiling’s perimeter to protect your walls.


You will also want to remove any faceplates which are on your ceiling, such as vent covers.;
, You will want to be sure that the base layer of your ceiling is in prime condition. Repair cracks in plaster and generally ensure that the ceiling is as smooth as possible. Cracks can worsen over time and inconsistencies (as well as cracks) will be made more visible by the texture of the ceiling.


Some cracks and inconsistencies can be fixed with spackle, but others may be structural and should be addressed by an inspector or contractor.

, Paint a coat of paint primer on your ceiling before adding the texture. This can help to reduce the appearance of a previous color but it will also help the new paint adhere to the wall. Choose a primer in a color as close as possible to your final color.

, There are a number of ways to texture a ceiling. You can buy pre-textured paint (which will likely be the easiest option). You can also texture the ceiling by adding materials to either latex or oil based paint. Purchase material that is meant for texturing paint, such as special sand, and mix it according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as well as your own preference.


Generally, you will mix 1 part of the additive to every ten parts of paint. This works out to roughly 1 ½ cups of texture for every gallon of paint.

, Once you believe you have the paint mixed properly, you will want to do a small test patch to ensure you are happy with the texture. Try to do the test patch in a corner of the room or otherwise in a less visible area. Adjust your paint as necessary.

Purchase the ceiling tiles if necessary.,
Take all the necessary measurements.,
Lay each tile out on a smooth, clean surface for cutting.,
Use a straightedge to measure out the cuts needed on each tile.,
Cut the tile with a sharp utility knife.,
Remove the excess tile.,
Clean up the tile's edge if necessary.,
Cut the remaining tiles in the same manner.",How to Cut Ceiling Tiles," If you are conducting a replacement job on an existing ceiling, you will want to match the ceiling tile style to the existing tiles. The easiest way to do this is to order much more than you need during the initial installation and store them for later use. If you are buying new tiles, start by removing them from their package and letting them rest inside overnight. The tiles need time to adjust to temperature and humidity conditions, as they can expand or contract a bit.;
, Use a tape measure to measure the dimensions of every opening in the ceiling grid that will need a tile cut to size. Write these measurements down for later reference. If your ceiling grid has been installed properly, most tiles will only need to be cut along 1 dimension.

, A wood tabletop provides an ideal surface. You will be cutting the tiles with a utility knife, so make sure your work surface will not be damaged by the knife blade.

, Place the straightedge along 1 side of the tile, line the markings up with the tile's edge, and then make a small mark with a pencil denoting the location of the cut. Repeat this process on the other side of the tile. Then, place the straightedge across the tile, joining the 2 pencil marks. Trace your pencil lightly along the straightedge to mark the line along which you will cut.

, Leaving the straightedge in place as a guide, score the surface of the tile lightly by running the utility knife along the straightedge (following your pencil line). Make sure that you replace the razor blade in the knife before beginning, as a dull blade will tear your tile. After the initial pass, make a second cut along the same line, this time cutting all the way through the tile. Cut in a smooth, continuous motion; using a sawing motion will rip the tile.

, After making the cut, pull gently on the excess tile. It should pull away cleanly, but if it does not, you can go over the cut once more with the utility knife. Discard the unused portion of the tile.

, If the cut leaves a ragged edge on your tile, you can use your utility knife to cut away some of the material and clean up the tile's appearance. Note that a small portion of the tile will be concealed behind the ceiling grid, so this step is only necessary if the ragged portion extends into the tile past this point.

, After testing your first tile for a proper fit, continue cutting the remaining tiles with the same method. Be sure to regularly wipe down your work surface to keep the tiles clean. You may also want to replace your razor blade if it begins to dull.

Paint the ceiling.,
Visualize and paint the ceiling in sections.,
Let it dry thoroughly.",How to Texture a Ceiling2," Use either rollers or a brush to paint the ceiling. Apply the paint in a W, X, or N shape in order to make sure that paint is applied in all directions. You will want to be sure to remove excess paint from the brush or roller before applying, since otherwise it will just drip into your face! Ew!


If the paint won’t go on your roller (because it is too thick), you can try putting it on a trowel or similar tool first, spreading it in the general area you wish it to go, and then switching to a roller to even the texture.

, Divide the ceiling into sections and complete the sections one at a time. These do not need to be formally divided. Painting the ceiling in sections will make it easier to make sure you get everything, keep you organized so you get done faster, and help keep you motivated.

, When you have painted the whole ceiling, make sure to let it dry completely before doing anything else (if any changes or additions need to be made). This usually takes a minimum of several hours. Adding more paint, texture, or touching the drying paint too much will pull the drying paint off and make your ceiling look uneven.


The ceiling will dry faster if you increase the air circulation in the room.

Texture the ceiling with a rag.,
Texture the ceiling with thickened paint.,
Texture the ceiling with a special roller.",How to Texture a Ceiling3," Use slightly contrasting colors of paint, applied with a rag to get a textured appearance to the ceiling. You can also use a sponge in a similar manner to get another texture.

, You can mix joint compound into the paint in order to get a faux plaster look. You can buy either a mix or the prepared compound. You will likely need a great deal of the material (at least 6 lbs of the prepared compound) but how much will depend on the area you are covering and how thick you want it to be.

, You can also use textured rollers to get other textures to your paint without having to apply multiple coats. You can use shaggy rollers or other textured rollers. These should generally have examples of their final textures on the packaging.

Measure the width of your coving and mark this spot on a ruler.,
Draw a straight line on each wall that is as far from the ceiling as the width of your coving.,
Score the area in between the lines and the ceiling using a knife so that there are no large sections of undisturbed wallpaper or paint.

,
Measure out the coving sections you will need.,
Place the coving sections in a miter box lining up the sloped lines so that they can be easily cut.

,
Cut the coving sections using a saw ensuring that the edges are as level as possible.

,
Apply adhesive to the back of your first coving section.,
Press the first coving section on the wall.

,
Use your line as a guide and hold the coving firmly in place, tamping with the palm of your hand.

,
Hammer a few nails into the coving section to keep it in place as the adhesive dries.

,
Repeat Steps 7-10 for the rest of the coving sections.

,
Apply adhesive to the edges of the coving sections that will meet at the corners and press them together.

,
Wipe away any excess adhesive using a towel.

,
Remove the nails once the adhesive has dried and paint or finish as desired.

",How to Fit Coving,";
,


Use the spot marked on your ruler as a guide. The line should be level and run between every corner.
This will make the adhesive used to install coving stick more strongly.

,,


At each corner, you will need to cut the coving at a 45-degree angle. This will allow the two sections of coving running from perpendicular walls to slide over each other. One section of the coving running into a corner should protrude at the top (with the cut sloping upward from the bottom), while the other should protrude at the bottom (with the cut sloping downward from the top). Plan out which sections will slope which way, and mark these lines.

,,,


You should have a thin, even layer that covers the entire length of the coving.

Unless you got a drywall lift, were going to built a T-brace from 2x4's.,
Install the drywall lengthwise on the joist for maximum structure strength.

,
The first piece of drywall that you put up is the most important.,
Use an electric drywall screw gun to fasten the drywall to the joist.,
When it comes time to cut the drywall, use a utility knife along with a straightedge, some a made specially for drywall.",How to Set up a Drywall Ceiling," The top piece should be 3 feet (0.9 m) wide, and the long piece should be the same height as the ceiling itself.;
,, If that piece is not square, every other piece will be off a little too.

, Place the screw about every 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart on the joist. Make sure that you sink the screw far enough. Run a taping knife on top of the screw to see if its deep enough, the knife shouldn't hit the screw.

, Only score the one side of the drywall, snap it, and then cut the back side.

Assess whether you have a ball-in-socket style ceiling fan, also known as a down-rod mounted ceiling fan.,
Always turn off the power at the electrical panel before working on anything electrical.,
Place your ladder under the ceiling fan.,
Remove the metal canopy that covers the mounting bracket by loosening the screws on either side.,
Retest that you have no power coming to the fan.,
Remove the wire nuts that are connecting the wires from the fan and the wires from the ceiling together.,
Grab a hold of the whole light fixture and slide the ball at the top of the fan pole out of the mounting bracket.,
Lower the fan to the ground.,
Detach the mounting bracket from the ceiling.",How to Take Down or Remove a Ceiling Fan1," These type of fans are distinctive in that the body of the fan hangs a bit away from the ceiling on a pole. The pole connects at the ceiling at a canopy, which is just a small metal enclosure that covers the mounting bracket and wires for the fan. This type of ceiling fan can usually be easily removed in a few steps.;
, An easy way to make sure you have turned off the power is by keeping the fan on when you go to switch the breaker. If you have successfully turned off the correct breaker, the fan should be coming to a stop when you return. , You may want to place it a little to the side of the fan so you can easily reach around the paddles to the canopy at the ceiling.

, You may need to use a very short screwdriver to get between the housing at the ceiling and the main body of the ceiling fan. Once the canopy is unscrewed, simply lower it down so it rests on top of the fan body. Now you should be able to see how the ball at the top of the fan pole slips easily in and out of the bracket. You should also be able to see the electrical connections between the fan and the wires in the ceiling.


If you cannot get into the space between the housing and the fan body, you may want to follow method two below, as it will tell you how to take more parts off the fan apart in order to remove it.

, This is most easily done with a non-contact voltage tester, which tests for magnetic fields around wires quickly and easily.

, You may need to pull all the wires out a bit to access the wire nuts but once you have them in hand, turn them counterclockwise and they should unscrew.


Once you have detached the fan wires from the wires coming from the ceiling, be sure to put the wire nuts back onto the wires coming from the ceiling. This way, if you need to turn the power back on before you install a new fixture, your wires will be safely capped off.

, This connection might vary slightly, but should slip out relatively easily no matter the exact style. Remember to keep a good hold of the fan, as once its out of the bracket you will need to support its whole weight.

, It may be helpful to rest it on the top of your ladder momentarily, so that you can readjust your grip and get down your ladder with the fan safely. You now have removed your ceiling fan but you are not quite done!

, It should be attached with two screws the electrical box in the ceiling. It is a good idea to put the screws back in the electrical box once the bracket is removed so that they are there for the next fixture you want to attach.


Even if you are going to put up a new ceiling fan, you should still remove the mounting bracket. Every ceiling fan comes with its own mounting bracket that is made specifically for that model.

Place your ladder in a corner of the room.,
Begin spraying the ceiling with wet stucco in even, horizontal gestures.,
Examine your first application closely to ensure that it has the consistency and texture you want.

,
Move your ladder when you can no longer spray the ceiling easily.,
Continue to move the ladder around the room and apply stucco in even strips until the ceiling is completely covered.

,
Let the stucco sit for 8 hours until dry.

,
Remove the plastic sheeting.

",How to Stucco a Ceiling," Cover all walls, and any furniture you cannot remove, with plastic sheeting. Secure the sheeting tightly with masking tape.;
, First put the dry mix in, then add water and stir. Follow the directions given with the mix.

, If the stucco slides off before you tilt the trowel to an angle of 40 degrees, it is too wet.

, Follow instructions given with the sprayer regarding how much to load.


This will allow you not only to practice applying the stucco, but to test the consistency of your mix. If you are dissatisfied with how it looks, go back to Step 2 and add more dry mix or more water.

, Get a feel for the speed and movement of the sprayer.

, Put on your mask and safety glasses. Make sure that you can easily and safely get within range of the ceiling.

, Do not go over the same area twice.

,, From your new position, start spraying again.

Assess whether you have a flush mounted ceiling fan, also known as a bracket mounted ceiling fan.,
Always turn off the power at the electrical panel before working on anything electrical.,
Remove all light bulbs and any bulb covers from the fan, if your ceiling fan has a light kit attached to it.,
Remove the light kit, if your ceiling fan has one.,
Remove the fan blades with a screwdriver.,
Loosen the screws that hold the fan body to the bracket on the ceiling.,
Remove the wire nuts that are connecting the wires from the fan and the wires from the ceiling together.,
Remove the fan body from the hinge on the mounting bracket.,
Detach the mounting bracket from the ceiling.",How to Take Down or Remove a Ceiling Fan2," This type of ceiling fan is obviously flush mounted, meaning that the motor of the fan sits right up at the ceiling. These ceiling fans require a bit more disassembly to remove, as the fan itself needs to be taken apart to get to the attachment bracket. However, they are good fans to have in rooms with low ceilings, as they do not hang down as far as ball-in-socket type ceiling fans.

, An easy way to make sure you have turned off the power is by keeping the fan on when you go to switch the breaker. If you have successfully turned off the right breaker, the fan should be coming to a stop when you return. , The light kit is simply the portion of the fan that is the light. On most ceiling fans with lights, the light kit is a separate section of the fan that can be removed separately. On many styles of ceiling fans the lightbulbs are simply accessible by climbing up a ladder and unscrewing them but some models require you to take off a cover that encloses the bulb.


Be gentle when removing the lightbulbs. If they happen to break, you should be cautious when removing a broken lightbulb from the socket.

, While some models will allow you to take the fan body off the ceiling without removing the light kit, most flush mounted ceiling fans require that it is removed, so that you can get to the screws that attach the whole fan to the ceiling. This step will require unscrewing the screws that hold the light kit to the fan body. Inside, you will most likely have to disconnect the wires that connect the light kit to the fan. These should simply be connected with wire nuts, which you turn counterclockwise to unscrew.


It is a really good idea to retest that you have no power coming to the fan once you have opened up the light kit. This is most easily done with a non-contact voltage tester, which tests for magnetic fields around wires quickly and easily.

, Ceiling fan blades are connected to the body of the fan with metal brackets that screw into the fan body, basically the housing for the fan's motor, and into the fan paddles themselves. It's easiest to keep the fan blade brackets and the fan blades attached and just unscrew the screws that attach the brackets to the fan body. This way, you aren't removing twice as many screws while up on your ladder.


If you plan on re-using the fan, be sure to keep all the parts. Placing all the parts in a marked bag or envelope is a good idea.

, Be sure to have a good grip on the fan body while doing this. On most modern ceiling fan models the body is attached to the bracket with a screw on one side and a hinge on the other side. This makes it so that when you unscrew the screw, the body of the fan can hang off the hinge while you disconnect the wiring. Once the screw is unscrewed, simply allow the body of the fan to hang from the hinge on one side. Otherwise you would have to hold the whole fan in one hand and disconnect the wires with the other.

, You may need to pull all the wires out a bit to access the wire nuts but once you have them in hand, turn them counterclockwise and they should unscrew.


Once you have detached the fan wires from the wires coming from the ceiling, be sure to put the wire nuts back onto the wires coming from the ceiling. This way, if you need to turn the power back on before you install a new fixture, your wires will be safely capped off.

, It should simply have a piece that slips out of the bracket.


Often, there will be a safety chain coming from the fan attached to a joist in the ceiling. If so, unhook the safety chain to free the fan.

, It should be attached with two screws the electrical box in the ceiling. It is a good idea to put the screws back in the electrical box once the bracket is removed so that they are there for the next fixture you want to attach.


Even if you are going to put up a new ceiling fan, you should still remove the mounting bracket. Every ceiling fan comes with its own mounting bracket that is made specifically for that model.

Let the paint dry.",How to Stipple Ceiling1," A stomp brush, also called a slap brush, often comes in a variety of different textures. Stomp brushes are brushes with very long bristles and can be used to make a variety of textures on your wall. Choose a brush for a type of texture that you want. If you want thicker pieces hanging from the ceiling, pick a stomp brush with thicker bristles. You can purchase slap brushes at most hardware stores., Read the instructions for your wall texture mix and combine the appropriate amount of water with the mix in a giant mixing bucket. Continue to mix the texture mix with water until it reaches a pasty consistency like pancake mix.One of the most popular brands of texture mix is Sheetrock texture paint.
You can use a 5-gallon (3.7 liters) bucket for this.

, Roll your paint roller into the drywall mixture that you just created and get it fully saturated. Knock the excess dripping paint back into your bucket so that the paint does not drip when you apply it to the ceiling. , Before you commit your texture to the ceiling, you should practice on a piece of cardboard first. Practice painting your textured paint onto the surface of some cardboard. If the mixture is too thick or not the texture that you want, add more water to your drywall mixture., Use a paint roller to apply a 1/8″ thick layer of the compound to the wall. Work in 1/6ths of your ceiling so that the mixture doesn't dry before you finish texturing your ceiling., Hold your slap brush perpendicular to the wall and push it into your layer of paint. Lift the brush back and you should have a nice texture on your wall. Experiment with different slap brushes and different amounts of paint to achieve different textures. , Using the roller and brush method, move to the different parts of your ceiling until it's totally finished. Remember to mix your drywall mixture as you paint, so it doesn't harden in your bucket., Once your entire ceiling has been textured, allow it to dry for at least 48 hours before removing your painter's tape and wiping the ceiling down with a damp rag."

All in all, it is very worth it.",How to Remove Texture from Acoustic Ceiling Surfaces,";
, We covered all of our floors with the rolls of plastic that you can get cheap at Home Depot. Once done, just roll it up and throw it away.

, This makes it a lot harder to scrape off. If it hasn’t, you only have to wet it lightly and it comes off like butter. If it has, you have to spray it heavily (we used our hose with a sprayer attachment) and soak it in order for it to come off. If you take a hand or pole sander with a really heavy grit sandpaper and quickly run over the ceiling before wetting it down it allows the water to penetrate into the texture a little better, making it come off easier.

, That stuff is nasty. We did the actual scraping with a few different tools. We used the widest hand trowels that we could find (metal work best). We also used flat headed shovels! They worked great because you didn’t need a ladder, the long handle was built in! On tough areas a ladder (scaffolding is safer) raises you so that you can get a better angle and clean more off quickly. There is also a tool that allows you to hook up a plastic bag for easy disposal and less debris on the ground.

, You have to use a pretty light touch and try to keep the edge level so that one end doesn’t dip into the drywall.

,, Roll up the plastic with the chunks on it and toss it. Cover the floors with clean plastic again,just to protect floor.

,, We did it ourselves with an airless gun and texture that you can buy at Home Depot. It looks like bags of concrete. Be careful not to buy the popcorn stuff again, we did that! We mixed it up and thought, ""Hmm… this looks really chunky""?, and had to take it back! So, we sprayed the texture on with the gun and then knocked it down to match the texture on the walls with a trowel. It turned out pretty good. My friends hired someone to do their retexturing after they scraped.

,,, You'll need at least 4 people tackle the task. A good estimate of time it should take to accomplish this is 5-6 days. (You can do all the scraping in one or two days, the retexturing in one day, the priming in one day, and the painting in another.)

Prime and paint your ceiling.",How to Remove a Popcorn Ceiling," Imagine your floor looking like what your ceiling looks like now. Now imagine tiny little pellets of paint in every crack and cranny of your sofas, chairs, and rugs. It's not a pretty sight. To avoid having to do more work later on, remove any and all furniture or household items from the room completely. It should look completely bare before moving on to the next step.


If some furniture is going to remain in the room because it is large or heavy, ensure you cover it completely in plastic to avoid getting it dirty.;
, Although a canvas drop cloth is the professional gold standard, several pieces of overlapped plastic covering will also do the trick. Take care because plastic can be slippery underfoot.


Remember that any plastic covering that isn't taped together has a chance of leaking. If you want to be absolutely sure that your clean-up job will only require throwing away the plastic covering, tape it together for added protection.

, Don't turn it up toward the ceiling; just have it on and blowing in an inconspicuous place near the ground. It’s probably best to put this on low, so you don’t blow debris around the room.

, Seek professional help for a diagnosis. Asbestos was widely used in construction, for its insulation and fire resistance, before 1979., Spray a 3' x 3' area of the ceiling. Let it soak in for a minute, and then spray it again. The popcorn material is very dry and porous, so it will easily soak in the water you spray on it. Don’t be afraid to soak it well.

, If you don't have a ceiling texture scraper, a large putty knife or drywall knife (4"" or 6"" is good).


It should come off very easily. If not, soak it some more, but be careful not to soak the ceiling too much. Too much water can cause damage to the drywall tape and underlying drywall that you will find behind the popcorn stubble.
If using a ceiling texture scraper, attach the refuse bag to the scraper. (Most scrapers will come with this functionality.) This way, you can throw the popcorn stubble from the catch right into the garbage instead of having to wipe it all up again on your floor.
If your room is tall, use a scrapers with an extension pole so you can reach better.

,, Gather any of the scraped-off popcorn that's on the drop cloth and put it in heavy duty garbage bags. Vacuum up any remaining dirt or debris.

, At this point, you will probably see that your ceiling has only been ""fired taped,"" meaning that the drywall installer only did a very crude job with the drywall tape, putting up only one coat of mud. So be prepared to have to put on a couple of coats of drywall mud.

, A skim coat involves topping compound applied to the entire ceiling with a 12"" or 14"" drywall knife. Sand this skim coat for a flawless finish before you apply the primer and paint. It may be helpful to have a professional do this step.

, So the popcorn finish didn't work out for you in the end. So what? There are plenty of other texture finishes that you can try out on your ceiling to make it pop and better stand out.

, Once you've mudded, sanded, and textured, you prime and paint. This is the fun part, giving you a beautiful new ceiling. The amount of work involved was definitely worth it.

Rent or purchase a textured paint gun.,
Mix your drywall powder with water.,
Load the hopper and set the gun's PSI.,
Test the gun on a piece of cardboard.,
Hold the hopper 2 feet away from the ceiling and pull the trigger.,
Wait 30 minutes and push the paint with a knock-down blade.,
Allow your ceiling to dry for 24 hours.",How to Stipple Ceiling2," You can rent or buy a pressurized paint gun and textured nozzle at most hardware stores. A textured hopper will look like a paint gun with a large funnel on the end of it. If you can't find textured paint guns, ask a sales associate at the hardware store or search online for a ""textured spray paint gun.""

Sprayers typically cost $225 to $400.Renting a paint gun and textured hopper will cost between $40 - $100 a day., Use a five-gallon bucket and mix your drywall compound with water. For the traditional drywall compound, use one part powder to six parts water and mix it together until it reaches a pancake batter-like consistency. If your drywall mixture is too thick, add more water until it loosens up.If you are having trouble mixing your compound by hand, use a drill and ribbon mixer.

, Load the hopper on the gun with the drywall mixture that you just created. Attach the gun to the air compressor and adjust the setting to 25 to 45 PSI. Once the gun is correctly hooked up and loaded, you can start painting. , Before trying to apply the texture to your ceiling, use a piece of cardboard so that you can get a feel for your paint spray gun. If your texture is too thin, add more of the drywall powder. If the paint is coming out too thick, add more water to your mixture.

, Move in slow deliberate sections of 6x6 feet (1.82 x 1.82 meters). If a part of your ceiling doesn't have enough texture, hold the gun and paint that part of the ceiling longer., Allow the paint to harden a little, but not enough to be completely dry. Once it's stiffened up, use a knock-down blade to press down the textured ceiling. A knock-down blade is a handheld tool with a flat edge that you can use to push down overly textured stipple.Using a knock-down blade over the entirety of your ceiling will give it a unified texture.

, After you've painted your ceiling, you'll need to wait a full day before it's all dried. Once it's dried, you can wash your ceiling as you normally would."

Prime the ceiling.",How to Stipple Ceiling3," As you stipple the ceiling paint will drip and land on whatever is beneath it. To preserve the look of your furniture, make sure to move it out of the room. If you have oriental rugs or carpets, you can roll those up and put them out of the room as well. Dried paint is easier to clean off hard flooring than carpet or upholstery., If you have pieces of furniture that are too big to be moved, you can lay drop cloths or tarps over them. Cover up the floor to prevent dripping paint from getting on it.

, Fixtures will cover up portions of your ceiling and make it impossible to stipple it consistently throughout. Find your circuit breaker box and turn off the power for the fuse that you're working on. Unscrew ceiling lights, fans, and chandeliers from your ceiling with a Phillips-head screwdriver or screwdriver that fits the screws in your lighting fixtures.

Double-check that the flow of electricity to your light is off by flipping the light switch on and off.
If you're uncertain how to disconnect electrical fixtures properly, hire an electrician.
For fixtures that you can't remove, apply painters tape around the edge of them so that they don't get paint on them.

, To prevent your paint from dripping onto your walls, you'll need to apply painter's tape to the edges of where your walls meet your ceiling. Roll out long pieces of tape and apply it to the top of your walls and around the perimeter of the ceiling you intend on painting. Applying 5-8 inches (12.7-20.32 cm) of painters tape will ensure that the ceiling paint will not drip onto your walls.

If you paint outside of the lines, your paint will end up on the painter's tape and not the walls.

, Purchase a white or off-white oil based or water based primer at a hardware store or online before using texture on your ceiling. Use a brush and dip it in the primer before applying it to your ceiling. Allow the primer to dry overnight before continuing with the rest of your project. Applying primer will allow the heavy textured paint to adhere to your ceiling.When using an oil-based primer, make sure to open the windows and to have proper air ventilation.

Cover the floor with a protective material if desired.,
Position a chair or stepladder underneath the tile.,
Lift the tile out of the ceiling frame.,
Angle the tile so that it fits through the frame opening.,
Pull the ceiling tile out of the frame.,
Address any issues that were causing damage to the tile.,
Replace the old ceiling tile with a new one.",How to Remove a Ceiling Tile," Gypsum ceiling tiles tend to crumble around the edges, especially as they get older. If you want to keep this debris from getting onto your floors, lay down something to protect them, such as sheets of newspaper. A tarp is ideal if you are removing large amounts of ceiling tile.;
, If your ceilings are out of your reach when standing up, you'll need to stand on top of something. This is useful even if you are tall enough to reach the ceiling, because it produces a more comfortable angle, which allows you to remove the tile with less damage to its edges.

, Each ceiling tile in your suspended ceiling will be held in place by resting on the T-shaped metal frame (the component that forms a grid across your ceiling). Gently push the tile upwards to lift it out of the frame. Use both hands to avoid damaging the tile and generating debris.

, The ceiling tile will be a little larger than the opening so that it can rest securely on the frame without falling through. To remove it, rotate it about 45 degrees in the space above the ceiling. The tile should easily fit through the square opening when positioned along the diagonal.

, Gently lower the tile through the frame, and set it onto your protective floor covering. Repeat this process for any other tiles that need to be removed. Gypsum tiles can be discarded in the garbage or recycled at select recycling depots that accept construction waste. Your floor covering can then be carefully discarded along with any debris.

, A common reason for replacing ceiling tiles is water damage, which readily causes discoloration and deterioration. Water damage is usually caused by a leaky pipe above the ceiling, and you must address this problem before replacing the ceiling tile.

, The new tile can be eased into the frame along the diagonal just as you removed the old one. Lower it gently into the frame, being careful not to damage any of the edges in the process.

Apply some blue painter's tape to the walls where they meet the ceiling.,
Press the tape down on the wall as tightly as possible to keep any excess paint from leaking in behind it.

,
Dip your paintbrush approximately halfway into the paint so the paint does not over-saturate the bristles.

,
Begin on the left side of the wall if you are right handed; if you are left handed, begin on the right side of the wall.,
Hold the brush against the ceiling so only the tips of the bristles rest against it without bending.,
Brush along the ceiling in short strokes, stopping as often as needed to reload the brush with paint.

,
Smooth out the brush marks along the ceiling’s edge by going over the paint a second time.

,
Hold the brush against the ceiling with the handle of the brush below the bristles.,
Move on to the interior of the ceiling, overlapping the brushstrokes with a roller just slightly to provide a clean surface on the ceiling with no visible edge where the brushwork begins.

,
Wait until the paint has dried, then remove the tape from the walls.

",How to Paint Ceiling Edges," The tape will help protect the walls from drips or from accidental smears.;
,,, This will allow you to pull the brush at a comfortable angle, which will help you avoid mistakes or paint smears.

, This will hold the handle of the brush closer to the ceiling.

,,, This will bend the bristles of the brush so the long fibers of the brush, rather than the tips, are in contact with the ceiling. Applying the brush this way will remove many of the brush marks that can be left behind by a paintbrush, and provide you with a smooth edge.

If you are sanding a stipple ceiling, use an electric sander with dust bag.,
Smooth out the stipple ceiling with a poll sander after using the electric sander.",How to Sand a Ceiling," Though asbestos was no longer legal to use after the late 1970s, it was not uncommon for drywall compounds used in textured ceilings to contain asbestos. Carefully send a sample by scraping the ceiling into a plastic bag to an asbestos lab. If your ceiling does contain asbestos, professionals will have to do the sanding job for you.;
,


Make sure all electrical outlets are covered well.
Cover the floor in heavy duty plastic and bring it up the wall about 1 foot (0.3 m). Tape it in place.
Cover the walls with heavy duty plastic and keep it in place with painter's tape all along the top so no dust can fall through. Make sure the plastic is long enough to reach the floor.
Cover the floor with plastic for sanding a stipple ceiling and resin paper for sanding a popcorn ceiling.

, Sanding can get very dusty and you do not want to breathe it in or get it in your eyes.

, Do not saturate the ceiling but wet it thoroughly. Start with a 4 foot (1.2 m) area so the ceiling does not dry before you get to it.

, You may need to apply more water if it is difficult to scrape.

,, It should be lightweight as you will be holding this over your head. Use 80 grit sandpaper. Move the sander over an area back and forth slowly. This will knock down the stipple.

, Use 120 grit sandpaper, followed by 200 grit.

If your walls are textured, consider calling a contractor for best results.,
If you have a drywall ceiling that's in need of repair, consider hiring a drywall contractor to touch things up before going on to painting.",How to Paint a Ceiling1," An acoustic ceiling, better known as a popcorn ceiling, or knockdown ceiling is best painted with spray materials. For this reason, it's best to use a professional contractor who is licensed to do the job.;
, Ask the drywall contractor to do a skim coat to smooth out the ceiling; adjusting the coat on the drywall before you paint will make the ceiling sparkle and glisten after the coat of paint has been applied.

Consider caulking around the edges in a color that matches your rose.,
Allow it to dry completely and then finish connecting and hanging your ceiling light fixture.

",How to Put Up a Ceiling Rose,";
, Drill a hole in the center of the rose with an electric drill and bit. The electrician can tell you how big the hole in the center must be.

, Use a 120-grit sandpaper pad and hand sander. The sanding process will scuff the ceiling so that it adheres more fully to the surface of the ceiling.


Always wear a ventilation mask when sanding.

, Set up your ladder. Have someone hold the ceiling rose in the position you desire, and then outline the area with a pencil.


Remove the rose, so that you can apply the glue.
You may need to set up two ladders so that both the person holding and the person outlining can access the ceiling rose.

, You can draw small perpendicular lines outside where the rose is to use as guidelines.

, You will need to mix it before you place the rose on the ceiling

, Apply the cornice adhesive with a one-half inch (12mm) notched spreader. Don’t apply it within a few inches (5cm) of the edges, because it will spread toward the ends.

, Push the rose against the ceiling, paying attention to your marked guidelines. Hold it in place for three minutes, or however long the adhesive package suggests.

, Screw it in three to four places.

,, You can also use a small amount of matching paint to cover the screw heads.,"

Stock up on supplies.,
Choose your color.,
Move your furniture and prepare your room.,
Use painter's tape to mask the area around the trim, as well as where the wall meets the ceiling.,
Prime the walls before you paint.",How to Paint a Ceiling2," For ceilings, specifically, use a thick-nap roller with an extension pole rather than a paint brush. These types of rollers will ensure a smooth layer of paint without bumps or bubbles. Additionally, you may need:


A ladder
A paint tray and liner
A wall brush for covering edges
Spackle and a putty knife for holes
Caulking and a caulking gun for cracks in corners

, Most ceilings are painted white because of their reflective qualities, making a room seem brighter and larger than it may really be. However, you may want to consider which particular shade of white you prefer; specifically, which one will go best with the color of your walls?


A standard bright white may play off of a richer wall hue more, causing too much of a distinction and ruining the taste of the room. Look for mellow shades of white or hues of eggshell if you feel that a bolder white might be too much of a contrast.
Flat paint is the best type of paint for ceilings because of its smooth viscosity. Flat paint will help hide any imperfections in the ceiling.

, Try to move as much of your furniture as possible out of the way of your work. This may not be possible if you live in an apartment or have extremely heavy and large couches, tables, beds and other pieces of furniture which may not be easily transportable to another room. If you find yourself in that scenario, drape plastic over all of your furniture to protect it from dripping paint.


Do not, however, use plastic on your floor, as it will bunch, crinkle and shift, hardly protecting it from paint. Instead, lay thick drop cloth evenly across your floor. Also be sure to properly protect your windows, sills and floorboards with plastic.

, If you're going to be painting your walls after you paint your ceiling, you won't have to do this, although preserving an even finish by taping may still be your best bet.

, Priming ensures that you'll only have to give the ceiling one coat of paint. A primer will help stick to the ceiling and absorb the coat of paint, like a sponge absorbing water.


For best results, use a primer with stain-blocker. Stain-blockers cover up unsightly stains on walls, such as watermarks, smoke, and nicotine, and keep them from bleeding through into the paint after the primer has been applied.

If necessary, cut in along the corners with a wall brush or an angled brush.,
While the cut in line is still wet, paint the ceiling with your roller.,
Paint in sections until the entire ceiling is covered with zigzags.,
Go over the zigzags with straight lines on your roller.,
Treat your vaulted ceiling like a wall.",How to Paint a Ceiling3," If you're not covering the edges of the wall with painter's tape, you'll want to use an angled brush to cut in along the edges of the ceiling, where the trim meets the wall. Cover the entire corner of the ceiling before working inward.

, You paint while the cut in line is still wet to prevent a clear line from forming between the edge and the center of the ceiling Dip your roller into the paint tray and coat evenly, making sure that excess paint has been driven from the roller.


Using zigzagging lines, cover the ceiling lightly with paint. While zigzagging with your roller, create ""W"" or ""V"" shapes without ever removing the roller from the surface of the ceiling.
Never lay too much pressure on your roller, it may cause uneven textures to blot along your ceiling.

, When you're done with a sections, blend it with the previous section. Don't worry too much about creating a uniform look just yet; you'll blend everything together beautifully in the next step.

, This will help even out the paint and create a firm visual appeal. If you've applied a primer coat, you shouldn't need to apply a second coat of paint.

, Contrary to a flat ceiling, vaulted ceilings can be painted like a wall. Start in a corner of the ceiling and work your way down to the wall in straight-lines, with each consecutive line slightly overlapping the one before. Be smooth and consistent with all of your strokes.

",How to Insulate a Cathedral Ceiling," Stand on a ladder and using a caulk gun, seal any areas where there is visible wiring or plumbing. Check the joists and wall plates for any holes or openings. Be sure to seal around any PVC pipes as well. This will protect the room from air infiltration and will also suppress fires.

, Also called vent chutes, the baffles will make sure there is enough air flowing for ventilation needs. Baffles are available in prefabricated models, built to fit the measurements of your ceiling joists.


Put the baffle between the joists, starting where they join at the exterior wall plate.
Attach the baffles to the interior of the joists using a staple hammer and cover the wall plate area completely. There should be a 1 inch (2.54 cm) space beneath the plywood sheathing.

,, The side exposing the kraft paper must face downward. There must be at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) of space beneath the roof's plywood sheathing. This will ensure adequate airing.

, Keep the insulation at least 3 inches (7.62 cm) away from any sources of heat sources such as chimneys or recessed lights.

, Leave at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) under the roof's plywood sheathing for adequate airing. There is nothing to staple with fiberglass batts.;

",How to Paint a Textured Ceiling,";
,,,, If the walls and the ceiling will be the same color, you can skip this step.

,


If you choose to use a roller, be sure to get one with a 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick nap to ensure full coverage.
A spray gun can also be used and may save some time but it might be necessary to practice on a different surface first to get a feel for the way the gun handles and how far you should hold the sprayer to the surface for the best coverage.

,


Textured paint is thicker than normal paint and is designed for textured surfaces. There are different varieties for different textures so be sure to choose the correct paint for your texture. For example, coarse paint for a coarse or popcorn ceiling.

,


If using a roller, be sure to press gently and use slow, even strokes.
If using a spray gun, spray lightly and evenly.

, Don't worry if your coverage is not perfect. You will have the opportunity to catch any missed spots when you apply a second coat.

,, For example, if your first strokes were north/south, paint the second coat in an east/west direction.

A popcorn ceilings that hasn’t been painted previously is usually water-soluble. If you paint it with a roller, the ceiling may absorb moisture from the paint and the texture can come off on the roller. Test your ceiling’s water solubility by spraying a small, unnoticeable spot with water. If the area becomes soft, your ceiling hasn’t been painted before.If your ceiling hasn’t been painted before, the best way to paint it is with a spray gun.;
, Painting an overhead surface means that there can sometimes be drips, so you need to protect the furnishings in the room. Take as much of the furniture out of the room as possible. If there are large, difficult to move items, cover them with drop cloths or plastic sheeting to keep the paint off them.Don’t forget to place drop cloths or plastic on the floor too.

, If possible, it’s best to remove light fixtures before you paint the ceiling. However, if you can’t, make sure to wrap them completely in masking paper and painter’s tape. You’ll also need to cover the walls, including windows, fans, vents, and doors, with plastic sheeting. Be sure to make an extremely tight seal at the point where the ceiling meets the wall with painter’s tape.If you’re painting the walls along with the ceiling, you obviously don’t have to worry about covering them and creating a seal with paint. You still need to cover the fixtures, windows, doors, and baseboards, though.
A tight seal is especially important if you’re planning to spray the ceiling. You can go with a looser seal when you’re rolling on the paint.

, Before you move on to making ceiling repairs or painting the ceiling, make sure that you have the proper safety equipment to protect yourself. When you’re working on an overhead surface, it’s easy for debris, paint, and other materials to fall in your face. Always wear a dust mask and safety eye mask or glasses.It’s also a good idea to wear a hat to cover you head. You’ll also want to make sure that you’re wearing old clothing or disposable coveralls that you don’t mind ruining.

, Once the room is covered in plastic, it’s important to fix any damage to the ceiling before you start painting. For small areas that require repair, you can use a can of spray acoustic texture. For larger areas, you’ll likely need to use powder texture that mixes with water and apply with a pneumatic hopper. Spray acoustic texture works best on areas of damage that are 16-inches by 16-inches or less.
If your ceiling has never been painted before, you can remove damaged areas by applying water to them and scraping away the damage.
Make sure to seal any areas of water damage with an oil-based, stain blocking primer that’s been thinned with water by approximately 25 percent.
When you’re checking the ceiling for damage, keep an eye out for dust, dirt, and other debris. Use a feather duster to remove it.

, When you’re painting a popcorn ceiling, paint with a flat or matte finish is usually the best option because it won’t draw attention to any areas with uneven texture. However, if you prefer a satin or semi-gloss finish, you can usually use those without any problem.If the ceiling is in a room that is prone to humidity, such as a bathroom or kitchen, a satin or semi-gloss finish paint is actually the best option.
Try to use as high quality a paint as you can afford. The better the paint, the less you’ll have to use and the less effort it’ll take to apply it. While you may pay more for a single can of high quality paint, you’ll need less to cover the ceiling so you can get away with buying fewer cans.

, White is the traditional paint color for ceilings because it keeps the focus on the walls. It can also help brighten up the room and make low ceilings appear higher. However, you may opt for another light color for your ceiling, such as a pale yellow or gray. It’s best not to use the same color on the walls, though.Using a dark color can be a good option if your ceiling is high and gives the room an imposing feeling. A richer shade on the ceiling can help make the space feel warmer and cozier.

, Acrylic paint works best on popcorn ceilings, but if you apply it straight, it will be too sticky and actually wind up pulling some of the texture from the ceiling. To make it more workable, thin the paint before applying it. With a popcorn ceiling, you can use water to thin the paint -- aim to add approximately a ½-quart of water for each gallon of paint.You don’t want to dilute the paint too much, so it’s a good idea to start by adding 8-ounces, or ¼-quart, of water to the paint and dabbing it on a corner of the ceiling to test how it applies. If it’s still too thick, add more water.
To determine if you've thinned the paint enough, pour some through a funnel. If it passes through it easily, you've got the consistency right. If it doesn't pass through freely, add more water.

, When you’re painting a ceiling, an airless paint sprayer usually works best because it fans the pain out in droplets to help evenly coat the surface.When you’re working on an overhead surface such as a ceiling, you want to choose a model that has a suction set and a portable paint reservoir instead of the usual jar. A sprayer that comes with a backpack type setup is usually the most convenient.If you don’t paint regularly, there’s no need to purchase a paint sprayer. You can usually rent them from hardware stores, home improvement centers, and tool rental companies.
Make sure to read the instructions on how to fill the sprayer with paint carefully. It can vary from model to model.

, Using the right tip on your paint sprayer is key to a successful paint application. With thinned acrylic paint, a 415 or 515 tip usually works best. To make sure that the tip you’ve chosen is appropriate, test it by spraying a piece of cardboard to see the pattern of the paint.When you spray the cardboard, make sure that the spray pattern is intact, without any breaks.
Make sure to examine the tip itself. If you notice that it’s rounded or has grooves along the edge, it is probably worn out and should be replaced.

, When your paint sprayer is ready, it’s time to spray the ceiling. Step up on a ladder so you can comfortable hold the nozzle approximately 1-foot from the ceiling. For the first coat, spray the paint onto the ceiling in a single direction, moving in a steady motion.Be sure to hold the sprayer so it’s perpendicular to the ceiling.When you finish with one strip of the ceiling, overlap the painted section with your next pass over the surface for the most complete coverage.

, After you’ve finished spraying the entire ceiling in the first direction, you’ll want to apply a second coat. This time, move the spray over the ceiling in the opposite direction of the first coat.Allow the paint to dry for approximately one to two hours between coats.
If the ceiling looks patchy after two coats, you may want to apply a third coat in third direction for more complete coverage.

, For the best paint application with a roller, you want to use a roller head that has a thick enough texture to really absorb the paint and smooth it across the ceiling. Roller covers that are made of lambswool or synthetic material and at least 1-inch thick are usually the best option. Make sure that your roller extension pole is long enough for you to comfortably reach the ceiling. You’ll probably need a ladder to help you get close enough, though.

, Instead of pouring the paint into the usual roller tray, it’s better to use a 5-gallon bucket. Because it can hold more paint, you won’t have to bend as far to reload the roller so you can work more quickly and efficiently.Remember to place a roller screen inside the bucket. That will allow you to get the excess paint off your roller so you don’t splatter it as you’re painting.

, When you’re painting a textured popcorn ceiling, you don’t need to apply the paint in a zigzag fashion as you usually would with a flat surface. Instead, roll the paint on in a straight pattern, using the lightest pressure as possible as you move over the surface.When you begin rolling on the paint, start near a corner and work in small sections.
Avoid going back and forth with the roller over the same areas or you may loosen the ceiling’s texture and knock it off.

, While you should try to get as close as possible to the edges of the ceiling with the roller, you won’t be able to fully paint along those edges without a brush. If you’re planning on painting the walls too, you can roll over and down the edges. However, if you’re not painting the walls, use a brush to cut in the edge with a gentle dabbing motion.A 2-inch trim brush works well for cutting in the edges.

, For complete coverage, you’ll need to apply two to three coats of paint to the ceiling. Before starting a new coat, though, be sure to allow each coat to dry completely, which can take three to four hours. Use the same straight pattern and gentle technique when you roll on another coat, but apply it in a perpendicular direction to the previous coat.If you try to apply another coat while the ceiling is still wet, you may wind up pulling off some of the popcorn texture.

Ensure that your ceiling tiles can support the weight of the insulation.,
Install new hanger wires along each beam of the grid.,
Purchase batt insulation.,
Slide the ceiling tiles out of place.,
Add the batt insulation.,
Slide the ceiling tiles back into place.",How to Insulate a Drop Ceiling," Although batt insulation is fairly lightweight, it can put an undue amount of stress on flimsy drop ceiling tiles and break them.


If you have fiberglass tiles, you'll need to replace them before proceeding. Fiberglass ceiling tiles cannot support the weight of insulation.
If you have the more common wood-and-gypsum ceiling tiles, they will need to be at least 5/8 inch (15 mm) thick to be used safely with batt insulation.;
, Because you'll be adding additional weight to the ceiling grid, you will need to install additional hanger wires to support it.


Aim to install an additional hanger wire between each existing pair of wires. This will double the total number of wires supporting each beam.
Remember that the hanger wires should only be secured into the wood joists. If you ran your grid beams parallel to the ceiling joists this will not pose a challenge.

, Either paper-backed or foil-backed insulation will suffice; both types of this insulation are readily available at home improvement stores.


Measure the distance of your grid from the joists to determine the depth of batting you should buy; most drop ceilings will accommodate up to 8"" (20 cm) batts.
To determine the total amount of batt insulation you need to buy, simply calculate the area of the suspended ceiling (width multiplied by depth in a rectangular room).

, Beginning on 1 end of the room, push all of the tiles in the first row up into the ceiling and slide them over. Do not take them completely down from the ceiling grid, as this makes them difficult to reinstall once the insulation is in place.

, Begin working the strip of batt insulation above the ceiling grid and into the row you are working on, keeping the backing faced down. Sit the insulation flush against the hanger wires so that there won't be any air space between neighboring strips of batting.


You may find it helpful to temporarily remove the cross tees of the ceiling grid while you get the insulation into place.

, After each section of batting is in place, reach underneath it and grab the ceiling tiles you moved aside. Gently pull them back into place so that the insulation rests on top. Repeat this process for each remaining row of tiles.

Assess the weight of the suspended item.,
Purchase a hook screw for your ceiling.,
Locate the nearest ceiling joist where you want to hang your hook.,
Use an electric drill to drill a pilot hole into the ceiling joist.,
Place the pointed tip of the hook screw into the hole.",How to Hang a Hook from a Ceiling1," Estimating the weight of the item you want to hang from the ceiling will determine what size fastener you need. Hanging a paper lantern will require a different fastener than hanging a large, heavy pendant lamp.


If the item you are using is less than five pounds, opt for an adhesive hook. Adhesive hooks also come in various sizes and are easy to remove without damaging the paint on your ceiling. (Note that adhesive hooks only stick on to flat ceilings, not textured ceilings.) If the item is especially heavy, balance out its weight using two hook screws. Install the two screws at an angle from each other, not directly vertical. ;
, Hook screws are small fasteners consisting of a pointed, threaded end and a curved hook end. They can be purchased from most hardware stores and will come in different sizes based on the amount of weight they can support.


There are various sizes of hook screws. If your item is small, use cup hooks or, even smaller, screw eye hooks.
If you're looking to hang something heavier, opt for large utility storage hooks, which are strong enough to hold things like bicycles.

, A joist is one of the beams that supports a ceiling, and it's the securest place to fasten a hook. The easiest way to locate your ceiling joists is by using a stud finder.


You can also knock on the ceiling with your knuckles. The areas between joists will produce a hollow, resonant sound, while the joists will produce a shorter, firmer sound.
Ceiling joists are usually spaced either 16 or 24 inches (40.6 or 61.0 cm) apart from each other. Once you've located a joist, quickly find the next one by using a tape measure and measuring out either 16 or 24 inches (40.6 or 61.0 cm). If you have a crawl space or an attic with exposed joists, look to see which direction the joists are laid and also how far apart they're spaced.
Use a pencil to mark the desired location of your hook screw once you've found a suitable joist.

, The pilot hole will allow you to screw the hook screw into the ceiling by hand without it binding up or breaking.


Select a drill bit that is about the same diameter as your hook screw's threaded shaft, but smaller than the outer threads themselves.
If the hole is too wide, the thread of the screw won't have anything to grab onto.
The pilot hole should be slightly deeper than the length of the hook screw's threaded shaft.

, Gently twist it clockwise; as it gets deeper, you will have to apply firmer pressure.


If you have trouble twisting it through the last few rotations, grasp the hook gently with pliers and use the pliers to gain added torque.
Stop twisting once the base of the hook is flush with the ceiling. If you twist past this point, you could break the hook.

Clean the ceiling.,
Measure the square footage of the room.,
Determine how many tiles you need.,
Remove any fixtures or vents.",How to Install Ceiling Tiles1," If the ceiling isn't very dirty, simply use a broom covered with a tee-shirt to dust away any dirt. If your ceiling is dirty or greasy, use a sponge to scrub one small section at a time using an all-purpose cleaner.It's important to let the ceiling dry thoroughly before applying your tiles.


A clean surface will make your tiles stick more effectively. You may have trouble attaching them if the ceiling is dirty or has peeling paint. If your ceiling is very greasy, wash it using a mixture of 1 cup ammonia and half a gallon of water.;
, To do this, use measuring tape and record how long the ceiling is. Then measure how wide the ceiling is. Multiply these two numbers to get your square footage.For example, if your ceiling is 12' long and 15' wide, then the square footage is 180.

, You'll need to figure the square footage of each tile. Again, multiply the length times the width to get the tile's measurement. Then divide the square footage of the ceiling by the square footage of one tile. This will tell you how many tiles you'll need.For example, if your tile is 24"" long and 24"" wide (2' by 2'), then the square footage for the tile is 4 (2 multiplied by 2). If the square footage for your room is 180, divide it by 4. You'll need at least 45 tiles.
Always buy 15 percent more tiles than you think you'll need. That way, if you need to cut tiles or make a mistake, you'll have plenty to complete the job., Unscrew any light fixtures, fans, or air vent covers. This will allow you to easily measure tiles and install them without damaging fixtures.


You'll probably want to use a flat-head or Phillips screwdriver to remove fixtures. This is also a good time to give fixtures and vents a quick clean.

Prepare a container of spackle.,
Remove the debris around the hole.,
Dust the area around the hole with a toothbrush or small paintbrush to remove any dust.,
Moisten a small, soft sponge and dampen the hole, rubbing gently.,
Patch the ceiling hole with the spackle mixture.,
Dry the spackle completely.,
Sand the area.,
Use a brush or soft cloth to dust the area clean.

,
Paint the spot with a color that matches the ceiling.

",How to Fix Holes in a Ceiling," Many brands of spackle or putty come premixed in disposable containers, and can just be opened and used. Drywall compounds are also available that can be mixed in a small, disposable cup.;
, Strip away any old paint or loose and flaking spots of drywall. If the hole was created by a screw or other attachment that affixed something to the ceiling, make sure all of the attachment pieces have been removed from the area, including inside the hole.

,


If the hole is larger than half an inch, use an adhesive mesh tape on the hole. Scrape the area around the ceiling hole, and apply the tape in strips that run at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) past the hole before preparing the area for spackling.

, Make sure the ceiling hole is wet, but not dripping. This will ensure the drywall spackle can easily attach to the hole, and stay in place.

, Use a putty knife to press the spackle inside and around the hole. Smooth the putty over and beyond the hole. The spackled area should be at least twice the size of the hole. Continue to spread the spackle over the hole until a flat surface has been created that is consistent with the ceiling.

, Leave the area open and untouched overnight to dry thoroughly.

, Rub a piece of sandpaper over the hole several times, applying pressure on the spackled area until the spot is level with the ceiling.

If you must hang your ceiling hook in a location where there is no joist, use a toggle bolt, also known as a toggle ""anchor,"" with a hook.,
Using a stud finder, select a hollow area in the drywall and mark it with a pencil.,
Drill a hole through the mark with an electric drill.,
Pinch the wings together and insert them through the hole.",How to Hang a Hook from a Ceiling2," A toggle anchor with a hook consists of a bolt threaded through the center of two spring-loaded wings; a hook is attached to the end of the bolt instead of a standard bolt head.


Never use a plastic anchor to hang something from a ceiling. Plastic anchors are meant to be used for lighter loads against a vertical wall. Measure the thickness of the drywall and the weight of the item you want to hang; then consult a chart of load capacities to determine what size toggle bolt you should be using. ,


A toggle bolt cannot be screwed into a wooden joist, so make sure you're drilling into a hollow area.
If you're hanging a lamp, make sure your hole is close to a power outlet that you easily can plug it into.

, The packaging on your toggle bolt should specify how big the hole should be - usually around half an inch.


If the packaging doesn't indicate the size, measure the base of the toggle when it's closed to determine how big of a hole to drill.
If you're using an especially large toggle bolt, use a paddle bit to drill the hole. A paddle bit is designed to drill larger holes.

, When they reach the hollow space, the wings will open. Tightening the bolt will screw the wings down until they are secure against the inner surface of the ceiling.

Use chalk lines to find the center of the room.,
Apply cement or adhesive to your tiles.,
Apply whole tiles to ceiling.,
Cut tiles for fixtures.,
Measure and cut edge tiles.,
Attach molding to the borders, optional.",How to Install Ceiling Tiles2," Measure halfway across each wall in opposite directions, using the length and width measurements you made for the ceiling. Have someone hold the chalk line or reel while you walk to the opposite end of the room. Snap the chalk against the ceiling. Rotate 90 degrees and do the same for the two opposite walls.For example, if your room was 12' long and 15' wide, you should measure 6' across the length of the room and 7.5' across the width of the room.
When completed, you should have 2 straight lines that cross each other in the center of the room. This will be your starting point for laying tiles.

, Use a foam brush or putty knife to spread adhesive on the back of your tiles. Spread adhesive to the four corners of the ceiling tile, about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the edges and to the center of the tile.


Check package instructions to determine the correct adhesive or cement for your tile material.

, Place your first tile in the center of the room, where the two chalk lines meet. Press it firmly against the ceiling, making sure it is level and aligned properly. Continue to place the tiles by working out from the center until you reach the other side of the room. Use the chalk lines as a guide., When you reach a fixture hole, measure the size and shape of the hole and locate where it will be on the ceiling tile you're preparing to place. Use those measurements to draw and cut the hole using a straightedge or scissors. Apply glue and place the tile on the ceiling where the fixture will be.


Do a dry run and test your cut before adhering it to the ceiling. Simply hold your cut tile up over the hole, making sure the hole is completely visible. This way you'll be able to easily reinstall the fixture.

, By the time you've almost completed tiling your ceiling, you may notice that you're near the edges and that the tiles will not entirely fit. You'll need to measure the exact size of tile for the edges. Then use a straight edge to cut the tile, apply glue, and press the edge tile against the ceiling. Repeat this around all the edges.


Again, do a dry run and test your cut before adhering it to the ceiling. Simply hold your cut tile up on the ceiling against the edge. It should fit snugly, but not be too tight or difficult to apply.

, If you choose to add borders to the edges of the ceiling, use a staple or nail gun and secure the molding to the wall. Fill the holes with wood filler and paint the molding.


Molding can make your room look more polished or finished.It can also hide edges of tiles that have been cut.

Locate one of the joists.,
Find the other joists.,
Install the furring strips.,
Apply the first tile in the corner.,
Staple the tiles across the ceiling.Once you've stapled the edge tiles, work your way across the ceiling filling in with whole tiles.,
Attach molding to the borders, optional.",How to Install Ceiling Tiles3," A joist is a length of timber or metal that provides structural support. It's easiest to use a stud finder to locate them in the ceiling. Mark the spot with a nail or chalk mark.


You might want to start by checking for joists near lighting fixtures since they're often installed along joists.

, Measure 16 inches (40.64 cm) from the first joist and check for the presence of the next one. Joists are usually 16 inches to 24 inches (40.64 to 60.96 cm) apart, so you should find it close to those measurements. Mark a chalk line that shows the joists across the entire ceiling., Furring strips are thin 1"" by 3"" strips of wood that you attach at a right angle to your joists so that they are flush against the wall. You simply staple a nail into the strip. Use a level and make sure that the furring strip is level. If not, add a shim underneath to make it level.


Make sure that your furring strips are at even intervals and that they fall through the center of your tiles. You may want to hold up tiles for reference as you install the furring strips.

, Snap a chalk line down the center of the first strip closest to the wall. Align the corner tile with the line and the wall, then staple it to the furring strip, using at least 2 staples along the sides and 1 in each corner. Continue placing edge tiles., You may need to use a straight edge to cut a tile to fit around a fixture. When you reach a fixture hole, measure the size and shape of the hole and locate where it will be on the ceiling tile you're preparing to place. Use those measurements to draw and cut the hole.

, If you choose to add borders to the edges of the ceiling, use a staple or nail gun and secure the molding to the wall. Fill the holes with wood filler and paint the molding.


Molding can make your room look more polished or finished.It can also hide edges of tiles that have been cut.

Paint the ceiling with white paint.,
Consider lighter colors rather than plain white.,
Use vertical patterns to good effect.,
Avoid using any features that protrude from the ceiling.,
Choose wall lighting instead of overhead lighting.,
Use window furnishings to increase the sense of height.,
Hang artwork up high.,
Use large mirrors that take up most of the wall.,
Paint a ""faux finish"" that is lighter at the top.",How to Make a Ceiling Look Higher," White will create a sense of height and expansiveness and it will reflect a lot of light, giving rise to the sense of increased height. There are two schools of thought as to whether or not a matte or high gloss finish is better for making a ceiling appear higher, so both are provided here for your own assessment:


Apartment Therapy states that high or semi gloss paint is ideal because it will create a reflective sheen and the reflection will give the impression of height and additional space.On the other hand, Art & Home states that a matte finish is better because it allows the ceiling to ""disappear"", with all of its faults being subsumed under the matte finish.;
, White isn't always the ideal color for a room and it isn't necessary to stick to a plain white where you'd prefer a color. Choose cool colors, especially from the pastel shade range. The important thing is to ensure that the color chosen is lighter than the wall colors., Focus on the walls in this instance; the sensation of increased height can be created by the use of vertical stripes on the walls. Paint vertical stripes or use wallpaper that has a printed vertical stripe pattern. The vertical stripes will help provide the appearance of height., A low ceiling benefits most from being very flat. Features that protrude tend to make the ceiling feel closer. This includes not using ceiling fans, moldings, and overhead lighting.


Keep crown molding thin. Any wider than 2–3 inches/4-6cm will be too thick., Be sure to keep the light sources even across the ceiling. It is recommended that you avoid using recessed can lights because the light distribution will be uneven and can make the ceiling seem more closed in.

, Hang full-length curtains or drapes as high to the ceiling as possible, preferably from ceiling height. Doing this will draw the eyes straight up the long, vertical line, creating a sense of height. , This tricks the eye into looking upward and gives more impression of height. Prefer artwork and photos with vertical lines and features over horizontal shapes. Note that the artwork is hung high in the introduction image.

, These tend to make the ceiling seem higher and work really well to do the trick!

, Paint the room two shades using a ""sponging"" or ""bagging"" technique, with the darker shade at the bottom, gradually moving to the lighter shade near the ceiling. This creates the visual effect of more space up high.

"

Paint the ceiling a dark color.,
Attach a picture rail or wooden wall edging.,
Use patterns on the ceiling itself.,
Add moldings, overhead lighting, decorative elements that extrude from the ceiling.,
Accentuate horizontal lines.,
Keep the window dressing light and short.Don't use long and heavy drapes, as these will increase the sense of height.,
Consider the impact of lighting.,
Hang pictures lower.",How to Make a Ceiling Seem Lower," Look for a dark, warm color, such as deep crimson, dark green, oranges, browns, reds etc.The color should be darker than the color used for the walls. Paint cafe points out that warm tones make a room seem friendlier and dark tones make it seem more intimate., Bring the ceiling paint down to meet with the top of the picture rail or edging.It is recommended that you bring the ceiling painting down at least a foot., Painted or papered patterns can be added to a high ceiling to draw it closer to the viewer. Emma Scattergood recommends patterned paper such as Anaglypta. , Any features that extrude will give a sense of bringing the ceiling closer to those under it. Consider a ""tray ceiling"". This is a ceiling which has varied flat horizontal levels; a tray ceiling will break up the flat look and can be enhanced by lighting features. It can be inverted or recessed., Apartment Therapy suggests using low furniture that stretches across the room.Look for decorative elements that provide horizontal contrasts, such as squat statues, busy scenes in paintings, wider frames, etc.

, Rather, use lightweight, lighter colored drapes that only cover part of the window and are not attached near the ceiling. Curtains have a tendency to create a vertical line, which is something you're trying to avoid when attempting to make a ceiling appear lower.

, While a feature light in the center might be a great means for helping the bring the height down visually, mood lighting should be placed lower, to ensure a sense of intimacy. Place wall lamps at a lower level, and use fixtures with closed tops.

, This will bring the viewer's eye to a lower level and create a sense of less height. Aim for horizontal alignment of frames where possible too - the one pictured here is an excellent example of drawing the horizontal theme across the wall.

Cover the nail or screw holes in the drywall.,
Sand and apply a third thin coat.,
Begin taping the tapered (or beveled) edges of the drywall joints.,
Apply a wider, second coat of compound over the area.,
Cover the second coat with a final thin layer of joint compound.,
Allow the coat to dry.,
Apply the same 3 coats as above at joints with raw edges.,
Apply tape.,
Spread a second coat over the taped corner joint after it has dried.,
Allow the putty to dry.,
Use a reinforced metal corner for outside corners and door openings.,
Permit the area to dry between coats of joint compound.,
Dampen the paper tape by dipping it in a bucket of water.",How to Tape and Float Drywall," Start with the bottom holes and move upward.


Fill the holes with premixed drywall joint compound using a 2-inch (5.1 cm) putty knife.
Allow the putty to dry, then sand down the rough points. Apply a second thin (but wider) coat using a 6-inch (15.3 cm) putty or taping knife, floating out or feathering the edges.;
, Use a 6-to-9 inch (5.3 to 23 cm) putty knife. Sand the last coat down after drying so you can feather the edges.

,


Apply a coat of joint compound over the area about 1/8 inch (3.18 mm) thick, filling up the cracks in the process.
Dampen a piece of the paper joint tape. Fiber mesh tape is easier to use, but it is weaker than paper tape.
Begin at the bottom and work the paper over the joint and into the compound using a 4-inch (10.2 cm) putty or taping knife. Continue until you have covered the entire joint with one coat of joint compound and tape. Allow this to dry.

, Use a 6-inch (15.3 cm) putty knife. Widen the width of the each following layer until you have filled up the dip, or beveled, edge in the wallboard and the joint appears to be flat.

, Only do this once the second coat is dry. Float out the joint, feathering the edges 12 inches (32 cm) on either side. A 9-inch (23 cm) or wider putty knife works best for this layer.

, Begin to smooth down any rough points with 100 grit sandpaper. Next, further feather out the edges of the dry compound.

, These are not beveled edges — you're looking for edges that have been cut. You need to widen out each coat of joint compound, floating outward so you feather the edges. The wider coverage will help prevent the appearance of a bump (or hump) in the flat wall.

, Float out the inside corner of the drywall using tape that has been folded in half lengthwise and embedded the same way as a flat joint.


Fill the inside corner joint with compound.
Take folded tape and mash it into the corner with half of the tape on each side of the joint. The folded edge should be tight in the corner. Using a special corner tape knife will help. Begin at the bottom and work up.

, Use the corner knife in the seam and a 6-inch (15.2 cm) putty knife on each side as you float out the edges.

, Next, spread a third and final coat over the corner joint. Use the corner knife over the seam and a 9-to-12-inch (23 to 30.6 cm) putty knife on each side. Again, make sure you float out the edges. Allow it to dry and give it a final sanding (further flattening out the edges).

, Don't use tape as you normally would. This is recommended to prevent chipping when the corner is bumped or hit when passed by.


Connect the metal corner bead with staples or screws. Now, apply 2 thin coats of joint compound over the mesh until it is level with the metal corner bead.
Float out the edges, using a 6-inch (15.3 cm) knife on the first coat and a 9-inch (23 cm) knife on the last coat.

, Sand down the rough points and feather the edges.

, This will help it stick to the joint compound."

Vacuum the webs.,
Try a feather duster.,
Use a lint roller.",How to Clean a Popcorn Ceiling1," A vacuum cleaner provides a way to suck up the cobwebs without rubbing the delicate popcorn texture. Choose a handheld vacuum with a hose extension that reaches the ceiling. For high ceilings, you’ll need a ladder. Point the vacuum and let its force suck away stubborn cobwebs., When you don’t have the right vacuum cleaner, a feather duster will do. Use a feather duster on a pole extension or climb up with a ladder. Move the duster under each cobweb and lift it away so it doesn’t leave marks.


Remember to clean the cobwebs off the duster before you use it again so they don’t leave marks elsewhere.

, Get non-sticky lint roller tubes from the store. These can be used to replace paint rollers heads that work with extension handles. Tape the ends of the rollers to protect the walls. Roll over the ceiling, then throw away whatever webbing comes down. Replace the tape as the webs stick to it."
"
Lay drop cloths around the floor of the room.,
Paint a 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) thick coat of drywall joint compound on to your walls.,
Choose your retexturing instrument listed below.,
Use other inventive surfaces to achieve an even but textured layer.,
Allow the joint compound to dry before painting.",How to Texture Walls1," Place drop cloths on windows, affixing them with stickpins to hold them in place. Cover any places that you do not want to get dirty. Retexturing walls is a messy process, so make sure all plastic drop cloths overlap.;
, Drywall joint compound is a common contractor's tool. It is used to create the smooth finish on top of drywall. It is also a good canvas for retexturing walls. You will retexture immediately after you apply the drywall joint compound, so if you are working alone, work on 1 wall at a time.


Understand that some of the joint compound will be wiped off during the texturing process. Put on more joint compound than you expect to have on the final product.

, How you retexture your wall may largely depend on what instruments you use.


Use a small whisk broom to create the look of grass cloth on a wall. Grass cloth is a cloth that is woven from plant fibers. It resembles linen and is commonly used as wallpaper. By taking the whisk broom and gently gliding it vertically down the wall to the bottom, and then starting again at the top, you can create this cloth-like texture on your wall.
Drag a thick hair comb or paint comb vertically down the wall to create a texture of thick and even vertical lines. You can also comb in an overlapping ""S"" curve with the paint comb, to create a curvy, textured line.
Use a thick-bristled brush to create circles. Leaving the brush in the same position, simply turn it around in one revolution. This should create the look of a circle. Wipe the joint compound off the brush before the next revolution.
To create vertical beading on your walls, take a window squeegee and cut grooves in it that are a few inches (cm) apart, depending upon how close you would like your beads to be. Start at the top and move the squeegee vertically down the wall. Use a straight motion and a steady hand to create long straight beads, or move back and forth to create a squiggled bead.
To create a woven look, take the squeegee and draw vertical lines, then drag it horizontally to create boxes that resemble woven fabric.
To create longer textured curves, use a process called skip troweling. Take a trowel and lightly brush the wet drywall joint compound at 3 to 6 inch (8 to 15 cm) intervals. Let the compound dry and then lightly sand the next day to remove bumps.

, Apart from brushes, combs, squeegees, trowels, you can also use the following items to create a beautifully textured look:


Sponge: Blot the porous side of a sponge onto newly-applied joint compound and let the pores of the sponge create a wonderful texture.
Old rag: Blot the flat surface of an old rag against the joint compound for a similar, if less uniform, effect.
Tissue paper: Lay the tissue paper over the joint compound and depress into the compound using a clean, dry roller.

, It should take several hours for the drywall joint compound to dry. Afterwards, hit the compound with one, perhaps two, coats of paint using a coarse roller.

Sand your drywall.,
Prime your drywall.,
Mix your drywall compound.",How to Texture Drywall1," Use a sanding pole to prepare your walls for drywall texturing. A pole with a rounded sander will allow you to remove material faster. Try to get the wall as smooth as possible.Use a sanding sponge to sand any difficult angles or corners. You can also use the sanding sponge for detail work.Use a fine grit sandpaper to sand your drywall. Sand with light pressure to avoid ruining the texture of the wall.Wear protective goggles and a dust mask when sanding. Sanding drywall releases small particles of drywall dust that will get everywhere. Make sure you're protected.;
, Remove any dust remaining from the sanding process with a damp cloth. Use a brush to prime the edges near the ceiling line, and use a roller to coat the walls. A high quality primer should go on in a single coat.Before priming, lay down some protective covering such as plastic or heavy cloth. Cover any valuables that can't be moved from the room. Primer's main function is to stick to a surface, making it difficult to remove.Some professionals recommend priming the drywall before you texture to help the compound stick. Others recommend priming after you texture to give your pattern a nice finish. The choice is yours., Fill a clean five gallon bucket with about five parts powdered drywall mix and thirty parts water. The compound should look like thin batter.If you're using a premixed compound gradually add water until you find the right consistency.Write down the ratios you used so you can make keep the compound consistent in case you run out.A drill with a ribbon mixer attachment makes this job considerably easier. You can also let the compound sit overnight to dissolve any lumps. Be sure to mix it again before texturing your wall."

Wrap duct tape around a paint roller.,
Roll over the ceiling.,
Use a broom.",How to Clean a Popcorn Ceiling2," Paint rollers are gentle on popcorn ceilings, but you can choose a thick-nap one for maximum protection. Wrap duct tape tightly around it, sticky side up. Unlike brooms, this combination won’t damage the ceiling., Gently move the roller over the ceiling. The dust will stick to the tape. When it stops working, try replacing the tape. The flexible nature of the roller and tape should also help you get into corners.

, If you don’t mind causing flakes of the ceiling to fall, a broom can work. Make sure your standard household broom is clean so it doesn’t reintroduce dirt. As gently as possible, brush it across the ceiling. Flakes will come off, but so will the dust spots.


Wear a mask when you do this. Popcorn ceilings from the 1970s and earlier may include asbestos, which is harmless when left alone."
"
Get a paint roller.,
Dampen the roller.,
Roll over the surface.,
Add vinegar or detergent.,
Apply the solution.",How to Clean a Popcorn Ceiling3," Paint rollers are soft and rounded so they don’t break apart the textures of the popcorn ceiling. Pick a thick-nap roller, ¾ inches (19 mm) thick or more. Also opt for an extension handle to make cleaning easier. The shape and softness of the roller will protect the popcorn texture from damage., Expose the roller to clean water. Try using a small flow from a faucet to splash or lightly coat the roller. You only need enough to make the roller feel damp. It should not drip at all.


Water can easily damage this delicate ceiling, so be cautious or consider hiring a professional.

, Push the paint roller over the dirty spots. Move in a line, applying an even coat of water. You don’t need to push hard against the ceiling. Rinse the roller when it gets dirty so it doesn’t spread any dust or dirt. Remember to squeeze out the excess moisture before using the roller again.

, If your ceiling has deeper stains, you’ll need to repeat the process with a cleaning solution. In a bucket of water, add a small amount of vinegar or mild dish or laundry detergent. The solution can be made with equal parts water and vinegar or detergent, but the more cleaning solution you use, the more abrasive it can be on the popcorn texture., Use your paint roller, keeping it damp instead of dripping, to roll even lines over the dirty portions of the ceiling. Alternatively, use a spray bottle. It requires climbing up on a ladder, but the spray bottle provides control over how much of the solution is applied to any spot. Allow the solution to sit and soak in. There’s no need to remove it, and trying to would put pressure on the popcorn texture.


Before you do this, you can also apply a stain-blocking primer such as Kilz.

Brush the area around the seam between the 2 sections of sheetrock.,
Mud the joint.,
Prepare the sheetrock tape for installation.,
Apply the sheetrock tape.,
Cover the sheetrock tape with additional mud.,
Clean up.",How to Tape Sheetrock," This will remove any dust or particles that may be lingering on the surface, making it easier for the sheetrock tape to adhere properly. If a brush isn't handy, a clean dry cloth or even a whisk broom will also remove the dust particles with ease. Wear a face mask during this process.;
, Using the drywall knife, fill in the small seam between the 2 sections of sheetrock. Apply small amounts of the mud at a time, making sure that there is as little extra mud left on the surface as possible. Spread the mud as evenly across the surface of the seam and the immediate area, helping to ensure there are no raised areas or clumps of mud along the surface of the drywall. Clean the knife after the mud is in position.

, Using the tape measure, determine the length of the seam between the 2 sheetrock sections, and then cut the correct length of tape with the cleaned drywall knife. When taping a wall seam in a room with a high ceiling, it is fine to cut 2 sections of tape, if that will make the task more manageable.

, Starting at the top of the seam, gently maneuver the tape into position, pressing lightly on the tape surface with 1 hand while using the other to guide the tape as you move downward. This will squeeze a small portion of the mud from under the tape while leaving the area underneath smooth and flush with the surface of the sheetrock sections. If using 2 pieces of tape to cover a seam in a wall that is taller, make sure that the edge of the second piece laps under the first piece, as this will minimize the chances of the tape being noticeable.

, Use the blade of the drywall knife to apply a thin layer of mud to the surface of the tape, helping to hide the edges of the taped seam. Smooth the area so that the mud blends into the sheetrock surface with ease.

, Wet the sponge with a little water and gently wipe away any excess mud from the surface of the sheetrock. After allowing the seam to dry, lightly go over the area with a piece of sandpaper, creating a smooth surface. Brush the area to remove any lingering particles before painting.

Purchase textured wallpaper.,
Apply the textured wallpaper to your wall.",How to Texture Walls2," Textured wallpaper comes in either rolls or uniform tiles that you hinge, connect, or stick onto your wall. Search for ""textured wallpaper"" in order to generate a list of retail textured wallpaper providers.

, Textured wallpaper comes in several different forms, each of which may have different directions. In order to apply rolls of textured wallpaper, probably the most common kind, simply measure the wall, measure your wallpaper to fit, cut out pieces of wallpaper, and apply them to the wall with a strong adhesive.

Pour either sand-textured or popcorn-textured paint into a paint tray.,
Apply Venetian plaster paint to a large steel spatula.",How to Texture Walls3," (Most popular paint brands make paint in these textures.) Apply it directly to the wall with a paint roller. Apply 1 to 2 coats and let dry. This is perhaps the quickest way to retexture your walls.

, Venetian plaster paint is a 2-tone paint made by popular paint brands to create the look of marble and stone on your walls. Work in a 3 by 3 foot (1 by 1 m) area and apply a small amount of paint in an overlapping, random motion until you have a thin coat on most of the surface. Allow some areas of the original wall to show through. Dry for 1 to 4 hours until it is a lighter color and matte finish.


Apply a small amount of the Venetian plaster paint to the spatula and skim the surface at a 90-degree angle to even out the surface colors. Let dry as before and repeat until you have achieved your desired texture. Using light grit sandpaper, polish the surface in circular patterns.

Use a double roller to retexture a wall with 2 colors of paint.,
Create the look of wood using latex paint and a wood grain tool.",How to Texture Walls4," Place 2 complimentary colors of paint in your paint tray. Work in curves going right and left to mix the paint thoroughly on your walls. This method has largely replaced the use of sponges to apply different colors; it is a very efficient method.

, Paint a neutral color of latex paint on your wall. Roll a wood grain tool in a tray of paint, and then roll it vertically down your wall, alternating with both sides of the tool to produce the uneven look of wooden boards.

Rent or buy a hopper gun.,
Adjust the air pressure.,
Practice your technique.,
Spray your drywall.,
Finish the texture.",How to Texture Drywall2," You can find hopper guns at most hardware stores, or online. If you plan on doing a lot of drywall texturing, you may find it more cost effective to purchase one of your own. If this is a one time project, consider renting your hopper gun.


Attach the hopper gun to an air compressor and load the hopper with your mixed drywall compound.Read the manufacturer's instructions before operating the hopper gun.Only fill the hopper up about halfway to keep it from getting too heavy., The air pressure needs to be high enough to spray the compound from the gun, but not so high that you can't control the spray.The gun should also have an adjustable aperture, or mouth. Adjust this opening to your liking. A wider opening will create bigger blobs, and a smaller one will create a finer texture., Before you spray your entire room, do a few test sprays on some scrap cardboard or drywall. Make any final adjustments to the pressure and aperture.Write down the settings you used in case you want to make the same effect again., Cover your wall in a continuous, sweeping motion. Don't pause when spraying as this will cause build up on your wall. Spray with a light touch for best results.You can spray in vertical or horizontal lines, or even in a random pattern. How you decide to spray is up to you, just keep in mind you're aiming for a uniform application.If you feel some of the texture is too thin, you can make another pass. However, be careful not to spray too much. It can be difficult to match up the textures when doing touch-ups., Your texture isn't complete until you paint it. Before you paint your drywall, add another coat of primer. Once the primer dries, add one or two coats of paint to finish the job.Let the drywall texture dry completely before painting."

Gather your supplies.,
Load the brush.,
Start your pattern near the ceiling.,
Finish the texture.",How to Texture Drywall3," All you need to do a sand swirl drywall texture is a wide brush, about 7 inches (17.8 cm) long.You can replace the drywall compound with a mixture known as perlite, which is primer with sand mixed in. The fine grit of the sand adds another dimension to this texture.If you choose to do swirls with just the drywall compound, you may need to thin it out a little more to get even swirls., To get the right effect from this texture, load the brush and wipe away any excess compound. You don't want your brush to have so much compound that it drips on your wall.Don't hold the brush by the handle. Grip the brush so that your hand is actually touching the bristles. This will give you better control when making the swirl pattern., Start at one end of the wall and work your way over in a horizontal line. Place your brush several inches below the ceiling and make a half-moon shape.When you start the next swirl, place your brush on the spot where your half-moon ended. This will create a nice overlapping effect.Work your way down the wall. The top of each swirl should cover the bottom of the row above it, so that all the swirls overlap.Practice your technique on some scrap cardboard or drywall before attempting the texture on your wall., Once the compound or perlite has dried, add another coat of primer. Let the primer dry and then paint the room as normal."

If you plan on doing the ceiling as well, get a pole for your roller and brushes.You can find these at any hardware store. The texture brushes may be marketed as ""crow's foot"" brushes., Load your paint roller up with drywall compound and start rolling in vertical lines. When you finish rolling one direction, repeat the process in the opposite direction. You aren't adding more mud to the wall, rather you're goal is to make an even surface.After you've rolled in the opposite direction, make another pass with horizontal lines. Crossing directions helps to smooth out any lines from rolling.Work with a 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch (1.25 to 2 cm) roller for best results.As you pull the roller out, give it a slight shake to remove any excess mud. As you apply the compound, you want to avoid dripping compound down your walls.If you have a hopper gun, you can choose to spray the compound on the wall rather than roll it. Either way, try to keep the layer even., Apply a generous amount of drywall compound to your texture brush. Hold the brush perpendicular to the wall and ""stamp"" the brush onto the wall.Pull the brush off the wall and keep stamping the wall, working in sections. To vary the pattern, make half turns with the brush with every stamp. Don't turn the brush while it is touching the wall, as that will make a smoother, swirled pattern. The goal of the slap brush technique is a rough texture., Dip a taping knife into some of the drywall compound and run it across the edges to smooth out any angles.Wipe the corners from the inside out. Put the edge of the brush into the corner and pull away from the angle., Let the drywall compound dry completely before adding another coat of primer. Once the primer has dried, paint the room as normal.

Handle drywall correctly.",How to Tape and Mud Drywall," Drywall should be fastened to all wall studs it covers, every six to eight inches (15.2-20.3 cm) along the length of each stud. Ideally, it should be supported at each edge every 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) in the middle of the panel in a wall framed 24 inches (61.0 cm) on center, giving you top to bottom 5 screws; in a more usual wall with studs on 16 inch (40.6 cm) centers, you will have a row of screws on each edge plus two rows spaced 16 inches (40.6 cm) in from each edge.


Drywall screw guns are far easier to work with. Don't mess around with a drill or power screwdriver. Borrow a drywall driver or invest in a counter-sinker designed for drywall applications that attaches to the end of your drill. These tools perfectly countersink every screw you place if you drive them straight.
Make sure your screws are correctly countersunk. You want the screws to lightly dimple but not tear the paper coating of the drywall.






Run the blade of your drywall finishing knife over the screws to make sure none are sticking out. Remove, countersink or otherwise deal with any screws that are sticking out even a little bit. (This will save you much frustration, since you will have to drive every single one you miss when you are applying the mud.)
Avoid drywall nails, unless you simply refuse to borrow a drywall driver. The chances of a nail bending, putting your hammer through the drywall or simply an incorrect countersink on the nail head are great. If you must nail, put them in in pairs about 1-1/2 inches (3.8 cm) apart and give the first another whack after you drive the second.;
, The long edges of the drywall are tapered; the short edges (and any edges you cut) are not tapered and will form ""butt"" joints that are more difficult to finish. Therefore, drywall boards should meet at tapered edges as much as possible and be no more than 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) apart. (Make sure the corners meet the same way, but don't worry too much about larger gaps — as long as the sheets are attached solidly any gap can be filled later with setting-type joint compound.)

, If your local municipality requires an inspection before mudding your drywall, schedule the inspection. It's better to be put through the inconvenience of scheduling a walk-through than having to tear the whole thing down after you've taped and mudded your joints.

, Your basic objective on every coat is to continuously work toward a smooth, flat surface. On the first coat,


On inside corners: Keep one edge of your blade running firmly against the drywall on one side and lightly against the tape on the other side.
On butt joints: use the drywall as a guide for both edges, leaving a convex curve
On taper joints: same, only leaving a concave curve.

, You can buy a dry mix (just add water) or you can buy ready-mixed mud. Both come in different mixes, such as lightweight easy sand, quick setting, or standard grade.


The dry mix is cheaper, and you can make as little or as much as you need (providing you're clear on how much you can apply before it sets up). Use it to fill big holes and gaps. On larger surfaces it's generally harder to apply, harder to sand, not as smooth, more time consuming, and a bigger mess. However, it sets up chemically (setting times vary; look at the bag) and so will be ready to re-coat sooner.
The premixed mud is ready to go after remixing in the bucket, but costs a little more, and may be more than you need for a given job.

, As a rough estimate, figure about 1 gallon (3.7 liters) of mud for every 100 square feet of drywall.


There are several brands and grades of mud. Use the ""all purpose"" mud for your base (first) coat to seat or cover the tape, and lightweight mud for the final coat. You can also use what is called brown or topping mud; it's actually beige and dries to a very pale color, and has a more plastic texture than regular mud. It dries smoother, has less of a tendency to bubble, and is intended for the final top coat.
If there's a watery layer on the top of pre-mixed mud, mix at slow speed with a mixing paddle bit on a heavy duty 1/2"" (1.3) drill. Mix until the water is blended in and the compound is smooth (until you don't see any lumps going down the vortex of the whirlpool made by the mixer). Avoid mixing speeds that are too fast, as you make create air bubbles in the joint compound.

, Plastic knives have a tendency to get burrs on their edges over time, so check regularly to make sure they still have smooth edges. You will need a 5 or 6 inch (12.7 or 15.2 cm), a 10 inch (25.4 cm) and a 12 inch (30.5 cm) knife and perhaps a putty knife or two for tight spots. A drywall mud pan is also very helpful.


Slightly soften the sharp corners of all your knives if they are new.
Steel knives and pans can rust, so be sure to clean them well at the end of your work session and dry them thoroughly.

, Before you start, you may want to mix a little bit of water with the mud for the first coat. You want your first coat to be slightly wetter than subsequent coats. Shoot for just a little more watery than the consistency of sour cream. Using a 5 or 6-inch (12.7-15.2 cm) knife, place a couple inches of mud onto the blade.


Press a liberal amount of mud into the seam between the drywall boards. You're going to scrape away any excess mud later on, so don't worry about smoothing it out early on. For this layer, it's better to have too much than too little.
You only need to press hard enough to fill the seam and smooth the mud to the wall.
The tapered edge (long edge) on a sheet of drywall tapers from about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) to the edge, so you want to cover the entire six inches (15.2 cm) of drywall from edge of the taper on one sheet to the edge of the taper on the other.
Use a bright light held at an angle to better see the tapered area that must be covered.
When using the wide blades loaded with mud, it's best to place the loaded blade at a 45° angle to the wall. As you draw the mud and blade down the wall, sharpen the angle until the blade and the wall are nearly parallel.

, Get the joint ready to take the tape, but don't take off so much compound that the joint is completely dry and/or extremely thin. (Think of the first coat of mud as the glue that sticks the tape to the wall; as soon as it dries it's useless. And you have another project fixing it, probably after you think you're all done. So don't lay down more mud than you can cover with tape before it dries anywhere on the seam.)

, Cut it to the length of the seam, with a little extra on each end.


Some people recommend soaking the tape in water first. While this may make it a little easier to work with it greatly increases the mess and awkwardness of the tape when actually mudding.
On the other hand, soaking the tape will help keep air bubbles from forming under it, and save you the trouble of having to go over and over with mud which can lead to an uneven finished product.The choice is up to you.

, Press the tape into the freshly mudded joint with your hands, starting at one corner and working your way to another. Be sure the center of the tape is as even as possible with the seam between the drywall boards. The tape should be dimpled in the center so it's easier to find.

, Starting halfway down the joint, hold the knife at about a 25° angle and press the tape firmly into the compound. Pull the knife along the seam in one stroke, smoothing the tape as you go.


If your tape starts to buckle, pull it out from the end or simply flatten it out with your hand.
Repeat this step from the middle, going the other direction. Do this for all walls and ceiling.
Cut around bubbled tape. The tape won't adhere to the wall where the compound underneath is dry. Take a utility knife and cut the bubbled tape away completely and re-mud. (Bubbled tape will end up looking horrible later on.) Smooth out the divot left by the tape with fresh compound.

, With a 5-inch (12.7 cm) knife, cover at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) on either side of the seam with mud. Cut the tape the full length of the corner. Fold the tape in half along the dimpled center line. Press the paper into the corner, and seat with the knife.


Starting halfway down the joint, smooth one side of the crease with your knife, then the other. Repeat the process on the other half. Make sure the center is covered smoothly.
Cover one side of the corner tape with a thin layer of mud.
Try not to place too much pressure in the corner with your knife as you seat the tape on the compound. Even if you took the sharp corner off your knife you still risk cutting through the tape. The knife naturally rides into the corner; not much added pressure is needed.

, Corner bead will help increase the durability of the outside corner drywall, protecting it from bangs and bumps. Nail metal cornerbead to the outside corners every 10 inches (25.4 cm), being very careful to center the bead (or it will be nearly impossible to mud on the low side).


Using the 5-inch (12.7 cm) knife, apply a layer of mud down one side of the bead, smoothing it into the bead and the drywall. To get the right angle, place one side of the blade against the corner bead, and the other side of the blade against the drywall. Smooth the mud in as few strokes as possible. Repeat the process on the other side of the bead.
Alternately, you can apply joint compound and fit paper bead on top of the compound, as you would with tape on an inside corner. The process is pretty much the same: Instead of nailing the bead down and covering with compound, cover with compound first, fit the bead onto the corner, and then knife away any excess compound.

, Apply a small bit of compound over each screw or nail and knife away the excess with your smaller trowel. Be sure to cover any divot left by the sunken screw or nail, but try not to leave too much excess compound over the divot.

, Verify that all seams have been given a coat of mud and tape, then clean your tools, cover your mud, and kick it for the night.

, Damp mud will have a darker, grayish color, while dry mud will be white. Depending on geography and humidity, 6 to 8 hours should be sufficient to let the compound fully dry. In humid climates and cold weather, it can take 24 hours or more, so get some fans and heat going.

, Sanding will put a lot of fine white powder in the air, and it's stuff you don't want to be breathing. If you're working near furniture or the kitchen, or any other place you don't want a fine layer of gritty dust lingering, seal the entrances or exits to the room with sheets of plastic. A little prep work on this end will save a lot of cleanup work later.

, With your larger trowel, lightly knock off any small burrs or excess compound from the tape and screws. Simply scrape them away with a light scraping motion. This makes your sanding both easier and more effective in the end.

, Otherwise, sand the joints gently. Using medium-grit sandpaper on a pole sander, smooth the rough areas — paying particular attention to the edges of the compound — with gentle, even pressure. Don't sand through the mud into the tape or paper surface of the drywall, only the mud around it.


Unless your work is really rough, ignore the picture above and simply sand. A power sander will make a terrific suffocating dust storm, it will probably tear up the paper tape and the surface of the drywall, and the drywall dust will drastically shorten the life of the sander.
Sand corners with a block sander or corner sander. Be especially careful when sanding corner joints.

, Apply a thicker layer of compound to all joints and all screw heads. You're back to normal consistency for your second and subsequent coats; you don't want these coats to be as watery as the ones before.


Smooth over with a second pass. Apply the compound with downstrokes and then smooth over with horizontal strokes.
The goal for the second coat is to fill up the bevel of the drywall so if you were to take your drywall knife and place the edge on the seam at a 90° angle, you would see no gaps between the joint and knife.

, ""Feathering"" means smoothing the outer edges of the compound by increasing the amount of compound applied both above and below the joint.On corner joints, cover the other side of the corner tape (the side you left bare after the first coat) with a thin layer of mud, using the wall and the corner itself as guides.
On butt joints, fill the dish on either side of the tape, running one edge of the knife against the tape and feathering the other edge of the knife to the drywall.
As you apply successive layers of mud, your feather will grow each time.

, Again, give it sufficient time to dry before adding more layers of compound.

, Start by knocking off any lumps or burrs left by the last layer of compound. Then, use a fine-grit sandpaper, sanding the outer edges of the compound until smooth.

, When ready, apply the third coat, making the edges as smooth and blended into the wall as possible. Your goal with each successive layer of mud is to increase the size of the joint by adding more compound to the edges (feathering). This builds and strengthens the joint while blending it better into the rest of the drywall. Feathering helps make the joints less distinguishable.


When applying the third coat, repeat the same process, only switch from a medium-sized trowel over to a larger trowel. A 12"" (30.5 cm) compound knife makes feathering a whole lot easier than a 6"" (15.2) knife, essentially cutting your time in half.
Let dry overnight. Sand again, making sure that all surfaces are smooth, and that the mud is seamlessly blended into the drywall.
Where the light shines across (or down) the wall or ceiling (or where the first coat went on too thick) the butt joints will probably have to be spread out farther with a fourth coat.

, Taping and mudding are just the beginning if you want to fix up your drywall or if you're installing entirely new drywall. Finishing the drywall gets the drywall ready to be primed and painted.

, If you want your drywall to have a studded, stubbly, or stucco pattern, or if you just wanted to shape geometric designs into your drywall, that's definitely something you can do. Learn how to do it here.

, In order to paint a beautiful coat over your drywall, you'll want to prime it first. An oft-overlooked step, but absolutely necessary!

, Drywall comes in a variety of sizes, types and widths. Typically, walls are covered in 1⁄2 or 5⁄8 inch (1.3 or 1.6 cm) thick drywall board bought in 4x8 or 4x12 foot sheets. There are also many different specialty products on the market such as ""green board"" which is a moisture resistant drywall with a green paper covering, used in damp areas such as bathrooms and kitchens. Ceiling boards called ""CV"" boards that are more resistant to sagging, and sheets that are larger than standard to cover longer or wider surfaces.


Ceilings and walls are generally faced with 1/2-inch (1.3 cm) drywall sheets. In ceilings you usually use ""CV"" rated or ceiling boards. There are also lightweight boards available for this purpose.
In some instances you may be required to place 5/8-inch (1.6 cm) drywall on your ceilings or outside walls, 5/8-inch (1.6 cm) drywall may be classified as ""Fire-rated"" or TypeX drywall and stands up to fires longer than traditional 1/2-inch (1.3) drywall does. In some municipalities you can double your drywall in fire risk areas, rather than buy more expensive thicker sheets.
The thicker 5/8-inch (1.6 cm) drywall is also useful for sound reduction because of its greater mass. Recording studios sometimes do a double layer of 5/8-inch (1.6 cm) drywall.

, Drywall should not be used for tub surroundings or showers. The correct material would be cement board with an 6 mil vapor barrier as well as the correct R-value of insulation behind it.


Be sure to use either sheathing tape (Venture, 3M, or Tuck Tape) or acoustic sealant on vapor barrier joints to ensure a proper vapor seal. The seams of the cement board need to be finished with a fiberglass mesh tape which is then covered with a ""setting type"" joint compound or ""thin set"" tile adhesive.
Check your local planning department and municipal building codes for drywall rules and regulations in your area.

, Drywall looks thin and light—until you lift it! It's one thing to manage drywall on the ground—moving, cutting, and lifting it. It's quite another to attach a sheet of drywall to the ceiling.


A drywall lift can be made using 2 x 4s nailed into a T-shape that is placed under the dry wall to hold it against the ceiling as you place a few screws into the panel to secure it. However, if you are installing drywall on your own, or don't think you have the upper body strength to manipulate the drywall, a lift is well worth considering renting.

Assess the size of the hole.,
Choose the correct spackle.,
Cut any loose or hanging pieces from the hole with a utility knife, or any sharp tool.,
Choose a spackle knife of an appropriate size: slightly larger than the hole.,
Stir the spackle, especially if you are using a previously opened spackle tub.

,
Press the loaded side of the spackling tool into the wall about a half-inch (20 to 30 mm) above the hole.

,
Press hard, and using a smooth stroke pull the knife down over the hole.,
If the spackle begins to sag, leave this coat to dry in the current state and come back later for a second coat.,
If needed, apply a second coat only after the spackle is fully dry.

,
Make the spackle as flush as possible, but remember that spackle shrinks.,
Smooth the spackle down with very fine grade sandpaper or use a damp sponge to smooth out the surface until it is flush with the wall.

,
Small holes do not need primer, but larger holes should be primed to seal the spackle and prevent it from absorbing too much of your top coat paint.

",How to Repair Holes in Drywall With Spackle," Spackle repairs holes up to the size of a hand or so, but any hole larger than the size of a fist will require the use of a support of some kind, unless they happen to have support behind the wallboard already.;
, One way to classify spackle is by weight: the smaller the hole, the lighter the spackle you will need.

, Don’t make the hole any bigger than you have to, but do make sure to remove any crumbling or unsupported wallboard gypsum.

, If you are unsure, use a larger one.

,,, Usually, pulling over the hole at a slight angle works best.

, It is better to give a hole several thinner coats than one thick one.

,, Do not be afraid to leave a slight mound (perhaps an eighth of an inch) above the hole.

Get a ready-made drywall patch.,
Clean up the edges of the hole.,
Cut or shape the patch carefully to fit the hole.,

Apply the patch to the wall and smooth the taped edges with your putty knife.,
Use a wide-blade putty knife to spread a thin topcoat of joint compound (sometimes called ""mud"") over the area surrounding the repair.,
Apply a liberal amount of non-shrink joint compound with a putty knife.,
Smooth the compound with the putty knife.,
Let the patched area dry thoroughly before applying additional coats or sanding.

,
Once the compound is dry, lightly sand the area smooth using drywall sandpaper attached to a drywall sander.,
Hide minor imperfections with an ultra-thin topcoat of joint compound.",How to Repair Holes in Drywall1," These are available at big-box home centers and hardware stores. They use a peel-and-stick, metal-backed patch for added strength.


If the hole was caused by a door knob or another object hitting the wall, a patch may hide the hole but it is not strong enough to hold up to another impact. Patching with a new piece of drywall will be a better solution.;
, Trim away frayed edges with a utility knife and press back into place any small chunks still hanging by a flap.

, Make sure to leave extra backing all around the patch to attach to the drywall surrounding the hole.

, To clean greasy areas (as in a kitchen), use trisodium phosphate (""TSP""), which can be found at most paint centers. Warm, soapy water can do the job, too, but don't let the drywall get too wet.

, This will remove air bubbles.

, The aim is to create a smooth transition between the patch backing and the surrounding wall. Because the patch backing lies on top of the existing drywall, there can be an unattractive layered look to your work if you don't do something to disguise it. Therefore you must learn to apply compound around the patch in such a way that the patch backing is ""feathered"" gradually into the rest of the wall. With practice, you'll learn the technique of making this transition smoothly. It will often require more than one coat of mud.


Example: If repairing a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.5-cm) hole, you will want to use a 10-inch (24 cm) putty knife to apply a skim coat of joint compound as a final topcoat. Remember to ""screed"" (gently scrape) the mud in one smooth, final stroke.

, Wider putty knives will produce smoother results.

, Pull the blade toward you in one steady, smooth motion, letting the knife make a 30-degree angle with the wall. If your finish doesn't look smooth, simply wipe off the blade, wet it and scrape the wall again. Make the mud as smooth as you can, but don't worry if it's not perfect. You will be able to sand the compound later when it's dry (although this can create a bit of a mess, so it's best to leave it as smooth as possible before it dries).

,, (Regular sandpaper will work, just not as well.) If there are large blobs or strips, shave these off with the putty knife first. You want to create as little dust as possible.

, Apply this topcoat over pin holes or hairline cracks as if you were trying to scrape it all off with your knife without leaving any behind. With experience, this step can often be accomplished without additional sanding.

,, Paper tape can be used as well, but it is not self adhesive and mud must be applied to the wall first, pressing the paper tape into the mud. Most 'beginners' find that the self-adhesive mesh tape is easier to use.

, Be sure that compound selected is ""sandable"", as some off the shelf repair compounds dry very hard (water putty etc).

,, If the mesh or paper tape begins to show, stop sanding. It's time for the next coat.

, On a wall with little to no texture, feather mud out wide of the repair area to minimize the visibility of the patch.

, Some textures can be added with more mud and a putty knife, others need to be sprayed on. For sprayed texture check your local home center or hardware store for a small can designed to match your texture (e.g. orange peel or knockdown textures).

, A can of spray paint primer (Zinsser or Bulls Eye) or other primer can be used if you don't have PVA primer (sheet rock primer)

Hide minor imperfections with an ultra-thin topcoat of compound.",How to Repair Holes in Drywall2," Trim away frayed edges with a utility knife and press back into place any small drywall chunks still hanging by a flap.

, This will help the joint compound to stick, if using regular joint compound. This step may be skipped if you're using a non-water-based joint compound containing acrylics, polymer fibers, or other similar non-water-based ingredients.


To clean greasy repair areas (as in a kitchen), use trisodium phosphate or TSP, which can be found at all paint centers.

, Wider putty knife blades will produce smoother results.

, Pull the blade toward you in one steady, smooth motion. Have the blade form about a 30-degree angle with the wallboard. If your finish doesn't look smooth, simply wipe off the putty knife, re-wet it and smooth the mud again, always pulling the blade toward you. Don't bother trying for a perfect finish, as you will have ample opportunity to sand the finish once the compound has dried.


If you're working on a hole requiring several layers of mud, applying a number of thin coats is better than one thick one. That will prevent bubbling and cracking during the drying process. However, this also requires additional drying time in between coats. If you don't have that much time, purchase a quick-drying product (like ""Hot Mud"") that can be mixed in small, workable quantities that will dry in less than 30 minutes.

, Never apply a second layer of joint compound if the first has not thoroughly dried.

, If there are large blobs or strips, shave these off with the putty knife first.

, Apply this topcoat over pin holes or hairline cracks as if you were trying to scrape it off without leaving any behind. This step can often be accomplished without additional sanding.

Outline the damaged area with a framing or carpenter's square.,
Use a drywall knife, jabsaw (keyhole saw), or utility knife to cut away the damaged section of drywall.,
Cut the patch from a new piece of drywall.,
On the back of the drywall filler piece, outline the actual size of the hole in the wall.,
Very carefully remove all the plaster material from the back-edge strips of your filler piece.,
Place the filler piece of drywall inside the hole.,
Lift the edges of the overlapping paper and be sure to get a good coat of drywall compound under all overlapping paper.,
Lightly sand the area smooth using fine sandpaper.,
Apply additional coats of compound if necessary, lightly sanding or damp-wiping after each coat.

",How to Repair Holes in Drywall3," Use a pencil to draw a square or rectangle on the drywall around the hole.

, Drawing a straight-sided shape will make it easier to fashion a replacement piece.

, This should measure about 3 inches (7-8 cm) larger than your hole in each direction.

, Make sure to center this outline in the filler piece so as to mark off all four edges.

, This will leave a 3-inch (7.5 cm) paper overhang on all four sides of the front of the filler piece of drywall.

, It should fit perfectly, leaving a few inches of overlapping paper on all sides.

, Immediately press these paper edges down onto the wet drywall compound using a drywall knife, as if you were applying tape, and the drywall compound is the adhesive. Cover the patch with drywall compound and smooth with a wide-blade drywall knife. Let the patched area dry before continuing.

, When you’re done, wipe the area with a damp sponge to eliminate the dust normally caused by dry sanding.

Find a piece of drywall that is at least 2"" bigger on all 4 sides that is the same thickness of the existing drywall (max size 12"").,
Cut out the damaged area of the existing drywall to a perfect square, even on all sides.,
Measure the size of the hole .,
Once the measurements have been applied cut from edge to edge of the drywall so that you have a square in the middle and a 2"" perimeter around the square (the back should look like a number sign ""#"").

,
Gently break the outer 2"" area of the gypsum (the white powder substance in between the 2 pieces of paper that make up drywall) and the brown paper off.,
Take some pre-mixed lite drywall compound and put it in a small pail and mix about 1/8 of water into compound and stir till the consistency is like pancake batter.,
Apply the mud onto the brown side of your patch, 2"" strip that is around your square patch and around the hole on the wall.

,
Take your patch and place it in the hole so that the piece drywall is level with your existing wall with lots of mud in between the patch and wall.

,
Take your 5"" drywall mud knife and remove all excess mud.,
Put a coat of mud (about 1/8"" thick) on the entire perimeter of the drywall patch, making sure that all of the paper portion of the 2"" strip is coated.,
Lightly sand and apply a final coat.,
Final sand happens in 2 days from start to finish and after painting is complete it is worth the effort.",How to Repair Larger Holes in Drywall,";
, Be sure that you remove all damaged drywall!

, Doing this means that later you can just cut and transfer the measurements onto the backside or brown side of the piece of drywall that you are going to use, making sure that there is that 2"" perimeter around the square.

,, Clean the excess, being careful not to damage the white side of paper on the drywall. After doing this you should have a square the same size as your hole with a 2"" border of just the paper from the drywall left over.


Be sure that the patch fits in the hole before proceeding to the next step if it is too small that is acceptable, if it is too big trim the brown side of the patch to match the hole.

, The amount is dependent on the size of hole, use the idea that you can always mix more or if you mix it right you can use it on other projects.

,,, By doing so you will make the patch stick to the wall by removing the excess mud. (Note: You will know that you are done when the patch is level with the wall.)

, Let dry overnight.

, This is where you take your time and make sure that you don't have too much sanding.

, One term for this is a California Patch.

, Center it so it extends behind your existing drywall by about 2 inches (5 cm) at each edge.

, Use 1-1/4-inch (3.2 cm) drywall screws. You can use a screwdriver, a screw gun or a drill. Countersink the screws (driving them below the wall surface) to make them invisible once they’re covered with mud.

, Be sure the new piece is no thicker than your existing drywall. Affix it by screwing it to the backer piece.

,, Let the patched area dry before continuing.

, To cut down on the dust that sanding causes, you can simply wipe the dried mud with a damp (not soaked) cloth. This will usually work as well as sanding. (However, note the warning below regarding damp-wiping.)

Texture if necessary to match the area.,
Apply two coats of primer to the repaired area.,
Paint once the primer has adequately dried.",How to Repair Holes in Drywall5," If you are unsure what texture you have, look up images: orange peel, knockdown, and popcorn online. Spray texture for orange peel is available in small aerosol cans at your paint center. Some manufacturers include an adjustable nozzle to help you match the desired look and thickness. Test on a scrap piece of drywall to develop your spraying technique, as this can be tricky to get it right. Don’t hold the can too close to the repair area or it may begin to look clumpy.


Soak the can in warm water for several minutes and then shake well for easier application.
To produce a ""knockdown"" effect, use your finger to apply little blobs of wet all purpose drywall compound in random shapes and patterns trying to match the existing pattern as close as possible. Let the blobs dry for about 10 minutes before lightly dragging a wide drywall blade over the slightly wet blobs. Never attempt to use a spray can for this type of texture, you won't be happy with the results. Note: The correct way to apply this texture is with a professional texture sprayer, available for rent at big box supply store. However you can get pretty close with the finger method. Wait 24 hours before applying paint or primer.

, One coat probably won’t be sufficient, as joint compound tends to soak up paint and create an unfinished look. Apply both primer and paint with a roller if at all possible, since paint brushes may leave brush marks. Home centers have small foam rollers for such repair work that are cheaper and easier to clean than larger rollers.

, This may only take a few hours, but it’s preferable to wait overnight.

Keep the room well ventilated.,
Protect the surrounding area.,
Choose a cleaning agent.,
Add the cleaning solution to a spray bottle.,
Spray a small amount of the solution onto the mold.,
Scrub the area with an old toothbrush.,
Dry the area out.,
Apply a stain-blocking paint.",How to Remove Mold from Drywall1," To remove mold, you may need to work with chemical cleaners. Many of these cleaners can be harmful if inhaled and, as a result, you should keep the doors and windows open as you work. Never direct a fan of any kind into the room or you will absolutely spread the spores everywhere! A fan may be placed in windows facing outward to push bad air outdoors. You should seal off doors with plastic to avoid spreading the mold spores in other areas of the house.;
, To prevent potential damage that could result if you accidentally spill chemicals or cleaners, protect anything that you do not plan on working with directly. Remove furniture and decorations to the other side of the room or out of the room completely. Cover the floor with newsprint or plastic drop cloth and tape the coverings taped in place. Keep an old rag on hand to catch any spills as you notice them.

, Cleaning agents range from mild to potent and include both natural and chemical alternatives. If you have small children or pets in your home, you may want to consider a milder, natural solution over a powerful chemical one. If you have a more advanced mold problem, a stronger chemical may be necessary.


Combine one part baking soda with five parts water. Baking soda is the mildest, safest cleanser available that is commonly used against mold.
Use straight vinegar or vinegar mixed in equal parts with water. Vinegar is a little stronger than baking soda but it is still natural and safe to use around children and pets.
Try an unscented detergent. Since one of the easiest ways to identify the presence of mold is by smell, using an unscented detergent guarantees that no other smells will interfere with your ability to detect the smell of mold. Detergents are still relatively safe to use around kids and pets even though they are a chemical product. Combine the detergent with a small amount of water.
Use bleach.Some sources recommend the use of bleach while others do not. Objections to bleach are primarily due to how harsh it is and how potentially harmful it can be to breathe in. Some also believe that its effectiveness is not reliably consistent. Nonetheless, it still remains one of the strongest cleaners effective against bleach and safe for painted drywall. Mix one part bleach with three parts water.

, Pour the cleansing agent and water into a spray bottle and shake to combine. Make sure that the solution is thoroughly combined to ensure effectiveness.

, Do not drench the area, since additional moisture can actually increase the mold problem rather than getting rid of it. Spray to mold once or twice over, making sure that each area has been covered with the solution but without using so much solution that it begins dripping off.

, A dish sponge with an abrasive side can also work. Scrub the area until you no longer see any discoloration or visible mold.

, Since mold can start developing if you leave the area moist, point an electric fan on the spot to help it dry out faster.

, If some mild staining still exists even after you have removed the mold, use a stain-blocking primer and paint to mask it.

If your mold spot has appeared by a door or window, while the inner wall is open have someone spray water on the door or window with a hose and monitor for any moisture coming in.,
Before replacing the drywall, it is recommended to paint the interior wall cavity with an elastomeric paint like Kilz, and also paint the backside of the drywall you are replacing.,
Fit the new piece of drywall in the hole.,
Secure the new section of drywall.,
Apply joint compound.,
Smooth the joint compound after it dries.,
Vacuum the entire area with a HEPA vacuum.",How to Remove Mold from Drywall2," As you work, mold spores could break free from the drywall. To prevent them from finding their way into the flooring, cover the flooring and anything in the surrounding area with plastic sheeting. Tape the sheeting in place.

, Use a pencil to lightly draw a box around every area with visible mold. The area should be larger than the stain itself and should span an area that extends over at least two wooden wall beams behind the drywall. Removing more wall than necessary will increase your odds of removing unseen mold spores and will also make it possible to replace the section of drywall.

, Saw along the line with your knife, pointing it out and away from you as you work. When the patch of drywall comes free, carefully remove it and set it down, mold-side up, on the plastic.

, Mold spores may have been stirred up during the process, but using a HEPA vacuum should remove them.

, Sometimes it can take 5 minutes of spraying with water before any leak will show itself. Once located, seal from both the outside and inside to prevent moisture coming in (again mold is only caused where there is moisture).

, Cut a new section of drywall. Use a tape measure to measure the hole and, using a utility knife, cut a piece of fresh drywall that fits the exact same measurements.

, It should be a tight, snug fit.

, Use drywall screws and a screwdriver to attach the drywall to the wooden beams in the wall behind it.

, Joint compound, also called drywall compound, should be applied to the perimeter of the new section of drywall to help join it with the rest of the wall and to seal any cracks in between the sections.

, After 24 hours have passed, you can use sandpaper or a gentle sander to smooth the dried joint compound out.

, Mold spores could have landed on surrounding wall or flooring, even with the plastic coverings in place. Remove as much as possible with a HEPA vacuum.

Plastic covers or tarps
Painter’s tape
Scoring tool
Chemical wallpaper stripper
Wallpaper removing fabric sheets
Compression sprayer or spray bottle
Sponge
Bucket
Hot water
Ladder or chair
Scraper;
, You can't take wallpaper off the walls if they're full of pictures and decorations, so you need to remove it all. This includes anything that’s attached to the wall, such as:Pictures
Furniture
Sconces and lights
Televisions
Mounts
Switch plates
Vents
Hardware like screws and nails

, Removing wallpaper is messy business, and the best way to protect furniture, rugs, and other décor is by removing it from the room before you start. Take out beds, sofas, chairs, shelves, decorations, area rugs, and everything else that’s in the room. Store them in another room until the wallpaper has been removed and the room redecorated.If you cannot remove certain objects, move them to the center of the room to protect them and to give yourself more room to work.

, Once you’ve removed everything you can from the room, cover whatever remains with tarps or plastic sheets. Cover the floors completely to protect carpet, tile, and hardwood. Tape the edges of the plastic sheets to the baseboards so water and paste don’t leak onto the floor or soak the baseboards.If there's any furniture left in the center of the room, cover it with plastic as well.

, The type of wallpaper that’s on the walls will determine how much effort you have to put into removing it. Newer wallpaper is called strippable wallpaper, because you can strip it off with your hands and a scraper without adding water or stripping chemicals. No matter what kind of wallpaper you have, begin by tearing off all the loose pieces you can.If you have strippable wallpaper, you'll be able to remove all the wallpaper without chemical strippers. Continue stripping and dry scraping the paper to remove the majority of it. Loosen the corners with a putty knife or scraper, and then peel off the paper at a 15-degree angle. Use a damp sponge to moisten any leftover paper, and use a scraper to remove the rest of it.
If you have peelable wallpaper, you'll be able to remove the top layer of paper easily, and the backing will stay behind on the wall. You'll remove this backing later with water and chemical stripper.

, With the wallpaper scoring tool, carefully go over all the wallpaper surfaces that you want to remove. This will punch small holes in the wallpaper or backing. Don’t press too hard, because the scorer can damage the drywall underneath.


It’s important to score the wallpaper or the backing because this will give the chemical stripper access to the paste underneath. Once the paste is soaked with the stripper, the wallpaper will come off easily.
Use course sandpaper to rough up the surface of the wallpaper or backing if you don’t have a scoring tool., Fill a bucket with hot water and soak the wallpaper removing sheets to saturate them. This will allow them to stick to the walls, and will start to loosen the glue under the paper or the backing.


If you're using a powdered chemical stripper that gets mixed with water, you can also soak the sheets in the chemical stripping solution instead of plain water.
Wallpaper strippers can come as a premixed liquid, a liquid concentrate, or a powder. If you have a powder or liquid concentrate, place the stripping chemical in a bucket and mix it with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
When working with harsh chemicals, consider wearing gloves and protective eyewear. Always work in a well-ventilated room.

, Remove the sheets from the bucket and place them on the wall one at a time. Gently wring out each sheet to remove excess water. Place the sheets on the wall vertically, starting at one of the corners. Don’t overlap the sheets, but make sure the edges are touching to ensure there are no areas of exposed paper between them.


It’s important to use the wallpaper removing sheets when using chemical strippers to remove wallpaper from drywall, because the sheets will protect the drywall from excess moisture and water damage.You'll probably only have enough sheets to cover a portion of the wall, so you'll have to work in sections until all the wallpaper has been removed.

, Once you’ve installed all the sheets on the wall, spray them down with an even layer of chemical stripper. For both ready-made and unmixed solutions, you can either use a spray bottle to soak the sheets, or transfer the mixture to a compression sprayer for faster application.


Leave the sheets to soak on the walls for about 30 minutes. While you normally wouldn’t want to let drywall soak for more than 15, the sheets will stop it from getting too wet.As the wallpaper soaks, the chemical solution will soak in through the holes you poked in the paper or backing and dissolve the glue underneath.

, Starting in the same corner at the top of the wall, grab the first sheet and the wallpaper underneath and gently peel the two away from the wall. It’s ok if more than one sheet’s worth of wallpaper comes off at a time.


Repeat the peeling steps until all the sheets have been removed.
When you remove a sheet from the wall, separate the sheet from the wallpaper and discard the wallpaper. Place the sheet back into the solution to soak again so that you can reuse it on a new section of wallpaper.
If you still have more wallpaper to remove, remove the sheets from the solution and repeat the removal steps.

, Use a scraper or putty knife to gently scrape away any leftover paper or paste from the wall. To avoid damaging the drywall, carefully slide the scraper between the paper and the drywall and lift the excess wallpaper off.As you work, remove as much glue with the scraper as possible as well.
Be careful with the sharp corners of the scraper, as they can poke holes in the damp drywall.

, Fill a clean bucket with hot water. Soak a sponge or rag in the water and go over every inch of the wall to rinse and wipe away excess glue. When you shine a light on the wall, dark spots indicate that there's still glue left there.


As you work, rinse and wring out your sponge frequently, changing the water as necessary. Continue wiping down sections of the wall until all the glue has been removed., Let the walls dry out for at least 24 hours before you do anything else. This will give the drywall time to fully dry out. Make sure there are no wet spots or dark patches on the drywall before you start patching or redecorating.

, The wallpaper may have been covering dents and dings, or there may be holes or gouges in the drywall from the removal process. Fill these with spackle before repainting or re-wallpapering.Place a small amount of spackle on a putty knife, and use the knife to press the spackle into the hole. Smooth out the spackle with the putty knife and leave it to dry.
For larger holes, use joint compound instead, and apply it with a trowel.

, This is the final touch that will ensure you have a perfectly clean and smooth surface for new paint or wallpaper to stick to. When the spackle or joint compound has dried fully, go over the entire surface of the wall with 120-grit sandpaper.Spackle generally takes a few hours to dry, while joint compound takes about 24. Check the manufacturer’s instructions about drying time before you sand the walls.
Consider wearing protective eyewear and a mask to prevent dust from getting in your eyes, nose, mouth, and lungs.

, To remove all traces of dust and dirt from the walls from sanding, vacuum the walls. Then go over the walls with a slightly damp cloth. Allow the walls to completely dry before priming, painting, or putting up new wallpaper.


Once you’ve sanded and wiped the walls, you can remove all the protective plastic from the room. You can also leave it in place if you plan to paint.

Remove the drywall nails left on the studs.",How to Remove Drywall," If you want to remove drywall, it's very important that you shut off any utilities in the area of the house that you're working on. Water and electricity should be shut off at the source before you start working on the drywall.;
, Any time you're going to start digging around in a wall, it's important to use a stud-finder and find out exactly what you're messing around with. Most modern stud-finders will come with pipe and electrical settings, meaning that you can use it to identify and locate any fixtures that might be built into the wall, to make sure you can avoid them successfully.


Mark areas with studs or fixtures with tape and work carefully around them, working toward the sensitive spots.
If you don't have a stud finder, go around the room carefully knocking on the wall. Hollow sounding spots should be unobstructed drywall, but harder knocking spots will have studs and possibly piping throughout. Use caution in those areas, slowing working in that direction.

, Usually baseboards and ceiling moldings must be removed first, before you can access the drywall and begin removing it. This is done with a flat bar or other prying tool. Both types of moldings are usually affixed with nails, and should be pried from the walls slowly, working from nail to nail. Do the same thing with any molding or trim around windows and doors before you access the drywall.


Use a utility knife to score the seam between moldings and drywall. The seam is typically filled with paint, caulk, or some combination of adhesive. If you want to reuse the molding, score the drywall edge of the seams to help fracture the wall where the molding and drywall surface will split.

, Make sure the power is off on these circuits, then carefully remove the trim from around any electrical devices in the area, including wall switches, receptacles, and thermostats. The drywall is usually fit around the device boxes underneath these covers so they won't be damaged when removing the drywall.

, Depending on the age of the house you're working in, the drywall will either be nailed or screwed into the studs. To remove drywall that's nailed in, you'll simply start prying up the sections of drywall, piece by piece. If, on the other hand, the drywall is screwed in, you might need to take a bit more time to remove the screws before you start prying it loose. Screws that are bedded in joint compound can be very difficult to locate and remove.


Drywall screws can sometimes be removed with a Philips-head screwdriver, but depending on the condition of the wall, this may be more hassle than it's worth. Look at the screws and the condition of the drywall itself. If they're easy to remove, go ahead and remove them. It'll mean less elbow grease down the road.
If the drywall is wet, or if the screws are mangled, rusted, or otherwise difficult to remove, go ahead and start prying the drywall loose as if they were simply nailed in.

, Standard drywall installation is done using 4x8 ft panels. Those are usually mounted horizontally with staggered joints, with two sections used to cover a standard 8 feet (2.4 m). section of wall. These will be fastened into the vertical wooden studs, centered at 16 or 24 inch (40.6 or 61.0 cm) intervals.


For unsoiled drywall, use a pry bar to begin prying the bottom of the panel away from these studs, allowing removal of the entire sheet. Pushing the short end of the flat bar up under the bottom of the panel allows for using the long end as a lever, making the initial prying easy.

, Identify a section of wall roughly 2 feet (0.6 m) above the ground and 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the end of the wall, making note to avoid electrical outlets. Using a hammer claw, make a foot long vertical series of holes.


Basically, what you want to do is open up some space to grab hold of the drywall and pull it loose. It's not rocket-science: knock some holes in at the side and give yourself something to hang onto.

, Grab at the upper and lower holes you've cut and pull a large chunk of drywall off the nails on the nearby stud. Keep moving along the wall, pulling chunks loose as you go. When the drywall breaks on a stud, make another vertical hole in adjacent gap and continue removing the drywall by hand.

, For water-damaged drywall, a good strategy is to open a hole at the midpoint of the 14.5 inch (36.8 cm) space between studs. Using a sledge or a battering ram of some kind can usually be effective in this circumstance.


If the water-damage extends to the upper panel, the same action will usually cleanly separate the wall from the ceiling.

, Use the flatbar to pry loose any nails remaining on the studs, or take care to unscrew the screws remaining in the wood. A pry bar or a hammer claw should be fine for the job.

Protect yourself.",How to Sand Drywall1," When you sand drywall, you are going to get powder everywhere. If you've ever had a flour accident in the kitchen, then you know exactly how much mess fine powder can cause. You don't want to be cleaning that up from all over the room and the rest of your house, so start by putting drop cloths on the floor. Then you want have to sweep or vacuum for days to get all the dust up., The simplest way to add some ventilation is to crack your windows.For better ventilation, put box fans in the windows facing outward to blow some of that dust away from you.Keep in mind, though, that screens will become clogged with dust, so you may want to take them off both doors and windows.

, While you want air movement, you don't want air flow from the drywall room to other rooms, as that will spread the dust around. Turning the air movement off will help keep the dust contained., While shutting off the air will help a great deal, it's also a good idea to block off the return vents. Cover them with plastic and tape around the edges. That way, drywall dust won't be able to sift into the vent, which would spread it around your house., It's best to move furniture out of the room if at all possible. However, if you can't move it or even if it's just nearby the entrance to the room, throw a drop cloth over it. Covering it will be much easier than trying to clean dust out of it., Put on glasses or goggles to protect your eyes. Gritty eyes are no fun for anyone! Also, your lungs will thank you if you wear a respirator or dusk mask. Look to see if it's rated for drywall. If it's not, that means the particles can still get through, which defeats the purpose.If you can't get as much ventilation in the room as you should, you'll need to change out your mask every hour. Just set an alarm on your phone to remind yourself so you don't come out of your work-induced stupor 3 hours later.
If you don't want to spend days showering, you might throw some protection over your hair, such as a scarf, hat, or even a shower cap."

",How to Paint Sheetrock,"


Sanding down sheetrock produces thousands of small particles that must be removed before applying paint. Use a vacuum with a brush extension and go over the sheetrock until it is clean. You can also use a micro-fiber cloth and rub the sheetrock down to remove particles.;
,


The sheetrock needs to be an even surface before you can begin painting. Fill holes and cracks with joint compound. Nails, screws, and other protrusions can either be covered over with joint compound or temporarily covered with masking tape.

,


Your primer will seal the sheetrock from water, cover over all irregularities in the surface, and provide a coat for the paint to adhere to. Polyvinyl acetate (PVA) is designed specifically for sheetrock. Latex paint is also an effective primer.
Choose a primer that roughly matches the color of your final coat of paint. Approximating the color is fine. If you are using light paint for your second coat, be sure not to use a dark color for your primer.

,


Dip the roller into a pan filled with the primer. Roll the primer onto the sheetrock in ""M"" or ""W"" designs so that the roller is constantly in motion; go back over these designs to fill in the gaps. You should create an even coat over the sheetrock so that no roller marks are evident.

,, Clean the dust off with a vacuum or micro-fiber cloth.

,


Use the same technique that you used with the primer. Apply a thick coat of paint to hide any imperfections in the sheetrock.

Set up a back light.,
Look for even color to ensure the drywall is dry.,
Set up a stepladder or stool.",How to Sand Drywall2," Shining a light along the edge of the wall helps you see all the ridges and dips. It's sort of like how a makeup mirror can highlight all the imperfections on your face. Some people hold a light with a cord and move it as they go, but you can also just use a lamp and direct the light along the area you're working on.You can also do all your light work first by moving around the room and shining it on different areas. You can mark points as ""high,"" ""fill,"" or ""even"" with a pencil. That way, you already know what you need to sand as you go around the room.You can also just feel for rough edges, but you're more likely to miss spots., You don't want to sand wet drywall. That's a little like trying to sand wet sand. You will get nowhere fast. Darker areas mean that it's still wet in places. If it looks even in color across the wall, you're probably good to go., You'll need to move from top to bottom. That way, the dust falls down on places you haven't done yet, rather than places you've already done. So you'll need to use a stepladder to get to the places you can't reach."

Scrape off the extra bits of mud/compound.,
Taper with the sanding sponge.,
Go over screws.,
Sand the seams.,
Use light pressure.,
Run over it with a dry paintbrush.,
Clean up carefully with a Shopvac.",How to Sand Drywall3," Sandpaper won't work as well on the places where the compound has pilled up a bit, so start with your drywall knife. Just run it along where you have larger bits of compound built up, scraping them up as you go.Go around the whole room first with the knife before working on sanding.

, Start in the corner where two walls meet. Sand outward so that you taper the mud down to the wall. In other words, sand along the corner in broad strokes, then slowly move those strokes outward toward the edge of the mud.You can also try wet sanding, which cuts down on dust. Dip a sanding block in warm water and wring it out thoroughly before using it on the wall. Rinse your sponge out when it becomes coated in white goo., You can use either the sanding sponge or the full sandpaper to go over the areas with screws and even them out. These areas usually only need a quick sanding., You'll also have seams along the wall where pieces of the drywall meet. Go over it with sandpaper (150 grit) first to quickly even it out. Swipe back and forth over it in broad strokes. Smooth it out again with your sanding sponge.Keep checking with the light to see if you miss areas.

, You don't need to send very hard. You're not scraping burnt rice off the bottom of a pan. You just want to smooth out any ridges and bumps in the dry wall, so you have an even surface. Don't sand down to the paper.Also, make sure you're only sanding the high parts. You'll fill in the low points with another coat of mud. You don't need to try to sand them smooth., If you notice there's dust on the wall from your sanding, you can use a dry paintbrush on it. Quickly run the brush over it to loosen up the dust, so it doesn't get into your primer when you start painting., Clean up the area by vacuuming as much as you can with a Shopvac then folding the dropcloths to take outside. Make sure you use the proper filters and bags for drywall when preparing the Shopvac. Otherwise, the dust will just come out of the back. If you're renting at a shop, ask what supplies you'll need for cleaning up drywall."

Before painting, use a ""stain-blocker"" primer/sealer paint suitable for use under your finished coat.",How to Remove Mildew from Sheetrock," If it is a wall or roof leak, patch or repair it. If it is simply condensation, like moisture in a bathroom or shower, you may need a ventilation to remove humidity from the room.;
,, This can be the type used for misting plants, or a used cleaning product bottle which has been thoroughly rinsed.

,,,,, If the area is going to be exposed to high humidity or moisture often, use an oil based alkyd enamel with a gloss finish. This paint is more mildew and moisture resistant than most latex paints.

Take your measuring tape and measure a square perimeter around the hole of 4""x 4"", then draw out the lines around this.,
Get a piece of sheetrock that measures the same thickness as your wall sheetrock (Most walls have 1/2 inch sheetrock installed).,
Cut the whole 6x6 section from edge to edge.,
Carefully break off the rock by bending with your hands.,
Check your fit with the 4x4 hole in the wall.,
Patch the drywall.,
Slide the 4x4 into the 4x4 hole, keeping it even with the wall by not pressing in too far.,
Carefully draw out any bubbles around the edges of the excess paper, bringing it tight and flush with the wall.,
Apply a small amount of the compound around the edges of the paper, making up the difference of the thickness of the paper to the wall.",How to Patch Drywall Without Taping," Once you have a 4x4 square drawn out around the hole, cut this out carefully. (Do this only if you have a small hole measuring about 2""x3"").;
, Cut out a piece of sheetrock measuring 6""x 6"".


With this piece of sheetrock (6x6) turn it over so the back of the s-rock is ""up"" and measure out the dimensions of 4x4 on the back side. Draw this out with a pencil, and then use a utility knife to carefully cut the back out without going all the way through to the front paper.







, Score the back somewhat deep, and leave the square in the center. You should now have the full 6x6 section with the rear scored out.

, The Sheetrock will try to stay sealed to the front of the paper, but will come off if you peel it. Do this to each edge, and when done, you should have what appears to be a full 6x6 section of S-rock on front. However. when turned over, it will have a 4x4 section of S-rock in the center, with 6x6 inches of paper on the front.

, You want it to fit tight. Shave any imperfections for that perfect fit.

, Wet the edges of the excess paper on your patch, and the edges of the sheetrock on both the patch and the wall hole, (this will help it bond later). Apply a very small amount of joint compound to the inside of the paper that will be facing the wall.

, You should now have the patch in place, and be ready for the joint compound.

, Use a broad knife.

, Allow this to dry and then sand smooth.

That said, asbestos was used in stucco and drywall as early as 1910, and use continued at a slower rate until at least the early 1980's.Asbestos is even used in some building materials today, but the risk is fairly low if your house was built in the 1990's or later.These dates are most accurate in the United States. In some other industrialized countries, significant asbestos use continued until about 2000. Don't rely on a hard cutoff date, since bans on manufacturing sometimes allowed companies to use up their existing supply.;
, These textured plaster ceiling coatings were a common use of asbestos, especially (but not exclusively) between the 1950's and 1970's.It's worth testing these ceilings if they are getting old and crumbling, or if you plan on doing nearby renovations that could disturb the area and release dust.

, Even if the plaster does contain asbestos, this is not a health risk as long as it is in good condition. If you see crumbling, cracks, or water damage, or if the plaster has been sawed, scraped, or sanded, it may be releasing asbestos fibers.If the plaster is undamaged, it's usually best to leave it alone. Check periodically and take a sample only if damage appears later.

, Without professional training, it is easy to make mistakes in respirator fitting or dust removal that can risk the health of your household. Although rare, there are cases where short-term exposure has caused asbestos-related cancer decades in the future.Country, state, and local laws may also require you to hire a professional, especially for shared buildings and work spaces.Before hiring an asbestos inspector, ask for documents proving they have been trained and approved in asbestos work by government agencies.
To avoid a conflict of interest, stay away from inspectors who work for an asbestos removal firm.
To find out more about legal requirements, contact your local or state department of health or environmental protection., Taking a sample can release dangerous asbestos fibers into the air. Whether you are doing this yourself or hiring an inspector, make sure the following precautions are taken:Turn off heating and cooling units.
Close windows and doors.
Tape a plastic sheet on the floor under the area you'll be sampling, and over open doorways and other large openings.Prevent others from entering the room while you work.

, Asbestos fibers are extremely fine and can easily be inhaled without noticing, which can later lead to lung diseases. To protect yourself, wear a well-fitting respirator rated at least N-100, P-100, or R-100, or one equipped with purple HEPA filtered cartridges.A disposable dust mask will not protect you.


If you have facial hair that interferes with a tight fit, you may need a powered, positive-pressure respirator., Asbestos is most dangerous when inhaled, but it can also cause cuts or ""asbestos warts"" if it reaches your skin. More importantly, fibers can cling to clothes and spread the danger of inhalation to other areas. Protect yourself before you get started:


Wear gloves you don't mind throwing away. Durable work gloves are ideal, but you can use powder-free disposable gloves.Wear safety glasses if taking a sample from above you, to protect against falling debris.Disposable coveralls with built-in footwear are ideal, especially if you are sampling a large area. You can wear old clothes instead and throw them away afterward.

, The test will be more reliable if you take several samples from different areas. You can ask an asbestos testing laboratory how many samples they prefer, or follow these rules of thumb:Up to 90 m2 (~1,000 ft2) of plaster: Collect three samples.
90 to 450 m2 (~1,000 to 5,000 ft2): Collect five samples.
Over 450 m2 (5,000 ft2): Collect seven samples.
If there are multiple layers of material, or if plaster in different areas looks different or was installed at different times, treat them as separate materials and sample each one using these guidelines.

, Fill a hand sprayer with water and a few drops of detergent. Spray this over an area of plaster. Wet plaster will release fewer asbestos fibers., Cut down through the entire depth of the plaster material with any sharp knife or tool. Remove at least a 2.5 x 2.5 cm (1"" x 1"") square of the plaster. Try not to break the material into small pieces.


It's a good idea to contact the testing laboratory first, as some prefer larger samples.
For popcorn ceiling coats and other friable material (anything that crumbles apart when you cut it), scrape off about 5 mL (1 tsp)., Place the sample in a clean high quality zip lock bag or plastic container, then place that inside a second bag. Label the container with the date and the place where you took the sample (e.g. ""hallway ceiling north end"").

, Use the smallest piece of tape possible to cover the hole.This minimizes the amount of fibers released from the cut edge.

, Carefully fold up the plastic drop sheet. Thoroughly clean the floor and the area around the sample with wet rags and sponges, or with a HEPA vacuum cleaner.Wipe the outside of the sample container with a wet rag.


Never use a regular vacuum cleaner.
Asbestos fibers can float in the air for hours.Minimize your use of that room for the rest of the day, and consider an additional mopping or HEPA vacuuming at the end of the day.

, Before leaving the area, put your plastic sheet, cleaning rags, gloves, and outer layer of clothing, including footwear, into sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags.If it turns out your plaster does contain asbestos, deliver these bags to a landfill that accepts asbestos-containing waste.Asbestos is banned from regular trash collection in many areas.

, Do this before leaving the work area if possible, to minimize the chance of tracking asbestos with you.

, There are several ways to find an asbestos testing laboratory to test your sample:


The U.S. Department of Commerce has established a voluntary accreditation program for asbestos testing labs, and provides a Directory listing of the labs who have become accredited. Labs are listed by state and listings include links to the labs’ websites.
Check out some well known international labs, such as the International Asbestos Testing Laboratory or EMSL Analytical, Inc..
Many labs offer testing for non-local residents, through Federal Express (“FedEx”), United Parcel Service (“UPS”), or United States Postal Service (“USPS”). Just run a search at your favorite search engine for “asbestos testing”.
Check the yellow pages for ""Laboratories — Analytical."", Asbestos testing is cheap as lab tests go. You can typically get three samples tested for under $100 USD., Most companies have a submission form for you to complete and mail or bring in with your sample. Print and complete the form and send with your sample and payment to the address listed for sample submission.

, If it turns out the plaster does contain asbestos, and it is not in good condition, hire an asbestos contractor to handle it. You can either have the plaster removed completely, or seal it underneath a protective coating that traps the asbestos fibers.Make sure the contractor is government accredited. Your local or state health board may be able to provide a list of accredited organizations.
Trying this yourself is not recommended. If you're set on the idea, make sure to comply with legal requirements in your area.

, After the job is done, you can hire an asbestos inspector or air testing contractor to confirm the asbestos was successfully handled without releasing asbestos into the air."

Build a framework to hang the sheetrock from.,
Install electrical outlets and fixtures before you begin with your sheetrock.,
Hang sheetrock on the framework using 4 x 8-foot (1.2 X 2.4 m) sheets.,
Mark the sheetrock to the width you need.,
Tape and embed the walls to your new basement room.,
Complete the walls by using a sanding block and sandpaper to sand down and blend in the edges of the embedment.",How to Install Sheetrock in a Basement," This usually consists of 2 x 4-foot (5.1 x 10.2 cm) framework attached to the basement concrete wall with screws.


Install insulation board onto the concrete or cinder block wall prior to installing the framework using construction adhesive applied with a caulk gun. This will form a vapor barrier between the walls and the sheetrock.
The studs, or furring, will have a top and bottom plate with the studs on 16-inch (40.6 cm) centers. Plumb the framework by using shims, or wedges, between the face of the basement wall and your framework.
Begin framing from one corner and work around the basement back to your starting point.;
, This would also include any cable TV, internet or phone lines.

, It is best to start at one corner with the sheets lying horizontally along the bottom.


Use wedges, or shims, to raise the sheetrock off the floor and keep the bottom row of sheetrock level to the top edge.
Most likely your basement will not be a standard height, and you will need to custom cut the sheet. Make sure it fits above the first row by measuring from the top of the first row to the top plate.

, Score it with a utility knife along the marks you make. Begin breaking the sheetrock from one edge and move toward the other edge.


The rock should break evenly if you scored deep enough. If it didn't, next time try to cut or score the sheetrock deeper.

,


It is best to tape the walls using 3-inch (7.6 cm) fiberglass tape rather than a paper tape in a basement location. Fiberglass tape resists cracking and moisture better in areas where you might have a lot of movement or moisture. The fiberglass attaches directly over the joints and embedment applied over them.

, This gives the walls a nice smooth appearance and makes it ready to finish with texture and paint.

Measure the length and width of the area where the sheetrock will go.,
Measure carefully and draw reference marks on the new sheet of sheetrock.

,
Use a straight edge (one that is at least as long as the cut) and place it on the sheetrock, lined up with your reference marks.

,
Using a sheetrock knife (or a utility knife), make the first cut.,
It is unnecessary to cut deeper than just the paper- it will only dull the blade.,
Turn the sheet over and bend the smaller part of the sheetrock up, to about a 90 degree angle.,
With the smaller piece bent, you should be able to cut through the paper on the back side, along the bend where you made the first cut.

",How to Cut Drywall,";
,,, Try to cut through the paper layer, but don't go too deep into the sheetrock. Make sure to cut the full length.

, You need only to cut through the paper and it will break very easily at the cut., This will break the remaining sheetrock.

Inspect the area for any obstructions, such as electrical wires, ductwork, or protruding pipes.,
Mark the wall studs to indicate the locations of the ceiling joists for reference during the installation process.,
Build a T-Brace, if necessary.,
Hang the drywall, starting in the corner, where you can use a full sheet.,
Wait until you know where you're placing each sheet before you apply any adhesive to the joists.,
Using your T-brace, or a friend to assist you, raise the first sheet of drywall to the ceiling and slide it snugly into the corner.,
Continue along the first wall, always ensuring that the tapered edges abut one another and are facing down.,
Affix the drywall sheets permanently to the ceiling joists using either nails or screws.,
Drive the fasteners in 3/8 inches (0.95 cm) away from the edges of each sheet, and space them 7 inches (17.78 cm) apart along the perimeter.,
Start the second row with a half sheet of drywall in order to stagger the seams.,
Measure and mark the cut line at the vertical midpoint of the drywall sheet.,
Trim the dry wall's length by first marking the line with chalk.,
Install panels over vents or light fixtures loosely at first.,
Complete the entire ceiling installation before moving on to the walls.

",How to Install Ceiling Drywall," Install furring strips to the framing in order to create a flat, even surface for drywall installation around these obstacles.;
, You'll also want to mark the placement of light fixtures and electrical boxes.

, This will provide the leverage and support needed to raise the drywall panels to the ceiling when you're working alone. Use a 2 foot (60.96 cm) piece of 1 by 4 (2.54 by 10.16 cm) and nail it to a 2 by 4 (5.08 by 10.16 cm) that is long enough to be 1 foot (30.48 cm) higher than the length from the floor to the ceiling.

, Raise the first sheet to the ceiling so you can get an idea of the placement across the joists.

, Drywall adhesive dries within 15 minutes, so you'll want to be ready.

, Make sure that the tapered edges of the sheet are facing the floor.

, The tapered edges are designed to make the process of taping and mudding easier.

, The heads of the fasteners you choose should come in contact with the paper facing, sinking in slightly without breaking through the paper.

, Along the interior joist, install the fasteners at about 12 inch (30.48 cm) increments.

, This will enforce the stability.

, Use a straightedge to help guide your utility knife as you cut. Tip the panel off of the floor or table at a slight angle, then push it down to break it in half. Use the utility knife to cut through the paper backing.

, Score the line with the knife first, then cut deeper with the second pass.

, Use a rotary drill to cut out a border for the fixture or vent, and then fully attach the board.

Make sure the drywall is ready to be finished.,
Stir the joint compound.,
Cover the screws and joints with joint compound.,
Apply drywall tape to all joints.,
Smooth the tape with your drywall knife.,
Cover outside corners with joint compound.,
Allow all the compound to dry for about 24 hours.,
Sand the first coat of joint compound.",How to Finish Drywall1," After the drywall is installed, you should look for any screws that are sitting proud of the wall. Drive them in until they are recessed just slightly. Remove any bits of the drywall's outer paper layer that are torn or loose. This will keep them from becoming mixed into the joint compound and showing.;
, Drywall joint compound (sometimes called ""mud"") is sold in large buckets. Remove the bucket's lid and check for a layer of water on top of the compound. If water is present, mix the compound thoroughly with a drill fixed with a mixing paddle. If no water is present, mixing is not necessary.

, Load your mud box (or any other container you use for holding the joint compound) using a 5-inch (125 mm) drywall knife. Load the knife with joint compound and use it to fill in the gaps between drywall panels. Use the compound to cover exposed screw heads as well.


When all joints and screws are covered, pass over the areas with the knife to smooth out the joint compound. The smoother the joint compound, the less work you'll have to do later when you apply a second or third layer of compound.

, Unroll a few feet of tape and position the tape over the freshly applied joint compound covering each joint. Gently press the tape into the joint. Unroll more tape and continue covering the joint until you reach the end of the wall. Tear the tape against the drywall knife blade to achieve a clean edge.


When taping an inside corner, you should pre-crease the tape. Cut the tape to length first, bending it back on itself to crease it. Apply the tape to the corner by gently pushing it into place with the drywall knife.

, Hold the 5-inch knife against the taped joint at a shallow angle. In one continuous motion, pull the knife across the joint, pressing the tape into the compound. Excess joint compound can be scraped off into the mud box.

, Outside corners do not require drywall tape, as they should be affixed with corner beads. Apply joint compound over each side of the bead smoothing it with a single pass of the 5-inch (125 mm) drywall knife.


Metal or plastic outside corner beads come in 10 foot (3 m) segments, so you'll probably need some tin snips to cut them down to size. They are great for protecting your outside corners against dings and other damage throughout the years.

, At this point, after the first layer of mud, your drywall is still going to look patchy. Don't be concerned about being able to see a little drywall tape, or having different consistencies on mudded surfaces. You're going to apply at least another coat of compound; these imperfections will even out and become invisible soon.

, After 24 hours, sand it down gently to smooth it. Use a medium-grit sandpaper, and do not sand too hard. Joint compound is fairly soft, so sanding too much will quickly wear it away and fray the drywall tape.


A small sanding block works well for inside corners, while a pole sander is efficient for sanding seams and outside corners.

Drywall is sold in multiple sizes: 4 x 8 feet (1.2 x 2.4 m), 4 x 10 feet (1.2 x 3 m) and 4 x 12 feet (1.2 x 3.6 m) are the most common. The 4’ x 8’ is the easiest to handle and works well for most jobs. 4.5’ width sheets are also available at commercial supply houses.


Sheetrock will cost just a few dollars per sheet for the 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) thickness. This is the average thickness, which works well for most uses.
Haul the sheetrock home flat, for example in the bed of a pickup truck, so it doesn’t break or bend while transporting. If you must store the sheets for more than a few days, store them flat and on top of each other so they do not warp or get their corners broken.;
, Few tools are needed to hang drywall. You will need a utility knife and spare blades, a hammer (or drywall drill if you screw the sheets to the wall), a straight edge for cutting and measuring (they make drywall T-squares just for this), and plenty of special drywall nails or screws.Drywall can be installed using nails or screws. With nails you end making larger “divots” because the hammer face is large. These are easily filled later, but require just a little more patience when taping. Screws are the “instrument-of-choice” for professionals these days. No professional drywall installer leaves home without a screw gun.
You might also consider getting a drywall foot-lift. Your drywall is usually installed 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) above the ground. A lift, or a drywall hammer in a pinch, will help you prop up the drywall as you nail it to the studs.

, Unless you are starting fresh and there is no old drywall, you should remove the old drywall instead of trying to patch up the drywall in pieces. The old drywall will need to be pried from the studs and ceiling joists with a crowbar or other instrument (often the hands once you get started), being careful not to connect with any electrical or other wiring under the drywall.

, When it comes time to install the new drywall, little pieces left over from the old walls and ceiling will get in your way and make the job more difficult. This would be a good time to pull out the shop vac and run it along the bottom edge of the walls. A broom works well too.

, They can either be removed or hammered into the wood studs. (It's best to remove them so you don’t hit them with the new nails or screws you will put in later.) Then run a hammer down each stud to make sure you pulled every screw and nail. Every one you miss will produce an ugly blowout.

, This goes for both ceilings and walls. Measure and cut the sheetrock so each end lands on the center of a stud or joist.Sheetrock joints that are unsupported by a stud or joist will definitely crack. Sand every cut with a Surform plane or rasp or the sheets will not fit. (NEVER use red chalk to snap lines; it will bleed through the finish paint.)

, Run a bead of glue down each stud that will be covered by the drywall. Do this immediately before hanging. You don't need to run glue down each stud, but it's recommended, and common practice among professionals.

, The order of hanging the drywall matters. This is a two or three person job if you haven’t rented a drywall “lifter” which lifts the pieces straight up by hydraulics and all you do is nail or screw the pieces to the joists. If you don’t have this machine, build two “T-shaped” supports (""deadmen"") to help with this job. Just nail together two 1x3's into a “T” shape, one for each end of the drywall you will be supporting. Make them a little bit more than exact height so you can wedge the sheets to hold them solidly in place. Once the drywall is lifted by hand, the deadmen are slid in under the drywall to wedge it against the ceiling joists while you nail or screw it up. Give up any idea you might have of forcing the sheets into place. They will break or blow out and make a mess.


Mark the ceiling joist centers on the top plate (to save much cursing). Always start from a corner when hanging. Never start from the center and hang outwards. Start from one corner and move in a straight perpendicular line. Once you have one row finished, move on to the next row.

, Make sure to screw or nail the drywall to each stud that it covers. Use a stud finder to locate the stud's position — they should be 16 inches (~40 cm) apart — and then screw or nail four or five evenly-spaced screws into the drywall along the studs.


Be sure to install the drywall perpendicular to its framing, whether you're working the ceiling or walls. Because of how drywall is constructed, its strength (dimensional strength bias) runs along the length. This means that it is best to hang it perpendicular, not vertically, for a stronger final product.

, When cutting, score a line through the face-paper (the front side of the drywall). Next, break the drywall by snapping away from the cut.


You may need to cut the drywall into a less regular shape, to fit it around an air vent, for example. Use the same process as you regularly would, taking care to cut off little by little instead of making one big cut. Remember, you can always cut off more later, but you can't put more back on after cutting too much off.

, Butt it up to the piece on the ceiling and nail or screw. Again, this will probably take more than one person to do, but if you've got muscle is relatively easy to do alone if no helpers are available.


Remember to start from one (top) corner and work on only one row before moving on to the next row.
Butt the bottom sheets up to the top pieces on the walls that you have just hung. They should be close to one another, but a little space is okay: You are going to tape and mud the joints later, so you do not have to worry about getting a perfect specimen right away.

, Work slowly and steadily, minimizing mistakes and making sure to plan. While hanging sheetrock, remember to:


Glue studs before hoisting the sheetrock into place
Gun in four or five screws on a stud, hitting each stud that's behind the sheetrock. (To drive screws with the gun running, don't be gentle — punch them in.)
Cut around windows, doors, fixtures, and other obstacles. If you have an obstacle that you don't know how to work around, consult a contractor.
Check all the screws or nails with a drywall knife to make sure none are sticking out. (Every one you miss will have to be driven in or removed when you're taping, which will make you very grouchy.)

, The seams between the pieces of drywall, including the inside and outside corners need to be covered. This assists in both insulation and achieving an aesthetically pleasing final product.

, Finishing drywall involves covering the entire sheetrock with a thin layer of joint compound, and then scraping it away, to give the sheetrock an even effect. This process is essential for a professional-looking job.

, Maybe you want a little pizzaz added to your walls. Read up on this handy little guide for several different techniques.

, Your finished wall is almost complete. Prime and paint it and you have a beautiful new room, equipped with sturdy sheetrock and an appropriate color.

Start by ""knocking off"" with a 6-inch (15 cm) drywall knife.,
Use a 10- or 12-inch (25 cm or 30 cm) drywall knife to hit any tapered edges.,
Use a smaller drywall knife and work your way up to 14-inch (35 cm) drywall knife to hit any butt joints.,
Use a 6-inch (15 cm) drywall knife to hit any corners.,
Sand the second coat of joint compound.",How to Finish Drywall2," Knocking off refers to sliding and picking off any residual drywall compound, or burrs, that did not dry evenly the day before. Knocking off allows for a more even second coat of compound, and pays dividends in a more professional-looking finish.


Pay special attention to the bottoms of walls, and to outside corners (beads), where burrs and other buildup concentrate.

, Tapered edges are where two drywall edges meet, getting thinner as they meet. This creates a small void on the surface of the drywall. The good thing is that voids are easier to even out with compound than protrusions.


Simply take a 10"" or 12"" drywall knife and run a thin piece of compound over the tapered joint in a straight line. Expect to finish tapered joints at around 10"" to 12"".

, Whereas tapered joints are recessed edges, butt joints are protruding edges. Butt joints take more effort than tapered joints to conceal, because you have to thin out a protrusion instead of fill in a gap.


Locate the center of the butt joint. On one side of the joint, start mudding with an 8"" (20 cm) drywall knife. Gradually work your way up to a 14"" drywall knife, hitting only one side of the butt joint.
Starting with an 8"" drywall knife and gradually working your way up, mud the opposite side of the butt joint.
When you're done, you should have 24"" to 28"" (60 cm to 71 cm) of drywall compound, in one layer, across the length of the butt joint.

, Use your drywall knife to finish one side of the corner only and let dry. Wait one day and then finish the other side of the corner with the same knife. If you try to finish both corners in the same day, you'll pull out compound on the opposite side when you push down with your knife in the corner.


If you wish, you can use an inside corner tool instead of finishing each corner one by one. An inside corner tool is a drywall knife that's curved at a 90° angle in the middle, perfect for hitting inside corners. Using this tool, however, requires a little bit of skill.

, After 24 hours, sand it down gently to smooth it. Use a lightt-grit sandpaper, and do not sand too hard. You just want to smooth off a little bit of the coarse compound; you don't want to take the entire sheetrock cover off.

Start the day again by knocking off.,
Apply the third and final coat of joint compound.,
Apply a lightweight compound to the entire drywall with a 3/4-inch nap roller.,
Avoid corners, but hit seams.,

Continue applying compound, and then removing it, in sections.",How to Finish Drywall3," With a small drywall knife, go over the previous day's compound and knock off any buildup or burrs that escaped the leveling effect of the drywall knife. 15 or 20 minutes of knocking off can make a huge difference in the final product.

, Without a third layer, you'll likely have areas where there's no compound and areas where the compound can be several layers deep (butt joints, for example). The texture on the drywall where there's no compound will look and feel different from drywall that has compound. A third coat of drywall will eliminate this, giving your entire wall the same, even texture.

, Take your roller, dip it into the compound, and lightly start applying it onto the surface of the drywall, working in sections. You don't want the roller to roll as much as glide across the surface, distributing compound.


When rolling the compound onto the drywall, start from the bottom and move upward. This way, your compound won't drip onto the floor.
Be sure to work in manageable sections. You'll be removing most of the compound, so try work in small sections as to keep it from drying out before you have a chance to remove it.
Put the compound on pretty heavy. If you put on compound on too thinly, it tends to dry out. This makes removing it harder, if not impossible.

, The corners are already covered in compound, so there's little need to cake on extra compound where they are. The seams, however, you want to blend, so putting compound over them will help accomplish that.

, With a larger drywall knife, scrape as much drywall compound from the wall as possible. You're not trying to get a plaster finish or a veneer plaster finish; you're simply trying to even out the texture of the drywall with a thin layer of compound.

, Cover and strip the entire wall in this method. Once completed, allow 24 hours for compound to dry, and then sand one final time to prep the drywall for priming.

Block off all vents and openings with plastic sheeting.Heavy-duty plastic sheeting helps to minimize how much dust gets dispersed through the air.,
Cover the floor and protect the furniture.Move as much furniture out of the way as you can.,
Turn off the central heat and air circulation.Leaving the system on will result in drywall dust getting into it, which will then spread throughout your home.,
Place box fans in the windows.Using box fans will help keep the room you are working in ventilated.,
Remove the door and window screens.This will allow the dust to move freely from inside to outside.",How to Clean Drywall Dust1," Cover all the openings throughout your home, such as doorways and windows, with it. For best results, hang the sheeting from floor to ceiling.


Cover all of the air vents and ductwork.
Secure the plastic sheeting with masking tape.;
, Cover what can’t be moved with plastic sheeting, especially upholstered furniture, since the dust can work itself into the fabric. Secure the sheeting in place with bungee cords.Place plastic sheeting over the entire floor of your work area.
If you have carpet in the rest of the house, consider covering the floors in every room with self-adhesive plastic lining.

, Even though you’re covering all of the air ducts with plastic sheeting before you begin, it is still beneficial to turn off the circulation system.


Be sure to leave the circulation system off until you’ve completed your task and cleaned up the dust afterward.
Check your system’s air filter frequently in the weeks following the sanding. You will probably need to replace it soon after., Open the windows and place the box fans in them. Be sure to position the box fans so that air blows out of the room, not into it. Use plastic sheeting to seal off the area around the fans and window frames. Duct tape the plastic in place.If any of the windows have air conditioning units in them, remove them from the room. They get clogged with dust easily.
Use the box fans on a low setting, which will cause the least air disturbance. Setting them on high will suck out a lot of the dust, but it will also increase the amount that’s moving through the air.

, It also improves the air circulation in the area. Not removing the screens will trap a lot of the dust in the room. You’ll also have to remove drywall dust from the screens after you’ve finished sanding.

Lay old sheets over floor and anything else you want to protect.,
Shut off all circuit breakers to any room outlets and lights.,
Keep the covers in place and tape over the exposed area.,
Figure out your walls are made of.,
Determine what type of wallpaper you have.",How to Remove Wallpaper1," Use small nails to attach to wall edges if necessary, but keep in mind that drop cloths move around a lot even if you nail them. Moving furniture out of the room to be stripped will make your life easier.;
, If you intend to do this at night, invest in a halogen work lamp and a long extension cord.

, This keeps water from getting inside during the removal process. Even outlets without power are dangerous to get wet and can pose a fire hazard. You may remove the paper underneath towards the end of the process.

, This let you know how gentle you have to be while stripping your wallpaper. Most walls are made either of plaster or drywall. While plaster is hard, durable, and fairly water-resistant, drywall is nothing more than paper-covered gypsum and shouldn’t be allowed to get too wet. The easiest way to tell the difference is to tap the wall in various places; if it sounds hollow, you have drywall. If you use a wallpaper removal method that involves liquid or steam, go easy on your drywall.

, There are many kinds of wallpaper, but the removal process will go a lot smoother with the strippable type or peelable-top-layer type than the traditional varieties. To test this out, work your putty knife under a corner of the wallpaper, loosen it, and try to peel it back with your hands.


If the whole thing peels away in one piece, you have strippable wallpaper. A bottle of champagne is in order.
If, much like a cheap label, only the surface layer peels away, leaving a papery bottom layer, your wallpaper has a peelable top layer. This isn’t as easy to remove as strippable wallpaper, but you should still consider yourself lucky that you don’t have the traditional kind.
If you cannot peel your wallpaper away from your wall by hand (or can only peel a thin strip away at a time), you have traditional wallpaper. You will have to remove it either with stripping solution or a wallpaper steamer.

Purchase a joint compound.,
Get compound applicators and sanders.,
Buy patching supplies for larger holes.,
Get paint and primer.",How to Do Drywall Repair1," The two commonly available joint compounds are lightweight and all-purpose. Lightweight compound dries quicker than all-purpose and requires less sanding.Joint compound comes in a variety of container sizes, but be advised that smaller containers may cost just as much as the larger ones. If resealed properly, joint compound can be kept for up to 9 months for other around-the-house repairs if you end up with leftover compound.;
, A joint knife and a metal straightedge will enable you to apply the joint compound smoothly and scrape away the excess, so the repair job will look professional instead of lumpy or uneven. Get a sanding sponge to even out the surface after the joint compound has dried.

, For big holes, you'll need a new piece of drywall to create a patch. Get backing boards, which hold the drywall in place, and purchase a piece of drywall large enough to fill the hole. You'll need paper tape and joint compound to smooth out the joints.

, The final step to repairing drywall is painting the repaired area so that it matches the rest of the wall. Use the same primer and paint you originally used to paint the wall.

Take breaks to clean.Because the dust is so pervasive, remove as much as you can before it has a chance to build up.,
Limit access to the work area.,
Designate one entryway.It’s going to be difficult not to track dust in and out of the work area, so choose one entrance and seal the other entryways off.",How to Clean Drywall Dust2," It’s not ideal, but cleaning frequently throughout the project can help you reduce a lot of dust. How often you stop to clean is up to you, but at minimum you need to clean at least once per day.


Wipe down surfaces with a microfiber towel or a damp cloth. Use a vacuum cleaner to get up the dust on the floor.
Do not remove your face mask during cleaning. Breathing in drywall dust can cause serious health problems., Dry wall dust is such a fine powder that simply walking around in the work area stirs it up. Even after you’ve stopped sanding, the dust hangs in the air for quite a while. Walking through pushes it around in the air.


The more people walk through the area, the faster the dust will spread.
Restrict the work area to only others working on the project., Lay a mat in front of the entrance. A mat isn’t going to make a huge difference, but at the very least you can reduce tracking dust by wiping the soles of your shoes off before leaving the area.


If you’re doing work in your own home, removing your shoes and leaving them behind will help.

Sweep first.Start from the exterior and work your way to the center of the room.,
Vacuum the floors.The most effective vacuum for this job is a wet/dry vacuum, also known as a Shopvac.,
Wipe everything down with a damp microfiber cloth.Fill a bucket with cool water.,
Vacuum a second time.,
Spot clean with a damp microfiber cloth.",How to Clean Drywall Dust3," Take your time and sweep with gentle strokes to avoid stirring up the dust more than you have to. Use a dustpan to scoop up the dust pile and place it in a trash bag. Tie the bag up immediately to seal the dust in. If you are working with a significant amount of dusk, there are products you can buy that will help the dust cling to the floor. This will make it easier to sweep up.


You can buy sweeping compound products at any home improvement store. They are usually sold in bags or buckets. The compound itself has a dust/sawdust-like consistency.
To use, shake the compound over the floor where you want to sweep. It holds the dust down to the floor so that you can sweep it up more easily.
Many of the products require 24 hours to settle over the dust before you can sweep it, so read the instructions carefully.

, If you don’t own one already, many home improvement stores rent them out. Use vacuum bags that are made specifically for collecting dry wall dust. For the finer particles, use a HEPA filter.


The filters can get clogged so, if possible, use a filter that can be washed and reused.
It’s also wise to have a back-up filter on hand, just in case.

, Dip the cloth in the water and wring it out well – a soaking wet cloth can damage fresh drywall. Start at the top of the walls and work your way down. You’ll need to rinse and wring out the cloth often.


Change the water in the bucket as soon as it gets cloudy.
After the walls, wipe down every horizontal surface in the room. This includes baseboards, light fixtures, outlet covers, etc., Insert a brush attachment for the second pass. Brush attachments help to get in the nooks and crannies. It also has a hose attached that will allow you to vacuum the walls. Start at the top and vacuum your way down to the bottom.


After the walls, vacuum the floor again.
You’ll will probably need to vacuum in the corners of the room and over the joints twice.

, Check the room and wipe up any lingering dust that you see. Run the cloth over the baseboards and window ledges one more time. If you want to be extra vigilant, damp mop the floor as a final step.Make sure you’re using clean water in the bucket, even for the final wipe down.

Soak a paint roller in the hot water/stripping solution.,
Saturate one section of the wall at a time.,
Let it soak for several minutes.,
Strip the wallpaper.,
Wash away residue.",How to Remove Wallpaper4," Putting holes in the paper will help your stripping solution to penetrate the adhesive.


Some people skip the scoring process because it can create small holes in the paper on the drywall. If you have a real plaster wall, this isn't as much of an issue.
If you don't want to score your wallpaper, use 120-grit sandpaper with a vibrating sander. Sand just enough to take some of the color off.


, Make sure it's as hot as you can stand. Mix in a wallpaper-stripping solution according to the instructions on the bottle.


A vinegar solution would also effective, cheap, and non-toxic. Consider using a 20-percent solution, but if you’d feel more comfortable with a milder concentration, feel free to experiment.
Another cheap alternative is fabric softener at about 25- to 50-percent solution. It doesn't have to be fancy fabric softener, but do make sure it’s unscented.
Mixing your stripping solution in small batches will keep the water hot.

, A sponge or large paint brush also works well.


A spray bottle can make the solution much easier to apply but will also cool it down faster. Weigh your options.


, Don’t saturate more than you think you can strip in 10 to 15 minutes.

, This will give the solution time to do its job.

, With the help of a plastic putty knife, peel pieces of wallpaper away one at a time.


Peel upwards. This will make it easier to wedge the putty knife between the uplifted paper and the wall.

, This helps the steam penetrate.


Some people skip the scoring process because it can create small holes in the paper on the drywall. If you have a real plaster wall, this isn't as much of an issue.

, Hold the steamer against the wallpaper to soften and loosen the adhesive. The longer you steam the paper, the easier it will peel off.


Be careful when using the steamer around drywall. The extra moisture may damage your walls.
Since the steamer will probably drip hot water, be sure to wear gloves and long sleeves.

, Use a plastic putty or drywall knife.

Sand down the edges.,
Apply joint compound.,
Sand the area.,
Prime the area.,
Paint over the repair.",How to Do Drywall Repair2," Use a sanding sponge to sand away the loose particles around the edges of the dent. Run the sanding sponge over the dent itself to create a rough surface that the joint compound, which is used to fill the dent, will be able to adhere to easily.

, Dip a joint knife sideways into the container of joint compound and load about half of the blade. Run the knife over the dented area to smooth on the joint compound. Turn the blade at a 90 degree angle to the wall and run it over the area again to remove excess compound.


Be sure to remove the extra compound, so that the area won't have bumps once the the substance dries.
Check the area it it dries to determine if the dent has been completely filled. You may need to apply a second coat if the joint compound shrinks as it dries.

, Use a sponge sander or another fine sander to gently blend the area with the surrounding wall space after the joint compound has completely dried. You can also use a dampened sponge to smooth the edges., Joint compounds are relatively porous, so it's necessary to prime the repaired area before you paint it. Otherwise, the paint will look different from the surrounding area.


Use a primer that matches the paint color. If possible, use the same one you originally used to paint the wall.
If you have paint that also acts as a primer, priming the wall first isn't necessary.

, Once the primer is dry, use a soft cloth to paint over the area with the wall paint. Work gently and use strokes similar to the strokes you used to paint the surrounding wall so that the paint will look blended after it has dried.

"

Remove the loose edges.,
Fill the hole with joint compound.,
Sand the patch.,
Prime and paint the area.",How to Do Drywall Repair3," If parts of the drywall are sticking out from when the nail was removed, gently scrape them off or push them into the hole. Make sure the edges of the hole are flush with the wall, so there won't be any bumps or lumps after you repair the area., Load the joint knife with joint compound and push the compound into the hole. Scrape away the excess compound by holding the knife at a ninety-degree angle from the wall and running it over the surface of the hole.Try not to get joint compound on the wall surrounding the hole, since it will dry and affect the paint in the area. Load the knife with only as much compound as you need to fill the hole.
If you get joint compound on the wall area surrounding the nail as you work, wipe it away with a damp cloth.

, Use fine-grit sandpaper to sand the area once the compound has completely dried. Use a damp cloth to wipe away the dust when you're finished. The wall surface where the hole was should now be completely smooth.

, For a perfectly seamless repair, use a soft cloth to dab a bit of primer over the repaired area. When it's dry, use another cloth to dab wall paint over the area.

Determine if testing is necessary.,
Hire someone to test for asbestos.",How to Remove Artex1," Prior to the mid-1980s, Artex was strengthened with asbestos. If your home dates back to that decade or earlier, you may need to test the Artex for asbestos before removing it.


Do not attempt to remove Artex that may contain asbestos. Doing so could be dangerous to your health and the health of those around you.

, If testing is necessary, you'll need to hire a professional, certified contractor to perform the test.


The contractor will close off the area and take a sample of the Artex. After testing that sample in a lab, he or she will let you know if it contains asbestos.
If the Artex does contain asbestos, you'll need to speak with a specialist about removal. Do not attempt to remove it yourself.
If the Artex does not contain asbestos, you should be able to safely remove it without professional help.

Heat the wallpaper.,
Loosen the edge of the wallpaper.,
Continue heating and peeling the wallpaper.",How to Remove a Wallpaper Border1," Set the hair dryer to its highest setting. Plug it in and blow hot air over the corner and edge of the wallpaper. Heat the wallpaper for about 30 seconds. The heat from the hair dryer should loosen the adhesive that was used to attach it to the wall.;
, Use your fingernail or a knife to lift the edge of the wallpaper and peel it back slowly. If it comes loose, keep peeling it back until it resists.

, Hold the hair dryer over the unpeeled section of wallpaper border and slowly peel it away. Continue down the length of the border, heating and peeling it until the entire piece of wallpaper has come loose from the wall.


Don't rip the wallpaper off in strips. This ends up making it more difficult to remove in the long run, since it leaves thin pieces of wallpaper on the wall.
If the wallpaper stubbornly sticks to the wall, don't force it. The hair dryer method doesn't work with all types of adhesive; you may have to try another strategy.

, Tape the drop cloths around wooden floor to protect them. Get a ladder if it extends to the top of the walls or the ceiling.

, If wallpaper is beneath them, they will need to be unscrewed and set aside so that you can remove all the sections of wallpaper., Disconnect your power to the room, since wallpaper removal requires a lot of water and can pose an electrocution risk. Work in the daylight for best results.

,, This is the best place to start. Lift that edge with a paper scraper.


You can use a putty knife or a paper scraper to lift up the edges of the wallpaper. A paper scraper is less likely to damage the walls.If it comes off easily, your wallpaper can be dry-stripped. Don’t add water, gel or steam unless you have to.

, Move it across the entire surface of the wallpaper. The small holes will allow water to penetrate the surface and loosen the glue.

, Pour it into a spray bottle. Spray it on a small area or apply it with a paint roller.


Replace the bottle with a hot water mixture when it starts to cool.
The aim should be to keep a minimal amount of very hot water seeping through the holes made by the scouring tool. This will minimize water damage to your wall.
Use a store-bought enzymatic, gel wallpaper stripper if the wallpaper is coated. Use a gel stripper for best results.

, Only spray what you think you can remove in 15 minutes.

, It should soak in a little before you start.

,, If your wallpaper has been painted over, you should skip directly to this step.

, Scrape it with a wallpaper razor scraper, while you move the hot plate to an adjoining section to soften the glue. Repeat until the paper is removed.

, Allow the stripper to set in for 15 to 20 minutes before you start to scrape.


Clean the wall immediately after you remove a section of wallpaper entirely. Use extra gel stripper to remove stubborn paste.

, They might have glued the area down with white school glue.

, Make it the hottest water you can handle. Wear rubber gloves to apply it.


If the water cools before you finish the project, replace it with hot water.

, Wring it out lightly. Place it over the glue and allow the water to set and penetrate the paper and glue.

, Wipe the paper and glue away with a scouring pad. Scrub well., Repeat until the Elmer’s glue is scrubbed off the wall. You may need to fill the area with putty before painting if damage is caused to the wall.

Allow the walls to dry for between 12 to 24 hours.",How to Remove Wallpaper Paste," The job can get pretty messy, so it's a good idea to cover the floors and and other parts of the room before you get started. If everything's already protected because you just stripped your wallpaper, all the better.


Tape off and cover outlets, switches, vents, baseboards and trim with painter's tape or plastic covers.
Cover floors with plastic or canvas tarps near all walls where you will be working.
Remove or cover furniture with plastic tarps. If your room is large, move furniture to the center of the room while you work.
Turn off the electricity to the room to avoid any electrical mishaps.;
, The process of removing wallpaper paste is as follows: soak the paste, rub the paste, then rinse the wall.That means you'll need several different items to do the job:

A bucket filled with wallpaper paste removal solution.
A sponge for soaking the paste.
A spray bottle filled with water.
A dry rag for wiping the wall clean (you'll probably need more than one of these to do the whole job).
A garbage can.

, Hot water alone won't do the trick - you'll need a solution that softens the paste, making it easier to remove from the walls. There are a variety of solutions you can use for the job:


Hot water and a few squirts of dish soap. This works perfectly well on most wallpaper paste. Fill up a gallon-sized bucket with the solution.
Hot water and vinegar. This is great for tougher jobs. Mix a gallon of hot water and a gallon of white distilled vinegar.
Try adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of baking soda into the bucket. The baking soda helps to dissolve the wallpaper paste.
Trisodium phosphate, or TSP. TSP is an industrial-grade cleaner that was once widely used as a cleaner. Is it extremely strong, but not great for the environment, so try using when other, gentler methods have been exhausted.
For the heaviest jobs, you might want to buy wallpaper paste remover from the store. The commercial removers use chemicals to quickly dissolve the paste. Follow the directions to mix commercial wallpaper paste remover. It is available from most paint or hardware stores, and contains ingredients created specifically to dissolve wallpaper paste.

, Wallpaper paste can contain chemicals that aren't great for your hands. The job of removing it can take several hours, so it's a good idea to protect yourself by putting on a pair of long rubber gloves, the type you'd use when washing dishes., Dip the sponge into the wallpaper paste removal solution you mixed up. Apply the solution to the wall, soaking it entirely. Don't soak the entire wall at once; do a 5 x 5 foot section at a time, so it won't dry before you can get to it. Let the solution sit for a few moments so it has time to soften the paste.


If you don't want to use a sponge, you can use a spray bottle. Pour the solution into the bottle and spray a 5 x 5 foot area with the wallpaper paste remover. Wait 5 minutes for the paste to soften.
Adjust the spray nozzle so it does not squirt directly on the wall, but it sprays a fine mist. Gradual saturation is necessary when spraying the wall.

, Use the sponge to rub in a circular motion until the softened paste starts to come off. Discard it in the garbage can as you remove it.


Scrape the wallpaper paste with a putty knife if you have trouble getting it off with a sponge. Scrape using even motions that do not cause your putty knife to damage the drywall.
If the paste doesn't seem to be budging, soak it thoroughly and try again.

, Soften and scrape the wallpaper paste throughout the room until most of the wallpaper paste is gone. Do so methodically, section by section, so you're less likely to miss any one area.

, Soak any remaining wallpaper paste with more spray mixture, and scrub it with a tough scrubber. Forceful scrubbing may be required to remove it.

, Remove the tape and covers from vents, outlets, switches, baseboards and trim. Use a sponge and the spray remover to carefully treat small areas.

, Run your hand along the walls. If they are smooth, most of the glue has been removed. If they feel sticky, repeat the process.

Check for wires.,
Cut a rectangle.,
Add backer boards.,
Install a drywall patch.,
Tape the joints.,
Sand the area and add another coat.,
Prime and paint the area.",How to Do Drywall Repair4," If the hole is close to an electrical outlet or phone line, make sure you check inside it so you don't hit any wires while you work.Feel around the hole with your hands, or peer inside using a flashlight.


If you find a wire, take note of where it is located and plan to work carefully around it when you repair the hole.

, Use a ruler and a level to measure and draw a rectangle around the perimeter of the hole, then cut it out using a utility knife or drywall saw. This will enable you to neatly patch the hole with a piece of drywall the precise size you need, rather than making an irregular patch.

, Cut the backer boards about 4 inches (10.2 cm) longer than the height of the hole. Line the first backer board vertically along the left edge of the hole. Use one hand to hold it in place tightly while using a drill to screw two drywall screws through the intact drywall just below the hole, and two through the drywall just above the hole. Use the same technique to install another backer board along the right edge of the hole.Pine or other soft wood backer boards work well for repairing drywall, since they're easy to screw into.
Be sure to hold the boards in such a way that the screws won't scratch or puncture your hands when they pop through the backer boards.

, Measure the thickness of the drywall and purchase a piece of drywall large enough to patch the hole. Cut it to size using the drywall saw so that it will fit neatly into the hole. Place the drywall patch into the hole and screw it into the backing boards on either side, spacing the screws 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart.


Most hardware and home goods stores sell scraps of drywall in different shapes and sizes. Look for one large enough to patch your hole so you don't have to buy a complete sheet of drywall, which will probably be more than you need.

, Load a joint knife with joint compound and apply it to joints, the seams where the patch and the wall connect. Quickly apply paper tape to the joints and use a taping knife to smooth the tape into place, making sure there are no bubbles or lumps. Apply a second coating of joint compound and let it dry.


You can add a little water to the compound to thin it out, making it easier to spread and feather out along the wall for even blending.Be sure to remove excess compound as you go, so that the transition between the patch and the wall is as smooth as possible. Pull the taping knife in one direction.
Laying the tape evenly can be tricky. It's worth starting over if you lay it crookedly, since the tape is important for blending the patch with the wall.

, Once the first few coats are dry, smooth the edges by sanding them with a fine grit sandpaper. Fill in any gouges and uneven areas by applying another thin coat of compound. Let that dry, and continue sanding and adding more compound until the surface is even and smooth.


Wait at least 24 hours between sandings. The compound should be completely dry, or you may create more ruts and gouges instead of smoothing the surface.

, After the last sanding, use a primer to get the area ready for painting. When the primer is dry, paint the area using the same brush or paint applicator you originally used to paint the wall.

Protect the surrounding area.,
Fill the wallpaper steamer with water.,
Steam an area for several seconds.,
Test the progress.,
Repeat as needed until you can scrape off the Artex.,
Gradually work your way over the entire area.,
Examine the area.",How to Remove Artex2," Remove any lightweight furniture and decorations. Cover the remaining furniture, appliances, and floor with a plastic drop cloth.


Protect yourself by wearing a dust mask and working gloves. You should also wear ""junk"" clothes that you don't mind dirtying while working on this project.
Steam removal can be very messy. Artex has a tendency to liquefy when it becomes too hot, and if this happens, the product can easily drip onto other surfaces and create stains.;
, Fill the steamer canister with hot tap water. Plug the machine into a wall outlet and switch it on, giving it several minutes to heat up.


Each steamer may work differently, so follow the manufacturer's instructions before use. If the water canister has a fill line, make sure that you do not fill it above that line. Give the machine an adequate amount of time to heat up, too.

, Press the steam plate over the corner of the Artex-covered area. Hold it in place for several seconds.


Do not hold the steam plate over one area for more than a few seconds. If you allow the Artex to get too hot, it could liquefy and drip onto other surfaces. Moreover, you may also damage the ceiling or wall beneath the Artex by applying too much steam.

, Lift up the steam plate, then use a scraper tool to test the softness of the Artex.


Press the edge of the scraper directly to the surface and push into the Artex using firm, controlled pressure. If the Artex feels hard or does not respond to moderate amount pressure, it isn't soft enough to remove yet.

, Continue steaming the same area for several seconds at a time, testing after each press. When the Artex becomes soft enough, use the scraper to ease it off the surface.It may take 20 seconds or more before the Artex softens enough to remove, but you should continue testing the area every few seconds with the scraper. Frequent testing will prevent more mishaps.
Once you can easily scrape away the Artex with the scraper tool, the product is soft enough to work with. Safely set aside the steamer and scrape the product away using straight, overlapping parallel strokes. Apply just enough pressure to ease away the Artex without damaging the surface beneath it.
As you scrape away the Artex, you can let it drop onto the drop cloth you spread out earlier. Alternatively, you can try collecting it in a large plastic garbage bag as it drops.

, Steam and scrape over the entire Artex-covered area. Take your time and remove each patch by following the same technique used on the first patch.


Work slowly and carefully. Continue testing each area after steaming it for several seconds, and do not assume that each area will take the same amount of time to soften.
Move in a straight line while working over the area. Each section you work on should slightly overlap the one before it. Working in this manner may prevent you from accidentally leaving gaps or strips of Artex behind.

, After peeling away the Artex from the entire area, carefully examine your work to verify that no traces of Artex remain.


If you do find some remnants of Artex, work over those patches with the steamer and scraper again. Continue doing so until you successfully clear the entire area.
Once you finish, you can gather the bits of removed Artex into plastic garbage bags and dispose of them. Note that steamed Artex will become dusty once it dries, so you'll need to work carefully to avoid disturbing the dust. Remove the drop cloth, as well, and return the room to normal.
The project is over once you complete this step.

Protect the surrounding area.,
Obtain an Artex removal solution.,
Score the paint, if necessary.,
Paint the solution over the Artex.,
Wait for the Artex to soften.,
Scrape away the Artex.,
Examine the area.",How to Remove Artex3," Remove as much nearby furniture as possible, then cover the rest of the furniture and any appliances with plastic drop cloths. Lay a drop cloth or newspaper over the floor, as well.


Wear working gloves to protect your hands. Softened Artex has the potential to create stains, so you should also change into clothes you don't mind dirtying before working on this project.

, There are several products specially formulated for Artex removal, and the application procedure should not vary much between products. For best results, however, choose a ""wet working system"" solution.


All Artex removal solutions work by breaking down the structure of the Artex and causing it to soften.
Working wet systems are water-based, so they tend to be non-flammable and won't create any hazardous fumes.Moreover, they keep the Artex wet at all times, which can prevent dry fibers from becoming airborne.
Since these products do not allow the Artex to dry out, they may even be safe for use with Artex containing asbestos. Nonetheless, you should still consult with a professional before attempting to remove any Artex that may contain asbestos.

, Some solutions may have difficulty working through paint, so when removing paint-covered Artex, lightly score the paint with a utility knife to promote easier penetration.


This is especially important when dealing with vinyl silk paints. The plastic polymers inside of the paint can turn into a thick goo when exposed to the removal solution. Scoring the paint should make it easier for the solution to work through the goo and into the Artex beneath.
Score the paint lightly, however, since you only need to cut into the paint and not into the Artex beneath it.

, Use a large, wide paintbrush to slather the removal solution over the entire area. Cover the area as thoroughly and evenly as possible.


Follow the package instructions to determine the proper application technique. Usually, you'll simply need to apply the solution onto the surface in even, parallel strokes. Thicker formulas may require the use of a putty knife or paint roller, however.

, Depending on the product you use and the thickness of the Artex, you may need to wait 30 minutes to 8 hours before the Artex softens enough for removal.When dealing with painted Artex or notably thick applications, you may need to cover the area with foil or plastic film and allow it to sit overnight. The film should prevent the solution from drying out, and the prolonged soak time should ensure more thorough softening.

, Use a scraper tool to ease the Artex off the surface. Work your way across the entire area while scraping away the product in this manner.


When removing painted Artex, use a long-handled blade scraper instead of a standard steel one. This tool will make it easier to cleanly lift the Artex from the surface.
Press the edge of the scraper directly onto the surface, then push into the Artex with controlled, even pressure. If the Artex is soft enough, it should scrape away without much difficulty.
Scrape in straight, parallel strokes. Each stroke should slightly overlap the one before it to ensure that no small strips of Artex are left in between patches.
Let the Artex drop onto the previously covered floor as you scrape it away. Alternatively, you could attempt to scrape it directly into a large plastic garbage bag, but it can be difficult to catch all of the falling pieces.

, After removing the Artex, examine the surface more thoroughly. Verify that all traces of Artex are gone.


If any patches of Artex remain after your initial removal, you could try removing them by applying more removal product. Let the Artex soften for a longer period of time before scraping it away.
If you are unable to remove the Artex in some places with the removal solution, you could still remove it by using the steamer method.
Once you scrape away all of the Artex, wrap it up inside the drop cloth and transfer the entire thing into a large plastic garbage bag for disposal.
Return the room to normal when finished. This completes the entire process.

Fill a spray bottle with a wallpaper stripper solution.There are a variety of different substances you can use to spray on the wallpaper to loosen the adhesive.,
Use a perforating tool to score the border.,
Saturate the wallpaper border with the solution.,
Start scraping.,
Lift away the wallpaper and scrape the pieces underneath.",How to Remove a Wallpaper Border2," Choose from these options:


Apple cider vinegar and water. This natural solution works well to break down the adhesive, but it can leave a smell on the wall; only use it if your wallpaper is covering paint, not a bottom layer of wallpaper.
Liquid fabric softener and water. This solution is cheap and effective, but you may not want to use chemicals on your wall.
Manufactured wallpaper stripper. You can buy wallpaper stripper solution from the hardware store to use on your walls.
Warm water. When all else fails, plain water usually does the trick.

, This is especially important if the border is made of vinyl. If you don't score it, the liquid solution won't be able to seep in. Scrape the scoring tool over the border for several minutes, until it's covered with hundreds of tiny holes.


Make sure the perforating tool you use is made of plastic, not metal. A metal scraping tool could harm the wall underneath.
If you don't have a perforating tool, use a plastic knife to make criss-crossing scores across the border.

, Spray it all over, in the corners, near the edges, and in the middle. Don't skimp with the solution; the wallpaper needs to be completely wet for the adhesive to begin to loosen. Let the solution sit for 15 minutes before continuing.

, Use a plastic scraping tool (similar to an ice scraper) to life the edge of the wallpaper and begin scraping it away. Use one hand to scrape and the other one to peel. Keep scraping and peeling across the length of the border.


If you run into a stubborn area, douse it with solution. Let it sit for five minutes before continuing.
Don't rip the wallpaper off in strips; this makes it a lot more difficult to remove the tiny pieces.

, You may have to saturate the stray pieces with more solution. Use the scraper to loosen them, then peel them away.

Clean the adhesive from the wall.",How to Remove a Wallpaper Border3," Wallpaper steamers aren't expensive, so if you plan on removing a lot of wallpaper in the future, you might want to go ahead and spring for one. If you only plan to use it once, consider renting one instead. In a pinch, a clothing steamer can be used.Steaming can damage some wall surfaces and should not be done on wallpapered walls unless you intend to remove the wallpaper as well.
If you are going to try steaming the border off, test it in an inconspicuous area first.

, Run the steamer along the border to loosen it, working from the bottom edge to the top edge. Use your free hand to lift the border as it steams and loosens.

, Continue steaming the border and lifting it away, using the scraper to help loosen it, until you're able to remove the entire border. It should come free easily after the steam treatment.

, Make sure all traces of wallpaper and glue are gone, since bits of adhesive can ruin your new paint or wallpaper job.

Clean the entire surface thoroughly with TSP or a TSP substitute.,
Rinse off the entire surface with water and a clean cloth to remove your cleaner.,
Check the condition of the wall.,
Cover any damaged areas and seams with spackle or joint compound.,
Use fine sandpaper (about 120-grit) to go over the walls to ensure a smooth surface before painting.",How to Paint Over Wallpaper1," TSP stands for tri-sodium phosphate; it's an excellent cleaning agent that is often used after mineral spirits, but can absolutely be used on its own.









TSP substitutes, often sodium carbonate based, are used largely for environmental reasons, but are less effective at removing oil and grime than TSP. Still, they are perfectly acceptable to use in this instance.;
, Make sure you give wall adequate time to dry after rinsing and wiping.








, Imperfections will be much more visible after the wallpaper is painted, so it's a good idea to hit those before you apply a coat of primer or paint.









Rub your hand along the wall to feel for bumps and tears in the paper.
All of the wallpaper should be securely attached to the wall. Check all seams and edges to ensure that no pieces are peeling or loose.
Use wallpaper paste to glue down any sections that are coming loose.

, You may need to apply several layers of joint compound, as the compound often shrinks when dried. You can always sand away excess compound — you can't add more once you begin painting.








, Primer and paint attaches better to sanded areas. A symptom of inadequate sanding is the appearance of small air bubbles on the surface of the wall; this is a clear sign that you haven't sanded the wallpaper enough.









Wipe off all dust with tack cloth after final sanding. Dust and grit will mar the final look of the wall if too much is left while painting.

Sand the walls where the wallpaper will be hung.,
Use a light touch, moving the sandpaper over the areas just enough to smooth out any imperfections in the wall and add some texture to ultra-smooth paints.,
Locate and fill any cracks in the wall where the wallpaper will be hung with wall compound.

,
Smooth the compound on with a margin trowel.

,
Scrape off any excess so the repair is flat.

Apply a sealer to the wallpaper (optional).,
Tape areas where you do not want to paint, such as baseboards and window trim.,
Prime the entire wallpapered area with an oil-based or shellac primer.,
Paint the walls following manufacturer recommendations for application and drying time.,
Remove the painter's tape from the wall and inspect your work.",How to Paint Over Wallpaper2," This will help prevent the wallpaper from possibly loosening after it is painted. Make sure to use an oil-based or shellac sealer, not a water-based sealer. Water-based sealers may cause the wallpaper to loosen from its bearing, defeating the purpose of sealing.








, Make sure that no spaces exist in these areas, as paint may bleed through, covering unwanted edges and corners.








, Again, stay away from water-based primers. Once dry, give the wallpaper a light sand using fine-grit sandpaper, paying special attention to the areas where spackle or compound was applied.









Follow manufacturer instructions for application methods and drying time.
Check over walls after primer is dry for any possible damage that might have been missed earlier. If holes or tears are detected, apply spackle again and re-coat the area with primer.

, Instead of a latex-based paint, many professionals prefer using an oil-based paint for these situations, as the moisture in latex may eventually unhinge some of the wallpaper under the coat of paint.









Apply two coats of paint for best results. Wait one full day before applying the second coat, and lightly sand the first coat for best results.

, You should have a beautifully painted wall, in which the wallpaper underneath is no longer visible.

Remove the tape and paper carefully as soon as the paint dries.

",How to Paint Around a Wallpaper Border,"


Clean the border with a damp cloth if it’s dirty and let it dry.
Look at the edges and seams to make sure they are flat and adhered to the wall. Repair any curling or loose places with a little wallpaper paste and let them dry.;
,, Try to make your cut lines as straight as possible.


Cut through the paper while it’s on the role if you can to save time. Slide out the cardboard tube most paper is rolled on to make it easier to cut.
If you unroll the paper to cut it, you will need to measure and mark the roll as you unwind it so that you get a straight line when you cut.

, Line the bottom edge of the cut paper up to the bottom edge of the wallpaper border so that about 1/8” (1/3 cm) of the border is showing at the bottom.

,,


The tape should cover the tiny edge of border paper left showing but not extend beyond it.
Make sure there are no gaps, bubbles or curled areas along the edge of the tape.
At the corners overlap the papers slightly.

,, Use a brush or trim size paint roller.


Try not to get much paint on the paper covering the border. Large amounts of paint might seep through or under the paper.
Make sure the paint line is slightly over the tape. That is so there will be none of the old paint color showing when you lift the tape off.

, Clean cobwebs and dust with a damp, not wet, sponge. Do not use wax- or oil-based cleaners or polishes. If the surface of imitation-wood paneling is peeling, remove all loose strips.

, Carefully remove any edge trim, so that it can be replaced after the wall is papered. Remove outlet covers and switch covers. Some people like to fill the paneled grooves with wood putty or spackling. This is not necessary when using the proper paper.

, Special primer is available where you buy wallpaper.

, Confirm that the corner is vertically square. Use a simple level.Measure the height of wall. Cut first strip of paper slightly longer than necessary. You will trim later.

, With clean water, saturate the adhesive, but not the paper, very damp but not dripping. You can use a specially-purchased tray or your bathtub. Some paperers use a spray bottle of water or a wet sponge. Set the strip of paper, adhesive toward the wall, working from top to bottom, aligning vertically. Smooth the paper to the wall with a dry brush or dry towel. Do not set any wrinkles. Smooth trapped air bubbles to edge of paper to escape. Wet the back of the paper after cutting, apply on the wall as before. Align to first strip. If you cannot get adjoining edges to line up perfectly, it is better to overlap them slightly than to leave a gap between them.

, Before cutting second strip of paper, make sure any designs on the paper are matched up. This may mean you will need to leave several inches of waste area so that patterns will match.Trim excess paper when wall is finished. Replace edge trim and outlet covers.

Wipe off any excess glue.",How to Hang Border Wallpaper," You can hang the border immediately below the ceiling or crown molding, along the top or bottom third of the wall, or halfway down a wall. Choose the location based on your preferences.;
, Use soapy water to thoroughly clean the area where you want to hang the wallpaper. Make sure there is no dust, hair or other particles on the wall in that area. Allow it to dry fully before proceeding.


Remove any mildew from the walls with a mixture of 2 cups (.473 liters) bleach per 1 gallon (3.785 liter) of water. Hanging wallpaper border over mildew will cover mildew, but not kill it.
If you wish, you can also sand the paint on the walls where you will hang your wallpaper. This roughens the surface and helps the wallpaper to stick but is optional.

, Fill in any holes or cracks with joint compound and then sand the areas to smooth them. Clean the area of any dust after sanding by using a damp sponge.

, If you are hanging along the top ceiling or crown molding then you can simply use that edge as your level.


Make sure you use a level when marking the location of a border along the middle of the wall or else you could hang the wallpaper crooked.

, Use the width of your border to measure the distance between the edges. Again use a level to mark this bottom edge of your wallpaper border.

, Measure the length of each wall with a measuring tape. Add these numbers together for the overall length of the walls. Read the total length each roll will cover, and divide the overall length of your walls by that number.


Be sure to buy 15 percent more than the actual area requires, because you'll need extra to match the patterns together.
You must measure all four walls individually because most corners are not perfectly square.

, Paint the primer along the strip where you would like to hang the wallpaper. Different primers should be applied differently so you should read the instructions from the manufacturer of your primer for specifics.


Allow it to dry but not to sit for longer than 24 hours without applying the border.
Be careful not to stray outside your lines because the primer can stain the walls.

, Cut a piece of wallpaper to the length you will need to cover one wall plus a little extra. When you install border wallpaper, you want to have extra paper for trimming on the ends.


Remember to measure each wall individually for accurate measurements.

, Roll the wallpaper border into a loose tube shape so that the adhesive is facing outwards.

, Different types of wallpaper borders will need to be prepared differently. Follow the instructions that are particular to your wallpaper. Pre-pasted wallpaper is usually the simplest option but unpasted wallpaper can also work.


Pre-pasted wallpaper usually needs to be wet, meaning you should soak it in water for no more than 30 seconds.
Unpasted wallpaper will require an appropriate paste. If you are hanging the border on a painted wall then you can use a standard wallpaper paste, but if you are hanging the border on a wall with wallpaper on it already then you should use a vinyl-to-vinyl wallpaper paste. Stretch out the border wallpaper and apply the paste generously onto the backside., Pull the end of the wallpaper from the water, unrolling it from the tube as you do so. After you have pulled a few feet (or about one meter) from the water fold it back on itself with the pattern on the outside. Continue this, always bringing the adhesive sides together until you have several folds together as if in an accordion.


Be careful to be gentle; you do not want to crease the corners.

, Booking the wallpaper border into an accordion shape keeps the paper moist so that it soaks up the liquid and activates the adhesive. You must allow the border to sit for a few minutes to allow the paper to relax and expand., You will want to start with the wall that contains the least visible corner of the room. Later on the wallpapers may meet up in a visible seam at this corner so choose a corner that is the least visible.


Alternatively you can start at the edge of the entry door to prevent there being any uneven seams at all., Starting in the least visible corner unfold one end of the wallpaper and apply it to the wall. You want the edge of the wallpaper to cover the corner and go into the next wall by at least ½ inch (1 cm).


If you have a line drawn on the wall then the wallpaper border should just barely cover the upper line.
If you are applying the wallpaper just below the ceiling then you should use the edge of the ceiling to align the wallpaper border.

, This will smooth out wrinkles and bubbles and make the wallpaper lie flat. Be careful as you smooth down the wallpaper because it can rotate slightly and become unaligned. Continuously check that you border stays aligned with the ceiling or level along the wall.

, Keep hanging the wallpaper border until you reach the end of the wall and your piece of wallpaper. The wallpaper should extend completely into the corner and onto the next wall.


Trim the excess wallpaper on the next wall to ¼ inch (6 mm) using a sharp knife or razor and a straight edge. Line up something hard and straight along the edge of the wallpaper and drag the razor down the edge.

, Measure the next wall and cut the next piece of wallpaper border so that it will match up with the pattern on the first strip with a little bit of overlap. Cut the border wallpaper to the length of the wall, reverse roll it, put it in water for a short time and let it sit to absorb the moisture and expand and relax.


To install border wallpaper, you need to align the patterns up so no one will notice a break in the design. This is why you must choose where you cut your piece of wallpaper for the next wall.

, Overlap the ¼ inch (6 mm) of the first strip on the wall and continue hanging the border on the wall. Remember to keep it level as you hang it. Smooth it out with the wallpaper brush until the end of the piece of wallpaper. Push this border into the corner and into the next wall at the end of the strip.

, Remove the overlap at the first corner where you put the new strip of wallpaper over the top of the first piece of wallpaper. Take a razor and cut through the upper layer directly at the edge of the border wallpaper so that the two edges line up perfectly.


When hanging wallpaper border, you want nice, clean edges that match perfectly with each other.

, Continue with the following strips of wallpaper border until you have finished all the walls of the room. Use the same processes for each of the following strips of wallpaper, making sure you remove all the bubbles and making the seams clean and sharp.

, As you hang the wallpaper around the walls you should remove any excess glue along the edges of the border. Use a damp sponge to gently wash away this excess.

, Generally, large prints don’t work in small rooms because they make them feel smaller.

, Small prints exaggerate the size of the room, while light colors reflect light, adding to the spacious feeling.

, It is best to use a wall without windows and other fixtures in this case.

, This will allow you to inquire about the best methods and tips for using it. You will be able to call the store if you have any questions throughout the process.

, If you need to order more, they may be able to match the color to the exact printing that you used previously., Each paper is slightly different. When in doubt, use the specific directions rather than general directions for wallpapering.

,, To make your own, rest a three by six-foot (0.9m by 1.5m) piece of three-fourths inch (1.9cm) plywood on top of two sawhorses. Sand the corners of the plywood to avoid tearing.


Basswood and plywood are like a self-healing mat, allowing you to cut into the surface of the paper with a utility knife without ruining the paper.

, Large pieces can be slightly unwieldy.

, You should make a mark every six inches (15cm) or so, to ensure you hang a sheet to be completely level. Don’t trust ceilings, floors, trim or windows, since many of them are hung without being perfectly level.


You will want to start hanging your wallpaper in the least conspicuous area of the room.

, Cover the floor in drop cloths. The water and paste can drip off the table and onto floors.

, You will need to apply patching compound and sand it if there are holes. Wash the wall with trisodium phosphate (TSP) or a TSP substitute.

,


For exceptionally uneven walls, you may want to apply special “liner paper” over them before pasting wallpaper.

, Cut it to the length of your wall, adding four inches (10cm) of extra space, or two for the top and two for the bottom.

, This means the prepasted side, usually white side, should be toward the outside., Place it at the bottom end of your worktable.

, Soak it for about 30 seconds, or the time recommended by the manufacturer.

, The patterned/colored side should be facing up.

, They should not be creased, just coerced slightly in toward the pasted side. This is called “booking.”

, During this time, the wallpaper expands. Laying the paper too soon will cause it to expand on the wall and create gaps., Ensure the pattern is right side up.

, Use your plumb marks on the wall to line it up. Then, leave about two inches (5cm) of extra paper above the trim to remove later.

, The size on the walls should allow you to slide it to an exact position.

, Brush the bubbles out toward the sides. Repeat until the wallpaper is smoothed to the wall.

, Always smooth from top to bottom and from the center toward the sides.

,, Cut with one clean motion against the top edge of the putty knife using a utility knife. Keep your utility blade as horizontal as possible as you cut.


Replace the blade after cutting the trim off two pieces of wallpaper. Sharp blades are essential to avoid tearing.

, Make sure you align it with the plumb line and with the previous strips of wallpaper. Pay attention to manufacturer directions on how to match up the pattern.

, Then, cut from the center of the fixture toward the corners. Trim the paper with our utility knife and putty knife.

Press the wallpaper into place.,
Trim leftover panels to fill in bare spots.,
Smooth the wallpaper down.,
Loosen the upper corners of each panel.,
Peel off the wallpaper.,
Wipe the wall clean.",How to Hang Removable Wallpaper," Start by measuring the wall (or walls) you want to redesign, then divide that number by the width of a single panel of wallpaper (the distance from one side to the other when you hold it vertically). This will give you an accurate approximation of how many rolls will be required to completely cover the wall.Measure at least twice. That way, you can be absolutely certain that the measurements you’re using are correct.It’s a good idea to buy roughly 15% more paper than you think you’ll need to leave a little wiggle room for mistakes and last minute patch ups.Most temporary wallpaper panels will be between 36-48 inches tall and 18−24 inches (−61 cm) wide.;
, Before you begin hanging, go over the wall from top to bottom to prepare it. This will clear away any dirt or greasy residue and help the adhesive backing of the wallpaper stick. Give the wall time to dry completely before you begin hanging the wallpaper.A preliminary cleaning is recommended any time you’re hanging wallpaper, but will be especially important in rooms where there may be heavier buildup on the walls, such as the kitchen or bathroom.
Don’t forget to remove any light switches, plate covers and other protruding objects from the wall prior to diving into the project., Depending on the size of the room, you can either work directly from one end of the wall to the other or start from the center and move outwards. To create a more seamless finish, the section where you start should be the focal point of the room.Starting from the corner will keep you from having to cut the paper to fit bare spots later on, while starting from the center highlights the smoothest, cleanest section of the pattern right in the middle of the wall.

, Use a level to find the wall’s precise vertical and horizontal planes and trace along the outer edge with a pencil. Try to make this mark as close to the molding as you can—it will serve as a consistent reference point all the way across the wall.This is the best way to ensure that the wallpaper will go on straight, since there may be slight imperfections in the molding.
Be careful not to draw the line so dark that it’s visible through the wallpaper.

, Peel the first 2-3 inches of wallpaper away from the paper backing. Line up the free edge with the pencil mark you just made and run your thumb along the edge to secure it. From here, you can begin smoothing on the rest of the panel without worrying about it being crooked.Double check that the edge of the paper is flush with the molding and totally straight before sticking it down.

, Pull the backing away from the roll as you go, working your way down the wall a little at a time. After every few feet, slide your hand over the panel, applying enough pressure to make sure the adhesive holds. Repeat the process with the remaining panels until the wall is completely covered.It can help to have a second person tack on the wallpaper as you peel away the backing, or vice versa.Smooth the panel from the center outwards. This will push air bubbles to the edges, making them easier to erase.

, Measure the exposed area, then cut a leftover panel to the corresponding width using a pair of scissors or X-acto knife. Do your best to line up the edges of the individual panels. Cut the wallpaper where the pattern repeats to make the edges easier to blend.Wallpapers with small, busy patterns will generally make misalignments less obvious.If you’re hanging the wallpaper on a particularly tall section of wall, it may be necessary to trim the paper to fit at the bottom as well.

, Once the wall is covered, use a dry squeegee or craft brayer to make sure each panel is lying perfectly flat. Be sure to work out any visible air bubbles or creases. By the time you’re finished, your wall will have been transformed with minimal time and effort.Deal with large or stubborn air pockets by deflating them with a safety pin, then smooth out the surrounding area.
Use an X-acto knife to cut openings for light switches and wall outlets., Use a fingernail to pry away the edges of the wallpaper where they meet the molding. Keep peeling slowly until you have enough to grab onto. As when you were applying the wallpaper, focus on one panel at a time.You may need to use a putty knife, scraper or similar tool to get the edges started., Pull the paper down and away from the wall in one smooth motion. Because of the low-strength adhesive used to secure removable wallpaper, you should be able to easily strip each section in a single piece. Crumple up the used panels and throw them away. It’s that easy!Peel the paper from the top, rather than the bottom or sides, so that you’re working with gravity.
Should any tearing occur, rip off the piece and proceed carefully to prevent further damage.

, Take a damp washcloth to the wall everywhere that the wallpaper touched. Let the surface dry completely before making any other modifications. It will then be clean and ready to adorn with the next pattern that catches your eye.When removed correctly, temporary wallpapers shouldn’t leave behind stains, glue marks or any other kind of residue. Even so, it won't hurt to give the wall a quick once-over.
If the panels are still in good condition, consider finding uses for them in other rooms of your home."

Calculate the area of the project.,
Choose the wallpaper pattern.,
Look at the wallpaper packaging or on the back of the sample to find out the repeat length of a drop pattern.,
Verify the number of square feet each roll covers.,
Reduce the total usable square footage on a roll to account for a drop pattern, if applicable.,
Calculate the number of single rolls needed.,
Determine how many rolls of wallpaper to buy.",How to Estimate the Amount of Wallpaper Needed,"


Measure the length and height of each wall you wish to cover in wallpaper. Subtract doorways and large windows from the total length. You can round the length measurement up to the nearest half foot or foot (or meter) to make it easier to calculate.
Multiply the length and width of each wall to get the area in square feet.
Add up the area of each wall to get your total area.
Increase the total area by 15 percent to account for waste.;
, You won't be able to estimate the amount of wallpaper needed until you know whether it has a straight match or drop pattern.


A straight pattern has either white paper or a continuous stripe of color along the edge, so that there's no pattern to match up to the next piece when you hang it. This type of pattern will require the least amount of wallpaper.
When the pattern is different along the right and left edge, you have to take the pattern into account when hanging the wallpaper. This requires cutting a piece off the top at times, so you can shift it up and match it to the pattern on the piece you just hung. This drop pattern requires ordering more wallpaper because the part you cut off the top is often wasted.

, Measure it yourself just to be sure it's correct.

, In the U.S., a standard single roll covers 36 square feet (3.35 square meters). European standard rolls cover 29 square feet (2.7 square meters).

, (If the wallpaper has a straight match, all 36 square feet are usable.) Use the following guideline to determine how much wallpaper is usable on a single roll:


A drop pattern of 0 to 6 inches (0.0 to 15.2 cm) has 25 square feet (2.3 square meters) of usable wallpaper.
A drop pattern of 7 to 12 inches (17.8 to 30.5 cm) has 22 square feet (2 square meters) of usable wallpaper.
A drop pattern of 13 to 18 inches (33.0 to 45.7 cm) has 20 square feet (1.8 square meters) of usable wallpaper.
A drop pattern of 19 to 23 inches (48.3 to 58.4 cm) leaves only half a single roll as usable.

, Divide your estimated total square footage by the number of usable square feet on a roll to get the number of single rolls needed for the project.

, Although wallpaper is priced as a single roll, most manufacturers sell it as a double or triple roll. If the wallpaper is sold as a double roll, divide the number of single rolls by 2. If the wallpaper is sold as a triple roll, divide by 3.

Coated fabric wallpaper is sometimes covered with an acrylic or vinyl covering that is easily washable. Plain paper wallpaper should not get wet. If possible, you should spot-clean it.You can scrub vinyl wallpaper, but you need to make sure that you don’t clean with anything abrasive. You wouldn’t want to use a rough sponge, for example.
Clean walls that don’t have protective coating with a dry sponge. A dry sponge, which contains no moisture, gently gets rid of the dirt on your wallpaper. ;
, Mix a small amount of dish soap, about two table spoons worth, with warm water in a bucket. Use clear soap to avoid staining the wallpaper with colored detergent. Dip a soft cloth or sponge in the cleaning solution. Wring out the excess cleaner into the bucket. Test the cleaning solution by dabbing a bit of it on an inconspicuous area. If it doesn’t damage the wallpaper, start the cleaning process. Wipe the surface from the top to the bottom. Clean in the direction of the vertical seams. Clean one section at a time in a circular motion.


Don’t overuse soap. Using a large amount of soap will make dirt stick to walls.
You may not want to use scrubbing pads because they are usually too harsh for wallpaper
Testing the cleaning solution in a small, hidden area prevents you from damaging the entire wall in case the cleaner turns out to be destructive. The surface near the baseboards is rarely noticeable to others, and is a good spot to test.

, This is where the second bucket comes in. Using the water from that bucket and a new cloth, rinse each section with clean water. Don’t use too much water; you don’t want to end up with damp walls. With a terry-cloth towel, dry the surface immediately after to prevent the wallpaper from soaking up too much moisture and tearing.

, The most efficient method for removing dust from your walls is vacuuming.Attach a wall brush extension to your vacuum before you start. Depending on the length of your extension, you may want to use a ladder to reach the higher spots of your wall. This extension will keep you from scratching your walls. Begin at the top of the wall and do a few sections at a time. Gently brush until you have completed the entire wall.


As long as you don’t rub your vacuum on the wallpaper, you can generally use the vacuum on fabric wallpaper.

, Find a cloth, preferably a micro fiber dusting cloth, and put it over a broom. Swipe the broom over the wall from left to right. This method will help you reach the dusty corners of your walls. Move the broom, clearing dust as you go, from the top of the wall to the bottom. You want to make sure that you leave no surface untouched.


If dust builds up on the floor, sweep it up.

, Wipe the walls directly with it. If your walls are high, you may want to get a step ladder in order to reach the corners. Start at the top and clear off the dust that you see. As you move down, make sure that your cloth has not become too dirty. A dirty cloth will smudge your walls.

, Use a putty knife and scrape away the excess crayon. Any loose bits that stick out should be ripped away. Once the surface is cleared, place paper towels over the stain. Now, press an iron set to its lowest heat on top of the stain. Wait for a minute, until the residual crayon seeps into the towels. Remove the towels and the stain should come off.


If you have washable wallpaper, then you should spray a washcloth with the solution you used to clean the walls. Then, gently wipe the stains until they disappear.

, Find an art gum eraser. With this eraser, gently rub at the wall. The eraser should absorb the oil and dirt left by fingerprints.If you have vinyl wallpaper, you can use soap and water to wash these prints away. Create a dish soap and water solution in a bowl. Put a cloth into the bowl to wet it. Then, use the cloth to wash the prints off the wall.


You can use a piece of bread to clear the wall.Take a piece of bread and leave it on the prints for a minute. Then, remove the bread from the wall. The gluten in the bread should remove the stains from the wallpaper.

, First, place paper towels over stains. Run a iron on a low heat setting over the paper towels.The grease should seep into the paper towels. Remove the towels to dislodge the stains.


Talcum powder can also work. Pour talcum powder on a washcloth. Apply talcum powder onto the wall with the cloth. Let the powder sit for 10 minutes. Remove the powder from the wall with a dry sponge or brush.

, Wet a rag with dish soap and peroxide. Using the rag, apply this combination to the wall. The combination should stick to stain. Leave it there for five minutes. Use a damp towel to wipe off the stain, then dry the area with a paper towel.


If this does not work, then you can attempt to get rid of the stain with sodium percarbonate cleaner that will whiten the spot.Dip a rag into this cleaner and then put it on the stain for four to six minutes. Then remove the rag, the stain should be gone. With a wet clean cloth or towel, clear the spot. Dry the spot afterwards by patting at it with a dry cloth."

Adjust the curtains as needed.",How to Buy Soundproofing Curtains," Start by determining the size of the curtains. Measure the area where you plan to hang the curtains. Use a tape measure to get the length, width, and height of the area. Make sure you add a few inches on each side of the window for the curtains to fall.


Write down the measurements so you can refer to them when you go shopping for the curtains.
Often, soundproofing curtains will come in standard sizes to fit the dimensions of a window.;
, Soundproofing curtains are usually made of quilted fiberglass or rockwool to help block out sound. They may also be coated in vinyl, making them stiff and soundproof. In order to provide a barrier against noise, soundproof curtains should be at least 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) thick.Because of the materials used, soundproof curtains are usually very heavy, weighing at least 15 to 20 lbs. (6.8 to 9.07 kg).
Some companies allow you to custom make the soundproofing curtains. You can choose the color, material, and cut of the curtains. However, this will usually cost more money that standard soundproofing curtains.

, As an alternative to heavy duty soundproofing curtains, you can get heavy blackout curtains instead. Blackout curtains help to block out light and noise in a space. They are often made of thick material and are lighter than heavy duty soundproofing curtains.Blackout curtains are also often cheaper than heavy duty soundproofing curtains.

, Heavy duty soundproofing curtains can be found online on sound equipment sites. Look for curtains that are within your price range and make sure they are made of soundproofing materials like fiberglass, rockwool, or vinyl.

You can also order custom soundproofing curtains for your space online. You should be able to pick the thickness and style of the curtains to suit your needs.

, You likely will not find soundproofing curtains at your local hardware store. Instead, you will need to look for them at sound equipment stores.You can also shop for the curtains at music supply stores, as soundproofing curtains are popular with musicians and sound engineers.
You can go to big box stores to by blackout curtains.

, Bring a flashlight with you to the store and shine it on the curtains. If you can see the light behind the curtains, they are likely not very soundproof. Real soundproof, blackout curtains will absorb all direct light and sound.You should also feel the weight of the curtains to make sure they are thick and heavy enough.

, Talk to the salesperson about getting a warranty for the curtains, especially if they are expensive. If you get the curtains custom made, you may not be able to get a warranty for them or be allowed to return them.

, Soundproofing curtains are heavier than typical household curtains. They need to be installed on thick curtain rods with heavy duty tracks and brackets. Shop for these items online or at a sound equipment store.If you buy the curtains in person, you can discuss installing the curtains with the salesperson. They can recommend good rods, tracks, and brackets for the curtains.

, Once you install the curtains, test them out to ensure they work properly. Try playing music just behind the curtain or make noise outside to see if the curtain absorbs the sound. Notice if the curtains block out all noise or only very loud noise., If the curtains are not working as you’d like, do not be afraid to trade them in or replace them for something better. Go back to the place of purchase and discuss other options for soundproofing in your home."

Wash any dirt or film away from the wall you want to decorate.,

Pour fabric starch into a clean pan and start at the top of the wall.,
Begin smoothly laying your cut fabric onto the starch from the top of the wall.,
Continue applying starch and smoothing the fabric down the wall.,
Apply starch evenly to the fabric itself.,
Wait for the fabric to dry completely.",How to Make Wallpaper1," A clean rag and some multi-purpose cleaner should do the job just fine. Let the wall dry for a day or so before you cover it.


If you don't have a standard multi-purpose cleaner laying around, some mild soap and water will work, too.;
, Add 2 more inches (5 cm) to the measured height to add some wiggle room when you apply it to the wall. This is especially important for odd-shaped walls and walls with windows..


Measure the width, too. If you’re using panels, this is doubly important. You’ll want to be sure the width of the wall doesn’t leave your last panel at an awkward width – if it does, you may need to make a few cuts for it to line up.

, You have two options here: one giant panel taking up your entire wall or several panels lining up with each other. If you choose the latter, be sure to match up any design on the fabric to maintain an even pattern before cutting the next panel.


Alternatively, cut the fabric into panels so that they meet the width of the wall. For example, if your wall is 60"" wide, you'll want five 12"" panels. The main advantage of this (if not the only advantage) is that they’re easier to work with and symmetrical. However, there will be seams and lining up that you’ll have to worry about.

, This is the stuff that turns your normal, everyday fabric into something stiffer that’ll pass as wallpaper. Use a sponge or paint roller to apply starch to the top half of the wall. A thin, even layer is best. Try to keep dripping to a minimum.Only do this if you have time to put up your panels afterward. You don't want to do this, have to leave, and come back to a dry wall that needs re-starched.

, This is easiest to do with at least two people – one person can place while the other smoothes out the bubbles.


Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric overlapping the ceiling. Temporarily hold the fabric in place with pushpins as it dries.

, Once the top half is done, apply starch to the bottom of the wall and start smoothing the fabric slowly over it in a downward motion. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric overlapping the bottom edge of the wall.


If any windows or doors are set into the wall, leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of extra fabric around them as well.
If you’re applying multiple panels, make sure the side edges line up just how you like them. It may take a minute to get perfect, but it’s a minute of work now for a lifetime of non-regret later.

, Don’t worry – it’ll soak in and won’t change the look of your wallpaper. When it dries, it will disappear and leave the top stiff, too. Again, apply it evenly in a thin layer.


Brush or smooth away wrinkles and bubbles in the fabric as you go. Any wrinkles or bubbles will be incredibly obvious and may ruin the look you’re going for.

, When it is, trim away the excess fabric from the tops and bottoms of walls and around windows or doors. For the record, it’s easier to create a hard, straight line with a box cutter or razor blade than scissors.


And that's it! Enjoy your newly wallpapered walls.

If the walls are square, you can add the lengths of the wall together, then multiply this number by the height of the walls to calculate the total area.
At the store, read the total area each roll of wallpaper covers and divide the area of your room by this number to estimate how many rolls to purchase. When hanging wallpaper, you will use more than the actual area of the room because you need to match the patterns on the wall, so buy extra.;
, Wallpaper comes in many different materials, featuring lots of different features to consider, depending on the job and the room. Some are more difficult to hang, while some are easy for the first-time user.



Vinyl wallpaper is the most common variety, and is easy to hang and remove. Canvas-backed vinyl paper is moisture-resistent and versatile, making it very appropriate for hanging in bathrooms and basements. It's generally prepped with adhesive, which means it's easy to hang and handle.

Embossed wallpaper is textured and patterned, making it ideal for covering the imperfections in walls. It's also easy to paint over and lined with adhesive, which means it'll be versatile for years to come.

Textile-based wallpaper is more difficult to hang, because you'll have to hang with clear adhesive paste, which is more time-consuming but also gives you more control over the final product. Flocked textile wallpaper features raised patterns for a professional effect, but are difficult to clean., While it'll take some extra time to hang, patterned wallpaper can add a unique theme to any room. If you want to buy a wallpaper with a distinctive pattern, make sure you take care to match-up the pattern and avoid clashing. You can also make the room seem larger using patterned wallpaper.



Use horizontal patterns to make the room seem wider. If you've got a tall and skinny room, you can make it seem cozier using horizontal patterns. Imperfectly squared rooms, however, can be affected slightly by using horizontally-patterend wallpaper, making it seem worse.

Use vertical patterns to make the ceiling seem higher. If you've got low ceilings, vertical-patterning can help trick the eye.

, In general, if you can, you'll want to get self-adhesive wallpaper, which is the easiest to install. To do so, you'll simply peel the adhesive strip off the back of the paper and press it firmly and evenly onto the wall, making it super-easy to use. Other varieties are often more involved.



Pre-pasted wallpaper is similar to self-adhesive, except you need to activate the paste on the back of the paper, usually with water or another activator provided by the manufacturer.

Dryback wallpaper requires that you also purchase wallpaper adhesive to use in the hanging of the paper. These types of wallpaper are often more intricate and expensive, but also more difficult to hang, especially alone.

, To protect the outlets and yourself, it's best to remove the panels to ensure for a clean-looking paper installation, and to tape over the outlets to protect them. Put small pieces of tape over the outlets and switches, enough to cover them.


Since you'll use water to activate the wallpaper glue, it's necessary to turn off the electricity in the room or you risk dangerous electrocution, or ruining the outlets. Make sure to turn off the electricity.

, Begin stripping sections of the paper off to get a sense of what variety of wallpaper you're dealing with (self-adhesive is much easier to remove) and use a putty knife if necessary to get it started. Peel all the paper off carefully, getting as much of it off the wall as possible, and scraping away any remaining adhesive underneath.


Save a substantial amount of time to remove the wallpaper. This can take a much longer time than putting up new wallpaper, so don't save it all for one day or you'll end up frustrated.
If the wallpaper is older, it may be more tenacious and require that you use a belt sander to help remove the wallpaper and adhesive, depending on the wall underneath.

, Start by cleaning the walls with a regular household cleaner and letting it dry thoroughly before inspecting the walls for mildew. It's very important to eradicate any mildew before hanging wallpaper, since wallpapering over existing mildew will cause it to spread. Remove any mildew you find with a mixture of 2 cups (.473 l) bleach per 1 gallon (3.785 l) of water.

, While you've got the chance, it's best to smooth up the wall before you paper over it. Apply wall putty to any cracks or holes in the wall with a putty knife, then wait for it to dry. Afterward, sand it smooth with fine-grit sandpaper.

, Paint the primer on evenly with a brush before you install wallpaper. The primer will help the paper adhere to the walls more effectively and will provide a solid foundation for your wallpaper.

, Measure a distance that's 2 inches (5.08 cm) shorter than the width of the paper on the wall next to the doorway. Mark this spot lightly with a pencil. Use a carpenter's level and pencil to draw a vertical line from the ceiling to the floor bisecting your mark. You will use this line as a starting point when hanging wallpaper., Apply wallpaper paste to the back of the paper, or if using pre-pasted wallpaper, follow the manufacturer's directions to hang appropriately. Scissors are perfectly appropriate for cutting wallpaper.

, Begin at the ceiling, leaving about 2 inches (5.08 cm) hanging over the top and below the floor. Carefully line up the wallpaper and press firmly into the wall to secure it.

, To wallpaper a room properly, you need to eliminate wrinkles as thoroughly as possible, or the wallpaper will look uneven and bubbly. Smooth the paper from the middle out, using enough pressure to force the bubbles out through the edges.


If you do create some wrinkles inadvertently, carefully pull a piece of the paper away from the wall until you reach the wrinkle, and press it out slowly.

, Align the next piece to the first piece. When hanging wallpaper, it's important to match the patterns together as closely as possible, if you're using patterned wallpaper. To line them up, start at a middle point to get them as close as possible and trim off the excess at the top and bottom.


Trim the top and bottom of each piece of paper. When you install wallpaper, be careful not to tear it. Use a putty knife to press the paper tight against the wall, and cut the extra off with a razor blade.

, When you wallpaper a room, you want to ensure you have enough adhesive on the seams to prevent the paper from peeling, so be very careful not to push too hard and squeeze out the glue or adhesive underneath.

, Wipe off the excess glue with a wet sponge after letting the wallpaper set for at least 15 minutes, then make sure the seam points are clean and without unsightly excess glue.

Check aluminum siding for dents, cracks or oxidization.",How to Repair Siding1,"


Small dents can be filled in with some putty, sanded smooth and touched up with paint to match the siding.
It is easier to replace pieces of siding with large cracks and breaks than by attempting to repair it. Replace by cutting out the broken piece with an electric saw and inserting a new piece cut to size. When cutting out the broken piece, mask off the edge you are cutting with masking tape to prevent it from tearing.
Repair oxidization by rubbing lightly with a fine grade of steel wool and polishing the area with aluminum polish.;

Hang the photo wallpaper.",How to Turn Your Favorite Photo Into Wallpaper," As already noted, the photo needs to be something you can live with for years to come and be something that will blend seamlessly with existing décor and furnishings. Avoid anything that will date quickly and steer well clear of photos of people who may be here today but gone tomorrow––after all, staring at your ex won't endear you to staying in that room! Images that tend to work well include:


Repeated features, such as similar trees in a wood or forest landscape or pebbles on the sand.
Landscapes, such as a favorite cityscape, beach, view from your summer cabin, etc. can make ideal wall features.
Sunsets, sunrise, moonscapes, stars, etc. are all possibilities for a wall photo.
Your child's artwork or a piece of art by someone in the family.
If you do want to include people, such as your children, have them as part of a wider landscape so that they're not the focus point. It can be overwhelming for them to see themselves blown up large, and it can also date quickly.;
, A crisp, clear photo that can be expanded without losing its integrity is vital for wallpaper images––every blur and unfocused element will be increased when the image is enlarged. Grainy or old photos may seem like a cool effect, but consider carefully how such images will work if expanded.

, Part of the photo choice will be guided by where your feature wall is going to be. Is this for your living room or a game room? Elegance in the living or dining room is a must, so a full sized photo of the Denver Broncos won't be the best placement for this area but might be absolutely ideal for the man cave. Match the content of the photo to the right room.


This article recommends a feature wall rather than covering all four walls of a room. You're free to do so of course, but be aware that more than one wall in a room covered in a photo will often look overwhelming.

, Once you’ve chosen your photo, walk away for a few days and then return. At the time, your heart may be saying one thing, but a few days later, your head may ask, “What was I thinking?” These few days of thinking it over will save you from making a rash decision, as this will be a big change to your home's décor.


On the whole, this is likely to be an expensive exercise, so part of your reflection should include a focus on the budget you have for this feature wall. Find out about the costs before getting too involved.

, While the photo may already be adequate (in which case, skip to the next step), enhancing it is one way of adding features that you think might improve the ability of the photo to blend in with the room's décor. Some possible enhancements to toy with include:

Try black and white with a splash of color. Using your computer photo software, add color to an unexpected spot on your black and white photo. From eye color to perhaps even a building in a skyline, a very small hint of accent color (that matches with the intended room) can add interest.






Create an old-looking photo out of a brand new one. Perhaps you want to “age” the photo and give it a more heirloom-type look. You can use either your internal software or use a program like Instagram to add a different take on the new photo.






Turn your photo into what appears to be a painting. Some software can actually transform a regular photo into a watercolor or oil type painting in only a matter of seconds. For a more sophisticated room, try different paint types; the end look can be extremely pleasing.






A border can be an excellent feature, to show where the image ends and where the wall resumes. Additionally, a border allows you the freedom to create photo wallpaper that covers only a part of the wall, rather than the entire wall. This means that you might consider an enormously enlarged photo (say, of your children), that is placed carefully in the middle of the featured wall and nothing else is added to the wall, just the paintwork serving as a frame around the border of the photo.







, The photo dimensions must be accurate because any part that appears to be missing, too short or too long will be immediately obvious and will ruin the entire appearance. Precision takes effort but is well worth it. If you aren’t good with measurements, consider hiring a handyman to do the job; although this might seem a bit wasteful, having the most exact measurements is key to creating the right effect and will ensure that there isn't waste after the wallpaper has been made.


It's recommended that you choose a wall that isn't oddly shaped or curved unless you're having professionals cover it. Such walls are fairly difficult to get perfectly right and can look dreadful when botched. Moreover, many vendors cannot create custom wallpaper for odd shapes, so you might be forced to do your own cutting for oddly shaped walls, meaning that it could look unprofessional.
See the previous step for the possibility of not covering the entire feature wall, just a part of it. This can reduce costs and may be a lot easier to work with than a whole wall space.

, In addition to the internet (which offers many choices for photo-to-wallpaper conversion), local copy and craft shops may offer this service, so it's advisable to check out both possibilities to see who offers the best deal in your area. Explain clearly what you want done and be sure to give the precise measurements so that they know whether they're up to the task or not.

If ordering online, only use a well-reviewed site or ask friends through Twitter, Facebook, etc. for their recommendations. Only order through trusted sites where you can read reviews and even contact previous clients. Ask how the wallpaper will be shipped to you, shipping costs, paper quality, and the overall turnaround time.






Consider your hometown copy shop. Not only do many local copy shops offer the service of turning photos into wallpaper, some private mail companies and graphic design firms can help you as well.







, Inquire about how to mount the photo wallpaper on your wall. Does the wallpaper mount like typical wallpaper (wallpaper paste) or does it come with a different type of backing, such as self-adhesive or similar? Ask if the adhesion can damage your walls if you decide to remove the wallpaper; this is especially important given that many photo wallpaper types will fade in a few years and need to be removed and replaced––can you be bothered totally repainting the wall after?

Have a complete understanding of application of the wallpaper before ordering it. You don't want to go to all the expense and trouble only to find out that its application is just too hard for you. In general, wallpaper paste is the easiest for self-application; many other backings may require you to get a professional to hang the wallpaper, adding to the final cost.






Ask about the inks and how long the image will last. After all, this is a photo and like most photos, when exposed to sunlight and other sources of light, it will probably fade within a certain space of years. For most people, this is fine as it's a reminder to change it!






Make sure the vendor you select can accommodate any special requests. Review any and all requests with the vendor before placing your order. You may need a special size or certain type of paper type that the vendor doesn’t have. Better to find out beforehand than after you’ve paid and received the product you didn’t want.







, Follow the instructions provided by the retailer who has produced your photo wallpaper. As with any application of wallpaper, ensure that the wall is cleaned properly first and that all traces of old wallpaper or flaking paint have been removed. If you are centering an enlarged photo piece of wallpaper, measure with great care. If you decide that the application is too difficult for you to do, get help from friends or family, or call in a professional. It's better to seek the help than to apply wallpaper unprofessionally––botched wallpaper is instantly obvious to everyone.

Brighten up a room.,
Choose a large- or small-scale pattern.,
Consider the room’s current color scheme.,
Try it out first.,
Wallpaper a whole room.,
Create an accent wall with wallpaper.,
Wallpaper the back of a bookcase.,
Frame pieces of wallpaper.,
Pull colors from the wallpaper.,
Keep the room’s theme in tune with the wallpaper.,
Design with simplicity in mind.",How to Decorate with Marble Wallpaper," Look for patterns with light colors, especially those that have iridescent ink or reflective, metallic accents. Avoid wallpapers that use dark colors if you want the room to appear larger.For example, you may want to add brightness to a dim hallway, or a room that is windowless and/or facing north.
Try a pattern with subtle pastels, neutral colors, and/or a glossy finish.;
, Opt for large-scale patterns for a more formal but intimate look. Large-scale patterns also help a sparsely furnished room look more complete. Pick a small-scale pattern to make a room look more spacious.Small-scale patterns in light, cool colors visually expand the room. For instance, light shades of blue, green, purple, or cool gray.If you want the room to appear smaller, use a large-scale pattern in a warm, dark color. For example, dark shades of red, orange and yellow.

, Take into account the furniture, floor covering and general décor, unless you’re revamping the whole room. Avoid using a busy wallpaper pattern in a room with other bold patterns. You can choose a busy or subtle pattern if your current décor has solid colors for the main pieces, such as furniture.For example, a sofa with a vivid plaid pattern would not pair well with a heavily patterned marble wallpaper.
Area rugs with strong patterns should either be replaced with something more neutral, or paired with an understated pattern.

, Tape a large piece of wallpaper to the wall. Leave it there for a week or so. Then decide if you still love it and want to live with it.Try asking yourself, “Does the wallpaper make the room feel harmonious? Or does it stick out in a bad way?”

, Decide if you’ll paper only the walls, or the walls and the ceilings. Including the ceiling creates a “jewel box” effect. You may appreciate this technique most in a room you visit occasionally, such as a guest bathroom. That way you can enjoy the room’s transformation, as opposed to a more common living area where you’re more likely to get bored with a pattern.A wallpapered ceiling is especially impressive in a room with molding that separates the ceiling from the walls.
Wallpapering an entire room takes a significant amount of effort. You should paint the room with primer first. Consider hiring a contractor for a large wallpapering project if you don’t want to undertake the time and effort yourself.

, Consider a wall that is furthest away from the entrance to the room, as a welcoming way to draw guests in. To make the wall stand out, use contrast: a dark accent wall in a light room or vice versa.Patterned wallpaper helps to camouflage flaws on your wall.A marbled accent wall can be used in a bathroom, kitchen, or even living room or dining room.

, Remove the shelves first, if possible. Otherwise paper the back sections in between the shelves. This creates a focal point with a high-end vibe, adding interest to the room and your bookcase.Try this with a plain bookcase, such as in beige or white. Or opt for a bookcase in a solid color that includes a hue included in your wallpaper.Avoid wallpapering a bookcase that has its own pattern or heavy woodgrain.
Examples of items you can display on your dressed-up bookcase: a basket full of magazines, framed photos, and modern or vintage decorative items.

, Achieve the look of wallpaper with a much less permanent solution! Get an even amount of picture frames. Alternate them checkerboard-style by framing wallpaper in some, and simplistic words or quotes in others.Use at least four frames. Minimal words or quotes go best in this alternating style, since incorporating other patterns or prints can look too busy.
For example, you may want to frame the words “Relax” and “Unwind.” Or you could frame “Splish” in one and “Splash” in the other.

, Decorate using color families found in your wallpaper pattern. For example, if your wallpaper has gold accents, use gold hardware on your furniture. If your wallpaper has peach tones, you may want to choose hand towels or even a chair in shades of peach.If your wallpaper is neutral or gray, choose whatever color(s) you like to design the room around. Or, you can stick with either a black and white or entirely neutral color palette.

, Marble goes with either a classic or a contemporary theme. Optionally, add extra touches of marble in the room’s decoration to enhance the décor.Examples of marble accents you can add to the room are accessories, tables, lamps or clocks.
Emphasize elegance using flowers, candles, fluffy towels and luxurious details.Style marble in a modern way using black and white décor, metallic, modern lighting, and furniture with crisp lines.

, A marble pattern makes a statement all on its own. Thus, you should favor simple accents over those that can compete with your wallpaper. Monochromatic furniture, pillows with metallic fabrics, mirrors, and simple vases all marry well with marble.


For example, keep area rugs neutral and simple.
You may want to put a few solid white vases on display, with a single flower only in the middle vase.

Clear obstacles and clutter.,
Designate a large area to pile the pieces of vinyl siding.,
Set up a ladder if you need one.,
Set a bucket nearby for nails.,
Use a zip tool to disconnect two pieces of siding.,
Slide the tool sideways and pry upward.,
Remove the anchoring nails.,
Push the siding downward to remove it from the piece below it.,
Check the ground for nails when you’re finished.,
Dispose of the siding.,
Replace removed siding as soon as possible.",How to Remove Vinyl Siding," Remove any obstacles or ground debris that may interfere with the proper use of a ladder. Move lawn furniture, potted plants, toys, sticks, and rocks away from where you’re working. Make sure there is a stable spot for the ladder to be set up.;
, If the siding is still in good condition, lay a tarp our to keep the siding clean. If you are going to throw it away, or recycle it, park a truck nearby, so you can throw the siding directly into it for removal from your property.

However you decide to pile the siding up, pieces are often 10-12 feet long, so make sure you have a large enough space. If you’re taking off a whole wall of siding, it will take up more space than you might think.

, Find a stable piece of ground to set up a ladder on. Make sure it reaches to the highest piece of vinyl siding that you need to remove. If the ladder is the type that leans against the house, make sure to place it at a 45 degree angle for the most stable setup.When working on a ladder, it’s always good to have a partner standing by to help you balance.
If you are only removing one piece of siding and you can reach it from the ground, a ladder is not necessary. If you are removing an entire wall, it’s best to start removing the siding from the top because of how the pieces are connected.

, Vinyl siding is held on by hundreds of nails, which you’ll be removing along the way. Make sure to have a trash bucket of some kind close to your work area so you can throw all of the nails in it as you go., Zip tools disconnect a higher piece from a lower piece. Reveal the nails anchoring a piece to the wall by sticking the zip tool under the bottom of the piece above it. To remove a piece at your eye level, slide the zip tool under the piece above that one.If you don’t have a zip tool, buy one at a hardware store. It should cost around $5, and is perfect for removing siding.
The top piece will have a piece of channel, rather than another piece of siding, covering its nails. You may have to remove this top piece of channel to remove the top piece of siding.

, Slide the tool about six inches (15 cm) from where you inserted it and pry it upwards. Then slide it a bit farther and pry again. Continue this process going back and forth between sliding and prying until the entire length of the piece of siding is unhooked from the piece below it.Once the higher piece is unhooked from the lower piece, lift the higher piece up and look under it. You’ll see the nails which anchor the lower piece to the wall.

, Use a crow bar, flat bar, or a claw hammer to pull all of the exposed nails from the piece of siding. Work methodically from left to right, taking care not to skip any nails. If you happen to miss a nail, the piece of siding will not come off of the house.A flat bar is the easiest tool to use because its shape works better than a hammer when removing siding. Find a flat bar at a hardware or home improvement store, or some big-box stores.

, After you remove the nails from the top of the piece of siding, it is still hooked to the piece below it. Place the palms of your hands on the siding and apply downward pressure until the piece pops free.If the piece still seems attached to the wall, gently pull it outward so it comes free of the channel holding it in place at the end of the wall.

, If you removed a whole wall of siding, it’s likely you dropped at least a couple of nails. Carefully scan the area you’ve been working in to locate any lost nails. They pose a danger to feet and lawnmowers if left in the yard. It’s a good idea to use a lawn magnet, which easily picks up nails you can’t see.

Dump the nails in a garbage container, or keep them for use later on. Don’t put them in a trash bag to transport them, as they’ll rip the bag and spill.

, You’ll have more siding than you can realistically throw away in your regular garbage. You’ll need to schedule a large item pickup with your trash company, or take the siding somewhere on your own. You may be able to recycle it. If the siding is in good shape, you may be able to sell it for secondhand use., Most of the time if your house has siding, the area of wall you uncover is not meant to be exposed to the elements. Hang new vinyl siding, or some other type of siding, as soon as possible to avoid damage to the exterior wall of your house.

If you only remove one piece, you might be able to cover the area with a tarp to protect it until you replace the piece. Measure the area you uncovered so you know what size replacement piece you need.
Don’t leave exterior walls exposed for long periods of time or you risk damage to your house.

Choose a stencil design, accent color for the design, and a wall color.,
Decide how you want to position your stencil to form a wallpaper pattern.,
Dip the tips of a stencil brush's bristles in your accent color's paint.,
Dab the brush into the openings in the stencil design.,
Trace the stencil's four registration points with a pencil after painting.,
Line up the stencil's registration points when moving the stencil to the next position in the pattern.,
Paint the rest of the pattern and move the stencil across and down the wall as necessary.",How to Make Wallpaper2," Paint the wall with the selected background color if needed. If it’s already a good color, you can skip right ahead to the stenciling.


To paint the wall, mark off all the edges with painter’s tape. If it’s a dark color, cover it with primer first, let it dry, and then paint it your desired color. If it’s a light color, you may be able to get away with just painting over it straight away.

, The only bounds here are in your imagination – is it going to be a single line of stencils? A curly-cue shape? Covering every inch of your wall? Once you’ve decided, use painter's tape to keep the stencil in place at the starting point of your pattern.


Just keep in mind the length of time and difficulty of the overall concept you’re planning. You may want to paint the Mona Lisa on your wall, but that makes it easy to mess up and is super time-consuming. When in doubt, keep it simple.

, Dab the brush onto a paper towel to remove excess paint. If you’d like, you can mix a couple of colors together for an intricate, unique look.


There is such a thing as stencil paint, yes. It doesn’t drip like wall paint does. That being said, it comes in pretty small containers. If you’re stenciling your entire wall, it may make more financial sense to buy a large can of paint and just be extra careful.

, Starting lightly, start creating small swishes of color inside the stencil – this method is called stippling. Hold the stencil firmly in place around the area you are painting to create sharp lines in your design.


If you’re working with multiple colors, cover every area with your first color before moving onto your second. This will make it much easier and quicker.

, Once you’re done with the first stencil, make small marks on its edges with a pencil to denote where it was. Then, when you lift it up and off the wall, you’ll know where it was and where you should place the next image.

, If your stencils touch on any corner, use your registration point to make sure that it’s right where it’s supposed to be. Check that the placement is even by using a level.


Once it is level, retape it in its new position with painter’s tape on all edges. But be sure not to place the tape over the previous stencil – it may still need time to dry.

, Have the pattern reach to the edges of the wall and any trim to create the seamless appearance of wallpaper.


If you mess up at any point in time and if you have the color available, just paint over the stencil. It’s just a hiccough in the process – it won’t ruin your pattern if you don’t let it.

Measure your walls to figure out how many sheets of paper you need.,
Line up your paper on the floor how you want it on the wall.,
Place double-sided tape on all edges of each paper.,
Start placing the sheets, peeling one edge of tape at a time.,
Keep placing the sheets until you’re finished.",How to Make Wallpaper3," Once you’ve decided what kind of paper you want and you know what size it comes in, measure your walls, top to bottom and side to side. How many sheets is that?


If it’s not even, you’ll have to figure out what you need to do. For example, let’s say your wall is 60” across and your papers are 11” across. Do you want 5 pieces of paper that are 11” and 1 that’s 5” across or 6 pieces of paper that all measure 10”? This is generally determined by how you want your seams to look.

, Unless you’re using plain, non-patterned paper, you’ll need to know which piece to put where and how before you ’actually put it in place. The edges that touch should line up perfectly – if they don’t, cut them to size or overlap them so that they do (or don’t, depending on your preferences). Place them on the floor how you want them to look on the wall.


Sometimes it works having a tiled look. That part is up to you – do you want them to be one cohesive pattern or a whole bunch of mini patterns?

, Now that you have every piece sprawled out on the ground, flip it over and place double-sided tape on every edge. Start at one corner and work your way out.


Don’t skip a corner. If you do, you might end up with an edge of the paper coming up from the wall, and that is not a cute look for your interior decorating style.

, As you’re holding the sheet of paper to the wall, start peeling the edge of one piece of tape, smoothing the paper against it as you go. As that part is secured to the wall, peel another piece of tape and smooth that side. Going one at a time will help get rid of any bubbles and make sure the paper lies flush against the wall.Adjust as necessary. You may find that the piece of tape moves the paper just the teeniest bit, but somehow miraculously knocking off your entire pattern. In that case, just adjust. There’s a reason you’re using paper on your walls and not paint, you know.

, Again, start from one corner and work your way out to keep your pattern cohesive and make it easier for you to place. If there’s an excess paper hanging off the edges, take scissors or a box cutter to the edge and cut it right off. Then, that’s literally it. Who knew it could be so simple?


If you end up getting a bit sloppy, don’t fret. Just cut off the dimensions you messed up or let it overlap. An exacto knife and a rule work wonders, but odds are no one will notice the overlap if you go the lazy route instead!

Cut out pages from an old book.,
Measure your pages and wall.,
Plan out your design.,
Brush the backs of the pages with wallpaper paste and place.,
Seal with a surface top coat.",How to Make Wallpaper4," Think about how cool it would be if you had excerpts of your favorite book lining your wall. Pretty neat, huh? If you’re willing to part with a copy, you can do just that. Carefully take a box cutter or exacto knife to the pages and cut them out close to the seam. Instant wallpaper.


When you’re finished, look at their sizes. Are they different? If so, you may wish to cut them all to the same size. That being said, there’s no rule that says they have to be the same size. Heck, you could use multiple books that all have different size pages. It just depends on whether you want a more tile-like or collage-like feel.

, How big are the papers that you’re working with? Now, how big is your wall? It’s gonna go a lot easier if you don’t have to stop halfway through to cut out more paper (or, heaven forbid, buy another book). Knowing your measurements beforehand will let you know if you have to cut them to a different size, too.


Let’s say your wall is 70” across and 90” tall. Your papers are 7” across and 10” tall. Length-wise, you’re fine: that’s 9 sheets of paper at 10” tall, making 90”. But for the width, do you want 11 sheets that are 7” across and one sheet that’s 3” or do you want to size them all down to 5” to make it perfect, or, say, 6.75” to make it “just about” right?

, Odds are no two of your pages are the same, so what do you want the final wall to look like? Clear out a large area (like a big table or the floor), and start setting up your papers like you want them to look. You’ll be glad you spent this time later when you don’t have all the footnotes section accidentally lumped together.


Because you're working with free-standing pages right now, be sure to turn off any fans and close the winds – or else you're going to have to enlist the help of a bunch of paperweights.

, One at a time, brush the back of a page and place it on the wall. Start at a corner so it’s easy to spread out from there. Don’t try to do a bunch of gluing and then a bunch of placing – you don’t want the paste to start drying on you.After each page, take a second to make sure it’s aligned correctly. If it’s not, you still have time right then to adjust it before the paste dries.

, Once all the pages are on the wall just how you like them, you’re almost done. All that’s left is sealing them with a non-yellowing, clear surface top coat. These come in both liquid and spray forms, but spray is much easier to work with. Cover the entire area with a thin, even layer, let it dry, and you’re done.


Technically, you could use a colored seal or even spray it with glitter. That part is up to you!

Measure your walls to determine how much paper you'll need.,
Make a template for your design.,
Paint or design your contact paper.,
With a buddy, slowly remove the backing and place on the wall, starting at the top.,
Smooth out all the bubbles and adjust as necessary.",How to Make Wallpaper5," Most contact paper comes in rolls that are 18” wide by 75” long.That being said, there’s also a grid on the back that can help you easily size it to fit your needs. How big are your walls?


If you do need to cut the width of the paper, take a razor blade, exacto knife, or box cutter and use the grid on the back, following the lines. Unless you’re cutting it into crazy shapes, this grid makes it super easy and lets you keep the ruler in its drawer.

, Contact paper comes in a bunch of different colors and patterns. However, if you go for white or solid-colored contact paper, you could always put your own design on top of that. Now’s your chance to design your very own wallpaper. What’ll it look like?


Paint is the obvious medium of choice, but your template could be for just about anything – glitter, felt, washi tape, you name it. With the right kind of glue, heck, you could line your wallpaper with bells.

, Once you have your template figured out (incorporating in the dimensions, of course), design away. Spread the paper out on the floor or on some large, cleared surface and get to being creative. This will be the funnest part!


Let each panel dry once you’re done. Don’t try to hang up the panels immediately – they’ll need a solid 3-4 hours for you to safely work with them (depending on your design, that is)., In one of the top corners of your wall, line up your paper with the backing still on. Once it’s in place, start peeling off the backing slowly. As you do that and your friend is holding up the paper, have one of you smooth down the front as you go.


Slowly move down the wall, in tandem smoothing and peeling off the back paper. Monitor your progress as you go – it’s easy to inadvertently angle the paper to the right or left.

, As you’re slowly going down your panel, smooth out all the bubbles before you continue adhering any further. This is easiest to do with a ruler or straight-edge, though the edge of your hand may work, too. You’ll be glad you took your time – a wall full of bubbles probably isn’t the look you’re going for.


The best part about contact paper is that usually it comes right off. So if you notice that you just flubbed up, immediately peel it back up and reapply. If you take swift action, pretty much any mistake with this DIY project can be remedied.

Inspect vinyl siding for cracks and tears.",How to Repair Siding2," Small cracks can be repaired with a good epoxy and some touch up paint. Large cracks and rips are best resolved by putting in a new piece of siding.


Don't be alarmed if your vinyl siding moves back and forth as you inspect it. It expands and contracts due to weather conditions and is installed in a manner to allow for this.

Inspect wooden siding for peeling paint, cracked boards, insect damage and dry rot.",How to Repair Siding3,"


Peeling paint should be removed--the area primed and repainted.
Small cracks or holes can be filled with wood putty, sanded smooth, primed and repainted. If the cracks are extensive, replacement is the better option.
Call an expert to repair insect damage, such as termites and ants.
Small dry rot repairs can be effected by cutting out the entire patch of rot as well as at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of clean wood all around the edges. Fill in the hole with a polyester wood resin filler, allow to dry, sand smooth, prime and paint. Large areas of dry rot may require replacing the siding entirely.

Check asbestos siding carefully for cracks or breaks.,
Wear gloves eye protection and a good respirator when working with asbestos siding.",How to Repair Siding4," Your safest option is to replace a broken piece of siding rather than trying to repair it. Asbestos becomes a health hazard when small pieces of it become airborne which could happen if you attempt repairs. Intact asbestos siding with no cracks is perfectly safe. There are cement siding pieces available that will be a very close match for your existing siding.

, Put the pieces in doubled contractor bags and dispose of them according to local ordinances.

First, determine if the wall you want to remove is a load bearing wall, meaning it supports the floor above.,
If the wall you want to remove is at a right angle to the floor joists - STOP.,
Look at the wall for electrical outlets, switches, etc.,
Since demolition will bring up a lot of dust and debris, empty as much from the rooms as possible and cover any doors with plastic sheets to contain dust.,
If you are relatively sure the wall is void of any obstructions, don't smash into the wall with your foot or a sledgehammer.,
Wearing work gloves, grab onto the edge of the smashed drywall and pull off.,
Once all the drywall has been removed, you can start to remove the wall studs.,
After all the wall studs are removed, you can remove the floor plate.,
Once all the debris is removed, you'll have to patch the ceiling where the wall was removed with a strip of drywall and patch the floor with a new piece of flooring.

,
On the ceiling, measure the width of the hole created by removal of the wall.,
The drywall should be cut almost as wide as the new opening (tape and mud will cover any gaps).,
Mud the edge of the new drywall and the existing ceiling with drywall compound ('mud"").,
Allow the mud to dry (check the box/container for drying time required) and sand the drywall mud.

,
Add another layer of mud, using a wider trowel to taper the edges.,
You may need to do the above steps several times to obtain an almost seamless match between the patch and the existing ceiling.,
Once you are satisfied with the patch, you can add a coat of drywall primer/sealer and repaint the patch to match the existing ceiling.,
Depending on the type of flooring, you will need to add a patch to the carpeting, tile or hardwood from the adjoining rooms.

",How to Remove Interior Walls," Go into your basement (or crawlspace) and look at the alignment of floor joists. These are large pieces of lumber going across the house from side to side supporting the floor/roof and are generally 16"" apart. Remember the alignment - they generally go from side to side on most modern homes across the width of the house.;
, This is a structural load bearing wall and can't be removed without doing major damage to your home. Inspect the floor space above it for signs that it supports the joists, or an upstairs wall. Look in the attic too, to see if any of the roof framework rests on it. If it's imperative that this wall comes down, you'll have to hire a contractor. They will call in a structural engineer to advise what has to be done to make the house structurally safe if the wall is removed. (Generally a steel beam is required to carry the load from the upper floor/roof to the side walls.)

, Even if there are none present there still might be wiring, plumbing, ventilation, etc. inside the wall. Go downstairs (or to the basement) and see where the wiring, plumbing, venting, etc. enter the main floor. If they go into the wall you want to demolish, they'll have to be relocated before the wall can be completely removed. In this case, all you can do is remove the drywall to expose the studs and the utilities in the wall. You'll have to wait until they're relocated to proceed.

, Cover any vents to prevent dust from being blown around or sucked into your furnace/air conditioner. Put drop sheets on the floor to protect them from debris.

, Take a regular hammer and smash a small hole in the wall at about shoulder height.

, Once you have an area large enough to stick in your head, grab a flashlight and look around. If there are no other obstructions in this area, you can knock the rest of the drywall out on both sides with a sledgehammer (or your foot if you're wearing work boots). Continue knocking out the remaining sheets of drywall as above, making a small exploratory hole before demolishing the rest of the wall.

, Take a reciprocating saw and saw into the 2 X 4 upright studs. Grab the ends and pull out as much as possible. Making sure the reciprocating saw is fitted with blades that can cut through nails, run the saw along floor and wall plates where the upright studs are attached to cut through the nails. Have someone hold the stud while you cut through the nails.

, Using a wrecking bar, pull the floor plate up from the subfloor. Do the same with the ceiling plate; have someone hold the plate while you detach it with the wrecking bar. Pull out any pieces of nails that remain in the subfloor and ceiling with a pair of pliers.

,, Place thin strips of wood across the newly created hole at 12 to 16"" intervals. (2 X 2s or 1 X 2s work fine). Holding them in place across the gap, place a screw though the existing ceiling on each side to secure them to the ceiling. This will be the new anchor to attach the drywall strip.

, Place the drywall on the ceiling and attach to the wood strips with drywall screws.

, Push paper drywall tape into the wet mud and smooth down with a trowel. Add another layer of mud on top of the tape and smooth out. You can also cover the screws with a coat of mud to cover.

,, Allow to dry as above and re -sand.

, Each time, you should use a wider trowel to obtain an almost invisible joint.

, If the ceiling hasn't being painted in some time, you might need to repaint the entire ceiling so the new section doesn't highly contrast with the old section.

",How to Mix Mortar," For a basic mortar mix, you'll want to mix essentially three parts of sand for every one part of cement you use. If you're mixing up a whole bag of cement, that'll mean you'll use three times that amount of sand, which will result in a big batch of mud. Only mix up as much as you'll need.The measurement doesn't need to be precise as a baking recipe. At most work sites, when mixing large amounts, the amount of sand is usually given in ""shovels full"" per bag of mortar mix, which usually works out to somewhere between 15 and 18, depending on how large the shovel scoops are. It's important to get close, but it's more of an eyeball measurement. You don't need to get out the teaspoons.;
, A bag of mortar should be mixed with about three gallons of clean water to achieve the right consistency. The amount of water used can vary drastically depending upon the weather, how wet the sand is, and the variety of mix you're using, so read the instructions carefully before adding water.


Ambient conditions ( temperature and humidity) will affect the mix and need to be considered.
A drier mix will yield a stronger bond. A wetter mix might be easier to work. That's where experience comes in.

, Using a fine-grade, sharp masonry sand for the job is more appropriate than other varieties, and using fresh unopened bags of masonry cement will be more effective than using older bags. Masonry cement mixes, like Quikrete, Sakrete, and other brands are all appropriate for the job.Some brands come pre-mixed specially for mortar, which means you don't need to add sand. These are somewhat more expensive than regular Portland cement, but are much better for smaller projects. Read the label and find out what you're getting. If you don't need to add sand, the mixing process is still the same.

Portland cement is not a brand of cement. It is the name of the most common type of ingredient used to mix mortars, concrete and other bonding mixes.


Keep the sand and dry cement covered to keep them as dry as possible. It's easy to ruin your materials if they get too humid and damp. Try to mix up only as much as you'll need, but also to use up what dry mix you have so that you can take advantage of your materials.
Check your cement bags for lumps. If there are lumps or hard chunks on the bag, it has been exposed to moisture and won't bond well, it needs to be discarded.
Different brands may recommend slightly different mixes. Read the label on the brand of mix you buy and follow the instructions. In general, however, a mix of 3-to-1 is usually appropriate and effective.

, In some areas where the wall you're building will be exposed to especially high winds or the elements, lime is added to increase the bonding and strengthen the stonework you're building. If you do elect to add lime to your mix, you'll also need to add more sand to balance out the ratio somewhat, resulting in a stronger, more bonded mortar.


An appropriate ratio if you want to use lime would be six parts of sand to two parts of lime to one part of cement.

, This means that you need to work more quickly or mix a smaller batch.

, In very wet, cold, or humid weather, the mortar will behave differently than if it's really hot and dry weather. You may find it more effective to use slightly less sand and slightly more water if that's the case. Experiment some to get the right consistency and mix.


In general, it's easiest to use mortar in moderate, dry weather than, cold and humid weather. While that's not always possible, you can learn to recognize the right consistency and add water appropriately.

,, Keep in mind that the finished product must be kept from freezing until set., Before you start adding dry ingredients, you need to wet all the things that you'll mix in, carry the mortar in, and use the mortar with so the mortar will slide off easily and reduce waste. Slosh about half the water necessary for the batch you're making into the mixer or the tray, and pour some water into the wheelbarrows or buckets you'll be carrying it in.


Depending on the size of your project, you be using a small mixing tray or you may want to use a gas-powered mortar mixer to mix large quantities of mortar. These feature several spinning blades that can hold up to three bags of 80 lb. mix, cutting down on the elbow-grease necessary to mix up a batch of mortar mud. Consider renting one for your job, especially if you'll be working over the period of several days.

, If you're using a power mixer, turn it on to get the blades churning and gently add your dry ingredients. Be careful to not dump them and splatter the water out, or to lose too much of the cement by clouding it.


The order of ingredients isn't particularly important, but some mixers tend to add the cement first and the sand afterward if it isn't pre-mixed. It's generally just easier to break the bag on the mixer, dump it out, and shovel in the necessary amount of sand.

,, As you mix, or as the mixer does its work, keep a close eye on the mortar. If it looks too dry, add small amounts of water as you go to keep it pliable and wet. Be careful about adding too much, and don't add too much right at the end, or you'll get a soupy, unintegrated, and useless mortar.

, The pile should look like a small mountain.

, Roll and pull the bag to empty the cement.

, If the mix is not evenly distributed the mortar won't have the right consistency.

, The water will begin to sink and soak through the mix.

, Keep adding extra water as necessary to make sure it stays nice and wet. Mix thoroughly to distribute all the ingredients evenly.

, Some brands like Quikrete call for a resting period to let the particulate get moist, making the mortar more effective. Transporting the mix into a wheelbarrow or buckets tends to take care of this resting period for you, though. It's important to not let it sit around too long or it will become stiff. Likewise, over-mixing tends to dry out the mix and decrease its working life.


A good way of checking the consistency is to ""snap"" the trowel. Scoop up some mortar on your laying trowel and flick your wrist downward to flatten it against the flat side of the trowel, then turn the trowel 90 degrees. If it stays without sliding off, you've got good mud.

, Check for the right consistency and empty the mortar into a wheelbarrow or into individual buckets to lay out on a board and start using. Make sure everything is pre-wet, or you'll have some trouble with the mortar sticking to it. It should slide out easily, if you've done everything correctly.

, Getting dry concrete in your eyes, lungs, or on your hands can be very painful and dangerous. It's very important to wear gloves any time you're handling mortar, as well as safety glasses, and a face-mask when you're mixing up the dry cement. It can have a tendency to cloud up and get in your face, and is very hazardous to the lungs. Use caution and always equip yourself safely.

, Mortar dries quickly, which is partially why it's effective and so good to work with. You can lay courses as fast as you can keep up with it. Eventually, the mortar on your board will start to dry out some, so it's helpful to keep a small cup of water with you to drip a little on and mix up with your trowel to keep that good consistency.


Using overly-dry mortar will result in weak walls, which can especially be a problem if you're laying a foundation. It's important to keep the mix wet enough and workable enough to be effective.

, After an hour and a half or two hours, mortar tends to start to become too dry and unworkable, even if you add a tiny amount of water to what you're using. Plan out your work project carefully and only mix as much as you'll need for the job at hand. You won't be able to use it later.


When using lime and you are not as fast or it is your first time laying brick, try mixing smaller batches. Mix just enough mud to use within 45 - 60 minutes.
If you are able to get help, have someone mix and carry the mortar for you.

, At the end of a hard day of block-laying, you've still got an important job to do: knocking all the hard and dried mortar off the mixer, your boards, your wheelbarrows, and other tools. There are all sorts of different methods for doing this, but the most effective is also the most simple. Use a hammer to bang on your tools and collect the dry mortar to dispose of it properly.


Don't neglect cleaning your tools. Electric mixers especially can become bogged down if you haven't done a good job cleaning off the dried-up cement. There shouldn't be too much of it if you've been mixing properly, but there'll be some.

Rinse the siding with fresh water.",How to Pressure Wash Vinyl Siding," A gasoline or electric washer with a pressure rating of around 2,000 PSI will provide enough force to effectively clean high, hard-to-reach vinyl surfaces. Set the spray nozzle to low pressure and use a 25-degree spray tip. Add an appropriate cleaning solution (such as a vinyl siding cleanser concentrate or mild dish detergent) to the reservoir.;
, Proper preparation is the key to successful vinyl exterior cleaning. It will make the job quicker and easier for people who prefer to do it themselves..


Remove any obstacles from the surrounding area. You may need to temporarily relocate any patio furniture, planters, etc.
Dampen and cover nearby plants or gardens to protect them from the high pressure spray and cleaning chemicals. You can use any non-porous cover such as a tarp or plastic tablecloth.
Cover all exposed outlets or electrical wires. If outlet covers do not exist, seal them with plastic and water-proof tape.
Remove dense areas of mold or mildew with a mixture of household bleach and water. Scrub the area by hand and rinse thoroughly with clean, fresh water.

, You may increase or decrease the power of the spray by adjusting either the nozzle setting or the distance at which you are holding the wand from the siding.

, Always ensure that the nozzle is pointed downward at a 45-degree angle to minimize the amount of water that gets behind the siding. Excessive water can bulge siding, dampen insulation or framework, and cause mold or electrical damage over time.

, Work from the top down to prevent streaks, and rinse within approximately 5-to-10 minutes of cleaning, before the detergent is able to dry.

Uplift with yellow.",How to Pick a Color for an Accent Wall1," Because it’s the most intense hue, red really raises a room’s energy level. Red is thought to speed up respiration and heart rate in addition to increasing blood pressure.This may be a good color for a dining room or living room accent wall because it enhances appetite, draws people together, and stimulates conversation.
Paint your entryway red to make a strong first impression.
Avoid using shades of red in bedrooms, because the powerful color can excite too much to have in areas where people regularly sleep.;
, If you want a room to appear more bright and refreshing, light blue is the way to go.Stay away from darker blues, because they can create a “sad” feel in the room. Contrary to red shades, blue shades slow down heart rate and respiration, and also lower blood pressure.Consider painting a blue accent wall in a bedroom or bathroom.

Use nails to support light to medium weight attachments.,
Purchase masonry nails.,
Pre-drill the lumber.,
Tap in the central nail.,
Put on safety goggles.,
Nail the object to the mortar.",How to Nail Into Brick1," Masonry nails can support furring strips, shelf brackets, or boards up to 1½"" thick (38mm; the thickness of a 2 x 4).They are built for anchoring into the mortar joints between bricks. Use sleeve anchors instead for heavyweight attachments, or if you need to anchor an object directly into the brick itself.If your wall is a single layer of brick with an exterior surface, the nails could open small cracks in the mortar and allow water to seep through.Use an adhesive or other non-penetrating method instead, or plan to waterproof the exterior.;
, Masonry nails are made from hardened steel, and usually grooved or threaded.Ordinary nails cannot penetrate into masonry. Choose nails long enough to penetrate about 1¼ to 1½ inches (32–38mm) into the wall, plus the thickness of the board you are attaching.Cut masonry nails are a variety with flat, tapering sides and a blunt point. These are less likely to split lumber, but are not strictly necessary.
Use studs instead when fastening thin metal and plastic, or when supporting a plaque, pipe support, or other object that might need replacement. Studs leave a threaded end protruding from the wall so you can fasten the object with an easily removed nut., If you are nailing lumber to the wall, drilling the holes through the board will make the job easier. Hold the lumber up against the wall and mark hole positions every 18–24 inches (45–60cm), with each hole positioned over the mortar joints, not the bricks themselves. Return the lumber to your workbench and drill through these marks with a drill bit slightly smaller than the diameter of your nails., Before placing the board against the wall, tap a nail through the central hole using a hammer.


If you are using cut nails, align them so the tapering sides are parallel with the wood grain., Both the masonry nails and the brick are brittle objects that can shatter when struck at an angle. Wear goggles or safety glasses to protect against flying shards.

, Place the object against the wall, with the nail lined up over the mortar, not the brick face. Use the small sledgehammer to drive the nail forcefully into the mortar. Strike the head of the nail squarely and keep the nail at a right angle to the mortar to minimize the chance of breaking. Drive the nail in until the head is flush with the board's surface.Hammer the remaining nails the same way.


If you have a big job or find it difficult to drive in the nails with a sledgehammer, get a stud driver instead. Insert the nail in the hollow tube and strike the end of the driver with a hammer. This allows for faster, straighter nailing with less chance of chipping the masonry.

, You can make the hole using a shovel or a hoe. This will make mixing the concrete easier.


If you decide to mix in a mortar tub, bring the tub as close as possible to where you will be spreading the concrete. This way, you won't have to transport as much.

, You will need 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of water for every 80 pounds (36.3 kilos) of Quikrete concrete. At this point, you can also stir in some liquid cement coloring.

, Do not add all of the water yet. It is better to add in the water a little bit at a time.

, Brace your knee or foot against the side of the mixing container and place the blade of the hoe into the concrete. Drag the hoe towards you. The concrete will part, and the water will rush in. Keep dragging the hoe through the concrete, from top to bottom until everything is mixed., Keep adding water and mixing until you have used up all your water, and everything is evenly mixed together.

Incorporate your decor.,
Remember the 60-30-10 rule.",How to Pick a Color for an Accent Wall3," Define the “visual temperature” of the natural light in the room. Choose warm-hued accent walls to create balance in eastern or northern rooms and cool-hued accent walls for western or southern rooms.


If your room is located on the east or north side of your home, the quality of light entering the room during the day through the windows is cooler than the light coming from southern or western-facing windows.

, An accent wall often looks the most dynamic and fitting when there are not any windows or doors to further busy the space.However, sometimes architectural features, such as a fireplace or nook, can be highlighted with an accent wall., Different colors play tricks on perception in different ways. Warm colors tend to pull a wall toward the eye while cool colors tend to push a wall away from the eye. If a room feels too big or awkwardly long, you may want your accent color to be warmer, while a smaller room benefits from a cooler accent color., If you have the furniture in your room organized in a way that you want to keep, pick your accent wall and color in a way that further highlights one of your more eye-catching pieces in the room.Pick a wall that an important piece of furniture sits in front of, such as a bed in a bedroom, or a large couch in a living room. This compliments an already attractive part of the room.
Look at the tones in your throw pillows and wall art for inspiration.

, While you have many color options for your accent wall, you should pick one that contrasts well with your decor. There’s a fine line between contrasting and clashing, so be careful with which combination you select. Some good examples are:Yellow wall with blue or purple details
Blue wall with yellow or blue details
Red wall with white or blue details
Orange wall with green details
Purple wall with purple or yellow details
Green wall with red, yellow, orange, purple, or blue details, 60% of a room, including the majority of paint and decor, should be made up of the most dominant color. 30% of a room should be in a secondary color, and 10% should be in an accent color.

Select your sleeve anchors.,
Mark the locations of the holes.,
Wear safety equipment.,
Drill the holes with a hammer drill.,
Clean out the holes.,
Insert the anchors.,
Tighten the anchor heads.",How to Nail Into Brick2," These non-removable fasteners have a shield around the shank, which expands for a sturdy fit. Select anchors that meet your needs:


Choose anchors rated to four times the expected weight load, or eight if they need to withstand dynamic load (moving or vibrating) or impact load (sudden force). The shear load rating is for forces parallel to the brick surface (a hanging picture), while tensile load is perpendicular (a pipe hanging from the ceiling).Choose a size that can penetrate the recommended minimum distance into the brick, taking the object you're attaching into account. For example, a ½"" (1.25cm) diameter anchor needs to extend at least 2¼"" (5.75cm) into the wall., Sleeve anchors can be installed in mortar joints, or directly into the faces of solid or hollow bricks. Because the anchors exert force on the surrounding brick, it's important to space the holes to avoid putting too much stress on one spot:Leave ten diameters of space between each pair of anchors. For example, ½"" (1.25cm) anchors should be spaced 10 x ½"" = 5"" (12.5cm) apart.
Leave five diameters of space between anchors and unsupported edges.

, Put on goggles, ear protection, and sturdy work gloves you can dedicate to masonry work.Avoid breathing in dust (which may contain silica and caustic substances), and wear a particulate respirator with a filter rated N95 or better for large jobs., Choose a masonry drill bit exactly the same diameter as the anchors. Drill through the object you'll be attaching (if necessary), and into the holes marked on your brick surface. This is much faster and more precise with a hammer drill.


Check your sleeve anchor product information. Some anchors require a hole with an exact depth. If your anchors have no maximum depth and the brick is sufficiently thick, drill about ½"" (1.25 cm) deeper than the anchors will penetrate for good measure., Blow the masonry dust out of the holes with compressed air. Some hammer drills come with a tool for this purpose. You may need to blow out the dust partway through drilling.Do not blow out the dust with your mouth.

, Push the anchors through the object you are attaching, and into the holes you drilled. Tap them into place with a hammer if necessary.


If you have two-part anchors, insert the sleeves first, then insert the bolts through their centers., Use a wrench or screwdriver to tighten the nut or screw head at the end of the anchor. This will push the sleeve outward to press against the sides of the hole. Keep tightening until you have a snug fit and the anchor head is flush with the surface.It may work best to tighten all the anchor heads in stages, a little at a time."

Hang pictures from hole-free brick clamps.,
Install masonry screws.,
Use an adhesive substance.,
Complete professional jobs with a powder-actuated tool.",How to Nail Into Brick3," These snap over the brick without the use of nails. However, the brick and clamp must be a very similar height to make a good fit. This may not work well if the recess above the brick leaves less than 1/8 inch (3.18 mm) depth of the brick's upper surface exposed, or if it forms a curved surface due to a concave masonry joint.

, As long as the masonry is not too old and soft, you can replace nails with screws for more secure anchoring:Choose screws at least twice as long as the thickness of the lumber you are attaching.
Select a masonry drill bit with a diameter equal to the screw's shaft's, not including the threads.
Drill through the lumber and into the masonry.
Insert and tighten the screw until firm. Avoid over-tightening.

, There are many epoxies, mastics, and contact cements that can bond to brick. Check the manufacturer's instructions before buying to find a product that works with the material you plan to attach, and that can withstand the expected temperature, weight, and weather exposure.This approach may work well for light loads on soft brick surfaces, which are difficult to drill or nail without crumbling.

, This tool drives hardened steel pins into the masonry using a gunpowder charge. It is rarely used for home projects, since lack of training or the wrong model could lead to shattered brick or injury. If you have some construction experience and have a large project to complete, this could save you a lot of time.


Do not use a powder-actuated tool on hollow brick."

Clean the tools.",How to Mix Portland Mortar," Portland cement is a dry powder and can be purchased at most hardware stores and building supply stores. The water can come straight from your spigot at home. When buying sand, make sure to buy sand with angular (rather than smooth) grains. Masonry sand is ideal, and can be purchased from most building supply stores. Additives are available at most home improvement centers and building supply stores. Make sure to read the directions on the package and purchase the appropriate amount for your job. If you want to augment your mix with lime, make sure to buy hydrated lime (also a dry powder). The ratio of sand to cement is about 3:1 by volume.;
, Using a shovel, smaller bucket or scoop, put three parts sand and one part cement into a mixing tub or trough, wheelbarrow, cement mixer or a 5-gallon (19 L) bucket. Add any dry additives according to the directions on the package and stir the powdered mixture thoroughly.


Make sure not to make more than you can use in about two hours, as the mortar will set quickly.
Adding lime to the mortar will improve its workability, make the mortar more water resistant, and will reduce the amount of shrinkage upon curing. Lime also helps prevent the cement and sand from separating.
If you want to add lime to your mortar, replace about ten percent of the Portland cement with hydrated lime.







, Once you have mixed the dry ingredients thoroughly, add water a little bit at a time. Add a small amount of water, then distribute the water by carefully mixing with a spade or other tool. Keep adding water until the mortar reaches the proper consistency. It should be smooth and spreadable, but should not drip or run off your spade when you lift it. If you add too much water, you can adjust by adding more cement and sand.


Once you have mixed the mortar, add any liquid additives and distribute them evenly through additional stirring.
Clean your mixing tools at this time so that the mortar does not cure on the tool.
Run clear water over the tool and rub with your gloved hand until all the mortar is removed.

, Apply the mortar within about two hours of mixing it. If you wait longer than that, it will likely have cured too much to use, but the curing time can be extended by adding retarders and by keeping the mortar cool or cold. Once the mortar begins to set and harden, do not attempt to thin the mix by adding more water.

, Run clear water over the tool and rub with your gloved hand until all the mortar is removed. If the mortar has set on the tools, beat the the tools to break off the dried mortar, then rinse while scrubbing."

, 1 edge of the grate may extend over the back wall while the sides of the grate fall within the inner edges of the kiln's side brick walls. Ashes from the kiln will fall through the grate.

, Place them on top and around the grate to build up the kiln's 3 walls.

, It should be arranged diagonally or like a diamond so 3 of the shelf's corners are supported by the kiln walls.

, The sheet iron should go partially under the kiln shelf's fourth corner to support it.

, These bricks should go around all 4 sides of the kiln.


Some of the bricks in this row will be balanced on the kiln shelf. Use pieces of broken shelf or other scrap material to even out the height of the other bricks.

, Place additional bricks in a smaller circle inside the first one.

, The hole will act as a chimney to let smoke out of the kiln. Cover part of the top of the kiln with more broken shelving or scrap material to form the hole.

Dig a trench in a circular or oval shape.,
Build a tall brick chimney in the center of the trench.,
Stack unfired bricks, also called ""green"" bricks, in a lattice pattern over at least half of the trench.,
Top the unfired bricks with finished brick.",How to Make a Brick Kiln2," It may be about 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 meters) wide, 7 to 8 feet (2 to 2.5 meters) deep, and 328 to 492 feet (100 to 150 meters) in circumference.

, Smoke from the kiln's fire will leave through this chimney. The chimney may need to be above 98 feet (30 meters) in height.

, The openings in the lattice arrangement will let air flow through the kiln.

, This forms a kind of ""roof"" over the kiln. Leave holes in the roof to drop fuel material (wood, grass, coal, etc.) for the kiln's fire into the middle area of the trench.

Choose the right glass block for your project.,
Draw a diagram of the installation.,
Mix the glass mortar according to the directions.,
Put down a bed of mortar and place the first row of blocks.,
Place the appropriate spacers between the blocks.,
Install anchors and reinforcing rods every 2 feet (0.61 m) (61 cm) to provide strength and stability to your glass block installation.,
Tool the joints.,
Clean any stray mortar off the faces of the blocks with a damp cloth.,
Seal the perimeter and joints when the mortar is completely set.",How to Install Glass Blocks," Blocks with large faces will let in more light, and thin blocks are better for windows. You can use different sizes, colors and textures to create the look you want.;
,


Plan your project to use whole blocks. Glass blocks can't be cut.
Allow a space of ¼ to ⅜ inch (0.6 to 1 cm) between blocks and between the blocks and the wall, jamb or window frame. You must include the spaces for your drawing to be accurate.
You may discover that no arrangement of glass blocks will completely fill the area of the installation. Plan to add finished wood or other material to the arrangement.

, The amount of mortar you will need depends not only on the size of the project, but on the size of the blocks. Mix the mortar in batches that can be used in about an hour so the mortar won't start to set before you get a chance to use it.

,


Place the first block. Then, trowel enough mortar onto one side of the next block so that when you set it beside the first block, the mortar fills the space between and sticks the blocks together. Add mortar to only one side of each subsequent block in the row.
The spaces between the end blocks and the wall, jamb or window frame will be filled with an expansion strip, not mortar. The expansion strip will allow the blocks to expand and contract with changes in temperature.

, Tap the blocks snugly against the spacers with a rubber mallet. Spacers ensure that the spaces between blocks are uniform and that the weight of the upper rows don't force mortar to squeeze out of the lower rows.


Use ""T"" spacers around the perimeter. Press the first spacers into the mortar as the first row of blocks is installed. For the sides, screw or nail ""T"" spacers to the adjoining wall or window frame.
Place ""X"" spacers between blocks. They will ensure even spacing between blocks on the same row and between rows.
Put the spacers between blocks halfway between the back and front so they don't interfere with tooling the joints later. Leave them in place and mortar over them.

,


Lay a thin bed of mortar and press the reinforcing rod into it.
Connect the rod to the anchors. The anchors extend from the wall or window frame at least 1 inch (2 to 3 cm).

, Before the mortar sets, use a mason's jointer along all the spaces between the blocks to make the mortar joint smooth and concave.


Except for very small glass block installations, you will need to regularly stop and tool the joints. Don't wait until you're done laying the blocks.

, The dust that forms on the blocks as the mortar dries can be wiped away with a soft cloth later.

, Use regular caulk between the blocks and the wall or frame and clear silicon sealant between blocks.

Plan out your wall.,
Pour a concrete foundation if you do not have an existing slab, brick ledge, or footing to work on.,
Make your guideposts.,
Gather all the materials you need to start your project.,
Mix your masonry cement, or mortar.,
Place bricks and ""mortar boards"" along your foundation so that you can reach easily them your work area.",How to Lay Brick1," Using string, a level, and a tape measure, plot out the exact dimensions of your wall, enclosure, structure, etc. Having a solid blueprint in place will help your purchase the correct amount of bricks and help you design guidelines that ensure your bricks are laid level.


When buying bricks, remember to account for the mortar. Add roughly 1/2"" to the size of your bricks to make sure you get the right measurement. However, if the bricks you are buying has a ""nominal size,"" this means that the manufacturer has already added room for mortar.Always buy 10-15 more bricks than you'll need -- some will inevitably break while you're working.;
, This must be level and below the grade of the finished ground so that the brick is all you see when your wall is finished. Once it is set, lay a row of bricks out on a ""dry run"" to ensure that the foundation is the right size.


The foundation should be the exact length and height of your brick structure.
In general, your foundation should be roughly 1 foot deep before you add the concrete.
The concrete needs 2-3 days to set, so you can use this time to set up your guides and round up supplies., This is most important if you are building a wall, but you'll need to create guideposts no matter what you're making to ensure that evenly lay the bricks. To make them, take 2 long wooden boards and drive them into the ground right at the ends of your structure. Starting with the surface of your foundation, mark the height of each brick, as well as the space for the mortar, using a tape measure. Make sure that the two boards are marked equally so that you have a straight line to guide you as you lay the bricks.









The architectural standard for brick is 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) mortar joint thickness on all sides. There are exceptions, of course, for queen, old Chicago, and custom brick., Once you have mixed the masonry cement and started laying brick, you have to use all the mortar and strike your joints before quitting. Mortar will harden overnight, so only mix as much as you can manage. Once you're concrete foundation has set and you're ready to begin, you should place the following supplies close by so you can work efficiently:


String and clamps/nails (to create guidelines).
Mortar and a mixing bucket.
Level.
Brick jointer.
Club hammer (to break bricks in half)
Tape Measure., This can be done in a wheelbarrow for small projects, or a mortar box if you don't have access to a mortar mixer or cement mixer. Basically, to mix the mortar, you will use a ratio of three parts masonry sand (builders sand, if it is very clean), to one part masonry cement. Add water to the dry materials and mix to a consistency like pudding. Too dry, and it will be difficult to ""set"" the brick in the mortar bed, too wet and the brick will sag.








, Place some mixed mortar on plywood so that that it can be reached easily. This will allow you to grab mortar with your trowel as you work, and not have to move around too much. If you've planned correctly, you can also place stacks of bricks at regular intervals so that you can keep working smoothly. However, if you're only working on a small project, you may be fine with one pile of bricks and a bucket of mortar.


Place a few shovels of mortar on each board, splashing the board first with water so the mortar ""keeps"", or stays wet enough to use."

If you want to build the oven properly, you need to follow a plan. Brick oven plans can be found online or purchased from your local home improvement store. Some great plans include:


Forno Bravo’s free brick oven plan (https://www.fornobravo.com/pompeii-oven/brick-oven-table-of-contents/)
Makezine’s free brick oven plan (http://makezine.com/projects/quickly-construct-wood-fired-pizza-oven/)
Purchase oven plans from EarthStone ovens (http://earthstoneovens.com/);
, The plan you choose will depend on how much space you can dedicate to your oven. For example, if you have a small garden, you will need to build an oven that will fit inside of it. Other considerations include:


If you’re building the oven under a patio cover, the oven should be short enough to fit underneath it. However, make sure the chimney can stick out from underneath the patio cover to release the smoke.
If you want to cook large pizzas, the floor of the oven must be large as well.
Budget limitations should be taken into consideration. If you have a small budget, plan to build a smaller oven.

, Dome ovens are igloo-shaped brick ovens with wooden doors. They have an easy, rustic elegance that can add a lot of visual interest to your backyard. Additionally, these ovens will cook food evenly and can be heated to very high temperatures.Dome ovens can be difficult to build. Some plans even involve woodworking.
These ovens can take a lot of time to heat up properly.

, Barrel ovens are brick ovens that are built around a large metal barrel. These ovens can be heated up very quickly and are more energy efficient than some dome ovens. This oven type is an excellent choice for hobbyists who want to be able to cook foods quickly.These ovens are usually sold in kits that include a firebox and a large metal barrel.
These kits usually have to be purchased online and can be expensive to ship.

, Most brick oven plans will include instructions for a concrete foundation. The concrete base will bear the weight of the brick oven, keeping it level for many years. The foundation slab should be at least as big as the brick oven. However, if you make it bigger, you can also create a patio or sitting area next to your brick oven.


If you make a larger patio area, you will need more materials and the foundation will take more time to build.

, The instructions for this form will be included in the brick oven plan. Follow the instructions to create a wooden form. This form will be placed in the ground and filled with concrete to create the concrete foundation.


Use a spirit level to make sure the form is perfectly level. The more level the form is, the more level your foundation will be., Measure out the foundation for your brick oven, using small flags or chalk dust to mark the edges. Next, clear away any large rocks or debris before using a tiller to excavate the dirt. Most foundation plans ask you to dig 10 inches (25.5 centimeters) deep into the ground. Tillers can be rented or purchased at home and garden stores. When using a tiller:


Follow the manufacturer instructions.
Avoid digging too deep too quickly. Only excavate about an inch at a time.
Water the area a few hours before tilling to loosen up the soil., Once the hole has been excavated, place the foundation form in the hole. Press the sides firmly to force them into the soil. If you have trouble installing the foundation form, you may need to dig some dirt away from the sides. Once the form is installed, fill in any empty spaces along the outside with dirt.

, Pour a layer of pea gravel or crushed rock into your excavated hole. Keep adding gravel until the layer is about 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) deep. Next, use a tamper to tightly compact the gravel. Tampers can be rented or purchased from your local gardening or home improvement store.


If you don’t have a tamper, you can use your foot to compact the gravel. However, it won’t be compacted as well.

, Cover the gravel with a layer of wire mesh. If needed, use strong wire cutters to trim or shape the wire mesh. Next, cover the wire mesh with a layer of 6 mil plastic sheeting.Use heavy duty scissors to trim or shape the plastic.


Wire mesh and 6 mil plastic sheeting can be purchased at your local home improvement store or online.

, Installing rebar will help strengthen and stabilize the concrete foundation. Refer to your brick oven plan to see how much rebar you need to use. Usually, you will install the rebar into the sides of the foundation form and use wire to connect overlapping sections of rebar.Some people think that installing rebar is unnecessary and skip this step. However, without the rebar, your concrete base may crack after a few years of use.

, Mix a batch of concrete and pour it into your foundation form, completely submerging the rebar grid. Once the form is completely filled, use a straight piece of wood to level off the top. Let the slab cure for a few days before continuing to build your brick oven.The amount of concrete you need will vary based on the size of your foundation. Refer to your brick oven plan for more information.
Mixers and other concrete pouring equipment can be rented at your local home improvement store.

, It’s easy make mistakes when building a brick oven. These mistakes can lead to cracking, collapsing, or bad insulation. If you follow your plan, you will avoid making these mistakes. Resist the urge to cut corners or improvise. If you do, you may undo all of your hard work.

, Your plan may ask you to build wooden templates or even a wooden door for your oven. If so, you will need to know how to use basic woodworking tools. Some basic tools include:



A circular saw, to cut straight pieces of wood

A jigsaw, for cutting shapes in wood
A power drill, to attach pieces of wood
A wood level

, Your plan will ask for several different kinds of bricks. It may be tempting to ignore their recommendations and use the cheapest or most readily available bricks. However, each brick type has an important function that will extend the life of your oven. For example:


Firebricks are used to line the interior of the oven. These bricks resist warping caused by heat and can reach the correct temperatures quickly.
Red clay bricks are usually used on the exterior of the oven. These bricks help insulate the firebricks and are somewhat heat resistant as well. Other brick types, such as concrete bricks, may be used for the base of the oven. These bricks are chosen for their durability and stability.

, Usually, when you build a structure from brick, you use a concrete mixture to connect the bricks. However, if you use this to connect the bricks in your oven, the concrete may cause the bricks to crack as they expand from the heat. Instead, use a mixture of clay and sand to cement your bricks together. This mixture will expand and contract at the same rate as the bricks.


Follow the ratios in your brick oven plan. Usually, the plan will ask you to mix six parts of clay to four parts of sand.For advice on bricklaying, talk to a representative from your local home improvement store. They can direct you towards the proper tools and equipment.

, Use concrete blocks to create a stand for your oven. Lay the first layer down in a square shape with an opening at the front. Use a level to make sure that the layer is even. Continue laying concrete bricks until the oven stand is about waist-high.


Once the concrete blocks have been stacked, fill every other core with concrete to cement everything together.The space inside the oven stand can be used to store firewood.

, Create a wooden concrete form in the shape of your hearth. Next, place the wooden form on the oven stand and fill it with concrete. Use a long, straight piece of wood to level off the concrete and let it dry for a few days.


Install a rebar grid into the wooden form before pouring the concrete for additional support., Set a layer of firebricks using the intended shape of the oven as a guide. Connect them with a thin paste made of one part sand and one part fire clay. Add water until the mixture becomes a thick slurry.Avoid the temptation to use mortar to connect the firebricks. Mortar won’t expand and contract with the bricks and will eventually crack them.

, Lay down firebricks in a circular shape to create the walls of the oven. As you build, slowly angle the layers inwards to create a dome shape. You may need to cut the bricks into smaller pieces using a tile saw.Let the sand and clay paste dry on each layer before continuing.
Leave a space open near the back of the dome. This will allow the smoke to vent into a chimney.

, Surround the opening at the back of the dome with a layer of firebricks. Stack the bricks in a square shape to create a tall chimney. The smoke inside the oven will vent out of the space in the back and the chimney will direct it into the air.You can also create a chimney base with the firebricks and then purchase a tall, metal chimney flute. Attach the flute with mortar.

, Use red clay bricks to create an oven entrance. This is where you will add firewood and insert food. Traditionally, brick oven entrances are built into an arch shape. However, you can also make a square shaped entrance if you’d like.Use mortar to connect the red clay bricks.
You can create an oven door out of wood or simply use loose bricks to block it off when necessary.

, Cover the entire oven with a thick layer of vermiculite-based insulating concrete.Let the concrete insulation dry according to the manufacturer instructions. Once it’s dry, add a layer of red clay bricks around the oven to give it a traditional appearance.

, Your oven plan will tell you where and how to build a fire inside your brick oven. Make sure you thoroughly understand the process before you try to build a fire. If you try to cook without reading the instructions, you may burn or undercook your food.

, Different foods require different cooking temperatures. Seasoned brick oven experts can tell what temperature an oven is by looking into it. However, if you’re unexperienced, you need to purchase an infrared thermometer. This tool can be pricy, but it’s an important investment in your cooking experience.Follow the manufacturer instructions when using an infrared thermometer.

, Make delicious pizzas in your brick oven using the Fire-in-the-Oven method. First, build a large fire in your brick oven. Let the fire build until the flames are licking the top of the oven. Next, push the fire to the back of the oven to clear a space for your pizza.Lay your pizza directly on the brick and cook it with the oven open for 1 to 3 minutes.The oven needs to be 650 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit (343-371 degrees Celsius) to properly cook a pizza.
You may need to add more wood every 15-20 minutes to maintain the flame.

, Add wood to your oven and create a large, slow-burning fire. Once the oven has reached 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius,) your oven is ready for a roast. First, carefully rake out the coals onto the ground, killing the fire. Next, place the roast in the oven and close the door. The residual heat from the fire will slowly cook the roast overnight.This method works best with larger cuts of meat.
The roast should be in a pan and wrapped with foil.

, You can use your oven to bake at temperatures below 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius.) First, build a fire in your oven. Once it reaches the right temperature, rake out the coals to kill the fire. Place your dish in the oven and close the door. The residual heat in the oven will cook the food.This method works well for bread, desserts, beans, and pasta dishes. Bread can be placed directly on the brick while other dishes should be cooked in an oven safe pan.

Use a spirit level to ensure that the first row is evenly placed.,
Set your guidelines along the first course.",How to Lay Brick2," Set a brick down in this ""bed"" of mortar, and tap it down with the handle of your trowel, until it is level, parallel to the line of your wall, and the edge is plumb. Repeat with 6 or 8 bricks, using the edge of the trowel to cut away the excess mortar that is shoved out from under the brick as you go.








You can put the mortar on about an inch and a half thick, and then press it down to about a finger's width. Then wipe off the excess with your finger, giving it the classic indention look that you see on brick houses.
In masonry, a course is a row of bricks.

,, You can make small adjustments while the mortar is still wet, so carefully use a level to make sure that you have a good, even base to your structure. Check every 4-5 bricks for the best results.









A good, even wall comes from good, even mortar. Checking quickly will help you correct your work as you go, getting better results each time., Once you've finished the first row, clamp or nail a string between your guideposts telling you the height of the next row of bricks. You may have to adjust your guideposts slightly so that they start with your first row of bricks, but every other measurement after that should be the same.









Make sure your line is tight. You can use a level to check it's straightness.
You'll be moving this line after every course of bricks.

However, before you get started you should determine the requirements necessary to create the patio. Is the location you initially considered large enough to fit the patio you want? Will certain obstacles force you to use a different layout than you had initially intended? A little time thinking about these issues will make the later steps that much easier.






;
, After you have determined the size, you must consider a few things like the pattern used to place the pavers (the bricks) and the material that will be used as a border. Here are a few points to consider.









There are a number of designs you can follow for the pavers. Some of the best know are the ""basket weave,"" the ""jack on jack,"" and the ""herringbone."" The basket weave or ""pinwheel"" design involves sets of eight total bricks laid in groups of two, with each pair set together left to right adjoining another pair set at an angle perpendicular to them. The ""jack on jack"" pattern is a uniform set columns and rows, with each paver set end-to-end and side by side. The herringbone design is a pattern involving pavers abutting to create a ninety degree angle, with the end of one paver used to cover the end of another.
The pattern you select will have a very real impact on the amount of time and energy needed to complete this project. For example, certain paver pattern designs will require you to precisely cut half of the pavers as you reach the edges of your patio, or you will have to purchase specially sized pavers with this in mind.
You must also determine if you want a border made of pavers or of wood. Lumber can provide a nice contrast to the pavers, and it is comparatively quick and easy to install. Pavers will take quite a lot more time to install but will seamlessly match the rest of your patio.

, Use your estimate of the size and your thoughts regarding the design of the patio to determine the quantity of the pavers you will need. Of course, there are some additional supplies that will be necessary in order for you to finish this project. A full list of supplies will be provided at the end of this guide, but some in particular are listed here as well.









Crushed stone or gravel may be used to fill the the deepest portions of the excavation floor after you have dug out the area for the patio. It will provide stability and aid drainage, but is not considered mandatory. You can determine the quantity yourself, but some suggest that you may want as much as four inches of crushed stone as the base layer. Calculate the necessary volume of crushed stone or gravel before you head to the home or garden shop.
Sand will make up the layer just below the pavers and can be used to fill the gaps between them. If you don't use crushed stone or gravel, this will also be the foundation of your patio. Some suggest that a layer just one inch deep is adequate, but other suggest at least twice that amount.You will need to know the volume of sand necessary when you make your purchase.
You may want to lay landscape fabric underneath to discourage the growth of weeds. It would require a lot of effort to remove weeds growing through your patio, so it is probably best to stop it before it starts.If you will use lumber along the edges of your patio as support, determine the quality and quantity of pressure-treated lumber you will require. There are a number of varieties available, but for a job like this you will want one rated for ground contact.

, You may also want to rent certain equipment, such as a gas powered tamper to compact the soil and sand (manual tampers are also available for purchase, if you prefer).








, It may be useful to stake out the corners and sides in order clearly identify the area as you work.









Leave an appropriate gap along the outside edge of the bricks for the border (whether of lumber or pavers).

, The depth to which you dig will be determined in part by the number of layers you intend to lay down. If you will only be laying down sand, just four inches or less may suffice. If you are going to be depositing a layer of crushed rock or gravel first, it may be ideal to dig the area to a depth of eight inches.








If the patio is going to be right next to your house, you may want to encourage water to run away from the foundation of your home. In this case, as you dig you can slope the ground away from the direction of the house. For each foot of length, add an additional 1/4 inch of depth to the excavation.Remove any large roots that may be apparent, even those just at the planned base of the dig. These can grow up through the bottom layers and undermine the stability of the patio.
If you intend to use pavers for the border, dig deeper along the edge. This will allow you to stand the pavers up on end.

, The soil must be firmly in place if it is to support the weight of the patio. If you are using a manual tamper this process can take some time, but it cannot be rushed.








, It should be spread out up to a depth of four inches. Make sure to maintain the integrity of the slope you may have created earlier. The rock should also be tamped into place to solidify the foundation of the patio.








, This should prevent the growth of weeds.








, If you are not digging deep or laying down a rock layer, you may want to do this immediately following the excavation.









It may be desirable to screw the boards together if lumber is being used as the border. The added stability will help hold the patio in shape.
If pavers are being used, stand them up in the trench you dug for the edge and tap them into place. Try to fit them as snugly together as you can.
Whether using boards or pavers, make sure that your border is installed at the desired angle (or, more likely, with no angle) by using a level.

, One to two inches are considered a reasonable amount, and it is no longer desirable to maintain the slope you may have created earlier. It is now necessary to level off the sand with a screed (which is a term used for any object used to scrape or level).








You can make a screed out of spare lumber.
Tamp down the sand. Be careful not to disturb the level surface that you have created.

, Press them into the sand as you lay them. Lay the pavers as closely together as you can and use a rubber mallet to seat them into the sand.








, Carefully sweep the sand to fill in the cracks between the bricks and along the edge.







, This will allow the material to settle between the bricks. Your project is now complete.

This ensures that you keep each course level., If you are turning the corner you began at, you will set each course half a brick back from the previous course, so that each course is staggered half a brick. If you are turning the corner where you began, put the first brick in the first course so that it is square, and lay a few brick in this direction also.









You don't want the joints of your wall to be even or the wall will be weak. You can either break a brick in half and start with a half brick, or turn a brick sideways (if you're structure is two bricks thick) and start with that., The standard bed and head joints are 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm), but this can be adjusted to your preference, up to 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) or even more.

, The jointer is a piece of tubing whose diameter is the same or slightly larger than your joint spacing, bent in an ""S"" shape. Hold the tool on one end, and rub it along the mortar joint between your brick with the curved portion of the tool to smooth out the mortar joint.

, It takes a lot of practice to be able to tell when the mortar is set properly to strike and brush the joints, but basically, when it is hard enough to touch with your finger and not leave an impression, it is ready.

, Once you have this rhythm down, you should be able to move quickly, no matter what structure or shape you're making. The same basic pattern is used the entire time.

,, Mortar is properly mixed and ready to use when it is moist enough that it holds together without crumbling. Mortar will start to harden, or set up, relatively quickly.

Finished.

",How to Expose Brick," Chip a hole in the plaster until you can see the brick and what condition it is in. Brick was a common construction material in the 19th century, but sometimes the quality was not always the best. By testing a small area, you can see if the brick underneath is worth exposing. The brick should not crumble or break when you touch it and should be free of any major cracks. If the brick looks good, proceed with the project.;
, There will be a fair amount of dust and dirt from the bricks, so seal any doorways or heating vents to limit dust from getting into other areas of the house. Put plastic sheeting on the floor near the wall you will be working on the catch the debris for an easier clean up. Keep windows uncovered so you can open them to help ventilate throughout the process.

, Start at your test hole. Position the masonry chisel at an angle and hit the end with a hammer. As plaster comes off continue to chisel away at the edges. You can also chisel wherever you see cracks in the plaster. This may help you remove bigger sections. Clear away any debris as it builds up.

, Apply moderate pressure to sweep away any dust that may still be on the bricks or mortar. Brush the entire wall, starting at the top of the wall and working down so the dust falls to the ground. Sweep up any debris.

, Using a clean cloth, start at the top of the wall and work your way down washing the wall clear of any remaining residue. Rinse out the cloth frequently and change the water as needed. There are several different techniques you can use to clean the exposed brick, like sandblasting and using muriatic acid, but water works just as well once the plaster and debris have been removed and is still considered the preferred method for those who do not have access to a sandblaster or want to work with acid.

, Since you no longer have plaster covering the wall, any air that was seeping in through the bricks will not have that buffer now. By using a brick sealant, you will seal those cracks and eliminate the drafts. Use a matte finish sealant for a more natural look, otherwise your walls will look too glossy.

Find a stone.,
Purchase an electric engraver or rotary tool.,
Get a wax-based pencil, marker, or stencil materials.,

Create a sketch or stencil of your design.,
Practice engraving on an extra stone.,
Clean the stone.,
Transfer your design to the stone.,
Secure the stone.,
Go over your design with the engraver.,
Clean the stone.,
Show off your engraved stone!",How to Engrave Stone," Your skill level and the design you want to create will determine the type of stone you need.


Stones with a flat surface, such as river rocks, work best for beginners.Softer sedimentary rocks (such as sandstone, limestone and soapstone) are easier to drill into.Keep your eyes open for stones when you're outside at the beach, in your garden, etc, or purchase engraving stones from your local arts and crafts store.;
, Alternatively, you can use a point chisel and mallet or hammer to do your engraving, but an electric engraver will make the process much easier.


Look for an electric engraver or rotary tool that allows you to change out the tip.
A carbide tip is appropriate for engraving softer stones like sandstone, limestone or soapstone. A diamond tip is best for engraving harder stones or glass.
Engraving tips come in various shapes and widths. For a basic design, the standard carbide tip that comes with your tool will be enough. Over time, you can add to the complexity of your designs by using a cone tip to create detail lines and a cylindrical shaped tip for shading and dimension.
Electric engravers or rotary tools can be found at your local hardware store, craft store or online.

, Sketching your design onto your stone or creating a stencil before you start engraving will save you a lot of missteps along the way.


Wax-based pencils, china markers or permanent markers can be used to draw your design directly onto the stone.
You can make an easy stencil using cardboard or acetate and a craft knife.
Beeswax and latex paint are optional design supplies that can be used to add color and shine to your stone.

, Safety goggles should be used during all of your engraving projects. Engraving throws small pieces of stone and dust into the air that can damage your eyes.

, Prepare a bowl of water large enough to submerge the stone. This will be used to cool and clean the stone during the engraving process.

, Your skill level, the size and shape of your stone, and your intended use for the stone will all play a part in creating your design. Inspirational words, a name, flowers, leaves, the sun, or other basic shapes are great design choices for beginners.


Create your own unique design or write out a word you want to engrave.
Look for stencil designs online that you can print and cut out.
Create a design on your computer. Draw an image or write a word in a font you like. Size the design to fit your stone and print it onto black and white paper.

, Whether you're engraving an image like a flower or feather, or writing out a word, having a sketch or stencil to follow will make the process much easier and will leave you with a nicer finished project.


Practice drawing your design on a piece of paper before sketching it directly onto your stone.

Make a stencil. If you printed out a picture to use, lay a piece of tracing paper on top and go over it with a pencil. Tape the traced outline onto your cardboard or acetate and cut out the design with your craft knife.

, Get a feel for the engraving process using a stone similar to the one you're saving for the final project.


Use the engraving tool to create straight lines across the stone, moving in different directions.
Vary the pressure you use to draw lines. Draw lines using light, feathered strokes. Go back and draw lines using more pressure. Notice the differences in the look of the lines.
Draw circles or other shapes in the stone.
If you're writing a word on your stone, practice making the various letters.

, Start by wiping any dirt or debris off of the stone with a damp cloth. Let the stone air dry or dry it with a clean cloth.

, Sketch your design onto the stone directly using your wax pencil or marker, or attach the stencil to your stone.


Use a wax-based pencil to draw your design if the stone is rough or porous. Use a china marker or permanent marker to draw on stones with a smooth, glassy surface.Position your stencil where you want it on the stone. Secure the stencil with tape so it doesn't move while you're engraving your design.

, Once a mark is engraved you can't erase it, so make sure your stone isn't going to move while you're working.


If the stone is flat and won't roll or slip, simply place it on a flat surface.
Placing a piece of non-slip shelf liner under your stone will help ensure it doesn't slide.
If the stone isn't flat on the bottom you can secure it using a desk vise or clamp, which can be found at your local hardware store., Set the engraving tool on a low speed and slowly trace over your design using light, continuous strokes. Start by going over the primary lines in the design. Roughly scratch out a shallow groove to create an outline of the design.
Continue to trace over the lines of your design with the engraving tool. Rather than pressing hard to carve out your design, go over the lines repeatedly using a light-hand.Periodically dip the rock into the bowl of water to cool it off. This will also help clean debris out of the grooves of your design so you can better see what you're doing.Continue to etch out the lines of your design until they are the depth you'd like for them to be.
Add shading or other details to your design. Engrave lighter lines, going in the same direction of the primary lines of your design, to create shading., When you're done engraving, clean off the stone in the water bowl or wipe it off with a damp rag. Allow it to air dry or dry it off with a clean cloth.


If you want your stone to really shine, use beeswax and a rag to buff and polish it. This will help your design stand out and give the rock an extra gleam.
If you want to give your design some color, use latex paint to fill in the grooves. Black paint on a light colored stone or white paint on a darker stone can really make your design pop.

, Place it inside your home, on your porch, in your garden, or give it away as a unique gift.


Larger stones can be used to make unique stepping-stones for a garden.
Heavy stones can be used to make door stoppers or bookends.
Small pebbles engraved with inspirational words or special dates make great gifts.

Size your shingles appropriately.,
Lay a starting row at the bottom of the roof along the edge.,
Lay the first row of shingles directly covering the narrow starter row.,
Lay the second row of shingles.,
Shingle around stacks, vents and chimneys as necessary.,
Interlace the flashing around the chimney with the rows of shingles.,
Bring the ridge edges together with a ridge-capping layer.,
Understand the basic patterns.,
Stagger each course to achieve the half pattern.,
Consider four and five inch offsets for added protection.,
Consider ""racking"" shingles until you reach the top on each side.",How to Lay Shingles," Depending on how you're going to organize your rows and courses, some roofers like to cut five variable sizes of shingles when using the basic three-tab variety. Basically, you'll cut off one-half tab-width of the first tab to start the first course, changing the necessary area to fill with each row, shifting the ""slots."" Usually, the following cuts are useful:


A half tab off for your first course shingles,
A full tab for your second course shingles
1.5 tabs off of your third course shingles,
2 tabs off your fourth course shingles
For your fifth course, cut off half of the final tab
Keep your sixth course tabs intact;
, Place nails in the 3 tab shingles about 3/4 inch (1.8 centimeters) above the cutouts, near where the tab meets the upper part of the shingle. Also place a nail 2 inches from each end of the shingle, in line with the other two. In all, use four nails per 3-tab shingle.


Nailing here will cause the next shingle to cover the nail heads and allow the next and subsequent rows of nails in shingles to always penetrate and hold the top edge of the lower row (this allows 8 nails to hold each shingle).
If the nail or staple gun is firing too deeply, almost mashing through the shingles, then the nails will soon pull through and come loose. Set the air compressor and gun depth setting lower.

, Snap a horizontal chalk line over the starting row to use as a guide. Cut six inches off the length of the first starter shingle nailed on, then use the rest of them full size. Shifting them in this way will join the ends of the first regular row of shingles placed over the starter shingles. This is the basic, sometimes called ""straight up"" way of laying shingles.


For the kind of shingles you purchase there may be a special starter row of shingles or a roll of strip material that you cut to the length of your roof.
Alternatively, you can use a starting row of full-sized shingles by turning them with the tabs pointing upward.

, Set the first shingle of the second row back a half tab, 6 inches (17 centimeters), from the edge of first shingle on the first row and so that the bottom of its tabs just touches the tops of the cutout slots on the shingle below. This 1/2 tab has to be cut off where it hangs off the left edge of the gable roof.


Snap a vertical chalk line from the inside edge of the first shingle on the second row to the top of the roof, and from the inside edge of the first shingle to the top of the roof. These chalk lines will serve as a guide for subsequent even-numbered rows of shingles, and odd-numbered rows, respectively. Continue working horizontally up the roof until you reach the peaks.

, Nail pieces of aluminum sheeting over holes that you can stick your finger through to protect roofing over holes from sagging, dimpling, cracking and leaking.


Stack pipes, vents and chimneys are surrounded with metal flashing laid over tar. Shingles should be interlaced with this flashing, which is usually cemented and nailed-down under upper shingles, but over the shingles on the sides. This is so water will run down the roof but not under the interlacing. For stacks and vents, have the bottom 2 or 3 rows that meet the flashing go under it, while the upper rows go over the flashing.

, Cement a sheet metal flashing apron over the upper edge of the chimney flange before laying shingles over it and cement another flashing apron over the lower half. Then cover the lower apron on each cemented side layer of flashing that tucks under the top apron using asphalt roofing cement.

, You can either use special shingles called ridge shingles or cut a number of regular shingles into 3 tabbed, equal pieces and bend each so they fit snugly on the roof peak and nail them into place. You'll need longer nails for this part, as you're driving through more layers of shingles.

, You'll get the most life out of your shingles and your roof by laying them in a smart pattern. The basic straight up pattern already described is perhaps the easiest and most commonly used, but professional roofers have different opinions about the most proper and efficient method of laying the shingles to get the most life out of them, which differ slightly in the amount of overlap and the pattern in which you install them. The basic patterns include:


the straight-up pattern
the half pattern
4-inch offset
5-inch offset

, All the other patterns work in essentially the same way, offsetting the courses by a particular amount. For the 6-inch or ""half"" offset, you can protect butt joints and horizontally-moving water by starting a new course 6-inches in every row. Every seventh course, the butt joints will realign and offer stability and protection., The method is exactly the same, though the measurement of the offset is slightly different. In an offset of four inches, standard shingles will realign every ten courses, while the five inch offsets will realign every eight. Understanding the benefits of each will help you decide which method to use for your roof:


The short overlap of the four inch offset is somewhat easier, allowing you to use cutouts to overlap every two courses, making less work for you. Unfortunately, because of this, the pattern is less desirable for extremely cold climates or very wet places.
For most DIY roofers, the five-inch offset is the most desirable pattern. It offers the most protection per shingle, making it much less likely that runoff will cut through the in-betweens, hiding shingle irregularities, and getting the most bang for your buck.

, The racking technique uses two sizes of the first shingle of each row, the regular 3 tab pieces and shortened pieces for each end, working vertically rather than horizontally. It goes much faster, allowing you to keep your tools next to you as you work and avoiding having to constantly reposition. Racking shingles sometimes also may create a condition called ""pattern curling,"" where the shingles curl and blow in the wind, at the places where the racked columns join, because of lifting the end of a shingle to place the next shingle and lifting the end high enough to nail the next shingle underneath each of the overlapping shingles. This curling may lead to water getting under shingles, leaking at the places where racked columns meet.
In some cases, racking may void the manufacturer's warranty on the expected leak-proofing quality and useful life of some brands of shingles. It's a common practice among contractors.

Design your roof truss.,
Saw the truss members to size.,
Lay the truss members out on the ground.,
Secure the joints with metal gusset plates.,
Install the roof trusses.",How to Make Roof Trusses," As with any structural member, a faulty design will undermine even the most professional of installations. Your roof truss will need to be able to handle the expected dead loads and live loads on your structure's roof. The truss will also need to be supported adequately at its ends.


The best material for building trusses on a small scale project is sawn lumber. Dimension lumber and engineered woods like plywood are not available in the sizes and lengths necessary to build a solid truss.






The roof truss will have a horizontal lower chord, and 2 angled upper chords that follow the roof line. These chords will be connected by ""web"" members, which will be oriented to form triangles. Your design should call for the same size lumber for each member.





;
, After designing the truss, saw each member to its required length. You will likely need to use more than 1 length of lumber to make the lower chord, so plan on joining the 2 pieces at the midspan of the truss. You will have stronger joints if you angle each cut so that it fits flush against the other members.

, Once all the chord and web members are cut to size, arrange them flat on the ground in the shape of the truss. Make sure that all the connections fit snugly, sawing off additional length if necessary.

, Lay out toothed gusset plates (often called ""nail plates"") so that they cover each joint, making sure that the plates cover each member equally. Hammer each gusset plate into the wood until the teeth are fully driven in and the plate sits flush against the lumber. Turn the entire truss over and repeat this process on the other side.


As an alternative, you can make your own gusset plates out of plywood. Lay pieces of plywood over each joint, covering about a foot (30 cm) of each truss member's length. Glue the plywood to the joint, and then nail it to each member to fully secure it. Repeat this process on the reverse side of the truss.







, Once the trusses are constructed, lift them into place and set them onto the top plates of the exterior walls just as you would a beam or joist. Toe-nail them into the top plate to secure them, and then make sure they are braced laterally using blocking or long purlins.

Inspect your tile roof periodically.,
Do NOT pressure wash your roof.,
Refurbish your roof.,
Replace damaged tiles immediately.,
Walk on your tile roof very carefully.",How to Maintain a Tile Roof," Tile roofs are extremely durable but still have to be inspected occasionally. Look for cracked or chipped tiles. Damaged sections have to be replaced immediately. Take appropriate measures to reduce the effects of other issues with your tile roof.;
, Read http://roofcoatingscam.com/is-it-safe-to-pressure-wash-a-roof/ to find out why and the damage it can cause. Effectively, the only way to safely clean your roof and the tiles on it is to use a 6"" trowel and wire brush and do it manually by hand. Pressure washing can erode the concrete tiles or penetrate through into the felt below and cause flooding in the roof space.

, After you wash your roof and let it dry, you may want to take additional steps to protect and rejuvenate the surface.

Buffing: In time, tile produces a chalky deposit on its surface. This is called efflorescence, and is caused by a natural chemical reaction in manufactured concrete. Efflorescence dulls the sheen of the surface, but in no way affects the structural integrity of the tile. Buff tiles with a clean rag.






Priming: Coat your roof with a clear alkyd primer. This gives the surface a protective sheen that reflects the sun's rays, keeping your home cooler. Primers also help fill the porous surface of concrete, making it repel water efficiently.






Painting: Use a heavy-duty acrylic paint. The polymers provide a durable, waterproof finish while improving the appearance of the roof. Some paints also are mildew-resistant. While gently buffing tile with fine sandpaper helps paint adhere to the surface better, the practice is impractical when painting a roof. Use a sprayer for the job, being careful not to paint other parts of the structure.






Sealing: Applying a clear acrylic sealant is a key part of a roof-restoration project. Use a sealant to help restore the color and durability of existing tile.







, Chipped, cracked or broken tiles should be removed as soon as they're discovered. Broken tiles can compromise the roof's ability to withstand exposure to rain and sun. To replace a tile, slide a flat bar under the 2 tiles above the broken piece. Put another flat bar under the tile to the left of the damaged one. Gently pry the bars upward and remove the broken tile. Before putting in a new tile, replace the roofing underlayment. When you've replaced the tile, pull out the left-hand bar first, then the one above.

, You'll have to go up on your roof periodically to clean the surface and make repairs. Tile is fragile, and you can severely damage your roof by walking on it. The key to walking on a tile roof is distributing your weight over and area wider than your foot. To do this, experienced workers lay down plywood walkways, treated with foam backs, when moving across a tile roof. Never walk along the delicate edges of tile or along specially cut tiles that are difficult to replace.

, Arrange the shingles so the ends and the tab notches do not lie directly above gaps in the shingle below. If the gaps lined up, water could get directly onto the roof sheathing and then seep in through a nail hole.








, One row would have nothing cut, the next row would have 6"" cut off, then 12"" cut off, and so on.








, Note how the first full shingle overhangs the edge by about 1/8"". This makes the water drip away from the fascia (the vertical board at the edge of the roof) and helps reduce deterioration of the fascia.








, A pneumatic nail gun makes quick work out of nailing shingles, but it has some drawbacks. The main drawback of pneumatic roofing nailers is their inconsistency in nail depth. Sometimes the heads stick up a little and sometimes the heads tear into the shingle. Another frequent problem is that nails sometimes enter the roof at an angle, which makes the head stick up. Protruding nail heads can tear the shingle above them, and it stands to reason that they don't hold as well as properly nailed shingles. Hand driving roofing nails give a superior level of quality but may take much longer to complete the roof.








, Most roofing nail guns have an adjustable guide on the bottom. This allows accurate positioning of the shingle before nailing it. The same results could have been achieved with an ""L""-shaped piece of wood to use as a positioning guide. It's kind of hard to see in this photo, but the adjustable guide is set against the lower edge of the previous row's shingle (in this case the first row) and the next shingle is rested against the nail gun's contact foot. This creates a uniform exposure every time. Notice the pattern of shingles as they are applied. This method of starting at a corner and working outwards and upwards can be a good way for two people to apply shingles and not be in each others way. One person works horizontally and the other works up the diagonal.








,









Lay the lower edge of the flange over the top of the lower shingles, and the upper edge is positioned underneath the upper shingles.
Cut the shingles to fit around the flange's dome.
Adhere the shingles adjacent to the flange with roofing tar.
Adhere the joint where the cut edges of the shingles meet the dome with roofing tar.
If the plumbing vent is close to the peak of the roof, lap the shingles over the peak of the roof.
Trim the shingles away from the ridge vent hole.
Attach he ridge cap shingles with two nails each.
Attach the plastic ridge vent with 3"" roofing nails.
Position the ridge cap shingles over the ridge vent.
Nail the ridge cap at the two narrow bands molded into the plastic.
Adhere the loose corners of the first shingle with a dab of tar.

Install the ridge tiles.",How to Install Roof Tile," There are a number of different grades of tile to choose from, and you must identify the grade that fits the climate in which the building is situated. Just as vitally, you must determine whether you would prefer clay or concrete tiles (various grades based on climatic conditions are available for both). They differ in a number of ways, and so the choice is a significant one.Clay tiles are considered to be one of the longest-lasting roofing materials available, even substantially longer than concrete ones. While concrete roofing tiles are typically expected to survive 30-50 years, in the right conditions a well made clay roof might be expected to last 100 years.
Though durable, clay tiles can be more expensive (and neither option is particularly cheap). One estimate illustrates the importance of the price difference: to place a concrete tile roof on a fairly common home with a roof area of 1,500 square feet could cost between $6,000 and $15,000; it could cost between $10,500 and $45,000 to give a clay tile roof to the same house.Finally, the color of concrete tiles are more prone to fade over time than that of clay tiles. For any roof that you will likely have for multiple decades, this is certainly an issue to think about.;
, To put it in simplest terms, a basic asphalt shingle (perhaps the most common roofing material in America) will typically place a weight of less than 3 pounds per square foot on a roof. Concrete tiles, which are usually lighter than clay tiles, can easily place over 10 pounds of weight per square foot on a roof. If you are adding tiles to a roof that did not previously have them, or to a design which did not originally incorporate them, the roof may not be capable of carrying the excess weight. In his case, you will need to have your roof inspected and possibly reinforced to bear the load., While some of these are common--for example, it is recommended that you have a ladder--others are rather specific to this task and are items that are likely not yet in your inventory. For example:


Gasket nails are a type of nail with an interior plastic cap that will help seal nail holes and prevent leaks.Underlay or underlayment. This is the water-resistant layer between the tiles and the roof frame and sheathing. A number of varieties are available, but because this is a roof intended to last from 30 to 100 year, it is probably a good idea to invest in one of the heavy-duty options.Outdoor caulking or sealant. There are a number of caulks or sealants available for outdoor use, but once again it is recommended that you use especially durable and high quality products. This roof could last a lifetime, but it won't if the materials don't suit the requirements of the job. , The most important staring point comes from your roof dimensions. You can use this calculator to help you determine the size of your roof (do not use the function titled ""Tile Calculator,"" which is clearly intended for interior floor tile).


Without specific information about the type of tile selected, it is impossible to estimate the number of tiles necessary to complete a job. A 100 square foot section of roof could require anywhere from 75 to 400 tiles.

, If you are going to replace the roof of an existing home, you must factor in the weather and the time you have available in which to complete this job. While it is obvious that you aren't going to want to rip your roof on during the winter, you must also look for dry days. Check the long-term weather reports (with an understanding that forecasts do change). Also, make sure you have enough manpower available to complete this project in a timely manner. This is not a one person job, and you will have to plan accordingly.

, While you are obtaining the materials, do consult with hardware store employees who may have special knowledge about the products. If customers have been complaining about a faulty product, they may have some knowledge about it.

, This is, on its own, a major job that can take days and require special tools. Be prepared to take the time to do this right.

, You should have reinforced the frame of the roof earlier before stripping any existing roof off. That said, the sheathing--the layer of wood or other material that covers the area between the relatively open frame and the outer layers of roofing--may be damaged or weak. Strengthen it.


Again, think about the weight involved. The fairly cheap and common shingle roofs that many people have are quite light; if you are transitioning from a light roof to a tile roof, the weight difference will be substantial. For a relatively average house with a 1,500 square foot roof, the total of underlayment and tiles will equal something approaching 8 tons in weight. That's more than the equivalent of having two large SUVs parked on top of your house., As you roll out the underlay, keep the bottom edge of the material aligned with the edge of the eave but above any metal or synthetic edging that may cover the borders of the eave.
Secure the underlayment. Roll out 10 foot (3 m)-long sections at a time, and then secure it with nails separated by intervals of 24 inches. Keep all nails at least 2 inches from the edge of the roof.
When you reach the end of the roof, cut the underlayment roll to match the edge. Secure the end with nails.
Restart at the end of the roof at which you first began. Overlap the underlayment, with the new layer partially covering that which was already applied. There may be a series of lines along the roll of underlayment, and this is intended to show the installer precisely how much the layers should overlap. Treat the top line on the installed layer as you previously had the bottom edge of the eave.

, Objects such as chimneys that project out from the roof will have to be sealed up as well. Metal flashing should be used around the chimney, and these should be sealed using caulk or other sealants specifically designed for outdoor use. Underlayment should be cut to fit around these obstacles, and then an additional layer of material (spare slices of the underlayment material, for example) should be placed over the areas where the flashing and underlayment meet and secured in place.

, If the roof has a steep slope, battens may be required to hold the tiles in place. Battens are thin strips of material (usually wood, but sometimes metal or plastic, and commonly 1 inch thick and 2 inches wide) that run horizontally along the length of the roof. Many tile varieties possess a lip or hook that will hang on available battens. (Obviously this is one more thing to consider when identifying the tile that fits your needs) In addition, clips are available to attach the tiles onto the batten.


Use two tiles to determine the spacing required for the battens. A minimum of a 3 inch overlap is required for the tiles that do not interlock (interlocking tiles will take care of the measurement for you), and a smaller amount of overhang should be left over the eaves. Factor this in as you determine the locations of the battens.
After you have determined the distance between the first two battens, measure the distance and set battens using that spacing all the way up, making sure to double check measurements as you go along.

, Start with one side first, and then move along the length of the roof.


If you have not installed battens, you can nail the tiles directly into the sheathing.
If you have installed battens first, you will nail the tiles into the battens. You can also use clips to anchor the tiles to the battens.
If your are using tiles that tightly interlock, it may not be necessary to nail all the tiles to the sheathing or battens; read the instructions that come with the tiles closely for details.

, Obstacles like the chimney will get in the way, and tiles will have to be cut to fit tightly around these areas. Additionally, tiles at the end of each row will almost certainly have to be cut.

, After you have completed the ""fields""--that is, the broad surfaces of the roof--you will need to cap the tops with special ridge tiles. These are rounded, and depending upon design can either be laid out end-to-end or in an overlapping style. This should be the final step in the process of installation. Congratulations are due for your successful assembly of a new tile roof!

Cutting tools:Angle grinder: The fastest option. Wear hearing and eye protection. Paint or prime cut edges to prevent rust.Circular saw: Slower than angle grinder, but follow same instructions. Use a metal blade and expect it to wear quickly.Nibbler: Effective if rated for the right metal and gauge.Tin snips: Slow but safe. Wear work gloves and find the longest pair you can.

, Use a 3/16-inch (4.76 ml) drill bit.


Spacing for the holes on the ends and sides of the panels should be 6 to 8 inches (15.3 to 20.4 cm).

, Place them directly onto purlins that are attached to the roof trusses, beginning on the outside edge.


Close or seal off the ends with a wood or plastic strip under the panel at each end. These will stop the entry of rain, wind and pests.

, Pre-drill the holes, and use #10X2-inch (#10X5.2 cm) screws with polycarbonate washers.


Continue across the roof until it is completely covered, lapping over the previous panel by at least 2.5 inches (5.5 cm) minimum.
Adjust the lap so that the last panel completes the coverage without making a cut lengthwise.

, If your roof is two-sided (and not just a single slope), repeat the installation on the other side of the roof, and install a corrugated ridge cap as you proceed across with the panels.

For each section of 150 square feet (14 m2), you should install a roof vent that measures 1 square foot (.1 m2). If the floor of your attic is 450 square feet (41.8 m2), you will need 3 1-square-foot (.1 m2) roof vents.;
,


Hammer a nail into the ceiling of the attic where you would like to install the roof vent. Hammer the nail from the inside of the attic. When you go onto the outside of the roof, you will see the nail sticking out of the roof.
Space the roof vents evenly.
Position the roof vents at least 2 feet (.6 m) below the ridge of the roof.
Ensure that there are no electrical wires or cables where you want to install your roof vent.
Avoid placing a roof vent over a rafter.

, Use a pencil to mark the dimensions of the roof vent. Use the nail poking up from the roof as the center point from which to measure.

,


Take off the shingles that lie where the roof vent will go. Cut off the loose part of the shingles with a utility knife.
Pull the nailed portion of the shingles off with a pry bar.
Use a pry bar to pull any remaining nails out of the area where you will install the roof vent.

, Use a reciprocating saw to cut away the area that you have marked and freed of shingles. The hole should be the same size as the aperture in the roof vent that you will use.

, Draw up the sides and tops of the shingles that lie around the cut hole.

, Place caulk onto the roof vent's flange. The flange extends outward from the bottom of the roof vent. The flange provides a surface with which to attach the vent to the roof, and also helps to prevent leaks between the vent and the surface of the roof.

Choose the type of corrugated roofing you want to use: PVC/fiberglass, or metal.,
PVC roofing.,
Metal roofing.",How to Install Corrugated Roofing2," These come in various lengths, but with a nominal 26-inch (66.04 cm) width. They each have advantages and disadvantages:

, The advantage of the PVC/polycarbonate roofing is the translucency of the panels.They allow daylight to enter through them.


If cost is a factor, PVC is a cheaper alternative to sheet metal.
PVC will block out the heat from the sun much more effectively than sheet metal, which will act like a radiator.
Some PVC is translucent, but filters ultraviolet rays, and comes in a variety of colors.
The disadvantages of PVC are that it's not as durable as sheet metal, is noisy in the rain, and can easily break off during high winds.


, One of the strongest features of corrugated metal is its durability. Modern galvanized steel or aluminum is resistant to rust, and can easily last up to 100 years.

Metal roofing is quieter than PVC when it rains.
Metal roofing resists rot, is not susceptible to insect damage, and is non-combustible (a boon in fire-prone areas).
The downsides include a susceptibility to denting, both in installation and in the case of an during hailstorms. It can also be significantly more expensive.


"
"
Prepare the roof surface by removing any old roofing, any rotten wood, and adding roofing felt to the entire surface.,
Calculate the number of sheets of corrugated metal needed.,
Place your first metal sheet in a corner of the roof, flush against the surface.

,
Nail in the first metal sheet to the wood of the roof.,
Place the second metal sheet alongside the first with an overlap of 3 to 4 inches (or 10 cm).,
Nail the second metal sheet to the roof.

,
Continue with the other sheets, overlapping on every side of each sheet except for at the edges of the roof.

,
Secure ridge caps to the bottom lip of the roof.,
Test the roof for any loose spots or places where water can seep in.,
Paint the corrugated roof, if desired.

",How to Install Corrugated Metal Roofing,"


Roofing felt is a cheap and easy-to-install material: simply nail the sheets into wood, overlapping each sheet by 3 to 4 inches (or about 10 cm).;
, Divide the area of your roof by the size of the sheets you will be using. Remember that you will want the metal sheets to overlap.

,, You should use about 20 nails per sheet. Whenever possible, nail in the valley between the ridges, where the roofing is closest to the wood.

, Secure the sheets together using hex screws and washers.


Whenever possible, line up the ridges of each metal sheet. This will create a tighter roof and make it easier to drill in the screws. Screw in the spaces between where you nailed the first sheet to the wood.

,,, Follow the same method as when installing the metal sheets: overlap the ridge caps both with each other and with the sheets, using hex screws and washers where the metal overlaps and nails where the ridge caps attach to wood.


You will use about 40 nails for each length of ridge cap.

, If any roofing is sticking up, secure it as much as possible with nails or screws if attaching it to other metal sheets.

Finish the flooring.",How to Install Vinyl Flooring," Use a measuring tape to carefully determine the size of your room. It is imperative that you get accurate measurements, or else you may end up with too little vinyl to finish the job. In general, order a small amount of extra vinyl above your measurements, so you don’t run out.






;
, Vinyl flooring can be placed in a variety of rooms, so the things you have to remove will vary depending on where you are placing your vinyl. Take out any free-standing furniture, and then move on to appliances. In a kitchen, you’ll need to remove the fridge and stove








You don’t need to remove any cabinets or vanities, as these are typically in permanent locations and the flooring can be installed around them.

, This step is primarily necessary if you have carpet that you are replacing with vinyl; vinyl flooring can cover nearly any floor surface, so long as it is rigid, flat, smooth, and dry. Pull up the old floor, and remove the threshold strips that trim out the doorways. The next step, although tedious, is very important: work along the subfloor, pulling out (or hammering in) any and staples and nails that you encounter that are not driven below the floor surface.









You can pull a metal trowel across the floor and listen for the ‘tink!’ sound that happens when you hit a nail or staple, making it easier to find them.
Old flooring and floor adhesives may contain asbestos, so call your county for an asbestos test before pulling it or disturbing it. If your county building or environmental office doesn't offer this service, consult a private testing laboratory to find out how to gather samples and have them test them.
If you choose not to remove the old flooring (if, for example, you’re putting vinyl over concrete or wood), just know that the floor will be a bit higher, and you might have to trim the bottom of your doors to accommodate the height.

, Making a template of the floor will allow you to get precise measurements, and may make cutting your plywood








You may need to do this in sections if you’re working with a large room or floor space.
You can measure hard-to-reach areas of flooring and draw/cut it onto the paper, if it is easier.

, For subfloors that require a lot of work to smooth, flatten, or level, installing an underlayment is the easiest way to make this correction. The underlayer is a ¼-inch thick layer of plywood that smooths out the floor and provides a sturdy base for the vinyl. Tape your paper template of the floor to your underlayer plywood. Use this as a guide, and cut the plywood to fit the flooring in your room. Carefully cut your plywood in sections that match up, checking for fit with each completed piece.









Only use vinyl-floor grade underlayer plywood, or else it won’t hold up.
Rough-cut the underlayer first, and then make more detailed cuts after fitting each piece.

, Put your underlayer plywood sheets in the room, and leave them for 2 or 3 days. This will allow them to acclimate to your home’s normal humidity levels, and prevent the vinyl from coming up or tearing later on in the process. Place the underlayer in it’s final location, so that the wood fits the space.








, To install the underlayer, you will need to use a special underlayer stapler with ⅞-inch staples; you will use approximately 16 staples per square foot of underlayer. You should never use nails or screws in the underlayer, as these will cause bumps in the vinyl flooring. Work your way across the room, stapling the underlayer to the floor. Remove and replace any staples that don’t go all the way through the plywood.








, Work your way across the floor with a sander, smoothing down any edges that are not flush where they meet, or bumps in the underlayer. Then, use a leveling compound to fill in these spaces and any cracks in the underlayer. This will help to provide a smooth underlayer, which is vital to having a smooth final application of your vinyl.









Follow the package directions for applying the floor leveling compound and make sure it is compatible with both the underlayer and the vinyl adhesive you will be using.

, Vinyl typically comes in 12 inch square tiles, but it may come in sheets. If you have vinyl sheets, all you have to do is cut it out to fit the room, allowing for seams if the room is wider than the sheet. Vinyl tiles, on the other hand, must be applied in a pattern. It’s typically easiest to apply vinyl in rows, but you may want to change the direction of the rows (for example, have them go diagonally across the room). #Determine how you will lay the floor. You may strike a chalk line as a guide to the first row of vinyl (if you are using tiles. Keep in mind that you will always start your pattern in the center of the room and work your way out, in order to keep it symmetrical.








, There are two types of vinyl: self-stick, and glue down. Self-stick vinyl is very straight forward, as it comes with an adhesive backing that you use to stick it to the floor. Glue down vinyl takes a bit more work, as it requires you to put a layer of vinyl flooring glue on the underlayer prior to placing your vinyl. If you have self-stick vinyl, simply follow the directions for application and you are set. If you have unglued vinyl, continue on for instructions on applying it.







, To make applying your vinyl easier, you can lay it out and cut it to fit using your paper template. Simply lay the vinyl out on the template, and use it as a pattern for cutting your vinyl to size. If you prefer, you can skip this step and measure/cut your vinyl directly in the room, on the underlayer.








, Get your vinyl flooring adhesive out, and get a notched trowel. Generally a 1/16 inch trowel is used for spreading the adhesive, some adhesives may also be applied with a short-napped paint roller. Start in a corner of the room (following your pattern), and scoop out some of the glue onto the trowel. Spread this across the underlayer in one section of the room, and then wait a few minutes for the ‘open’ time to set; laying the vinyl right away will cause air bubbles to form as the solvents evaporate from the adhesive.









Always have a damp rag at the ready for spills or smears on the vinyl.
Make sure that the notch-size of your trowel is compatible with the adhesive you’re using; check the application directions to verify.

, For solid vinyl tiles (VCT, or vinyl composition tiles), place each one flat, perfectly aligned with the row, and snugly abutting the previous tile. Do not slide the tiles when laying them, as this will ""drag"" the adhesive., If you’re using small vinyl tiles, you can use a rolling pin (yes, like the one in your kitchen); otherwise, rent a floor roller from a local home and garden center. Apply pressure as you roll over the tile in order to stick it to the adhesive and the underlayer. Do this for each section of vinyl that you lay, and then again when you’ve completed all of the vinyl.








, Work your way across the floor, applying the vinyl according your your pattern. Lay out some of the glue, allow it to dry until tacky, stick the vinyl, roll over it with your roller, and repeat the process at the next section. Fill the entire floor with the vinyl, until you reach the edges. If you need to cut vinyl to fit the odd edge spaces, do so now. Otherwise, place your cut vinyl into these spaces and roll over them to verify that they are secured.








, Wait several hours for the floor adhesive to dry (according to package instructions), and then begin replacing the molding

Apply a heavy bead of asphalt cement.",How to Install Asphalt Shingles," It generally takes three bundles of shingles to cover 100 square feet (9.29 square meters). Asphalt shingle ""bundles"" are actually sealed in packages (the term bundle comes from wooden shingles which actually came tied up with wire in bundles). Measure your roof and buy appropriately.


Measure the length and width of the individual sections of the roof, multiplying them together to determine the area. Add the areas of each section together, then divide by 100 to get the correct number of squares. Multiply this number by 3 to get the number of bundles you'll need to buy.;
, This will help determine how the shingles will lay on the roof width. Most asphalt shingles are 3 feet (91.4 centimeters) in length. If your roof's width is not an even multiple of the shingle's length, you will have a partial piece on one end of each row.


The bottom row of shingles must hang past the edge of the roof. For a wood shingle roof you would have to cut the shingles that go on the edge to create a straight line to accommodate this.

, Start removing the shingles at the peak farthest from the trash container, or the corner you want to collect the shingles in. Use a garden fork or a roofing shovel to pull them off quickly, use the hammer-method and go by hand for a more thorough job.


Pry up the nails and loosening the ridge caps. It's ok if you don't get all the nails at first, because you'll have a chance to go back through and remove them later.
Remove the metal flashing around chimneys, vents, and valleys in the roof. Flashing in the valleys will almost always be trashed, especially. Some roofers will keep some of the flashing that's in good shape, but it's probably worth junking it all when you've got the chance.

, Sweep the roof as clean as possible. Remove nails that didn't come up earlier. Reattach loose boards in the sheathing. Examine the sheathing for damage and rotted boards, replacing the damaged sections., Lay asphalt, felt-paper, or special waterproof underlayment, over the roof. Some roofers will use 15-pound (6.8 kg) roofing paper, which is an effective method. Be generous with the staples while attaching the paper to the roof deck. Use ""tin caps"" under staples, if the roof may be exposed to wind before shingles are to be applied.


Use sticky back ice and water shield as underlayment where ice dams or leaf and twig dams are likely to build up, and at valleys and where the roof ends at a wall (wide metal flashing may also be used there).
Install new flashing. Nail metal flashing called ""drip edge"" along the outer edges of the roof deck.

, You can use narrow tab-less starter shingles if you bought some (GAF Pro-Start is one such brand), or will be cutting your own starter shingles to fit the particular project. Some people like to only have to buy one variety of shingle and cut them to fit, while others prefer the ease of the pre-cut starter shingles without tabs.

, Depending on the type of shingles you're using and the roof you're working on, you may need to marking a chalk guideline beginning 7 inches (17.8cm) from the bottom roof edge. In either case the glue strip of the starter course is then placed along the drip edge, and at the rake edges as well.

Mark from the left to right edge of the roof so the chalk line will be seen immediately above each course as a guideline. Continue to chalk additional guidelines based on the width of the shingle through at least four courses (rows) across the roof.

, If you are making your own starter shingles, cut the tabs off for the ""starter course"" (bottom row) of shingles. To prepare the tabs and lay the starter course, shorten the first starter shingle by 6 inches (or about a half of one tab).Place the glue strip at and all along the drip edge, and the rake edges as well. You will shingle over this starter course, so the bottom course will be double thickness.


Instead of cutting off all three tabs, you can also reverse the shingles for a starter course, so that the entire shingle with tabs turned upward are under your first course of shingles. With either method, putting the solid edge at the drip edge and cutting 6 inches off the length of first starter shingle prevents the slots between the tabs from lining up with the first regular course laid over the starter, thus not to expose the asphalt roofing paper through the slots of that bottom row.
Nail the shingles with no tabs, such as precut Pro-Start shingles,and apply asphalt cement from a caulk gun in many dots along the drip edge under the edge, then press the tab-less shingles down onto the line of asphalt cement dots with adequate spaces between the dots. A continuous bead of asphalt could trap condensation or windblown water under the roofing at some point.

, To make sure you've got the right sizes to lay courses correctly, cut several sizes of shingles from the three-tab variety you purchased. Cut off one-half tab-width of the first tab to start the first course. Each cut is needed to shift the slots of the shingles on the course of shingles a 1/2 tab from aligning with the slots in shingles above and below. Keep all scrap, especially any single tabs for use on the ridge cap shingles. Make the following cuts:


Cut a half tab off for your first course shingles,
Cut off a full tab for your second course shingles
Cut one and a half tabs off of your third course shingles,
Cut two tabs off your fourth course shingles
For your fifth course, cut off half of the final tab
Keep your sixth course tabs intact

, Nail the ""cut off shingle"" into place, about 6 inches from its lower edge. Hammer in one nail about 2 inches from each end of each shingle and another nail about 1 inch above each cutout.


The next shingles above should cover the nails by about 1 inch vertically. Horizontally, end nails will be covered by up to about 1/2 of a tab, of the shingle(s) above. Be sure that these nails will hold the top edge of the course of shingles immediately below.

, Repeat this basic pattern, alternating shingles across the roof, working toward the right side, using the chalk line to keep the shingles straight horizontally.


Use 4 nails per shingle and 6 nails on the prevailing windward sides of the roof, as wind resistance nailing. Some local codes require the 6 nails on all sides.

, You can let the excess extend off the side end of the roof and trim it down after it is nailed on, if you like. Continue this process to the 5th row, then begin the same process as the first row beginning with a full shingle, and a chalk mark. Repeat all of the way to the ridge.


If it is a hip roof, allow about a tab width to overhang onto the next section of roof at the hip to help strengthen the joint there.

, Bend the last course of shingles over the ridge, up to about 6 inches, and nail it onto the other side so that the roofing extends over the top of the ridge, where nails will be covered, leaving no exposed nails.


Bend single tabs (or special ridge shingles) over the ridge, beginning at the end putting a bead of asphalt under the first ridge shingle to hold down the tab. Nail it where the next ridge shingle will cover the nails about an inch horizontally and vertically.

, With the asphalt granules exposed, across to the other end, nail the shingles on both sides of the ridge as before. Cut off the asphalt nail line from a ridge shingle when you get to the other end.

, Dot the cement under and around the edge of the last ridge shingle where you removed the nail line. Nail at the four corners to the end of the ridge.


Also apply asphalt cement over the nail heads exposed on the last ridge shingle to prevent water leaks.

Prepare the floor.,
Install the vapor barrier.,
Pick a corner to start laying the Pergo.,
Continue the row.,
Start the next row.,
Continue laying rows until you've filled the room.,
Install the baseboard.",How to Install Pergo Flooring1," Clean any debris off the floor and secure any loose floorboards before attempting to install anything over the sub-floor. Make sure the sub floor is level with a carpenter's level. Floor leveling is usually only done on concrete floors, but you can find speckling product at the store that you can apply with large putty knives, if you've got a few spaces out of alignment. You can also just install Pergo over the floor, even if it's a bit uneven, but you risk cracking or separating the tiles eventually.


If you're remodeling and not installing Pergo in a new installation, remove any carpet, padding and remnants from the floor. Remove baseboards, vent covers, and any other fixture that would present an obstacle to the flooring. You should clear all the way to the sub-floor.
If you need to undercut the baseboard, use an undercut saw with plastic spacers. Saw the bottom of the trim or chip it out using a chisel or utility knife. It should pop off easily.;
, Whether you're installing Pergo over concrete or wood floors, it's common to install a vapor barrier if you're concerned about moisture. Laying a laminate vapor barrier helps to keep moisture from going into the fiberboard and causing it to warp. This should be available in the flooring section of any home repair store.


Lay the underlayment in strips so they are touching but not overlapping. Any overlap will cause uneven spots in the floor, so try to smooth it out as much as possible.

, For most projects, you want to start with the back left corner of the room and work toward the door. If you start in the middle, you'll have to make cuts when you get to the edges, to make the tiles fit.


To install the tiles, remove the tongue from the first piece. This side will face the wall. Place the tongue side of the second plank into the groove of the first, starting at an angle. When the tongue is in the groove, press down until the joint clicks into place. Work in rows. When you are done with the first row, move to the next.
Be sure to leave a consistent 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) gap around all the edges of the room to allow for expansion with temperature changes. It's also common practice to lay the planks in the direction that any light entering the room shines down the length of the plank.

, At a 30 degree angle along the long side of the two pieces, push the new piece into the groove. They should click together easily, or you can use a crowbar or a hammer to tap them into place gently.

, Stagger the length of the planks in the second and following rows so that none of the planks end at the same place. The best way to do this is to cut a 2 foot (0.61 m) (60.96 cm) length of plank and start the second row with it. Then use a full plank for the third row and keep rotating across the room. Cut your pieces in an area away from where you are installing the floor so the dust does not get into the joints.


There are always unfinished pieces that stick out around two to three sides. Measure from the end of the last piece, subtract a quarter inch, and measure the finished surface to that dimension. Make your cut using a mitre sliding saw. If it's not quite straight on the edges, it'll be covered by the baseboard anyway.

, Connect the joints of the long side of the starter piece with the groove of the last row laid. Press the plank down until it locks into place. Secure the piece into place by using a tapping block near the end of the plank and gently knocking the piece. Continue with the tapping block down the row as you place a plank.

, When you've completed the rows, you're done with the Pergo installation. Install the baseboard according to your plans for the roof and return any fixtures where you removed them. If you're doing new installation, it might be necessary to make a small cut out form under

Measure the area.,
Get your materials.,
Prepare a work site.,
Remove the old roofing.,
Repair any damage.,
Add your insulation layer.",How to Install Metal Roofing1," Before you can begin to update your roof, you will have to get an accurate measurement and order your materials. Always try to measure from the ground first in order to keep yourself safe. If you must climb onto the roof to measure the space, be sure to use caution.









Find out the slope of your roof. The slope is given as rise-over-run, meaning the distance up over the distance over. This measurement will typically be a measurement over 12 inches (30.5 cm), something like 4/12 or 8/12. Convert this to the equivalent in degrees and as a decimal.
Use the slope factor to determine the area of the roof. Measure the area (length x width) on the ground, and then multiply this by the slope (in decimal form). This means the slope factor form is: length x width x slope. This will give you the number of square feet that need to be covered.
For example, if your roof measures 10 feet (3.0 m) x 10 feet (3.0 m) and the slope of the roof is 12/12 (45 degrees, which converts to 1.414 in decimal form), you would multiply 10 x 10 x 1.414, to get the total of 141 square feet of roofing.
Find the square footage for the entirety of your roof, and add up the total to find out how much metal roofing you need to order.
Allow for a minimum of 10% waste (extra roofing).;
, You will most likely have to order the roofing metal in the amount and color specific to your house. You will also need a large garbage can, a jigsaw or power metal shear, a staple gun, a drill and assorted drill bits, 1¼ inch roofing nails, metal roofing screws, and self drilling, self-sealing wood screws.








, In order to make your installation as easy as possible, it is important to have a well-organized work area. You will need a large bin for trash (old roofing and debris), a place for tools, and your scaffolding or ladder set up.









Make sure that if you are using electric tools that none of the chords are in the way.
Store the material in a readily accessible area, protected from the weather. The panels are weather-proof but staining can occur if left open to moisture

, Although you can install corrugated metal roofing over shingles, for the best foundation it is recommended that all the old roofing be removed. Work at a slow and steady pace, not trying to rip-up or carry-off too much old roofing at once.









Start from the highest, furthest point and take up all the old shingles, flashing, vents, and boots. You should be replacing all these with the new metal roofing.
If you come across any large nails that are sticking out, either remove them and put them in your debris container or hammer them in deep so that they aren’t a danger to anyone working.
If you need to reposition your gutters, do so at this point.
Always remove the old roofing on a day (or set of days) when the weather is expected to be dry and sunny, as you don’t want any rain or moisture to seep into your building.

, With the old materials removed, the bare bones of the roof frame or plywood sheathing will be exposed. If there is any damage to the sheathing (the wood under the shingles), insulation, or ventilation, fix it now.








, This helps to block out moisture from getting trapped between the metal roof and the sheathing. Use roofing felt to cover the entirety of the roof and secure it with a staple gun or nails.

Watch for dips and dents that may allow accumulation of water in a particular area.;
, For example, keep copper pipes from touching steel roof systems. When different types of metal come into contact with each other and eventually become wet, they will break down in a process called electrolytic corrosion.

, Dip a cloth into the bucket, and then clean uncoated metal roofing with this solution. Rinse with clear water from a garden hose.

, Clean the scratched portion of the roof with the mineral spirits, and then rinse with clear water and allow it to dry. Dab a small paintbrush into metal touch-up paint, and then cover the scratched area with the paint.

, Remove all the rust possible, and then rinse with clear water from a garden hose. Do not scrape the rust with a wire brush. If the rust has caused corrosion, sand it lightly to remove the rust completely, and then apply a metal primer to protect the roof from future rust. Apply touch-up paint to the metal primer for aesthetic purposes, if you wish.

, Repair loose pieces or damaged panels, or contact the installer for assistance with these issues. If you have access to the underside of the roofing system, you may be able to push dents back out without professional assistance.

, Use extreme caution if cleaning snow or ice from a roof with a metal tool, as it may scrape and damage the protective coating of the roof.

Buy a little bit more than you think you need.",How to Install Linoleum Flooring," Linoleum and its synthetic alternatives are soft, pliable, and flexible when compared to most other flooring materials. In fact, they're so flexible that they will actually shrink and expand ever-so-slightly with changes in temperature.Though these changes are imperceptible to the naked eye, they can cause minor issues when it comes to installing and maintaining your floor. Because of this, you'll want to give your linoleum a chance to reach its ""resting"" size by storing it in the room you intend to use it in for about 24 hours prior to installing it.;
, Before beginning the process of laying down your linoleum flooring, you'll want to completely clear your work area from any possible obstructions. For most rooms, this will mean removing any furniture or floor decorations (e.g. rugs, etc.), along with any appliances that are connected to the floor, like toilets or pedestal-style sinks. Finally, you will probably want to remove any doors from their hinges, especially if they open inward, to ensure that you're able to comfortably work all the way to the edge of the room.


When it comes to preparing your work area, be conservative. Spending a little extra time removing items that may not be completely necessary to remove is almost always a better use of time than halting your work later on to, for instance, uninstall a toilet that's in your way.

, Next, remove any baseboards — the small wooden ""trim"" pieces at the bottom of a wall — that run along the edges of your floor. Usually, this can be accomplished by carefully prying with a pry bar, flat head screwdriver, or sturdy putty knife. To prevent damage to your wall, try inserting a small block of wood behind your prying tool as you work the baseboard away from the wall. This keeps your tool from scratching against the wall and provides additional leverage.While you're working on your baseboards, take the opportunity to also remove any outlet covers that could be damaged by your linoleum flooring installation project.

, After you remove your baseboards, quickly examine your bottoms of your walls near the floor to look for any leftover nails sticking out of the wall. Carefully pull these nails out of the wall with a pair of pliers, the ""claw"" end of a hammer, or a similar prying tool. If left in, these nails can present problems when attempting to lay your linoleum flat against the wall.

, Linoleum must be laid over floor that's as close to perfectly smooth and even as possible. If it isn't, the underlying imperfections will eventually be reflected in the linoleum itself, resulting in unsightly bumps, ridges, soft spots, and so on. If you plan to lay your linoleum over the existing floor, check it to make sure that it is level and free of imperfections. If you plan to lay it over the subfloor, remove your existing flooring and check whether the subfloor is in good condition. If your floor or subfloor isn't completely even and level, you may want to try fixing minor issues with the tips below:Concrete floors: Level high spots with a grinder or masonry chisel. Fill in small holes or cracks with additional concrete.
Wood floors: Use an embossing leveler to fix minor dents and indentations. For more serious issues, use plywood underlayment (see below).
Existing linoleum floors: Repair worn sections of floor or indentations with an embossing leveler (apply with a straightedge trowel). If any sections are damaged or loose, remove the linoleum and work off of the subfloor.

, Some floors and subfloors just aren't suitable for supporting linoleum flooring — either they're too worn or damaged to easily repair or you'd like to keep the floor material for use in other projects. In these cases, it's usually best to use a plywood underlayment to support the linoleum. Cut 1/4 inch (0.63 centimeter) underlayment-grade plywood to fit the floor area you plan to cover with linoleum, then lay this over the existing floor or subfloor. This provides a smooth, even surface for the linoleum to rest on, bypassing the problems of using a damaged or worn floor entirely.


For tight seams for your plywood pieces, use a pneumatic stapler about every 8 inches (20.3 cm) along edges.
Don't forget that using an underlayment will raise the level of the floor slightly, which may require you to shave off a small amount of material from the bottoms of any doors in the room.

, Now that your floor is ready for linoleum to be installed, it's time to measure it so that you'll know precisely how much linoleum to use and exactly how to cut it. You have several options for measuring your floor — just a few are listed below. Regardless of which method you use, it's important to make your measurements as accurate as possible so that your linoleum will fit precisely against your walls and appliances.


One option for measuring your floor is to lay down a large sheet (or sheets) of a heavy paper like butcher paper across the area of floor you intend to cover with linoleum. Use a pencil to precisely trace the edges of the floor area. Cut the shape of your floor area from your paper, then use this as an outline when you cut out your linoleum.
Another option is to use a tape measure to obtain measurements for all of the sides of your flooring area. Sketch these results on a piece of paper and use your measurements to cut your piece of linoleum. This method is especially handy for square or rectangular sections of floor — all you need to do is measure two perpendicular sides and you'll know exactly how much to cut.

, Once you have a paper outline of your floor area or precise measurements and a rough sketch, you're ready to mark your linoleum material with its final shape. Use a washable marker to trace your paper outline or use a straightedge and tape measure to draw lines according to the floor measurements you took. Linoleum is usually sold in 6 or 12 foot (1.8 - 3.6 meter) wide rolls, so it should be possible to mark and cut linoleum flooring for most small spaces and rooms (e.g., bathrooms, hallways, etc.) in one seamless piece. For larger projects, it's OK to use two or more pieces.


It's almost always a good idea to mark your linoleum floor pieces about an inch or two wider than they need to be. While it's fairly easy to trim the edges of the linoleum to make it fit your floor space, there's no way to make a piece of linoleum that's too small bigger, so be conservative when cutting your linoleum.

, Once you know the exact dimensions of the floor area you intend to cover, you can begin cutting your linoleum. Note that, for the most accurate fit, it's best to use linoleum that's been allowed to acclimate to the room for about a day (see above). Use the measurement or outline you took to cut your linoleum in as few separate pieces as possible.


To cut your linoleum, use a sharp utility knife or a hooked linoleum knife and cut along your pre-marked lines. Use a straightedge to ensure an accurate cut. If you have some handy, put an extra layer of plywood underneath your linoleum as you cut it to avoid gouging your floor.

, Carefully move the cut linoleum piece(s) into position and lay it down. Work the linoleum around any corners and obstructions, taking care not to crease it. If you marked and cut your linoleum so that you have an extra inch or two on every side, the extra material will lay up against the walls. Use your linoleum-cutting tool to carefully trim the edges of your linoleum so that it lays flat on the floor and is flush against the edges of the flooring area. Below are a few tips for trimming your linoleum to fit snugly:


Straight walls: Use a straightedge or straight piece of wood (like a 2x4) to crease the linoleum against the corner where the wall meets the floor. Cut along the crease.
Inside corners: Use V-shaped cuts to shave excess material off of the linoleum where it meets the inside corner. Cautiously remove thin strips of material until the linoleum just lays flat against the floor.
Outside corners: Make a vertical cut inward from the corner at a 45o angle. Shave material off from both sides of the corner until the linoleum sits flat against the floor.

, Now, peel back half of your floor. Use a notched trowel to spread adhesive on the underside of the linoleum. Follow the linoleum's recommended directions for use — some linoleum is meant to have adhesive applied evenly across the entire underside, while other types of linoleum are meant to have adhesive applied only along the edges. Allow the adhesive to sit briefly (most adhesives used for this purpose recommend doing so to achieve the best hold), then roll it back down and carefully press it into its place on the floor. Repeat for the other half of the floor.


Linoleum/flooring adhesive is almost always available at major hardware stores (often under the all-purpose name ""flooring adhesive""). Always defer to the usage instructions included with the products you buy, including your adhesive. — if they vary from those presented in this article, err on the safe side by following them.
For linoleum requiring adhesive all over its underside (rather than around the perimeter), leave a few inches along the edges without adhesive. Linoleum can shrink and expand slightly when exposed to glue, so wait to apply adhesive to the edges until this settling has occurred.

, Use a heavy roller (a 100 pound model should work well) to remove air bubbles from the linoleum and securely adhere it to the floor or subfloor. Work from the middle of the floor to the edges, taking care to carefully roll over the entire floor. If this forces excess adhesive out from under the edges of the linoleum, use a solvent to dissolve it and remove it with a wet rag according to the manufacturer's directions.

, To give your new linoleum floor a protective, glossy sheen that can add longevity, finish it with an approved linoleum sealant. Use a brush or roller to apply a thin, even coat over the entire piece of linoleum, taking care not to leave any spots bare. Work from the farthest corners of the floor inward to ensure that you don't have to step on any wet sealant.


Pay extra attention to any seams in the linoleum — spaces where two pieces of linoleum rest against each other. If not sealed properly, these seams can become natural locations for peeling and water damage.

, As your sealant and adhesive dry, it's important to stay off of your new floor. Even after your sealant is completely dry, keep traffic to a minimum until the underlying adhesive sets completely. Replacing your furniture too early or walking excessively on the floor can cause the still-pliable flooring to deform as it dries, leading to permanent bumps and divots.


Many flooring adhesives will be sufficiently dry in 24 hours, but some may require longer drying times. Always defer to your manufacturer's directions and err on the side of caution. Prolonging a minor inconvenience in the short term can save you problems in the long term.

, When your new linoleum floor has completely dried, you can start getting your room back to normal. Replace your baseboards, appliances, furniture, electrical outlet covers, and any other items you removed from the room to prepare it for its new floor. Take care during re-installation not to scratch, mar or damage your linoleum.


Keep in mind that some of the items you replace (especially doors and baseboards) may need to be slightly raised or altered to accommodate the slightly higher floor level.
For very heavy furniture and appliances, use a piece of plywood to slide the fixture into place, rather than dragging it across the floor, as doing this can damage floors even after they've set.
For specific help re-installing some common room fixtures, see our installation articles on baseboards, doors, and appliances.

, As you're returning your room to its original condition, don't forget that many room fixtures require their edges to be sealed with caulk to provide an air- and water-tight seal. Baseboards in particular can require extensive caulking, as can toilets, sinks, and other appliances that use water. Note that latex or acrylic latex-based caulk is usually best for most indoor projects.

, Though linoleum and vinyl flooring are fairly cheap compared to flooring options like hardwood and tile, you still won't want to spend any more money on your flooring project than necessary. Figuring out how much linoleum your project calls for beforehand can prevent you from wasting money on excessive flooring material and save you the hassle of having to run back to the hardware store if you don't have enough. For most projects, the easiest way to do this is simply to use an online calculator (like this one).


Though online calculators will vary, most (including the one above) simply require you to input the length and width of your floor section (or sections) to receive a total estimate. For floor sections that are square or rectangular, you'll only need one length and width, but for a differently-shaped area of floor, you'll need to divide your square into rectangular sections and find a length and width for each to get an accurate total.

, You don't need to use a calculator to figure out how much linoleum you need — it's also pretty easy to find this amount by hand. Use one of the equations below to determine exactly how much linoleum is necessary for your project depending on whether you're buying sheet linoleum by the yard or tiled linoleum.Keep in mind that, regardless of the equation you use, your floor area value will be the length of your floor times its width (for each rectangular section of floor).


For sheet linoleum: (Floor area)/9 = # of Square yards of linoleum needed
For 9-inch tiles: (Floor area)/0.5626 = # of 9-inch linoleum tiles needed
For 12-inch tiles: (Floor area) = # of 12-inch linoleum tiles needed

, As with all home improvement projects, it's a smart use of your time to buy just a little extra when you're shopping for linoleum flooring. Just as you might buy extra concrete when pouring a new driveway, buying extra linoleum gives you the ability to correct for small mistakes you might make and also accounts for minor errors you may have made during the process of calculating the amount of linoleum you need. In addition, extra linoleum can be stored almost indefinitely and used to patch minor damage to your floor, line the bottom of cabinets under your sink, and for a variety of other home-improvement projects.

Check to make sure the concrete is level.,
Mix a batch of concrete leveler.,
Install the vapor barrier when the concrete has dried.,
Install Pergo as before.",How to Install Pergo Flooring2," If you're laying Pergo over concrete, remove all carpet, trim, and other things covering the sub-floor to expose the concrete underneath. Before laying Pergo, it's a good idea to smooth out the concrete to make sure that you've got the flattest surface possible for the new installation. Use the level to make sure it's smooth, and take steps to smooth it out if necessary with new concrete.

, Uneven floors need to be smoothed out with concrete leveler. This usually comes in a 40-50lb bag, which can be mixed with water to prepare. In a bucket, mix a small batch of concrete with water as directed. Don't mix more than you'll use in the next hour, or it'll dry out and become useless and hard.


Start at the lowest points in the room and pour a small reservoir, so you can mix water in and wet the concrete back up if necessary. Use a putty knife or a trowel to smooth out the concrete as thinly as possible, feathering out the edges of your work as you go.

, Wait at least 48 hours before installing a vapor barrier over the fresh concrete leveling job, then put down a vapor barrier as described previously. These polyurethane sheets are usually available from Pergo dealers as part of the package. Cover the entire floor with the sheets, which should be cut to completely cover the floor. Make it big enough on the sides so any vapor coming up will end up behind the baseboard. Tape the seams together before continuing with installation.

, Once you've smoothed out the concrete and added the vapor barrier, installing Pergo over concrete should be exactly the same as installing over wood. Pick a corner, start clicking them together leaving the appropriate amount of space between rows, and trim them to fit on the ends.

Install the edging.,
Add the metal panels.,
Add the flashing.,
Finish your roof.",How to Install Metal Roofing2," The edging, or eave flashing, is metal strips that are used to cover the perimeter of the roof. Use your 1¼ inch nails to secure the flashing to the roof. It should overlap the edge of the gutter (if you have them).








, Always begin working at the longest peak to eave point of the roof. Take your first sheet of metal and place it on the roof so that it overhangs the edge at least ¾ of an inch. This panel must be aligned perpendicular (square) to the edge.









Use your neoprene washer head screws to secure the metal to the sheathing. Space the screws about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart down the entire piece of metal.
Make sure that the screws are all aligned evenly, as you will be able to see them from the ground if they are exposed-fastener metal plates.For exposed fasteners, avoid over tightening the fastener. Each fastener has a durable rubber grommet that seals the roof from the weather. Tighten the fastener just enough to seal the site. If you over tighten and the grommet is displaced, remove and replace.
Continue installing the metal panels, making sure that the edges overlap at lease one inch, or as required, with the adjacent panel. Do this until the entire roof is covered. If you feel the need for sealants, lay a bead of 100% silicone or adhesive silicone before laying the sheet down and make sure the bead is towards the edge of the bottom sheet. This will allow the silicone to squeeze out towards the edges, making it a more tight seal.

, This is the metal trim similar to the eave flashing, except that it is placed over joints in the roof where different sections meet. This should be used in valleys (points where two sections less than 140 degrees meet) and as end caps over the tops of two sides that meet. Be sure to cut this metal at the correct angle before installing it.









The flashing can be bent into a ‘V’ shape to fit over the top of a section (ridge) of a roof, if necessary.
Depending on how wide the flashing you’re using is, you will either have to use one or two rows of screws.

, Make sure that you’ve completely covered the entire roof with the metal, that all edges are smooth and finished, and that there are no loose pieces. Clean up all remaining metal, nails, and screws and enjoy your new roof!.

Consider solid hardwood.,
Consider engineered wood.",How to Install Hard Wood Flooring1," Solid hardwoods have been the traditionally used material in flooring for some time now. They will give a room an elegant, old-world look and for good reason: solid hardwood floors last a long time. They can be sanded and refinished many times, giving them a much longer lifespan than other types of wood flooring. However, considerations must be made as hardwoods are very susceptible to changes in moisture level. Solid hardwood floors can only be placed in specific areas, because of their reactions to moisture. They cannot be used in bathrooms or in basements. Prepare accordingly.
Floors like these will also need installation considerations. Solid hardwoods will need to be nailed into place, which means that a wood subfloor is required. If you do not or cannot provide this, you will need to consider other options.;
, If solid hardwoods are not an option but you would like to have a similar look, consider engineered wood. This wood is similar to what is used to construct many types of modern furniture, and can be used anywhere in your home as it is not affected by moisture as much. It will provide a sleeker, more modern feel and appearance to a room.It is also possible to glue boards such as this. However, the surface they are applied to must be absolutely flat and perfectly clean, so it is not necessarily recommended.

Work your way down the board, repeating this motion every 3-6 inches.
Use a pry bar to completely remove the baseboard if it still doesn't come off., Remove the doors so that you have more room to work and don’t have to worry about them swinging at you.

In some cases, you may have to trim the bottom of the doors or buy new doors if your new flooring is so high that the door catches. Remember this when you reinstall the doors.

, Using a jamb saw, which is available at most tool libraries or rental centers, trim away the bottom of the door jamb. The door jamb is the frame of the door, or its casing. Set your jamb saw to the height of the flooring and cut away so that you can slide your new flooring snugly underneath.

You can also use a regular saw if you cannot get a jamb saw. Place a piece of laminate up against the doorjamb to see the proper height. Using a saw, cut into the door jamb using the laminate to guide you.

The major issue with installing laminate flooring on stairs is durability - stairs tend to get more wear-and-tear than most other surfaces in your home. For this reason, it is advisable to ask the supplier or manufacturer for the most hard-wearing laminate they have.


In addition, laminate flooring can be high-gloss and very slippery - which may be a concern if you have young children in the house. To minimize the risk of slipperiness, go for laminate flooring with a textured, matte finish.
You should also specify that you want matching nose stripping when choosing your laminate, as many manufacturers do not have matching nose stripping for all of their flooring.In terms of quantity, you should order about 10% more flooring than you actually need in order to cover the square footage of stairs. This is necessary as you may need to cut a number of boards to fill in extra spaces. It will also allow you a comfortable margin for potential errors.;
, Laminate flooring needs time to adjust to the temperature and humidity of the house before it is installed. This prevents the boards from warping, expanding or contracting later. To acclimate your flooring, remove the boards from their packaging and stack them in an open space, where air can circulate, for 48 hours., The next thing you will need to do is prepare your staircase for laying down the laminate. If you need to remove carpet from the stairs, you can pull it up using a pair of pliers. Carpet is normally attached using adhesive tack strip, staples or both. The tack strip can be removed using a pry bar, while the staples can either be hammered back in place, or removed using a scraper.Make sure to wear gloves while you are removing carpet, the staples can be very sharp and may cause injuries.
Even if the stairs were not covered in carpeting, you can prepare them by removing any old paint or adhesive and repairing any loose or creaking steps by nailing them securely in place.You will also need to make sure each of the steps is level, so the laminate boards will sit properly. If they are uneven, you can use a belt sander to level them out, or simply use a scraper to get rid of any debris or high spots., Many stairs will have a pre-existing overhang: this is when the underside of the nosing on the upper steps is visible from the bottom of the staircase. You will need to address this before you can lay the laminate flooring. You can do this in one of two ways:


You can either cut off the overhang using a reciprocating or jigsaw, then use a chisel to ensure the surface is flush with the riser.Alternatively, you can use a piece of plywood to pad the riser, filling out the space underneath the overhang. Just be sure to nail the plywood in place before installing the laminate.

, The next thing you will need to do is cut the laminate tread pieces, riser pieces and stair nosing to length. For the tread pieces, lay the the plank across the step, making sure that it fits snugly from left to right. You may need to trim the edges slightly so they are aligned with the step. Most thread pieces will not be wide enough to cover the entire step. If this is the case, you will need to cut a second plank to fill in the rest of the space:


To do this, you can either cut two planks into even pieces, so that their combined width covers the thread, or you can use a full plank and cut a smaller strip to fill in the extra space. When cutting thread pieces, make sure to cut on the groove side of the plank, and glue them together tongue-to-groove. The tread piece should not extend all the way to the edge of the step, as you will need to leave room for the top nosing.
Next you will need to cut the riser pieces to length. You need to make sure that they will sit snugly on top of the tread piece, and are level with the top of the riser. If the edges of the plank are not perfectly aligned with the edges of the riser, you can trim them to fit.
To cut the nose stripping, you should measure the length of the exposed thread, as well as the length of the riser and cut laminate pieces to fit, trimming the edges to fit the angle of the stairs, if necessary.
A good tip is to mark each piece with a number as soon as you cut it to size, this way you will know which piece corresponds with each stair., The easiest way to install your laminate flooring is to start at the top of the stairs and work your way down. By doing this, you avoid standing on the freshly installed flooring (and you won’t trap yourself upstairs when the job is done!)

, The thread piece is the part of the stair that you actually step on to. To install the tread pieces, apply three beads of good quality wood glue to the subfloor, making sure not to put any on the space at the edge which will be covered by the nosing later. Take the glued-together tread pieces which you assembled earlier and place them firmly onto the tread, with the tongue edge of the plank facing outwards.If any glue squeezes onto the laminate planks, wipe it off quickly with a damp cloth.

, The next step is to cover the risers, which are the vertical parts of the stairs. Apply three beads of wood glue to the back of the riser plank (which you cut to fit earlier), and press it into place, holding firmly for a minute or two while the glue sets. It should sit snugly between the tread piece underneath and the tread edging above.


If you want to secure the riser piece further, you can use a nail gun to nail the very top of the plank in place, as the nails will be concealed by the thread edge.

, Once the thread and riser pieces are in place, you will need to apply the stair nosing (this is the piece that sits on top of the riser and overhangs the edge of the step slightly). To install the nosing, apply a bead of construction glue to the subfloor (rather that the nosing itself) and press it firmly into place, with the tapered end overlapping the thread piece.


You will also need to screw the top nosing into place, in order to properly secure it. To do this, cover the nosing with a strip of clear plastic tape, to protect the laminate. Mark out where each of the screws should be placed with a pencil - they should be spaced about 9 inches (22.9 cm) apart, and should be centered in the middle of the nosing.
Drill a countersink hole for each of the screws, using a combination bit. Insert the wood screws, leaving the plastic tape in place until after you've covered the screws with putty.

, It is up to you whether you wish to put all of the riser pieces and tread pieces in place first, before installing the nosing, or if you want to complete each step fully before moving on to the next one. Whichever method you use, make sure you take your time and install your laminate flooring carefully. You want this flooring to last many years, so it is worth doing the job properly.

, Once all of the laminate flooring is in place, you will need to fill in the exposed screw holes in the stair nosing with putty. Prepare the putty according to the instructions, making sure to mix it well. Use a plastic putty knife to smoothly and carefully fill in the screw holes. Once you've filled in every hole on the nosing strip, remove the plastic tape covering the nosing.


Continue to work your way down the stairs filling in the holes and removing the tape on each piece of nosing.
After 20-30 minutes, use a damp cloth to even out the putty covering each screw, before it is fully dry. You may use water or acetone for this.

, It is very important to clean the stairs immediately to remove any fallen bits of putty, as putty can be almost impossible to remove once it sets. You should also sweep away any sawdust and peel off any remaining tape from the stair nosing. Once the stairs are clean, you can take a step back and admire your handiwork!

, You should avoid using the stairs (as far as possible) for 12-24 hours after you finish the flooring. This will give the glue adequate time to set and allow the new flooring to settle."

Prepare your subfloor.,
Let your wood acclimate.,
Gather tools.",How to Install Hard Wood Flooring2," You will need your subfloor to be ready for laying down hardwood floors. This tutorial focuses on installing solid hardwoods, so you will want a wood subfloor if you want to follow the directions exactly. Other options are available, however.


Don’t forget to consider things like door jambs as well. You will need to be able to either get your floors underneath the molding or you will need to cut your floor to go around it.

, Before you install solid hardwood floors, you will need to let the wood acclimate to the moisture level of your home first. Leave the wood to sit in the room in which it will be installed for at least three days. Try to install the floor during either the Spring or Fall, when the temperature is neither very hot nor very cold. Temperature will also affect the wood.

, A larger number of tools and supplies will be necessary to complete this project. You can rent larger pieces, like flooring nailers, from your local hardware store. Other pieces, like nails, will need to be purchased. You can find the materials list for this project at the bottom of this page.

Lay down the first board, tongued-edge facing out into the room.,
Nail the boards to the subfloor.,
Lock your boards together.,
Continue until you have completed three rows.,
Remember to cut boards to size.,
Begin laying rows with the flooring nailer.,
Use a hammer for the last few rows.,
Cut the final board to size.,
Place the final boards using the crowbar.",How to Install Hard Wood Flooring3," The board should leave a small gap at the wall for expansion (check manufacturer’s recommendation) and be placed in line with the room (so consider measuring guidelines). Place spacers in the gap.


Guidelines can be placed by finding the center point of each wall and marking a line between them, creating a cross at the center of the room. Where one of these lines meets with the wall, mark the manufacturer’s recommended expansion distance and then draw a line at that point which is perpendicular to the center line.

, Use the drill to make guide holes and then, using a hammer, nail the board into the subfloor with nails placed 1-3” from the end of the plank, ½” from the groove side, and every six inches down the board. Use a nail set to finish.

, When the first row is done, place the next board so that the tongue of the first fits into the groove. You will want to place the boards so that they are offset, beginning six inches or so from the ending of the previous board. Use a mallet and tapping block to tap the boards together and create a tight seam.

, You will nail the first three rows just as described in Step 2.

, Since you are staggering boards, you will likely need to cut boards in order to fit in the gaps at the end. Measure the distance that it needs to be, keeping the expansion gap in mind, and then (with the board face-down) cut it using a saw.

, Once you have enough space, you should begin using the flooring nailer (though you could technically do the entire floor with the hammer and nails). Simply align it with the board to be nailed and then hit it.

, You will eventually run out of room to use the flooring nailer. Hammer the last few rows the same way you did the first ones.

, If it does not fit properly, you will need to cut the final board so that it is narrow enough to fit. Measure carefully and use a circular or miter saw to cut the boards to size.

, Since you will not have enough space to tap them with the mallet, use a crowbar instead to wedge them into place. You are now ready to finish your floor.

Add baseboards.,
Add trim and transitions.,
Use putty to cover holes.",How to Install Hard Wood Flooring4," Once the floor is in place, you can add some type of baseboard trim, usually a type of molding, where the floor meets the wall. What type of baseboard you choose is up to you and will depend on your needs as well as the design of the room.

, Add trim and transitions anywhere where your floor does not meet up with your wall, such as doorways or a section of the room with different floor covering. Trim and transitions should be cut to size and installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This is usually a very simple process.

, If you wish to, you can cover the holes created by the nails with nail putty. This may be a good idea, as such holes can collect dirt and other undesirable material. Be sure to get putty in the color of the wood you are using for the floors, as this will help in blend in.

Reinstall the baseboards when you’ve finished.",How to Install Flooring2," Laminate flooring consists of pre-cut wooden boards that snap into place with each other. You don't need nails or screws because each piece comes with an interlocking tongue and groove. You place one row of flooring down, then snap the next row into the first one until the room is covered.

You always place laminate parallel to the longest side of the room.
You need to figure out exactly how wide your final row of laminate will be, as it is rare that the rows will all fit perfectly right out of the box.

, In order to buy the right amount of flooring, you need to know the square footage of the room. To calculate the square footage of a rectangular room, simply measure the width and length of the room in feet and multiply the two numbers.

If you have an oddly shaped room, imagine it is made up of many smaller rectangular rooms. Measure each of these ""rooms"" separately and add together your answers to get total square footage. For example, an ""L"" shaped room would measure the vertical section and the horizontal sections, then add the answers together.

, Some pieces will break, you'll have to saw some extra wooden laminate, and you may need to make repairs in the future. If your room is 200 square feet, buy 220 square feet of flooring to be safe Bring your measurements into your hardware store or flooring dealer for help deciding how much flooring you need to buy.

, It is easiest to install laminate flooring parallel to the longest wall in a room, and it usually looks best. Measure the width of the room from this wall to the other side and write this number down. Subtract 1 inch from the final result to account for the space between the floor and wall.For example, your room might be 22 feet (6.7 m) wide, or 268 inches wide. You need 267 inches of flooring to cover this width.

, Take your longest width and divide it by the width of your planks or tiles. For example, if the width is 267 inches wide and the planks are 6 inches wide, you would get 44.5 planks. This number means that you need 44 and half of your six-inch planks to cover the entire width of a 268-inch floor., This is often the hardest part about setting up your new floor. In the previous example, you needed 44.5 planks to cover your flooring. This means that there will be half a plank missing if you only laid down 44 pieces of tile/laminate, so you need to cut one row in half to make everything fit.To find the width of your last piece, multiply the decimal from your calculation by your plank width. For example, pretend you are using 8-inch wooden planks and you need 20.65 of them to cover the width of the floor. This means you need 20 normal rows, plus one row cut to 5.2 inches (.65 x 8 = 5.2).

, You can use a table saw to do it yourself, but most hardware stores will cut wood or tiles for free if you ask. If you are cutting a new plank greater than 3.5 inches, consider splitting the difference and cutting matching first and last planks. Simply divide the number by two and cut two new sets of planks. For example, if you need your last plank to be 5.2 inches wide, you could instead have a first plank that is 2.6 inches and a last plank that has 2.6 inches, matching them perfectly.Make sure that all of your planks are at least 2"" wide or bigger.
Though less professional, you can also install the all the floorboards and then measure the remaining space at the end. This, however, can lead to an unattractive “squeezed” look if your last row is much skinnier than the rest.

, You don't want the joints (where the end of one piece meets another) to be lined up across your floor, you want them to be varied. To do this, you need to start and finish with different lengths of laminate for every row, so the number of pieces needed will change each time., Wood changes shape depending on environmental conditions. To prevent warping once the wood is installed, stack your new laminate and leave it in the room you are installing in for 2 days to acclimate., And underlayment protects your floor from damage and moisture, and is essential for laminate flooring. However, check your chosen laminate before buying an underlayment -- many of them come with pre-attached underlayment. Ask a specialist at your home-improvement store if you have any questions, but be sure to have an underlayment before continuing.

A vapor barrier is one of the most important underlayments. It prevents moisture from getting under your floors and ruining them. They are essential if your subfloor is cement. Always install a vapor barrier if it does not come pre-attached.

, These will form a space between the wall and your laminate. This way changes in humidity that cause the wood to bulge won’t damage the flooring or walls. Place wooden spacers along the wall every 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) to separate your laminate from the walls.

Your baseboards will cover up this space after they are reinstalled., A dry fit is basically a practice run for your installation. Without locking each piece of flooring into place, lay the flooring out so that each piece is parallel to one another and you know that it fits. Make notes of any spots that are exposed or the pieces are too big. on the ends of your first three rows., Place the flooring snugly against the spacers on the wall with the tongue side facing the wall. Lay your first piece in the corner of the room so that the bottom presses against one side and the length presses against another. Then add the next plank on top and snap it into place.

You want to lay your first row parallel to the longest side of the room.
Start on the side of the room with a door to make installation easiest.
Chose the shortest side of the room with a door if there are multiple., It is rare that your flooring will fit your room perfect. Lay the plank sunny-side down (the side you will see) and use a band saw to cut it into the appropriate length. Remember that your need to keep ½ inch space between the plank and the wall.The cut side of the board always goes against the wall.

, This ensures that the joints of the wood do not match up. For a better look and a sturdier floor, the horizontal joints of your laminate should be at least 6-12 inches apart.If you have no remainder, or the remaining piece is too small, cut a piece of the laminate so that it is 2/3 the length of the piece next to it, then start with that. This will prevent the joints from lining up too much.

, Snap the laminate together., Lay down the laminate, snap it into place, measure and cut the end piece, and repeat. If you did all of your measuring correctly in the beginning, this should fly by.

Slide any laminate underneath doorjambs.
Vary the joint length by 6-12 inches.
Remember to keep 1/2-inch spacers between the wall and flooring., This is the final step for your new flooring. Simple re-adhere your old baseboards, or buy and install new ones."

Apply the grout along the joints in the tile with a rubber grout float.,
Allow the grout to dry before wiping it with a wet sponge.,
Wait 72 hours before walking on your new tile floor.",How to Install Flooring3," Square footage is as simple as multiplying the length of the room by the width. Bring this number to your tile dealer to determine how many tiles you need.

Always buy 10% more tiles than you need in case some break or you need to make repairs., This ensures that you have nice, full-length tiles in the center of the room and cut tiles along the fringes. In order to make this possible, however, you have to make several careful measurements to determine where the middle of the room is, how many tiles you need on each side, and the length of your end tiles., Find the midpoint of each wall by measuring the length and dividing by two. Mark this midpoint on each wall., Where these lines cross should be the starting point of your tile. It is the center of the room. Put a tile on these lines so that two edges of the tile are lined up with the chalk.

Use a yardstick or level to make sure the line is straight.

, Do not use mortar. This is your test run to determine how many tiles you are going to need. Start with your center tile and place the tiles against each other towards perpendicular walls. You should have two ""half rows"" when you are done.

There will likely be space between your last tile and the wall. Don't worry, as you will be able to deal with this later.
Be sure to place spacers in between the tiles so that you have the correct distance.

, Unless you are very lucky, you will likely have a space between the wall and your last tile where you cannot fit another tile. Record this number as ""end tile width.""

Repeat this process for both rows of practice tiles.
Since you started in the center, the opposite side will have the opposite width. If, for example, you have 1/3 if a tile to go on one side, the other side will have 2/3 of a tile remaining., It is difficult to cut very small tiles without breaking them, and incredibly thin tiles often look bad.However, you can move your center point to prevent this from happening. For example, you might be using 12"" tiles, and your end tile width is only 2"". If you move your center tile 4"" away from this wall then you suddenly have an end tile width of 6"" on both sides, making it easier to cut., Once you’ve made your measurements, count the number of tiles in your rows – you will need the same number on the opposite wall. Take your marked tiles and cut them along the line you marked when making measurements. This is how you will need to cut every tile along the ends to make sure they all fit.

If the last tile is only going to be 1-2 inches thick, move your center line back 2 inches and re-measure it so that you have a nice wide tile at the end., Starting at your mid-point, lay out your tiles towards each wall of the room. Verify your measurement by laying out a row of tiles and adjust the guidelines as needed. Do not skip this test run, as it is crucial to laying down even tiles.

When installing ceramic tiles, insert the plastic spacers to allow room for grout.

, Following the directions on the bag, mix your mortar and water in a 5-gallon bucket. You will likely need an electric drill with a mixing paddle to properly mix everything, as the mortar is thick. Start with a small bucket of mortar – if you wait too long to apply it in can become hard and useless.

Wipe the paddle off as soon as you finish mixing to prevent it from drying onto the drill.Let the mortar stand undisturbed for 5-10 minutes.

, Tiles often have subtle color changes and variations depending on when they were manufactured. Don't start with one box and then move on to the next one. Instead, take several tiles out of each box and mix them up before beginning.

If your tiles have direction arrows on the bottom make sure that they all face the same way during installation., Scoop out a generous amount of mortar and spread it on the floor in front of you using the flat side. Then take the notched end of the trowel and scrape it across the mortar. Notice the grooves in the mortar lines – these will help distribute the mortar and hold the tile in place.

Only apply enough mortar for 2-3 tiles to begin tiling.
Make sure you start tiling in a corner of the room that allows you to exit the room without stepping on any tiles.

, Make sure that the tile is squared up with the wall and your chalk lines, then firmly push it down and into the mortar.

It is often easiest to start in the center of the room, near your chalk lines, but you can only do this is if you measured out the distance to the wall first and calculated the width of the end tiles ahead of time.

, A straightedge is a heavy, long ruler that helps ensure your tiles are level with each other. Place it along the edge of your first tile, and then lay down the rest. Use plastic spacers to ensure the tiles are the right distance apart., Place enough mortar for a few tiles, press them, and repeat., Bumps of mortar will make it harder to lay tiles later on, so take the time to clean up and excess liquid before it hardens., Once you’ve finished putting on the tiles, leave the floor and return the next day to finish the job. Check the mortar to see how long it needs to set, but you wait roughly 24 hours before continuing., Similar to the mortar, mix the grout following the manufacturer’s instructions., This tool, available for rent at most tool shops, allows you to evenly spread the grout into all the cracks. When done, use it to remove as much excess grout from the tiles as possible so that most of the grout is in between the cracks of the tiles, not on top of them., After 20 minutes or so, use a wet sponge to clean of your tiles, leaving the grout in between the joints., The grout needs time to harden and set, so avoid foot traffic or you could slide your tiles around. After several weeks, you may want to apply a grout sealer to prevent water damage."

Prepare your floor for tile by installing tile backer board on the floor, securing it to the existing sub-floor with thin-set mortar and cement board screws or nails.,
Make a scale drawing of the bathroom floor, including toilet, tub and vanity locations, and bring it to the tile store or home center so you can buy the proper size mat or combination of mats.,
Check the wiring with a continuity tester, after purchasing the mat, to make sure it wasn’t damaged during manufacturing or shipping.

,
Install an electrical outlet box 5 feet (1.5 m).,
Note: following your preliminary layout, you should mark the path of the thick “power lead” between the mat and wall cavity and chisel a shallow trench into the floor.,
Draw the layout lines for the tile on the floor.,
Install the mat, securing it lightly to the cement board with double-face tape.,
Check the mat wiring again with the continuity tester.

,
Install conduit connectors to both ends of two pieces of 1/2-in.,
Spread the mortar over a 5- to 10-sq.-ft. area of floor.,
Lay the tile, then tap it firmly into place.,
Connect the power lead and thermostat wire to the thermostat, following manufacturer's instructions.",How to Install Electric Radiant Heat Mat Under a Tile Floor,";
, Points to keep in mind when sizing the mat are: 1) Install the mat up to the area where the vanity cabinet or pedestal sink will sit, but not under it; that can cause excessive heat buildup; 2) Keep the mat 4 in. away from walls, showers and tubs; 3) Keep the mat at least 4 in. away from the toilet wax ring; 4) Keep the heating cable at least 2 in. away from itself. Never overlap the cable; 5) Don’t leave large gaps between the mats. Your feet will be able to tell!; 6) If your mat is undersized, give priority to the areas where you’ll be standing barefoot most often.

,, up in the wall near where the wiring leads from the mat will terminate. Run new wiring to the box from the circuit breaker panel or - if the mat is small - from a nearby outlet (consult manufacturer's instructions for more information about wiring requirements).

, Notch the bottom plate to accommodate the two conduits that will contain the power lead and the wires for the thermostat-sensing bulb.

, Select tile that’s at least 6 in. square so each tile will span two or more sections of cable. Smaller tiles are more likely to conform to the minor hills and valleys of the cable when you tamp them in place, creating a wavy surface.

, Use hot-melt glue to additionally secure the mat. Don’t leave any humps or loose edges; you’ll snag them with your notched trowel when you’re applying the thin-set mortar. ,, electrical metal tubing (EMT) that are long enough to run from the floor to the electrical box for the thermostat. Fish the power lead cable through one length of conduit. Hot-melt glue the power lead into the groove. Fish the thermostat wires through a second piece of conduit, then weave it 12 in. into the mat, keeping it equidistant from the cable on each side. Nail metal protective plates over the notches in the bottom plate to protect the wires and cable where they pass through.

, Use the flat side of the trowel to press the mortar firmly through the mat and into contact with the cement board. You can establish a flat, uniform layer by lightly floating the trowel across the tops of the cable, then use the notched side to comb the mortar to create ridges; a 3/8 x 1/4-in. trowel works well for most tiles. Again, lightly skim your trowel over the cable. The sheathing on the cable is tough, but you still need to avoid any “sawing” type action or jabs with the trowel. It takes a little trial and error to get a flat layer.

, Do two resistance tests while installing the tile to ensure you haven’t damaged the cable. (If the resistance test fails, see the manufacturer’s instructions to find the problem.) Once the mortar has dried, grout the joints.

, Use a programmable thermostat so the mat will only come on when it's needed. It costs more initially but will save energy and money in the long run.

, Remove any carpeting or rugs in the room, and detach the baseboard around the floor if present. If you have old flooring in place, remove it to expose the wooden or concrete subfloor underneath. Be aware that vinyl or asphalt flooring may contain asbestos, and if it crumbles at the touch, you should remove it with protective equipment and procedures to protect your health and safety.


See also How to Remove Linoleum and How to Remove Floor Tile.
If you are careful while removing the baseboard, it may be possible to install it again after the new floor is in.

, If the result is above 12% in a wooden subfloor or 75% in a concrete subfloor, the subfloor is not suitable for bamboo flooring.Consider installing a more moisture-tolerant floor material instead. Moisture tolerances for flooring material should be listed by the manufacture.


New concrete subfloors should be left to dry and cure for 60 days after they were poured. You may not get

, If the subfloor and surrounding areas are not dry year round, the moisture could eventually cause decay in the bamboo or in the adhesive attaching it. If there is a large amount of mold present, or if you suspect the ductwork is faulty, consider hiring a professional.If there are crawlspaces beneath your house with exposed earth, you could reduce moisture by covering the earth with a vapor barrier such as 6 mil (0.15mm) polyethylene sheets., Vacuum or sweep your subfloor so it is clear of dust. If you are installing your bamboo floor with an adhesive, cleaning stains and spills off the subfloor is recommended so the adhesive sticks properly. Sand down paint or other coatings in this scenario as well, then vacuum up the dust it creates.

, Use a long level, or a level attached to a long string, to measure the floor in several directions and places. If any reading reveals a height difference greater than 3/16"" over 10 ft. (approximately 5mm over 3m), you may have to alter the subfloor to make sure the bamboo flooring doesn't squeak or bend.Wooden subfloors can have high spots sanded down, but low spots should be cut out and replaced.Concrete subfloors can be leveled using a rented concrete sander to sand down high spots, and using a concrete repair mix to build up low spots., Use a tape measure to measure the dimensions of the floor and calculate the square footage (or square meterage) you will need. This measurement will be used to determine the amount of bamboo flooring you need to purchase.

, Once the room is free of dust created by the cleaning and preparation process, close the doors and windows so the room can reach a consistent temperature.Once the room temperature is stable after a day or two, it is time to purchase the bamboo.


The ideal temperature for bamboo flooring is between 60 and 70ºF (16–21ºC), while the ideal humidity is between 40 and 60%. These measurements don't have to be perfect, but if the typical conditions in your room vary greatly from these numbers, bamboo flooring is not recommended.

, If the flooring is sold by number of planks, you'll have to calculate how many you need by dividing the total room area by the area of one plank. It's a good idea to purchase 5% more flooring by area than you think you need, since you may need to cut some of the planks to fit your space.


Be aware of additional difficulties with concrete subfloors (see Nailing Down the Floor). The bamboo flooring salesman should be able to advise you on solutions that match your specific situation.

, Bring the planks inside and remove the wrapping. Wait for at least one day, and up to three, for the bamboo planks to adjust to the room's temperature. They may expand or shrink slightly as they do so, and the floor will fit better if you let the planks do this before you install them, rather than after.


Avoid storing the planks directly on concrete or against outside walls, as this may affect their moisture content or temperature. Consider bringing a table inside and placing the planks on top of it.

, You cannot nail a floor onto concrete, so if you have a concrete subfloor, you may need to install a wooden underlay first. A more stable solution, though more expensive, may be to purchase floating floor materials. This includes a layer of foam or other material as an underlay, then click-together floorboards that do not require nails.

, If there is a room below the floor you are installing, remove chandeliers, ceiling fans, and other fixtures while you are installing. The pressure of the pneumatic nail gun could shake them loose through the floor joists.

, Leave a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) space between the bamboo floorboards and the wall to allow for any slight expansion of the floorboards. Place them across the floor joists, and start against an outside wall if possible to establish your line.Fit each plank together using the tongues and grooves.


Using spacers is recommended. These are simply thin or wedge-shaped objects placed between the floor and the wall to keep them separate.

, Use a table saw or circular saw to cut the last floorboard to the correct length. Save the excess board to begin the next row.

, Drilling the holes before nailing reduces the chance of bending or breaking the board. Drill at a 45–50º angle from the side of the board, so the next row of planks will hide the nails. Make sure the holes you drill are smaller than the nails you are using.


Each board should be drilled (and nailed) approximately every 10 inches (25 cm), and about 4 inches (10cm) from each end. Do not drill closer than 4 inches (10cm) from the end to avoid splitting the board.If your subfloor has raised floor joists, make sure your hole is over one of these so the board can be securely nailed.

, Test on a piece of scrap or defective bamboo floorboard first to see if the gun and nails are appropriate for your wood. If it ""dimples"" with a raised or cracked mark, test again with a different air pressure.


Warning: put on safety goggles before using a nail gun.

, Nail the boards in place through the guide holes you drilled. A professional quality nail gun will minimize the chance of breaking your floorboards. The use of 18 gauge nails is recommended for securing bamboo floorboards., The second row should be nailed in the same method as the first, drilling then nailing from the side to fasten it to the floor joists.


Use a rubber mallet to tap the row into place before nailing.

, Offset the floorboards by two to three times the width of the floorboards as you lay them for a uniform look. Work from several cartons of bamboo flooring at once, if you have more than one, so that color variations are evenly spread across the room, instead of clumped together., Once the first two rows are laid down securely, you can fasten the other floorboards using only the tongues of the board. Drill a hole directly above the tongue of the board, at a 45º angle into the wood. Keep a careful eye on the nail penetration and adjust air pressure if necessary so the nail head only penetrated just deeply enough for the groove of the next board to fit over it.Tap boards together with a rubber mallet before nailing, as before.

, Use a table saw or circular saw to cut the floorboards to the correct shape to fit the room. If there is a gap you need to fill that is less than half the width of a floorboard, pick up two or more floorboards and saw them to half their width or more so that, in total, they fit the space more closely. Sawing a single floorboard to less than half its width is likely to cause breaks when nailing.

, Secure the last two rows with additional nails to ensure the floor is well fastened. Once these are in place, you may use the floor immediately.


Remember to leave a 1/2 inch (1.25cm) gap between each wall to allow for expansion. This can be hidden by replacing the baseboard molding, and by applying additional shoe molding if necessary

Purchase some wood that will give you the right look for your space.,
Store the wood in the space you will be installing at least 2 weeks prior to actually starting the install.,
Remove the old floor down to the sub-floor.,
Start by snapping a chalk line across your sub floor.,
Begin with the longest, most straight wall; using the longest, most straight floor boards you have.,
(Option 1) Face nail (using finish nails) then angle nail the first few rows of boards you install.,
Racking the boards gives the chance to eliminate imperfect pieces and helps stagger board ends.,
When there is enough space to begin using the floor nail gun, space nails 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) apart (2-5 nails per board).,
Check your work as you continue, use a square if you have a good reference point.,
Use a jamb saw to undercut trim pieces.

",How to Install a Prefinished Hardwood Floor," Due to the large amount of different types of hardwood, choose one that fits your budget and appearance. Also be prepared for delivery of a very heavy large stack of wood if you are doing more than one room.;
, This give the wood a chance to expand and contract based on the humidity and temperature of the space. The amount of time that the wood needs to acclimate will vary from region to region; if you live in a dry region and the wood was properly stored at the warehouse, it may only take a couple of days.

, This will prevent having different ""levels"" of flooring across the space where you will be installing. Remove as many nails, tacks, etc. as possible for best results.

, Measure out from the wall the distance of one floor board plus 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) expansion room. You can use a scrap piece of lauan or other thin wood material against the wall to use as a spacer. (see image)

, It is very important that the first few floor boards you lay down are perfectly straight across the room, this prevents your floor from looking crooked or slanted across the room.

, (Option 2) Face nail (using electric brand nail gun or finish nail gun) the first few rows of boards you install. This will keep your very first rows straight where wall prevents the use of the floor nail gun.

, Lay out the boards in a few rows and randomly stagger boards by shade, while staggering the board ends by 4-6"" or more between adjacent rows. Boards with defects and large knots can be used in less conspicuous areas along the wall.

, Try not to nail boards less than 2"" from either end.

, Make sure each board end is at least 4-6"" from the board ends in the previous row. Continue using the floor nail gun until you reach the far wall, then face nail the last remaining rows.

Be sure to check the instructions on your duvet cover's tag. Do not wash your duvet with the cover still on it.;
, Before you decide to wash your duvet, be sure that it doesn’t require dry cleaning. Generally, if your duvet is made of cotton or a cotton blend, it can be machine washed. However, to ensure you don’t accidentally ruin it, read the instructions on your duvet’s label., Before washing your duvet, you will want to Sew Up Holes and tears in it. Mending these holes will prevent the stuffing from your duvet from falling out during the washing and drying cycles.

, Your duvet might not have a tag on it that contains washing instructions, but if it does, you will want to follow the manufacturer’s directions for washing and drying your duvet.The picture of a tub or bucket tells you whether or not the article can be washed. The number in the tub is the maximum water temperature. A hand in the tub means the item must be hand-washed only.A square with a circle inside it represents the dryer. Dots inside this symbol corresponds to the temperature of the dryer. Fewer dots means lower temperatures, and more dots or bigger dots mean higher heat may be used. An “X” through the square means you must line dry the item., If your duvet is especially dirty, you might want to consider pre-soaking it before you begin washing it. Pre-soak your duvet in a large sink, bin, or other large container that is large enough to hold your duvet. Pre-soaking treatments such as borax also help boost the cleaning power of your detergent.Your bathtub is a great option for pre-soaking your duvet. Ensure that your tub is clean and fill it with water and a small amount of borax or other pre-soaking treatment. Let the duvet soak for an hour.

, Odds are that your personal washing machine will not have sufficient space to adequately wash your duvet. You will want to wash it in the largest possible washing machine, so you’ll need to make a trip to your local laundromat.Center agitators can pull threads on your duvet or even tear it, so be sure you choose a large front loading washer for your duvet., Harsh detergents can strip the down filling of its natural oils and fibers. Use a natural detergent or a gentle commercial detergent specifically designed for delicate fabrics.


For a natural option, add a half cup of baking soda along with your detergent of choice at the beginning of the wash cycle and a half cup of white vinegar at the beginning of the first rinse cycle. This combination will freshen and soften your duvet., Regardless of which kind of detergent you choose, be sure that you don't use too much. Excess detergent can be as damaging as using a harsh detergent. Aim for one-quarter cup of commercial detergent or slightly more for home made or natural ingredient detergents., For white duvets, you will want to use a laundry booster like borax or baking soda to ensure that your duvet stays a beautiful bright white color. Avoid harsh soaps or bleach, unless there is a stain that will not come out without bleach.


If you have a stain such as blood or ink that requires bleach, be sure to check your duvet's label to ensure that bleach is appropriate prior to using it on your duvet. Otherwise, your duvet could end up with patchy discoloration.

, Because of the delicate threading on your duvet, it’s important to wash it on a gentle cycle. Washing your duvet on a high agitation setting meant for heavier, more durable fabrics can cause your duvet to come unstitched or even tear.

, Because of the thick matting inside your duvet, the detergent can get trapped in there more easily than thinner sheets and blankets. To avoid leaving laundry soap inside your duvet’s filling, run the rinse cycle twice., Once your duvet is thoroughly cleaned and rinsed, you need to start the drying process. Drying a duvet is a more involved process than drying a quilt or regular blanket. Because the stuffing in duvets is so thick, it can be harder to get all the moisture out. To protect your duvet, dry it on low heat and on the gentle cycle for a longer time rather than on high heat for a shorter time.Periodically throughout the drying process, remove your duvet and hand-fluff it. This prevents the filling from matting and will also tell you how dry the duvet is.

, Despite using large capacity machines and trying to hand-fluff your duvet, sometimes the filling falls to one side or sticks together. Putting two or three clean tennis balls in the dryer will help evenly fluff the filling of your duvet., Once you have gotten your duvet dry in the dryer, hang it outside to finish drying. Even if it feels dry to the touch, odds are that there is still moisture in the interior filling. Hanging your duvet outside allows this final bit of moisture to evaporate and helps prevent a musty smell and mildew from setting into your duvet.If you cannot hang your duvet outdoors to dry, try hanging it indoors across the backs of kitchen chairs so it can air out. An oscillating indoor fan pointed toward the duvet will be helpful, too, along with rotating it every few hours., Once your duvet is completely washed and dried, consider investing in a duvet cover. Duvet covers are far easier to maintain than the actual duvet itself, and these covers minimize the number of times you have to wash your duvet., A few times per year, hang your duvet outside to air out, if possible. Choose a sunny, dry day, and hang your duvet on a clothesline. This helps keep your duvet from developing a musty smell.If you don’t have an outdoor space to freshen your duvet, consider putting it in an XL capacity dryer for 10 minutes along with a freshly scented dryer sheet. Doing this a few times per year will also help ward off musty smells and help keep your duvet smelling fresh.

Each panel is 8 sq. ft in size (24” x 48”), so to calculate how many panels you'll need, divide the total square footage of the room by 8.;
, To prepare the floor surface for installation, sweep and/or vacuum all loose debris off of your basement floor.

, In the selected starting corner, place ½” spacers at each side of the starting corner, then lay the first panel.

, Cut a connector at 22 ½” for the short end (this will allow for the 3/8” connector insert in the long side panel on either side).

, Place the 22 ½” connector in the first laid panel - this can be inserted easily by hand and a light tap with the rubber mallet will ensure a tight connection.

, Place 2 more spacers at the side of the wall and slide the second panel into the connector of the first panel. Continue on with this process until you come to the end of the wall. It may be necessary to cut the last panel of each row to fit the room size.


Remember to include the ½” spacer at the end of each row.

, Place the 4’ connectors on the long side of the panels that have just been installed.

, It's recommended that you stagger the panels in each row to provide added strength. To install the panels in a staggered pattern:


Cut a 2’ x 4’ panel in half
Measure the panel at 24” and place a mark on either side, using the straight edge to mark the center of the panel
Place a piece of 2x4 under the panel at either end, and cut the panel using a circular saw with a plywood blade

, For the second row, start back at the original starting point beside the first panel placed. Place 2 spacers at the wall, then slide the 2’ x 2’ cut panel into the long end side connector of the first panel. Tap with a mallet to secure, then continue to lay the rest of the second row using 2’ x 4’ panels. Once finished, place the 4’ connector into the second row of installed panels.

, Continue to install the panels, working from one side of the room to the other, one row at a time. The connectors will ensure a snug and tight fit.


Remember to fully insert the connectors into the groove of the panel.
For tight areas, or the last panel and row, the use of a pull bar and mallet will be required to connect the panels together.

, Once you have completed your basement subfloor installation, the ½” spacers that were placed around the room to allow proper air movement for drying may need to be left in place depending on the finished flooring options that you are planning on installing. Check the information regarding your finished flooring to see whether or not you can remove the spacers.

Fill a tub with cool water and add detergent.,
Swish the blanket through the water.,
Press out excess water.,
Wash again using plain water.",How to Wash a Blanket1," Find a tub or basin large enough for your blanket to fit in and fill it up with cool water. Mix in mild detergent and let it spread through the water. You’ll essentially be doing the same thing as a washing machine on a gentle setting, only manually, which gives you greater control over how the blanket is treated and helps ensure that every part gets clean.Don’t fill the tub up too much or it may overflow when you put the blanket in.;
, Using soft, kneading strokes, drag the blanket back and forth in the soapy water. It’s best to take hold of one section of the blanket for a few passes, then smooth it out and wash a new section. Do this until the blanket has been cleaned thoroughly.







, Take the blanket out of the tub and let the saturated water run out. Fold the blanket in half two or three times and then use both hands to apply pressure to the blanket, squeezing out excess water. Pressing the blanket is a safer alternative to wringing it out, which can stretch the fabric out of shape.








, Give the blanket another quick wash in some plain cool water. This will rinse away any detergent that might have soaked into the blanket. Swish the blanket through the water, touching each section individually. Make sure there are no traces of soap remaining on the blanket.








Drain and refill the tub with fresh water until it remains clear after rinsing. You may need to do this several times.
Make sure you hand wash delicate fabrics like wool, silk and linens. These fabrics are woven from natural fibers and may be irreparably damaged if treated with harsh washing methods.

Disconnect the power cord before cleaning.,
Check the manufacturer’s recommendations.,
Pre-soak the blanket.,
Wash briefly and gently.,
Rinse and spin briefly.,
Take care when hand washing.",How to Wash an Electric Blanket1," Your electric blanket features a control cord that provides power through a wall plug. Whenever you want to clean the blanket, remove this cord from the blanket. Before removal, turn off the blanket and unplug it. The control cord should never be submerged in water.Before cleaning the blanket, check to make sure that all of the wire heating elements within the blanket are positioned as they should be, and that none of them have worn through the blanket’s fabric.
If the wire heating element has worn through the fabric in any location, or the connection point between the blanket and the control cord is damaged in any way, discontinue use of the blanket.
If you have an older electric blanket with a control cord that is not detachable, do not wash it in a washing machine. Instead, carefully hand wash the blanket, taking care not to submerge the control cord.;
, Your electric blanket will come with a user’s manual that includes specific washing instructions. These instructions may be included on a “product care” label attached to your blanket, a booklet in the blanket’s packaging, or on the packaging itself.Almost always, you’ll be directed to pre-soak the blanket, wash it briefly on a gentle cycle, and rinse. A brief spin cycle will also likely be recommended.

, Most manufacturers recommendations will direct you to soak the blanket for anywhere from five to fifteen minutes. In addition to the specific amount of time, they will also recommend different temperatures of water, ranging from cold to warm.If a specific temperature is not mentioned regarding temperature or duration of pre-soak, go with a cold water soak for fifteen minutes.

, Almost all modern electric blankets can be washed in your washing machine. Most manufacturers do not recommend a full wash cycle, however. In fact, most blankets only need a few minutes’ wash on your machine’s “delicate” or “gentle” cycle.Use only a small amount of a mild washing detergent. Do not use any other cleaning chemicals.
In particular, never bleach your electric blanket.

, Rinsing cycles can be even shorter. Just one minute of rinsing with cool or lukewarm water is the standard recommendation. Meanwhile, most blankets do benefit from a single standard spin cycle., Though it may surprise you, modern electric blankets are intended to be washed in a washing machine. If you have an old blanket that is not damaged in any way, however, you may want to wash it by hand. For instance, if your blanket’s power cord is not removable, it needs to be carefully washed by hand. The key is agitating the heating elements within the blanket as little as possible.To wash by hand, dunk the blanket (not including any electrical cords) into a tub with cold water and mild detergent and swish it around for a minute or two. Let it soak for fifteen minutes, squeeze soapy water out, and rinse in cool water before drying.

Make sure the blanket will fit in the washing machine.,
Perform a quick color test.,
Select a gentle cycle and use cool water.,
Add a mild detergent.,
Load the washing machine evenly.,
Wash the blanket.",How to Wash a Blanket2," Depending on the size of the blanket you’re washing, you may have trouble getting it to fit into a washing machine. Front-loading washers and top-loaders without agitators will produce optimal results, as the drum is spacious and allows plenty of room for the blanket to move. If your blanket is too big to fit in a standard washing machine or is made of an especially delicate material, wash it by hand instead.Take the blanket outsides and give it a good shake to remove any loose dirt or dust before washing.
Laundromat washing machines are typically bigger than commercial washers and might be the best option if you’re washing a blanket that is particularly large or thick.

, If the blanket has never been washed before, it might be a good idea to quickly test to see if the dye used to color the blanket will run in the washer. Soak a colored portion of the blanket in cool water for a few minutes, then dab the blanket with a piece of plain white fabric or paper towel to see if the color bleeds. Wash the blanket by hand if there’s a substantial amount of color on the test cloth.Avoid washing a new or brightly colored blanket with other clothes.

, When machine washing blankets, always use cool water and choose the gentlest wash cycle. Washing machines are rough on clothes: that’s partially how they manage to get things so clean. The downside of this is that all the spinning, beating and agitating can stretch your blanket out of shape and cause it to come out looking worse than before. Similarly, hot water can shrink threads and cause dye to run. Be aware of this and protect your blanket from damage., Pour a small amount of mild detergent into the washer after it fills but before you put in the blanket. This way, the detergent will diffuse evenly throughout the water, creating a gentle washing solution and keeping you from having to pour the detergent directly onto the blanket. Most laundry soaps are astringent and can cause wear and fading to textiles in high concentration, so pick a detergent approved for delicates and go easy on it.A little goes a long way: a quarter cap full of detergent is plenty.

, Place the blanket into the washing machine, making sure that the weight and bulk of it is evenly distributed around the inside of the drum. Otherwise, not all surfaces of the blanket will get cleaned equally, and the motion generated during the wash cycle can throw the washer off balance. If the washer you’re using has a center agitator, coil the blanket loosely around the agitator as you lower it in., Let the blanket go through the process of washing. If the blanket is of a heavy-duty or synthetic material, it’s alright to let it finish a full wash cycle. However, you can also take the blanket out and drain the washing machine after 3-5 minutes; for delicate and natural fabrics like wool or down, there’s no need for the blanket to undergo a complete wash, rinse and spin cycle.The longer the blanket is in the washing machine, the higher the chance it will come out warped, stretched or damaged. The spin cycle in particular may be too forceful for certain fabrics.
Fabrics that are washing machine safe include cottons, which are preshrunk, and synthetic materials like polyester and nylon, which don't stretch out or shrink.

Set the dryer to a low heat setting.,
Load the blanket into the dryer.,
Allow the blanket time to dry.,
Remove and hang the blanket.",How to Wash a Blanket3," When using a clothes dryer to dry your blanket, keep the heat setting between low and medium. Higher heats might shrink the blanket, or cause synthetic materials like polyester to scorch. If you’re drying a down or wool blanket, set the dryer to tumble.Because it uses no heat, tumble drying takes longer and should only be used if you’re worried about damaging a natural fabric.
Once again, cotton and synthetics are resilient fabrics, which make them totally dryer-approved (just watch out for high heat on synthetics, as they're prone to burning after a while).

, Once again, make sure the blanket is distributed evenly in the dryer. Let the blanket lie loosely in the barrel, and try not to bunch it up.


Clear out the dryer’s lint trap before you begin drying. Fluffy items like bedding tend to shed a lot of lint, which can become a fire hazard as it accumulates.

, If your blanket is of heavy construction or has been washed and dried many times, it should be okay to let it go through a full drying cycle at low heat. Dry delicate or loosely-woven blankets in short bursts and keep an eye on the blanket's material as it dries. Set the dryer’s timer for the desired time, or else monitor the blanket throughout the drying process.Tumble drying a delicate blanket might take hours. Reset the dryer at the end of a tumble cycle and repeat until the blanket is no longer damp.
Overdrying can cause shrinkage or damage. Choose the appropriate time for the blanket you’re drying and give it a feel from time to time when machine drying for longer periods.

, Take the blanket out of the dryer while it is still slightly damp. In most cases, it’s preferable to allow blankets to finish air drying—this will help instill a fresh fluffiness in the blanket as the remaining moisture dissipates and spare you the grief of dealing with shrinking, scorching, stretching and static. Smooth the blanket out by hand, then either hang it from a clothesline or drape it over something broad and flat. Let the blanket hang until it’s completely dry.A drying rack or ironing board can be useful for draping a drying blanket if space for a clothesline is unavailable to you.
Turn the blanket over periodically to expose both sides to direct air flow.

"
"
Press out any remaining water.,
Hang the blanket.,
Roll the blanket up between dry towels.,
Lay the blanket out.",How to Wash a Blanket4," If you decide to air dry your blanket after washing it, be sure that you’ve first removed as much moisture from the blanket as you can. This will save you a lot of drying time. Remember to press the blanket, don’t wring or bunch.

, Using a clothesline or ironing board, straighten and suspend the blanket to let it begin drying. Hang drying works best when it’s done outside due to the movement of the air, but if you don’t have a place to dry clothes outside you can also turn on a fan or simply let the blanket hang overnight.


Smooth out all wrinkles and folds before hanging the blanket, or else the blanket will crease and dry unevenly.
Make sure the blanket is completely stretched out when hang drying. Greater surface area means faster, more thorough drying.
Wool, silks, linens and any blankets with loose weave-work, like crochet, should always be hung and allowed to air dry. This is the gentlest way to treat easily damaged fabrics and will help protect them for many more washings and drying.

, Alternately, sandwich the wet blanket between two clean, dry towels and roll or fold them up together. The towels will wick moisture out of the blanket from both sides, helping it dry faster. Place a heavy object like a book on top of the roll to apply pressure to the damp blanket and increase contact between the blanket and towels.One advantage of the towel method is that there should be no need to smooth the blanket once it’s dry since it’s already been rolled taut or neatly folded.
Using an object heavier than a textbook to press water out of a blanket that is drying between towels may misshape the blanket or cause wrinkles once it's fully dry.

, If you’re pressed for space or don’t want to use the towel method, find a clear, flat space to lay the blanket out. Place a couple dry towels underneath the blanket to absorb excess moisture as it dries, and flip the blanket over as needed to allow exposure to air on both sides. This will take considerably longer than any other drying method, but requires minimal effort. You may need to run an iron over the blanket after it has dried completely in order to eliminate wrinkles.This method will also be useful for blankets made from delicate fabrics like wool which easily stretch out and lose their shape when subjected to rigorous washing and drying.
Use a low heat when ironing and only go over trouble spots in the blanket lightly once or twice.

Wash the sheets as usual.,
Assemble the pegs (clothes pins), washing basket, and a 1.5 liter (0.4 US gal) soda bottle half filled with water and sealed.,
Peg (pin) the sheets to one line.,
Toss the water bottle into the middle of the sheet.,
Repeat with any other sheets.

",How to Stop Sheets from Wrapping Around the Clothesline,";
, These are to go to the clothesline as well as the sheets.

, Now, lift the other end up and peg (pin) it onto the next parallel line. The aim is to create a cradle shape out of the sheet and to have all of it pegged to the line.

, It will sit there, anchoring down the sheet. The sheet will stay in position while drying and won't wrap around the clothesline.

Assess the state of the mattress carefully.,
Air the mattress outside.,
Sponge the mattress.,
Use baking soda or bicarbonate of soda.,
Use a strong wood odour to mask the mustiness.",How to Restore a Musty Mattress," Mustiness is one thing, while mould and mildew is quite another. If the mattress is mouldy or mildewed, assess the extent. Sometimes surface mould can be killed by airing in sunshine but if it has permeated the mattress, you'll need to toss it out at an appropriate waste or recycling depot.;
, As long as the sun is shining, this can even be done during winter provided it isn't on wet ground. A good day of sunshine will be a healthy start for improving the mattress odor. Even better if you can take it in and put it out again several days in a row.

, Make up a solution of 5 drops of tea tree oil (ti-tree oil) to one bucket of warm water. Sponge this mixture over the entire mattress. Then place out into the fresh air to dry thoroughly before use.


Tea tree oil has the benefit of anti-bacterial and anti-mould activity.

, Sprinkle liberally over the mattress. This should absorb most, if not all, of the odour. Leave on the mattress for two to four days, then vacuum off. The mattress will hopefully be ready to use now.

, Some woods such as huon pine or cedar can be cut into blocks and Slipped between the base and the mattress to release a better odour. Herbal or spice sachets could also be used to the same end.

Ensure the blanket can tumble freely.,
Check the manufacturer’s recommendations.,
Stretch the blanket after laundering.,
Air dry your blanket.",How to Wash an Electric Blanket2," One important factor is the size of your dryer. Some smaller dryers may not be large enough to wash a large electric blanket. The main criteria is the blanket’s ability to tumble freely. If there is not enough room for your blanket to tumble in your dryer, consider air drying your blanket instead., Your user manual will also include specific instructions on drying your blanket. Some models may even require a brief dryer “pre-heating” period, akin to pre-heating your oven. Otherwise, you’ll likely be directed to dry your blanket somewhere between five and ten minutes.Unless directed otherwise, always set your dryer to “low” when drying your electric blanket.
Remove the blanket from the dryer while it’s still damp.

, Depending on your blanket’s manufacturer, it may need to be stretched back to its normal size after washing and/or drying. Since the blanket will still be slightly damp, it will likely be easy to reshape. In order to do so, have someone else help you.Stand across from one another, with both of your arms reaching along opposite edges of the blanket as far as possible. Then simply gently pull apart from one another.

, To allow the blanket to dry the rest of the way, or if you simply wish to entirely air dry your blanket, drape it over a clothesline or shower rod that will be able to bear its weight. Note that it is extremely important to wait until an electric blanket is fully dry before plugging it back in and/or using it again."

Find the leak.,
Mark the leak.,
Dry the mattress completely.,
Deflate the mattress.

",How to Repair an Aerobed Leak1," From simply listening for the leak to spraying the mattress with soapy water and looking for bubbles to more extreme tests like submerging the mattress in a tub or swimming pool, the many tests for find a leak in your air mattress are detailed in 5 Ways to Locate a Leak in an Air Mattress. However, the most reliable methods seem to be the easiest: using your ears and spraying the mattress with soapy water. Whichever method you choose, always inspect the mattress systematically.


First inspect the valves.
Then, check the seams.
Finally, inspect the flat surfaces of mattress.;
, Use a permanent marker or a piece of masking tape.


For “flocked” (fuzzy) mattresses, use fine grit sandpaper or an emery board to smooth the area before attempting to patch it. Be gentle! And make sure to remove any debris with a damp cloth or vacuum cleaner before proceeding.Alternatively, use acetone—an ingredient found in many nail polish removers—to smooth the flocked area before patching it. Wet a cotton ball with a small amount of acetone and dab the area around the hole. Then, use something rigid like a spoon to scrape away the flocking. Finally, use rubbing alcohol to clean the area thoroughly., Use hair dryer to speed up the process. Or let the mattress air-dry overnight.

Create curtains.,
Reupholster chairs.,
Make a linen button.,
Sew a quilt.,
Cut napkins.,
Create a child's sundress.,
Cut a scarf.,
Make a bandana or headband.,
Look at its general condition.,
Think about its size.,
Launder the linen.",How to Reuse Old Linens," By reusing old linens, you’ll be able to create new and colorful curtains for your home. Repurposed linens may help you create that warm or even a retro feel for a space that previously lacked personality.


Measure the window you want to cover with a new curtain.
Cut your linen to the appropriate size. Make sure to reserve several inches (depending on taste and how much fabric you have available) on each side of the curtain.
Use an extra-large hole puncher, scissors, or something similar to cut a proper number of holes in the top of the curtain. Space your holes 4 to 5 inches apart (10 to 13 cm).
Use grommets or hanging hooks to secure the new curtain to a curtain rod.
Add lace or other embellishments for more character.
Hang your curtain.
For another look, think about stitching old hankies together to create a new, colorful valance.;
, Reupholstering chairs with old linen can make a time-consuming chore fun. In addition, using old linen may help you preserve a vintage look that the fabric of the old chair had. To reupholster chairs, consider:


Matching your old linen to the chair in question. You may want to change the style completely, or you may want to match it based on period. If you’re redoing chairs from the 1960s, consider using fabric from the 1960s.
Carefully unscrew screws, untack tacks, and remove the old fabric.
Cut the new fabric to match the old fabric.
Replace screws, tacks, and anything else that secured the old fabric.
Consider repainting the chairs to improve their appearance.
Consult a professional and ask them to reupholster for you, with your desired fabric, if you want., Linen buttons are cool items for both functional and decorative uses. The great thing about them is that you don’t need very much material or time to put them together. When making your linen buttons:


Take a button or button shell.
Use an old white linen or fabric to add extra padding.
Place the linen you've chosen for the button on top of the extra padding.
Place your button on top of the fabric (with padding underneath).
Trace a circle. Your circle should have the radius of the button available on each side of the button (the radius of the fabric should be 4 times that of the button.
Cut the fabric. Then take the ends of the fabric and fold them inward toward the back of the button.
Sew the fabric together into a button., Perhaps the most popular thing to do with old linens is to make patchwork quilts. Patchwork quilts are made up of many pieces of different fabrics. Patchwork quilts can be created in one sitting or can be added to over time.


Select a wide variety of old linens. Focus on diversity of pattern and color.
Cut squares (or rectangles). The size of your squares (or rectangles) is up to you, but people commonly cut 4 to 8 inch squares (10 cm to 20 cm).
Arrange your squares in a pattern that is pleasing to you.
Sew the squares together.
Don't worry too much about size in the beginning. One of the best things about patchwork quilts is that you can keep adding squares indefinitely., You can make napkins out of just about any piece of old linen. Ultimately, napkins are simple and versatile accessories that will add character to any dining occasion.


Pick pieces of linen that are free from stains, holes, or frayed material.
Cut squares that are 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) larger than your desired napkin. For instance, if you want 18 inch (46 cm) square napkins, cut 19 1/2 inch (49.5) squares of fabric. For reference, common dinner napkins are 16 inch (40.6 cm) or 18 inch (46 cm) squares.
Fold the edges of the napkins 3/4 an inch (1.9 cm) and press/iron them. Unfold the crease when you are finished.
Pin the folds and creases.
Stitch the folds about an 1/8th of an inch (.3175 cm) from its edge.
Cut any extra thread and iron the napkins to reinforce the creases and stitching., A popular way to reuse old linens is to make simple dresses out of them. With little effort you can turn curtains or bedsheets into new sundresses with a colorful and vintage look.


Select a large vintage table cloth, old curtains, or other linens.
Measure the child and sew the linen so it fits them. To do this, model your design off an old sundress you have in the closet or off of one you’ve found at a thrift store. You can also find a dress pattern through an online search.
Cut excess fabric. Don't be afraid to cut more than you need, as you can always decrease the size of the dress later.
Sew the sundress together in the back.
Add vintage embroidered linen to add more character., It is relatively easy to repurpose old linens into new scarves, as seemingly outdated patterns on linens will can make fun and exciting scarves.


Pick patterns that are fun and may suit your personality.
Decide on width and length. Consider modeling the size of your new scarf off an old one you like.
Cut any oversized fabric. Make sure to cut off worn edges, if possible.
If you’ve used smaller pieces of linen, stitch them together. Use thread that matches the general thickness and appearance of the fabric you are stitching together., As simple, square pieces of clothing, bandanas and head bands are relatively easy to make out of old linens. To make bandanas or headbands:


Determine the size you want.
Cut a square (or rectangular) piece of linen from an old sheets or curtains.
Add lace or other embellishments to them to add more character., The condition of the linen will give you an idea of whether it is good material to reuse. It will also give you an idea of what you can reuse it for. When considering a piece of linen, look at:


The material itself. Some material might just be unsuitable for certain projects. For instance, linen drapes that are coated with fire retardant from the 1940s or 1950s may present health hazards.
Whether it is discolored. Depending on the project, discolored fabric may add to the overall look and appeal of a material.
If it has holes in it. If so, you may need to trim substantial amounts of fabric to get something you can work with., After its general condition, you’ll need to evaluate the size of the old linen so you can determine what you can make from it. When considering size, think about:


Curtains and bed sheets lend themselves to new lives as new dresses, new curtains, or a variety of smaller pieces of clothing or household accessories.
Smaller articles like hankies, pillow cases, or small curtains can be repurposed as small articles of clothing or can be sewed together into curtains, quilts, or even pieces of clothing.

, Before repurposing any linen, you need to properly launder and clean it. Not only will this prepare the linen for its new life, but you’ll reveal any stains or any other imperfections that might make you reconsider reusing a specific piece of linen.


Wash older, fragile fabrics in warm water in the sink.
For newer linens, wash the on the gentle cycle in the washing machine.
Use a light, color-safe detergent."

Evaluate the space where you plan to install the floating flooring.,
If your subfloor is concrete, cover it with a wood or engineered wood subfloor first.,
Prepare your space.,
Pick out the floating flooring.,
Roll out the foam underlayment in a single layer across the floor.,
Decide which way the pre-finished hardwood flooring planks will lay.,
Place a 5/16 inch (7.94 mm) spacer against the wall that is the furthest away from the door.,
Snap the two tongue-and-groove pieces of flooring together.,
Cut the last piece in the row so it will fit, leaving a small buffer between it and any walls (for expansion or contraction).,
Place the next row, but stagger the joints so that they overlap.,
Continue staggering each new row until you've covered the room with the square-edge flooring.,
When finished, be sure to remove the spacers from the edges of the walls.,
Cut down casings when your flooring doesn't fit underneath it.,
Scribe around tricky corners or angles.,
Use a pull bar to help join together tongue and grooves of end pieces.",How to Install a Floating Floor," Before you go about laying down your floating floor, you need to know how much ground you need to cover. Although it's perfectly possible to buy only the amount required for the job, it's beneficial to purchase a little more than necessary to account for mistakes and patch-ups, especially if you're installing for the first time.

Using a tape measure, measure the room from one wall to the opposite wall, and write down the distance. Suppose the distance is 10 feet (3.05 m).



 


Next, measure the distance of the opposing walls to each other. Suppose this distance is 12 feet (3.66 m).






Multiply these two measurements to find the total area you will need to cover with pre-finished hardwood flooring. From the example, you would multiply 10' x 12' (3.05m x 3.66m), which would give you a total area of 120 square feet (11.163 square meters).





;
, Laying down your floating flooring directly onto concrete is a no-no. For one, there's less insulation. Also, the possibility of dampness, however small, is greater when there are fewer membranes between your concrete foundation and your floating floor. In choosing a wood subfloor, many professionals like to use OSB (oriented strand board) or plywood. Use the measurements above to estimate how much OSB or plywood you will need.

, Before you really get started, there's just a few more things you need to take care of:

Use a level at various spots on the floor to make sure it's even. Fill in unlevel spots or grooves with patching compound.






Sand down bumps and ridges in the subfloor.






When you're all finished, vacuum the floor to remove any dust or debris.







, Pre-finished hardwood flooring comes in different sizes, thicknesses, lengths, colors and designs. Some common finishes and wood options include oak, cherry, maple and walnut. Which you choose depends largely on personal preference.


Calculate how many boxes of floating flooring and how many rolls of foam underlayment you will need to purchase. You can find this information by reading how much footage each box and roll covers. Divide the total area of the room by the area the box or roll covers.

, Size the foam underlayment and cut it with a utility knife. Tack it into the subfloor and then seal the seams together with duct tape.

, Parallel with the longest wall usually looks best — and is the easiest to install — but an irregular-shaped room might suggest another arrangement, such as a diagonal layout.

, Lay out the first piece of square edge flooring with the groove side against the wall so it fits snugly against the spacer. Place the next piece end to end.


Why do you need spacers around the walls? The floating wood floor will expand and contract as a unit with temperature fluctuations. Leaving a small barrier around the side of the room will give the flooring enough of a buffer to do its thing without cracking., Place the flat edge of a kick tool or wood block against the end of the second piece and hit the kicker with a hammer. Continue this process on the floor along the wall.


If you have one, a dead-blow hammer will remove the need for a kick tool or wood block to serve as padding. Dead-blow hammers minimize the damage to the wood.







, Cut the flooring with a jigsaw or circular saw as needed.


If you're having trouble fitting the end piece into the floor because of the wall, you might need to remove the second-to-last piece and lay down the final piece of flooring first. Once the end piece is in position, tight against the wall, fit the second-to-last piece back in and attach the tongue to the groove., Cut the first piece of flooring of your next row so that the end-joints don't fall along the same plane. This will strengthen the durability of the floor as well as add a pleasant aesthetic component. Use the kick tool, block, or dead-blow hammer on the side of the plank to connect the rows together.

, Shoot for every other row to be placed along the same plane to give the arrangement a uniform look.

, Cover up the free space between the baseboard and the floating floor by installing shoe molding along the entire perimeter of the wall. When you do, be sure to nail the shoe molding to the baseboard and not to the flooring to prevent cracking when the floor expands.

, If you're trying to install flooring around doors for example, you might find that the floating floor doesn't quite fit beneath the casing. Trim these door casings with a flush-cut dovetail saw if the flooring doesn't fit underneath the casings. To do this, hold the saw flat against a scrap piece of flooring to use as a guide, and press the saw into the casing, gently make the cut. Slide the flooring underneath to make sure that it fits.

, Scribing is a really useful skill to have in your toolkit. It will allow you to make accurate cuts using a compass as a guide.

, Usually, you can fasted one piece of flooring to its vertical cousin by tapping on the bottom of the end piece. But what if the end piece butts up against a wall, and you don't have the space to tap the tongue and groove together? For this you use a tool called a pull bar, which is a long strip of metal with a tongue on either end going in opposite directions. Just fit the pull bar down into the seam between the end piece and the wall, and then tap on the upward-sticking tongue of the bar to connect the tongue and groove.

Check your mattress instructions.,
Make rotation and flipping reminders, if necessary.,
Attach your reminders to your bed.,
Clear the area of breakable items.,
Re-position your bed, if necessary.,
Strip your bed.,
Position your mattress.,
Complete your rotation.,
Flip your mattress, if necessary.",How to Rotate a Mattress," Your mattress, especially if it is new, might not need you to flip it at all. In this case, clear directions on the mattress tag will state something along the lines of ""Do not flip"" or ""No flipping required.""Mattresses without this direction should be flipped and rotated for best results.


Some mattresses have a ""pillow-top"" on one side. Usually, these mattresses aren't intended to be flipped, but can be rotated.In some cases, the pillow-top of your mattress may not be uniform. Check the directions of pillow-top mattresses carefully; some might not require rotation.
If you have torn the tag from your mattress, or if the tag was somehow pulled free from it at some point, you should look up your mattress care instructions online. Type the name, manufacturer, and size of your mattress into an online search engine to find your care instructions.;
, Depending on the kind of mattress you have and its manufacturer, you may only need to rotate your bed twice a year.Other mattresses may require you to follow a more regular schedule, like rotating every three months.But it can be difficult to remember which way your mattress needs to be rotated/flipped. Reminders will help! Take your pen and an index card and:


Write the name of the month you plan to rotate your mattress at the top of your card.
For a mattress that requires flipping and rotating, turn your card upside down so the month you wrote at the top is now at the bottom of the card. Then write the month three months after the first month you wrote.
Take your second index card and write the name of the month three months after the second month you wrote along the top.
For a mattress that requires flipping and rotating, turn your card upside down so the third month you wrote is now at the bottom of the card. Write the next month three months after the third month.

For example, on your first card you could have ""March"" at the top and ""June"" at the bottom and upside down. Your second card, in this case, would have ""September"" at the top and ""December"" at the bottom and upside down., This will help you to remember which side needs to be rotated or flipped when the time comes. Take your safety pins and attach one card to the head of your bed and the other to the foot. A pin apiece should be enough to keep your reminders in place, but two pins will give your card greater stability and prevent it from catching on your sheets.You might also want to mark these dates on your calendar, put an alert in your phone, or use an online calendar service to keep track of your mattress maintenance.

, Rotating and potentially flipping your mattress can be an awkward endeavor. You might lose your hold of it while re-positioning, causing it to flop this way and that. While it's unlikely your mattress will do serious damage to you or sturdy objects, like a nightstand or dresser, more fragile items may be damaged.


Move lamps, heaters, knick-knacks on your nightstand, cups, glasses, clocks, wall hangings, and other breakable items out of the way before flipping or rotating.
You should also move stationary objects that might get in the way while flipping the mattress, or might be a hazard while flipping. For example, you might want to scoot your nightstand out of the way a little bit so you don't bump your toe on it while reorienting your mattress., This is especially important if you don't have a headboard or some kind of buffer between your bed and the wall. While rotating and flipping your mattress, you could jostle the frame of your bed into the wall, causing damage to it. To prevent damaging your wall, you might want to slide your bed a short distance away from the walls.

, If you need to flip your mattress while rotating it, bedding and sheets will get pinned beneath your bed. Even if you only need to rotate, sheets can get tangled, catch on your bed frame, or make it difficult for you to get a grip on your mattress. Strip your bed before doing either to make your job as easy as possible.

, Pull your mattress away from the headboard, wall, or the head of your bed frame, if possible. Some four poster beds, beds with footboards, and large mattress beds, like king sized ones, may require you to first lift the bottom of the mattress to pull it away from the headboard and rest on the footboard. This position will allow you to most easily helicopter your mattress around on your box spring or frame. Then grasp your mattress by one corner, lift up slightly, and drag it so the bottom faces either the left or the right side.


Check the sides of your mattress for handles. Some mattresses include side handles to make maneuvering and transportation easier.
You can rotate your mattress to whatever side is most convenient. Your end goal is to re-position the foot of your bed so it becomes the head.
Recenter your mattress after you have pointed the bottom to either the left or the right. The starting head and foot of your bed should be hanging off the left and right sides now, with the mattress roughly in the middle of your box springs or frame.
King and Queen sized mattresses may be hard to maneuver with just one corner. If you have a bed this size or larger, you will likely have the easiest time rotating your mattress by propping it on the head- or footboard and sliding it a little at a time until the foot and head of the mattress are pointing off to the sides.
You should not prop and pivot your mattress on your head- or footboard if either have sharp angles that might catch on your mattress or if these are not stable. In this case, offset your mattress by pushing one corner of the foot of the mattress inward with respect to the frame and one corner of the head of the mattress outward. The resulting orientation should be offset and tilted on an angle., Grasp your mattress again by the corner and begin sliding it so the bottom takes its new place at the head of the bed. Once your bed is mostly in position, you can make small adjustments until it is completely centered, unless you need to flip your mattress. Once your mattress is rotated, flip-needing mattresses will have to be turned over.


The size of king mattresses makes these prone to developing a hump in the middle. Thanks to the fact that these mattresses are mostly square, you can prevent this hump from forming by only rotating these mattresses 90-degrees and not finishing the rotation.
Except for king size mattress, your bed should now be oriented normally, with its long side running from the head of the bed to the foot of the bed. The head and foot of your mattress should now be in exchanged positions., Pull your mattress to either side of your bed so that about half of it hangs off your box springs or frame. Take the overhanging side and lift it until your mattress is standing straight up. Then lower the tall end to the opposite side of the bed. End-over-end flipping can be done similarly; pull and prop your mattress on the head- footboard and then raise the overhanging side and lower it until the bottom of the mattress takes the place of the top.


Generally, you should flip your mattress alternating between side-to-side flipping and end-over-end flipping unless your mattress tag/instructions indicate otherwise.
After flipping your mattress, it should overhang the opposite side of the bed. However, at this point it is rotated and flipped. All you need to do is push your mattress into place on your box spring or frame and you're done."

Do not dry clean your electric blanket.,
Do not iron an electric blanket.,
Inspect the blanket after washing and drying.,
Take care at the laundromat.",How to Wash an Electric Blanket3," Many people believe dry cleaning is gentler, and thus preferable for an electric blanket. This is not the case. In fact, it’s extremely important to avoid dry cleaning your electric blanket, as the chemicals used in dry cleaning can damage the insulation that surrounds the blanket’s heating elements., In general, you want to do as little cleaning, treating, and otherwise caring for your electric blanket as possible. In particular, never iron an electric blanket, as an iron can easily damage the blanket wires’ insulation., If, during washing or drying, any of the heating wires within the blanket become displaced or otherwise damaged, do not use the electric blanket any further. If you are at all uncertain about the condition of your blanket, the best option is to avoid using it.You can check to ensure the wires are all in place by holding the blanket between you and a bright light source. The wires should all be evenly spaced, and never overlap.

, Most manufacturers recommendations will direct you not to dry your blanket in a commercial dryer, such as those at the laundromat. The reason is heat: commercial dryers can get much hotter, and risk damaging your blanket. However, if you are careful to set the dryer at its lowest heat setting and check frequently to prevent drying the blanket all the way, you can safely use most commercial dryers."

Know that all air mattresses lose air naturally.,
Inflate the air mattress fully to test for a leak.,
Check the valve holding in the air.,
Stand the mattress up on its side in a quiet, large room to examine it for leaks.,
Place your ear 2-3 inches away from the mattress and listen for hissing sounds.,
Wet the back of your hand and repeat this process if you can’t find anything.,
Use soapy water to search for bubbles if you still cannot find the leak.,
Circle the leak with a pen or sharpie.,
Deflate and dry the mattress completely.",How to Patch a Leak in an Air Mattress1," Before you decide to strip the covers off of you mattress and search for holes, know that no air mattress holds air indefinitely. You will naturally have to re-inflate your mattress whether or not you have a leak.


Cold air, for example, causes your mattress to shrink. As the house cools down at night, your air mattress will likely soften a bit as the air cools. A space heater by the mattress can prevent this problem.Air mattresses need to “stretch” after they are bought. Don’t be alarmed if they feel soft shortly after you inflate them the first few times, they will quickly adapt.;
, If, after several minutes, it is severely deflated, then you likely have a leak. Sit on the mattress after you blow it up – it should not sink more than 1-2 inches under your weight.


If you are still not sure if there is a leak, leave your mattress inflated overnight and put weight on it, like several textbooks. If it is more than a little deflated in the morning, you have a leak.Keep the mattress inflated as you search for the leak. If you feel the mattress becoming soft, reinflate it before you start searching again. The higher the air pressure inside the mattress the more forceful the leak will be, making it easier to notice., Hold your hand over the valve and feel for any escaping air. It is usually located right next to the air pump and looks like a plug that you can detach to quickly deflate the mattress. Unfortunately, the valve is the one part of the mattress that is difficult to repair at home.


If your valve is broken or leaky, call the manufacturer to order a replacement.

, The majority of punctures and leaks occur on the bottom of the air mattress after people accidentally leave things underneath the bed. Make sure the bed is fully inflated and then stand the mattress up on its side to examine the bottom. You want enough room to flip, turn, and move around the mattress to easily search for leaks.

, Slowly move your ear across the entire surface of the mattress, keeping your ear close enough to hear escaping air. When you find the leak, it will sound like a thin, hissing noise, like someone saying “ssssss.”


Start on the bottom of the mattress, then try the sides and the front if you don’t find anything.

, The air escaping from the mattress will quickly evaporate the water, making your hand feel cool. Run your moistened hand along the entire surface of the mattress, 2-3 inches away from it, to search for small leaks.


You can also lick your lips and use them to sense escaping air, as your lips are some of most sensitive parts of your body., While some manufacturers warn that this will lead to mold and mildew, soapy water is still one of the best ways to find a leak. It works just like a child blowing bubbles -- you will create a thin layer of bubbly water, and the air mattress will ""blow"" into it through the leaky hole, exposing in the leak.To do so:


Fill a small bucket with water and a few drops (1 teaspoon) of liquid dishwashing soap.
Using a sponge, slowly wipe down the surfaces of the mattress with soapy water.
Start near the valve, then check the seams, underside, and top.
When you see bubbles forming you’ve found your leak.Wipe the soap away with a clean sponge when you are done.

, When the mattress is deflated it will be nearly impossible to find the leak again. Make a note of where the leak is so that you can easily repair it.


If you used the soapy water method, use a towel to quickly dry the area near the leak and mark it.

, Once you’ve found and marked your hole, let all the air out of the mattress. If you used the soapy water method to find the leak, pat the mattress dry with a towel and leave it in the sun for at least 1-2 hours before returning to it.

Consider returning the mattress.,
Gather your materials.,
Cut a patch from a repair kit or a spare piece of vinyl so that it will cover the tear.

,
Smear an ample amount of adhesive over the tear.,
Press the two sides of the seam together.,
Let the adhesive dry almost completely.This is called “setting up” and will take a few hours.

,
Apply a layer of adhesive to the patch.,
Place the vinyl patch onto the newly applied rubber cement, following the instructions on your repair kit.,
Allow the adhesive to dry completely.Drying times will vary depending on the adhesive but 6-8 hours is a good bet.

",How to Repair an Aerobed Leak4," If the mattress is new, a leak in the seam may indicate a defect or poor quality., You will need an air mattress repair kit or the equivalent components: a vinyl adhesive and a vinyl patch.When purchasing adhesives, look for urethane glues like McNett’s Seam Grip or Coleman’s Seam Sealer.
Instead of urethane glue, you can try rubber cement.

,, Use the applicator that came with your adhesive or a small paint brush. Make sure the adhesive extends ¼ of an inch beyond the edges of the tear.If you’re fixing a seam on a flocked surface, use more adhesive to ensure that the two sides of the seam stick together.

, The goal is to make sure that both sides of the opening remain in contact while the adhesives sets up.Consider using clothespins to hold the two sides of the tear together. Just be careful not to glue the clothespins to the mattress.

Assess the damage.,
Plug the hole by filling it with rubber cement or seam sealer.,
Seal the valve.,
Replace the valve.",How to Repair an Aerobed Leak5," Is there a hole or a crack? A hole will be easier to fix than a crack. If there’s a crack you might need to order a new valve from the air mattress manufacturer.This is a long-shot method and may not always work. Often, a severely damaged valve means that you’ll need to buy a new mattress.

,, If the valve is leaking air because the valve plug isn’t properly sealing against the valve stem, you can line the stem with a thin piece of plastic to help it seal properly., If the valve is damaged beyond repair, order a new one from the manufacturer and replace it according to the instructions."

Re-inflate the mattress.

,
Place a weight on the mattress.

,
Listen for leaks.",How to Repair an Aerobed Leak6,",, Pay special attention to the areas you repaired. Consider using the soap water detection method. Then wait a few hours and check again.

Buy a patch kit.,
Completely deflate the mattress.,
Sand away any soft felt near your hole.,
Clean and dry the area around your leak.,
Cut out a patch roughly one and a half times bigger than your hole.,
Apply the patch according to the manufacturer’s directions.,
Press down on the patch with firm, even pressure.,
Let the glue dry on the patch for 2-3 hours.,
Inflate the mattress and check for leaks.",How to Patch a Leak in an Air Mattress2," Almost every outdoor store will have these in the camping section. They are small, cheap sets that contain glue, sandpaper, and patches for tents, bike tires, and air mattresses. If you are in a pinch and the hole is small, a tire patch made for cycling should work fine.


Some companies have dedicated air mattress repair kits that you can find online, such as the Thermarest Repair Kit, Tear-Aid, and the Sevylor Repair Patch.
Make sure that the patch kit works on plastic or vinyl., You don’t want any air getting under your patch and ruining the glue, so let all the air out the mattress before continuing.

, If your hole is on the top side of the mattress you’ll need to remove the soft covering to make the patch stick. Take a wire brush or some sandpaper and lightly remove the felt coating until you only have plastic surrounding your leak.


Some mattress makers refer to this soft coating as “flocking.”

, Using soapy water or a little isopropyl alcohol, clean off the leaky area so that there is no dust, dirt, or debris surrounding the hole. Dry it completely before continuing., You want ample room to cover the leak, so cut your patch so it fits over the hole with a centimeter or more of the patch around every side. If your patches are pre-cut, use one that offers 1-2 centimeters of space around the hole itself.

, All patches function in one of two ways: they are simply applied like stickers, or you must apply special glue and then attach the patch. Either way, follow the instructions and apply your patch smoothly. Don’t remove it to get it “perfect.” As long as it covers the leak entirely it will work, and taking it off and reapplying it will make it less sticky.

, Once your patch is on, apply pressure to it for 30 seconds or more to make sure it is firmly attached. Use the heel of your hand to press down on the patch, or use a rolling pin to strongly flatten the patch against the mattress.

, It can help to lay a heavy, flat object on top of the patch to keep the pressure on it. Do not try to inflate your mattress until the glue is dry.

, Place your ear right next to the patch and listen for any escaping air. If no one needs it to sleep, leave the mattress inflated overnight and return in the morning to make sure no more air is escaping.

Know that DIY fixes may void your warranty.,
Sand away the soft felt around your leak if it is on the top of the mattress.,
Cut out a square of thin, malleable plastic, like a shower curtain.,
Attach the DIY patch with strong glue.,
Press your patch into the glue and hold it there.,
Place a heavy object on top of the patch and return in 6-8 hours.",How to Patch a Leak in an Air Mattress3," Many manufacturers request that you only use patch kits, or you send the mattress back to them for repair. Though effective, DIY patches can lead you to lose your warranty on the mattress, so proceed with caution.


Duct tape can be a temporary fix. Though effective in the short term, the glue on duct tape is not made to permanently bind to plastic, and it will eventually dry out and fall off.
Never use hot glue to fix a leak. Hot glue will, in almost all cases, melt part of your air mattress and make the hole bigger.

, This fuzz, though comfortable, will prevent your glue or patches from completely binding around the leak, causing it to fall off shortly after applying. Take a wire brush or some sandpaper and lightly scrub away the felt coating until there is only plastic around your leak., If you’re out of professional patches or cannot buy one, you can still improvise a patch from things around the house. Tarps and shower curtains work well and are easily cut to size.Make sure your square is big enough to cover the leak, with at least one extra centimeter on every side.

, Cover the leak in a generous amount of glue at least the size of your patch. Do not try this with your child’s bottle of craft glue. You need a strong, reliable adhesive, such as superglue, KrazyGlue, or Gorilla Glue, to adhere your patch., Use strong, even pressure to press the patch into the glue. Smooth out the patch with your fingers and gently wipe away any excess glue around the edges of the patch.

, Use several heavy books, a weight, or similarly heavy objects and place them on top of the patch to keep the pressure up as it dries. When you return the patch should be firmly adhered to the mattress.

, You will need an especially large space at the foot of your bed for the mattress. If you only have room on the side of your bed. You will have to adjust each step accordingly.

, Make sure that you keep your mattress in line with your box spring and bed frame.

, Half of the mattress should be on the floor and half rising vertically toward the ceiling so that it resembles a super tall couch at the foot of your bed. Make sure the top part of the mattress is folded over the bottom portion so the curve is resting on the base of your bed.

,


You may want one to two inches extra bed skirt material passing past (or below) the mattress edge for assurance of a perfect outcome.

,


You want the remainder to sit at the foot of the bed. This allows the remaining skirt to feed through when you push the mattress back up the bed.
To save your upper body, use your feet to roll the mattress slightly away from the bed by pushing the top half of the mattress further down towards the part on the floor. You will be able to make enough room so that you can work each section of the skirt between the mattress and the bed frame as you work your way across the mattress.

,,,, The weight of the mattress will bring the bed skirt with it so there should be no need to handle the skirt.

, You should be able to tell how it is going to look before you finish getting the foam mattress completely into the final position.


Check to ensure the bed skirt is not crumpling and is sliding smoothly with the mattress as it advances toward the head of the bed. If you need to return to an earlier step to make adjustments, do so now.

, Ensure that the mattress is sitting perfectly in line with the foundation and that your bed skirt is straight.

Start with a mild cleaner like dishwashing liquid.,
Use baking soda to tackle caked-on dirt.,
Remove paint stains with acetone or paint thinner.,
Try phosphoric acid (rust remover) for hard water stains.,
Try wax, silicone, or detergent for fiberglass boat surfaces.",How to Clean Fiberglass1," Dishwashing liquid will cut through most grease and oil stains. Don't use automatic dishwasher detergent, since it can be too abrasive for fiberglass.Your detergent or cleaner should not have any bleach in it. Bleach can also damage fiberglass, so verify that it's not an active ingredient in your mild cleaner.
You can also make a homemade cleaner easily by combining vinegar with regular dish detergent.This cleaner may work particularly well in showers.;
, Mix baking soda with water to form a paste that can be used to remove dirt on surfaces like a shower door or sink. Apply it to the soiled area and leave it in place for at least 12 hours.Follow up by cleaning the area with soapy water.


The paste may turn a brownish color when it sits on the dirtier areas of fiberglass.
You can use vinegar to active the baking soda after it sits on a fiberglass surface for deeper cleaning power. It should bubble a little, after which you can wipe down the fiberglass to get rid of the baking soda and dirty stains.

, Both of these substances can be dangerous, so be careful when you are using them. Acetone and paint thinner should only be used for stains such as oil or paint.Since these materials can harm the fiberglass, only use them in the case of the worse stains. Spot clean using acetone and paint thinner, so you don't damage any areas not heavily stained.
Wear thick gloves when cleaning using acetone or paint thinner. It may be good to wear goggles as well so you don't get either substance in your eyes.

, It can be dangerous, so be careful when handling rust remover. Mix it with water so the rust remover is not too strong and damages your fiberglass.Dilute rust remover with water by about 10% to make it less dangerous to handle. Mix carefully before applying to any fiberglass surfaces.
Since this can be a dangerous cleaner, make sure to wear rubber gloves. Rinse the fiberglass surfaces immediately with water when applying the rust remover; don't let it sit on the fiberglass for long.

, If you have a fiberglass boat, you'll likely want it to shine when in the marina or on the water. You can find these cleaners at marine stores, who can usually suggest the best kind for your particular boat.


A good boat wax polish will create a protective shield on the gel-coat fiberglass surface, protecting the boat from the elements. This will stave off any damage from the water and keep your boat looking nice.
Older boats with fiberglass surfaces that have seen a lot of use might do better with a silicone polish, which sinks in to the surface better. If your boat is older or used, you may also want to clean it on a more regular basis.
If you remove your fiberglass boat from the water after each use, wash it down thoroughly with a mild detergent and rinse thoroughly after each outing. This is especially important if your boat is in saltwater. Saltwater can really damage a boat's fiberglass surfaces.

Use a quality mattress.,
Find sheets that fit and feel soft.,
Find fluffy comforters and blankets.,
Vary the shapes and sizes of pillows.",How to Make a Nice Cozy Bed1," Start your cozy bed with a great mattress, which can make the most difference in the comfort of your bed, especially for sleep. Choose memory foam, pillow-top, and other mattress varieties according to your preference.


Choose an innerspring or air mattress if you prefer a softer mattress. Try memory foam or latex if you prefer a firmer mattress or suffer from lower pack pain.You can also supplement any mattress with a lush mattress topper, which fits over the corners of your mattress like a fitted sheet would, and comes in all the same materials that mattresses and comforters do to create the texture and coziness you want.;
, Use a fitted and flat sheet on your bed that are the right size for your mattress. Ideally, they should also be made of a high-quality fabric for the most comfort.


Cotton flannel provides extra coziness and warmth and silk is very smooth and warm for cold months.Choose a blend of cotton with a small amount of polyester for a fabric that is soft but wrinkles less easily.
Look for 100% Egyptian, organic, or pima cotton for the most luxurious fabrics, which are typically softer and more durable at a higher thread count (the number of threads in a square inch of fabric).Choose a percale weave if you prefer your sheets a little crisper and lighter, or sateen for a finish that feels heavier and more supple., Get a great down comforter, quilt, or other comfortable blanket of your choice as a main source of warmth and softness for your bed. Then use additional throw blankets for extra coziness and warmth.


Invest in a real down comforter for light and fluffy warmth, or a down alternative if you are allergic. Get a duvet cover for the comforter that can be removed and cleaned more easily than the comforter itself.
Look for knit fabrics, faux fur, cashmere, or other materials that are soft to the touch when you shop for throw blankets. Layering these on the bed can create extra volume, warmth, and comfort.

, Buy your preferred texture of pillow for sleeping, be it soft, firm, or shaped. Then add on additional pillows for comfort and decoration to lend support and coziness when you’re sitting or lying down.


Choose a firm pillow if you prefer or are prone to sleeping on your side, a medium-firm one if you sleep on your back, and a soft one if you sleep on your stomach.Try a memory foam material for your main sleeping pillow if you want something that will conform to and offer full support for your head and neck. You can also buy shaped pillows like a wedge to lend support when sitting or lying propped up.
Try a long body pillow for extra comfort while you’re sleeping, as well as a nice cushioning against a wall or daybed frame if your mattress is up against one.

Avoid using scouring brushes or wire brushes when regularly cleaning fiberglass.,
Gently rub your fiberglass cleaner on with a cloth or soft nylon brush.,
Use a sponge for especially difficult stains.,
Apply white polishing compound to your boat with a soft cloth.",How to Clean Fiberglass2," These will scratch and ruin the gel-coat surface of the fiberglass. Even though your stains may be deep, harsh brushes are not the best solution to get rid of the stains.Don't use steel wool, scrapers, or scouring pads either. These cleaning utensils are also too harsh for fiberglass surfaces.

, Make sure the brush has plenty of give against the fiberglass surface. Fiberglass can be scratched easily, so be especially gentle even with tough stains.


Try using a circular motion when scrubbing fiberglass surfaces. This will ensure you don't damage the fiberglass underneath.
For tougher stains, you can use a heavier cloth. However, it should still be soft enough to prevent damage., Sponges may be good if you need to let your cleaner sit for awhile. Use a soft sponge without any abrasive surfaces.


It may be especially useful to use a sponge when using baking soda paste. When using baking powder paste, the cleaner needs to sit awhile before mixing with vinegar.
The sponge can soak up the cleaner from the fiberglass surface. It can also wipe stains from the fiberglass surface.

, Use a clean cloth and be especially gentle when applying the polish. Ideally, the polish should leave your fiberglass surface with a clean, white sheen.


Only apply the white polish compound with a soft cloth after cleaning the fiberglass. The polish should be the final step in your cleaning procedure.
Use the white polishing compound a few times a year to keep the fiberglass sparkling. The polish should be applied when the boat has been out a few times or has sat for awhile.

Fit the sheets neatly.,
Put on a comforter and pillows.,
Top with decorative pillows and blankets.,
Leave some things imperfect.",How to Make a Nice Cozy Bed2," Put a fitted sheet onto your mattress first, followed by a flat (top) sheet. Make sure both are pulled and tucked in neatly to avoid wrinkles and hanging edges.


If you have a mattress topper, put this on before your fitted sheet. They will typically have elastic bands or elastic corners like a fitted sheet to easily fit onto the mattress.
Tuck in alternate diagonal corners of a fitted sheet to avoid it popping up. Make sure the fitted sheet you have has enough depth to fit fully over and tuck under your mattress, and isn’t too tight or stretched out.
Lay down a top sheet with the wide hem toward the head of the bed and the colored or patterned side facing down so it shows when folded over. Create crisp and neat ”hospital corners” with the flat sheet by tucking under the end first, then the sides, of the excess material., Lay a blanket or comforter on top of your flat sheet, then fold the top of the sheet down over the blanket to display the pattern and leave room for your sleeping pillows. Fluff pillows and place them in between the folded-down bedding and headboard of your bed.


Try putting down a light blanket first, followed by a comforter and then a throw blanket. Layering like this makes it easy to adjust to your ideal warmth, while also creating a visual coziness.Layer pillows according to size, with the largest closest to the headboard of the bed. Square Euro size pillows are first, then King and Standard sizes, followed by Lumbar or roll-shaped pillows., Put the finishing cozy touches on your bed by adding on plenty of extra blankets and pillows. Use a variety of soft textures to create an even more plush and luxurious look and feel for the surface of your bed.


Place larger decorative pillows behind your sleeping pillows, against the headboard, while smaller decorative pillows should be placed in front of other pillows. Throw blankets can be spread across the bed or thrown casually at the foot.
Avoid using decorative pillows that aren’t comfortable to sit or lay against, such as ones that are overstuffed or are covered with coarse fabric or beading. Stick to the same soft cottons, knits, and faux furs that will be the most cozy.

, Avoid having your bed too neatly made by arranging some elements more casually. Imperfect bedding looks cozier and more inviting than a flawless bed that you don’t even want to mess up to get into.


Try keeping a corner of the bedding folded down, sheets and blankets untucked, and pillows strewn casually to make your bed more accessible and inviting.
If you like having your bedding super crisp and well-made, try keeping just one item more casually arranged, like a throw pillow at the foot of the bed."

Use a space heater or electric blanket.,
Include dark colors and plenty of texture.,
Create a calming scent in the room.,
Create soft mood lighting.,
Put on relaxing music or sounds.",How to Make a Nice Cozy Bed3," Create cozy warmth in colder seasons by heating the space around your bed with a space heater. Or, try an electric heated blanket for even more warmth right in your bed.


Choose a radiant heater if you want to heat the objects in a room (like your bed and yourself) that it’s pointed at. Choose a combustion heater to heat the air in the entire room.Take care to follow all safety instructions for space heaters and heated blankets. Don’t put a space heater too close to bedding or other linens, and turn it off when you leave the room.

, Choose dark colors for your bedding, curtains, or even the walls of your bedroom. Darker tones help a space feel more closed in around you, in a good, cozy way. Mix up the textures in the space as well to create further comfort.


Incorporate a variety of textures into your bed and bedroom by including several rugs, curtains, and of course your throw pillows and blankets. Layer on faux furs, knits, quilts, and any different fabrics and textures you can think of.
If you want to include dark colors but don’t want the space to look too dark, try using a gradient of colors for different items. Black, grey, and silver are a great combination, as are a dark navy blue, medium blue, and light blue.

, Light scented candles, use a spray, or disperse essential oils in a diffuser to add a relaxing scent to the air around your bed. Stick to natural fragrances for the best effect.


Try scents like lavender, Roman chamomile, and sandalwood for traditionally relaxing scents, or anything else that helps make you feel cozy.Some scented sprays are designed or safe for use directly on pillows and bed linens. Spritz some of this spray lightly on your bedding to distribute the scent right where you’ll sleep or relax.

, Use lamps, lanterns, and strings of lights around your bed for softer, cozier lighting. Favor natural light during the day and low light or no light at night.


Turn out an overhead light and use low lamps and string lights instead to create softer, dimmer light.
Replace bulbs in overhead lights or lamps with lightbulbs in a warm hue that are 40 watts or lower, or use a dimmer switch in place of a regular on-off switch to quickly make your main lighting softer., Create a cozy ambience by putting on your favorite relaxing music or sound effects. Use your favorite slow-paced music played at a low volume, or use a soundtrack of relaxing sounds to make the setting extra calming and inviting.


Stick to acoustic music, ballads, classical, or other slow-tempo music for the most universally relaxing sounds. However, you should also stick to your preferences to choose whatever calms you down the most.
Try websites or CDs that feature sounds like those of falling rain or a crackling fire. Unless rain is already falling outside where you live or you happen to have a fireplace in your bedroom, these recorded sounds can help replicate the cozy feeling that the real thing elicits.

Don’t let fuel touch the glass.",How to Clean Fireplace or Woodstove Glass," Stubborn black soot stains that bake onto fireplace or woodstove glass can be very difficult to remove. But hot fires will help loosen the stains from the glass and make them easier to remove with cleaningBefore cleaning your glass, burn one or two hot fires in your fireplace or woodstove to loosen up the soot and dirt that’s built up on the glass.;
, You should never try to clean a fireplace or woodstove when it’s hot, and this applies to the glass as well. You could burn yourself or crack the glass if you're not careful.To be safe, let the stove or fireplace cool for a couple days before trying to clean it.

, For fireplace and woodstove glass that’s relatively clean and well-maintained, you may just have to wipe away a thin layer of haze from the glass. Soak a microfiber cloth or paper towel with water. Wring out the excess, and wipe the inside of the glass with the damp cloth.This will be sufficient to remove the white or grayish haze that can build up on glass from the heat, smoke, and ash.
If your glass is still dirty after a quick wipe, continue with the cleaning process.

, Take some fine white ashes from the fireplace or woodstove. Place the ashes into a bowl and add a few drops of water. Stir the ash and water mixture into a paste, adding more water if necessary. Dip a microfiber cloth into the ash paste and scrub the glass in a circular motion.Add more ash paste to the cloth as necessary, and keep rubbing until you’ve removed the soot.
Rinse the cloth with water, wring it out, and wipe the glass with the clean cloth.
You can also use newspaper to clean the glass instead of a cloth.
Wood ashes have a high pH and contain calcium carbonate, which is why they're so great for cleaning soot from glass.

, Brown stains sometimes build up on the glass because of the carbon in the fire. To remove stubborn brown stains, spray woodstove glass cleaner on the window and let it sit for 30 minutes. After soaking, wipe the glass with a damp microfiber cloth to remove stains and excess cleaner.You can also use this cleaner and the same method to clean the outside of the glass if it’s dirty.
Avoid ammonia-based cleaners on woodstove and fireplace glass. These can leave rainbow streaks on the glass, and many glass manufacturers don’t recommend using them., The easiest way to maintain the glass in your fireplace or woodstove is to clean it regularly so that deep cleaning isn't necessary. When you're burning regular fires, clean the glass each week with an ash paste:


When the fireplace or woodstove has had a day or two to cool, gather some ashes
Mix the ashes with enough water to make a paste
Apply the paste to the glass with a microfiber cloth to remove soot and dirt
Wipe the glass clean with a damp microfiber cloth

, Sometimes cleaning agents and ash paste can leave streaks on your glass that make it difficult to see the fire. To remove this, mix one part vinegar with three parts water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the glass and wipe the glass with a dry microfiber cloth until the glass is dry.Clean the inside and the outside of the glass in this way to remove streaks and make the glass clear and spotless.

, Glass cleaners that contain silicone will leave a layer on the glass. This layer will protect the glass from dirt and soot buildup, meaning you won’t have to clean the glass as often, and cleaning will be easier.Before applying any cleaner that isn't made specifically for wood stoves or fireplaces, read the instructions to make sure it’s heat- and fire-safe.

, Scraping the glass with a razor blade or other sharp implement may help to remove soot and buildup from fireplace and woodstove glass, but it’s more likely to scratch or gouge the glass. Modern fireplace and woodstove glass is actually a ceramic glass, and it’s much softer than regular glass.Scratches in the glass will make the fire harder to see, and will provide small crevasses for soot and dirt to hide.

, Clean fires will produce less smoke and lead to less soot buildup, which is why clean fires are important for keeping the glass clean. Fire needs oxygen to burn, so you must make sure the air vents in your fireplace or woodstove are open and clear when you're burning fires.Don’t let fuel block the air intake vents.
Clean the ashes out regularly to keep the intakes clear.
Make sure the air intakes are all open when you start a fire, and keep them fully open until the fire is established.

, When clean fires are your priority, dry hardwood is the only fuel you should burn in your woodstove or fireplace. This will produce the hottest fire, will ensure all the fuel burns, and will help prevent smoke or soot. To prevent smoke, soot, and creosote buildup, never burn:Wet or damp wood
Coal
Treated wood
Garbage
Large amounts of paper

, Softwoods tend to contain more resin than hardwoods, so they can lead to more smoke, soot, and creosote. Pine and birch especially contain a lot of resin that can leave soot on the glass, so you should never burn these in your fireplace or woodstove.Softwood is wood that comes from coniferous trees, and hardwood comes from deciduous trees.

, Smouldering will occur if the fire isn't getting enough air, if the fuel is wet, or if you put too much fuel on at once. Smouldering means the wood isn't burning properly, and this will create soot on the glass and creosote in the chimney.To avoid a smouldering fire:


Make sure the fire gets enough air, and open the intakes more if necessary
Don’t pack the fireplace or woodstove full of logs that can smother the flames
Add four to five pieces of fuel at a time
Never burn wet fuel

, When fuel touches the glass, the flames will be right against the glass. This will create difficult-to-remove black stains. To avoid this, don’t overload the woodstove or fireplace, and build your fire so the fuel is a safe distance from the glass."

Wear protective goggles when working with fiberglass.",How to Clean Fiberglass3," Inhaling fiberglass dust, which is produced whenever fiberglass is damaged, cut, broken or sanded, can be dangerous. Though the irritation from fiberglass dust is temporary, it is also very unpleasant.Exposure to the fibers and the dust in fiberglass can produce skin, eye or respiratory tract irritation. It does not cause long-term problems in most cases, but can lead to painful irritation.
This exposure could become serious depending on the length of exposure and the size of the fibers that one comes in contact with. Fiberglass dust can cause internal damage, though this is extremely rare when only cleaning fiberglass.

, Fiberglass can also cause skin irritation. It can even leave a rash on your skin in the case of long-term exposure.Wear long sleeves and clean clothes each time you're working with cleaning fiberglass. The long sleeves should prevent your arms from being exposed, while clean clothes will make sure you don't retain any fiberglass dust on your person.
Minimize the amount of bare skin that can be exposed to fiberglass. Gloves, long sleeves, and pants are necessary when working intensively with fiberglass.
Launder clothes worn when cleaning fiberglass separately from your other clothes. Fiberglass dust can get into your other clothes if you're not careful.

, Eye irritation and damage is also a serious problem with fiberglass. Eye irritation can be much more serious than inhaling fiberglass dust, since it is more likely to cause permanent damage.


Particles from fiberglass can get into your eyes and irritate them. Wearing goggles should minimize the contact with fiberglass and keep your eyes safe.
Sharper fiberglass fragments can also severely damage your eyes if you do not protect them. They can cut your eyes and even lead to long-term damage or issues.

Dust painted walls at least once every year.,
Make a cleaning solution with mild dish soap and warm water.,
Dampen a non-abrasive sponge with the solution.,
Work in sections.,
Rinse each section with clean water after scrubbing.,
Dry the surface with a towel.",How to Clean Enamel Paint1," Dust removal is important for maintaining enamel-painted surfaces, but an annual dusting is all that most walls need. Run the brush attachment on your vacuum over the walls and ceilings to quickly remove dust from the surface.For smaller areas, a hand duster should suffice.
Always dust before you do a deeper clean. For instance, before trying to remove a stain, give the walls a quick dusting.;
, Dirt and smudges will require more than a simple dusting to remove them. Fill a medium-sized bucket with warm water, then add a few drops of mild dish detergent. Use your hand or stirring device to mix them together. Fill a separate bucket up with just warm water.


You could also mix three tablespoons of distilled white vinegar in a gallon of water to create a safe cleaning solution for enamel-painted walls., Dunk a non-abrasive sponge, like a cellulose sponge, into the bucket of cleaning solution. Squeeze it to remove excess solution. You want the sponge to be dampened but not dripping., Divide the surface up into a series of vertical sections and clean them one at a time. Starting from the top and working your way down to the bottom, gently use the sponge to scrub the surface in circular motion. Once the sponge starts looking dirty, dip it back into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and continue.If the water in the bucket starts to look dirty during the process, dump it out and create a fresh batch of cleaning solution.

, Wet a second sponge with the clean water in your second bucket. Starting at the top and working your way down, use the wet sponge to wipe down the section and rinse away the cleaning solution. Be sure to remove all soap thoroughly, since dirt and grime can stick to soap residue if left on the wall., Thoroughly go over each section with a fresh towel to remove excess moisture from the surface. Work systematically, such as from top to bottom, so that you won't miss any spots."

Dust your silk plants.,
’Dry Clean’ hard to reach dust with salt.,
Check for colorfastness before liberally applying any cleaning product or water.,
Remove grime with cleaning products.,
Rinse your arrangement in cool water.",How to Clean Fake Plants2," When your silk plants have accumulated small amounts of dust and dirt, rely on traditional dusting methods to efficiently clean and revive your faux foliage. There are several dusting methods to choose from:


Run over the leaves, flowers, stems, and pot with a feather duster.
Attach a cleaning brush to your vacuum and suck up the dirt, dust, and debris.
Remove dust from your plants with a blow dryer set to low heat.
Wipe away grime from your silk plants with a dry microfiber cloth., Remove moderate dust accumulation from all the nooks and crannies of your silk plants with a simple, yet effective, salt-cleaning method.


Pour ½ cup salt into a plastic bag—the size of the bag is dependent upon the size of your silk floral arrangement.
Place the silk floral arrangement inside the plastic bag and seal it shut.
Shake the bag vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes. The salt will act as scrubbers, removing dust, dirt, and debris from the surface and hard to reach places. Repeat the process as needed.Open the bag. Turn the silk arrangement upside down with in the bag and shake it once or twice to remove the salt.
Remove the arrangement from the bag and return it to its container.You may substitute cornmeal or rice for salt., When checking for colorfastness, you are trying to determine how resistant the dye in a fabric is to removal.Prior to applying large amounts of water or a cleaning product to your silk flowers, always test an inconspicuous spot to see how it affects the color.


Spray, dab, or wipe a minuscule amount of cleaning product onto an inconspicuous part of the silk flowers and observe the spot for changes. If the color was negatively affected, do not proceed to use the product; If the color did not change, the product is safe to use., When your silk foliage is coated in grime, revive your faux bouquets with various cleaning products. Before applying these products, place your arrangement in a sink or outdoors.


Refresh your faux foliage with a silk flower cleaner, which come in spray and aerosol varieties. Coat the entire arrangement with the silk flower cleaner. Follow the instructions provided on the product.Fill a spray bottle with 50/50 water and white vinegar mixture. Spray the entire arrangement with the water-vinegar mixture—don’t forget to spritz the backside of leaves and petals. Dab the arrangement dry with a clean cloth.You may substitute rubbing alcohol for white vinegar.In a clean 3-gallon bucket, combine 2 gallons of hot water with 1 tablespoon of white flaky soap. Fill a spray bottle with this mixture. Coat the entire arrangement with the water-soap mixture. Dry the arrangement with a clean cloth. If your silk flowers require additional cleaning, you may then apply 1 to 3 coats of non-aerosol silk flower cleaner to your arrangement—allow the silk flowers to dry completely between coats., Easily remove a thick coating of dust from your silk arrangements with cool water and dish soap.


Fill a small basin with cool water—never use hot water, it will melt the glue used to hold the flowers together.
Squirt a small amount of dish soap into the water and mix.
Dip one stem at a time into the cool, soapy water flower first. If necessary, rub the foliage lightly to remove grime.
Remove the stem from the water a blot dry with a clean cloth.
Repeat on the remaining stems.
Once clean and dry, rearrange the flowers and return them to their container."

Run your plastic plants under hot water.,
Submerge your plastic plants in a water-bleach mixture.,
Cleanse the plants with a chlorine neutralizer.,
Rinse and scrub your silk plants.",How to Clean Fake Plants3," Over time, algae builds up on the surface of your plastic aquatic plants. Before you can sterilize the fake plants, you must remove the algae. Turn on your faucet and wait for the water to become hot. Place the plastic plants under the running hot water to rinse of the algae., The process of sterilizing your plastic aquatic plants in a water-bleach mixture begins by submerging them in a water-bleach bath for 1 hour.


Retrieve a 3 gallon bucket, disposable plastic gloves, protective eyewear, and a bottle of bleach.
Pour 1 gallon of hot water into the bucket.
Put on the disposable gloves and protective eyewear.
Add 1 teaspoon of bleach to the water and stir. If your plants are vividly colored, add an addition ½ teaspoon bleach.
Submerge the faux foliage into the water-bleach mixture for 1 hour. Stir the mixture every 15 minutes., Before returning your plastic plants to an aquarium, soak them in a chlorine neutralizer and rinse with hot water.


Retrieve a clean 3-gallon bucket.
Pour 1 gallon of hot water into the fresh bucket. Submerge the plants in the water.
Add a chlorine neutralizer to the water—carefully follow the instructions on the package.
After the allotted soaking time, remove the plants from the bucket and rinse your faux plants under hot water., You must clean your silk aquatic plants differently than your plastic aquatic plants—exposing your silk plants to bleach will damage the fragile fabric.


Rinse your silk plants under hot tap water to remove any built-up algae.
Create a cleaning paste. Measure out ½ cup un-iodized salt and pour it into a small bowl. Gradually add lemon juice until a paste is created.
Apply the paste to the silk plants with a clean toothbrush. Scrub thoroughly.
Rinse the silk plant under hot water to remove the paste and any remaining algae."

Perform a spot test with your intended cleaner.,
Make a paste with baking soda and water.,
Use a Magic Eraser on crayon and fingerprint stains.,
Get rid of tough stains with ammonia, vinegar and baking soda.",How to Clean Enamel Paint2," Before you get started, apply a small amount of the cleaner on an inconspicuous spot on the wall. Rub it in, and then wipe it off. Carefully inspect the area to ensure the color of the paint isn't negatively affected.


Even if it seems to be fine, only use abrasive cleaners when absolutely necessary., Mix equal parts of baking soda and water to create a thick paste. Use your fingers or a utensil to apply the paste directly onto the stained area. Gently scrub the area with a non-abrasive sponge. Rinse with clean water and dry thoroughly., Magic Erasers can be useful for removing tough stains left behind by small children. Wet the sponge, then wring it out. Scrub at the stain until it disappears. Use the less abrasive side of the sponge so that you don’t scratch up the wall., If dish soap, baking soda, vinegar and Magic Erasers all failed to remove the stain, create a stronger cleaning solution. Mix a gallon of water with 1 cup (120 mL) of ammonia, ½ cup (60 mL) of vinegar, and ¼ cup (30 g) of baking soda. Use a gentle sponge to rub the solution into the stain with a circular motion.Rinse the solution away with a sponge dipped in clean water. Dry the area thoroughly.

Ensure your crystal is dishwasher safe.,
Load the dishwasher carefully.,
Allow crystal to warm up.,
Use a small amount of detergent.,
Run the dishwasher.,
Let the crystal cool.,
Remove the crystal carefully.",How to Clean Crystal1," Many crystal glasses have a dishwasher safe label. If yours do not, check with the manufacturer or research online to find out if they can be put in the dishwasher. Crystal manufacturer Riedel notes that their glasses are used in hotels around the world and are thus cleaned in professional dishwashers. If you cannot find any information, err on the side of caution and wash by hand., Ensure your glasses, bowls, or other crystal items have enough space. You don’t want them touching, as they could jostle and bump into each other causing damage during the dishwashing cycle. Don’t overcrowd or overload the dishwasher, and be sure any long-stemmed glasses fit securely in the rack., Don’t start the dishwasher until your crystal has had time to come to room temperature. Sudden changes in temperature, such as heating a chilled glass, can cause breakage or damage to crystal., Don’t add extra detergent in the hopes of getting your crystal extra clean. Excessive detergent can leave a cloudy film on your crystal. Follow the recommendations for your dishwasher and detergent, taking into account whether you have hard or soft water., Start your dishwasher and allow it to run its normal cycle. Don’t interrupt the cycle or open the door in the middle of cleaning.

, Allow the dishes to cool before opening the door to the dishwasher. This will also let your crystal dry in case the dish-washing cycle didn’t fully dry the crystal. Depending on your dishwasher and water temperature, this could take several hours., You may want to wear gloves or remove the crystal with a lint-free cloth to prevent smudging and fingerprints. You can also use the lint-free cloth to remove any left-over water spots.

Find a container large enough to fit your dentures.,
Purchase distilled white vinegar.,
Mix one part water with one equal part vinegar.,
Ask your dentist before using vinegar.,
Soak the dentures for 15 minutes a day.,
Place the dentures in the vinegar overnight.,
Check for softened tartar and deposits.,
Soak your denture brush in a bleach/water solution.,
Remove the dentures from the vinegar.,
Brush the dentures with your denture brush.,
Rinse the dentures thoroughly.,
Pour out the vinegar solution.",How to Clean Dentures With Vinegar," Look for a glass, a cup, a bowl, or a washable food container to pour the vinegar solution into. Make sure it is big enough for your dentures to be submerged. Try to find a glass container to avoid any breakdown the vinegar might cause in plastic or other permeable materials.;
, Find white vinegar to use in this cleaning solution.Cooking or flavored vinegars might transfer flavors to your dentures, creating an unpleasant taste.


You can find bottles of distilled white vinegar for relatively low prices at most grocery stores.
Avoid apple cider vinegar, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and any other vinegar that is not distilled white.

, Into the container you have found to soak your dentures in, mix a solution that is 50% vinegar and 50% water. Make sure the mixture has enough volume to cover the submerged dentures.You can work this into your evening bedtime routine by pouring in the vinegar and water as you are washing your face or changing into night clothes so that all you have is drop in the dentures on your way to bed.

, Before starting a vinegar routine for your dentures, get the ok from your dentist. Partial dentures, for example, can be adversely affected by long-term use of vinegar as a cleaning solution.This is because the vinegar can act as a corrosive solution on the metal parts of the partial dentures.

, A good rule of thumb for partial dentures is to soak them in the vinegar solution for only 15 minutes once a day. This short amount of time will still soften buildup on the dentures without damaging the metal clasps on the partial dentures., If you notice heavy deposits of tartar (called calculus) starting to congregate on your dentures, it is time to start soaking them overnight in the denture solution. The solution will weaken tartar compounds.Remember not to do overnight in vinegar with partial dentures unless you get the green light from your dentist.
If you do not see tartar buildup on the dentures, stick to an overnight vinegar soak.
Some dentists recommend that if you are going to do an overnight soak on a regular basis, only use a solution that is 10% vinegar mixed with water, and only for 8 hours., In most cases, the vinegar won’t actually dissolve the tartar, but it will soften it so that you can brush it away the next morning. The vinegar won’t remove stains on its own either, but it will make it much easier for a denture brush to do the work., You should soak your denture brush in a half bleach/half water solution once a week to prevent the growth of bacteria.Rinse the brush thoroughly before using it on your dentures.

, The next morning, bring the container over to the bathroom sink and fill it with water. Remove the dentures from the vinegar solution with your hands, making sure to keep the dentures over the water. This water acts as a cushion in case you drop the dentures while handling them., Now use the clean brush to rub off stains and calculus buildup on the dentures. Brushing the dentures after an overnight vinegar soak will also work off plaque, food particles, and bacteria.If the stains don’t come off after the first overnight soak, repeated soaking should eventually get all the stains off.
If stains won’t come off no matter how much you soak your dentures, talk to your dentist (this includes coffee stains, yellowing, any sort of stain).
Scrub every surface of your false teeth, both inside and out, with either a denture brush or a toothbrush. Make sure the brush is wet when you do this, and that you use a light brushing stroke., After cleaning the surfaces of the dentures, it is time to rinse them off. Rinse the dentures repeatedly until both visible stains and tartar, as well as all traces of vinegar scent, are rinsed away. Rinsing helps wash away any debris and get the vinegar flavor off the dentures., After you are done soaking your dentures, pour out the solution. Do not re-use the vinegar solution as it now contains debris from stains, tartar, bacteria, and whatever else was on your dentures.

Saw the antlers off the skull cap.,
Scrub the antlers with a wire brush.,
Boil the antlers outside.,
Remove antlers from the boiling water after 30 minutes.,
Allow the antlers to air dry for a day.,
Apply water and soap to a towel.,
Scrub the antlers with the towel.,
Dry the antlers with a towel.",How to Clean Deer Antlers," Get a hacksaw and place it against the antlers, at the point where the antlers meet the skull. Saw both the antlers off, while securing the skull so that it doesn’t move, altering the trajectory of the saw so that the cut is uneven.Consider using a clamp to hold the skull in place, so that it doesn’t move while you saw it.;
, You need to remove all remaining organic material from the antlers. Scrub every part of the antler well, but give special attention to the area where the antlers met the skull cap. This is where hair and tissue are most likely to be hiding.Wire brushes are available at most hardware stores. They are abrasive enough to pick up tissue without requiring too much force.

, Fill a large cooking pot with water and, for best results, a pinch of salt. Allow it to reach a boil on a stove or a fire pit. Once it boils, submerge the entire antler in the cooking pot and allow to boil for 30 minutes.This step is important for removing dangerous bacteria from the antlers.
You should boil the antlers outside, otherwise they will stink up your house.
Before beginning, test to see if the cooking pot is large enough to fit the antlers inside. All the antler should be submerged during boiling. If you don’t have any pots large enough, you can try using prongs to force them underwater or adjust them periodically during the boiling process.

, Keep prongs on hand that you can use to remove the antlers without burning yourself. The antlers will feel soft when you pull them out of the cooking pot, but they will harden up after a few minutes., Leave the antlers outside somewhere safe, where they will get sun and dry off. Do not, however, allow them to be out in the sun for more than 24 hours. They sun will erode the color of the antlers after more than a day of constant exposure., Too much water can damage the antlers, so be sure that the towel is only damp, not wet. Squeeze excessive water out of the towel. Apply a nonabrasive soap—not bleach.


Bleach and bleach-based cleaners can damage the antlers.

, Feel free to use force when scrubbing the antlers. Scrub until all dust and grime has been removed., You do not want the antlers to remain wet. Use a new towel that is dry to go over them, picking up excess moisture. It is alright if the antlers are still somewhat damp at the end of the process."

Surface-clean the item with a gentle soap and a soft cloth.,
Try spray cleaners for surface cleaning as well.,
Add some grit for a deeper clean.,
Apply your mild abrasive to the clear plastic.,
Consider applying a UV clear-coat spray or commercial protective wax.",How to Clean Clear Plastic1," The first step to cleaning any clear plastic item is wiping away dust, dirt, grime, oils, etc. from the surface. Opt for non-abrasive materials so that you don’t scratch the plastic surface.Add a small amount of a gentle detergent, such as dish soap, to clean, warm water.
Use a clean microfiber cloth or soft cotton rag (like an old t-shirt). Paper towels are too abrasive.
Wet the cloth thoroughly with the soapy water, and gently scrub the surface with a circular cleaning motion.
Rinse the residue away with clean, cool water and dry the plastic with another clean cloth.;
, Commercial window or multi-surface cleaners can also be used to wipe away surface debris from clear plastic. In some cases, though, they may add further cloudiness and streaks by leaving a film behind. If you’re cleaning a clear plastic windscreen, for instance, test an small area first to evaluate the results.


Use a non-abrasive cloth like microfiber or soft cotton.
You can also make your own multi-purpose cleaner by combining clean water and white vinegar (at a 1:1 ratio) in a spray bottle., Surface cleaning alone will probably not restore the clarity of your plastic item or reduce yellowing. In this case, instead of avoiding abrasion, you may want to use a mild abrasive to scrape away the surface damage done by UV rays and wear and tear.Some people find that plain white toothpaste works well; others prefer mixing baking soda with vinegar to make a foamy cleaner with some grit.
Or, try mixing baking soda and oil soap (such as Murphy’s Oil Soap) into a thick paste equal or slightly thicker in consistency than toothpaste., In this case, a microfiber or cotton cloth is still fine to use, but you can also enhance the abrasion a bit further by using a woven scouring pad (not steel wool) meant for non-stick or coated cooking pans.Clean and rinse the surface first.
Use a circular cleaning motion with relatively mild pressure. Think more “exfoliating your skin” and less “sanding down a piece of wood.”
Rinse the cleaner away with clean, cool water.
Dry the plastic with a clean, soft cloth (with no abrasion this time).

, Scrubbing away the surface cloudiness of your item may, unfortunately, leave it more vulnerable to UV damage in the future. Depending upon the importance and function of the plastic item — such as a car headlamp cover or boat windscreen, for instance — you may want to add surface protection to slow down the deterioration process.UV protectants for plastics come in clear-coat sprays and wipe-on waxes. Consider which application and process is best suited to your needs, and follow the product instructions explicitly."

Mop cork floors.",How to Clean Cork1," Vacuum or sweep your cork floors. Do this to remove any obvious layers of dirt or dust. That dirt can scratch the floor over time. Use a soft-bristled broom or a low setting on your vacuum., Combine a drop of mild dish soap with ¼ cup (60 mL) white vinegar and 1 quart (.946 L) of warm water. Put the solution in a spray bottle to apply it most easily to any surface. Mix it gently by rocking it back and forth or stirring gently. Don’t shake it or you’ll create unwanted suds.Don’t worry if you add a little extra soap.
You can also use a combination of liquid soap and water. Try combining 5 drops of soap to every quart (.946 L) of water.

, Try using a gently abrasive cleaning solution. Watch out for cleansers that contain bleach. These can discolor your cork. Also avoid acidic cleansers that might damage your cork., Use a soft mop to wash the floor with store-bought cleansers, soap and water, or your solution of water, vinegar, and soap. Rinse off the cleaning solution or you might see streaks or a soapy film when the floor is dry. Allow the floor to air dry or dry it with a soft rag.Wring out any extra water when you begin mopping to avoid over-saturating the floor. This extra water could damage the cork.

Submerge your crystal in the solution.,
Wash your crystal carefully with a cloth.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Dry your crystal.",How to Clean Crystal2," Fill your sink or a bucket with warm water and a small amount of mild dishwashing soap. Too much soap can leave a cloudy film, so only use a little bit. Swirl or agitate the water to mix the solution thoroughly. Line the bottom of the sink or bucket with a rubber mat, soft cloth, or even paper towels to prevent damage to your crystal., You’ll want to do one piece at a time to prevent the items from clanking together, which could cause chipping or breakage. If needed, allow your crystal to soak for a few minutes.If your item is too big to fit in the sink or bucket, or cannot be fully submerged, such as a lamp or chandelier, dampen a soft cloth or sponge in the solution and use it to carefully wipe down the item.

, Use a soft cloth or sponge for washing your crystal to avoid scratches. Gently rub the sponge or cloth on the surface of the crystal in a circular motion, and be sure to clean the entire item, inside and out.If your item has a narrow opening, try using a baby bottle brush to move a sponge or soft cloth around the inside of the item.
Some crystal is etched with language or artistic designs; use a soft-bristled toothbrush dipped in the warm water mixture to brush dust and dirt out of the etchings.

, Use warm, running water to rinse away any residue from the crystal. You may want to wear gloves to ensure you aren’t putting fingerprints on your clean crystal.


For those larger items, use a clean, wet cloth or sponge to wipe down the item and remove any lingering soap.
You could also rinse your crystal in a bucket or bowl of distilled water, as this will reduce the amount of water-spots left behind., Gently wipe each item down with a lint-free cloth. This will remove any water spots and give your crystal a beautiful shine. Again, it is a good idea to wear gloves to prevent smudging your clean crystal."

Vacuum the seats.,
Spray a light coat of cleaning solution on the seat.,
Use an interior brush on the area.,
Wipe away dirty suds with a microfiber towel.,
Repeat until clean.,
Vacuum again after you’re finished.",How to Clean Cloth Car Seats1," Before you clean your cloth seats, you need to remove all debris, dirt, and crumbs. Vacuum the seats well. Make sure to get into the seams. Use your fingers to separate the seams and stick the nozzle of the vacuum into the seams to remove any loose debris., You should use a fabric or cloth cleaning product to clean cloth seats instead of an all-purpose cleanser. Lightly spray the solution over the area that you want to clean. Try four to five sprays over the area.Make sure not to spray so much that you saturate the area. This can lead to mold and smells on the cushion underneath the cloth.

, Before spraying cleaner on a new area, work on the area you just sprayed. Work on one area at a time, immediately brushing the area after spraying. Use a soft or medium stiff interior brush to massage the cloth seat.Don’t use a stiff carpet brush on cloth interiors. This can mess up the cloth fibers on the seat.

, Massaging the cloth helps bring dirt to the surface. When the suds start to gather with dirt in them, use a microfiber towel to wipe away the dirty suds. Make sure to do this before it dries, which will put the dirt back on the seat., Repeat this same process, spraying, massaging, and wiping, until the area is clean. Remember, the key is light coats before you brush instead of saturating the fabric with solution. It may take three to six coats to remove the stain., When you’ve finished removing the stain, use the vacuum on the area again. This helps dry up any wet saturation that has accumulated and dry the fabric. Let the seats finish drying before driving the car anywhere."

Use dampened sandpaper on wetted-down clear plastic.,
Scrub in a circular motion with progressively finer grades of sandpaper.,
Apply an abrasive polishing compound to smooth out the plastic.,
Apply a UV protective coating to slow down subsequent clouding.",How to Clean Clear Plastic2," Wet-sanding uses decreasing levels of abrasion to scrub away and buff smooth a clouded plastic surface. There are many variations of this method when it comes to cleaning car headlamp covers, since oxidation can cause clouding that may reduce the effective brightness of your headlights.


Clean the surface of the plastic item first with a gentle soap, soft cloth, and clean water.
Protect any surrounding surfaces (e.g., car paint or chrome around your headlamp covers) with thick layers of painter’s tape, or even taped-down plastic sheeting., Soak the sandpaper in clean water, or spray it down while working. Keep the plastic damp as well. Use firm and even, but not excessive, pressure. Rinse and check the surface for even abrasion when switching sandpaper grades.


For a more aggressive application on, for instance, a car headlamp cover, you could use 400, 600, and 2000-grit sandpaper.To exert greater caution with your headlamp covers (or with something like a boat windscreen), try using 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and finally 3000-grit sandpaper., After thoroughly rinsing the item and drying it with a soft, lint-free cloth, apply a commercial polishing compound to fine-tune the abrasion process. Follow the instructions provided with the product, but expect to go very slowly so that you can methodically work the compound over the plastic item.Look for abrasive polishing compounds for plastics at auto parts or marine retailers.
If your plastic item doesn’t require this level of care, you can opt to simply wipe rubbing alcohol over the rinsed plastic in order to remove any lingering dust, oils, or residue., Unfortunately, once you’ve done all this work to make your plastic crystal clear, the yellowing and clouding process will begin again immediately. If you want to add some more time before you have to wet-sand the plastic item again, consider applying UV protection to retard the impact of ultraviolet light.


For automobile headlamp covers, for instance, you could apply a paste wax intended to provide UV protection.Or, you could use a UV protectant clear-coat spray. If so, work slowly (according to the product instructions) and be sure to fully cover any areas (car paint, etc.) that you don’t want the clear-coat to get on."

Mist on and wipe away a commercial clear window wax.",How to Clean Clear Plastic3," Use a gentle soap, clean water, and a microfiber or other lint-free, non-abrasive cloth. Make sure the plastic item is dry before proceeding., Especially if you are dealing with pricey clear plastic components (such as on a boat), do your homework before choosing and using a clear plastic cleaner/restorer. Some plastic manufacturers recommend only certain brands, and using others may void any warranty or even cause irreparable damage.Consult the manufacturer’s recommendations before trying any do-it-yourself methods as well.

, This type of product is often used on windscreens and other clear plastic components of boats, so see what options are available at marine product retailers. Follow the product’s instructions for use; typically, however, you will use an included foam applicator and buff with a series of clean microfiber cloths., Once again, follow the instructions for the specific product. Typically, though, you will apply a light, even spray of the product on the plastic item, then wipe it away in a circular motion with a clean, soft, lint-free cloth.This type of product will help provide more lasting UV protection, thereby delaying future clouding or yellowing.

Rub the sponge over the cork. Allow it to air dry completely before using.Don't dilute the hydrogen peroxide.
You do not need to rinse the hydrogen peroxide off the cork.

, You can sand any item made of cork, even floors. Very gently rub the cork with sandpaper that has fine or extra fine grit. Only sand in one direction and avoid sanding in circles. Doing this will remove any layers of dirt, but it will also remove the top layer of cork. Accordingly, limit the number of times you sand your cork each year., Use a commercial sealant to protect cork shoes, floors, and fishing rod grips. Consult with a flooring professional or manufacturer to determine the best sealant for your cork floors. For other products, try using sealants manufactured for cork shoes. Use the sealant to keep your cork clean and prevent it from deteriorating over time."

Call a professional if you can't solve the problem yourself.",How to Select Pest Controls," It is essential to know what type of pest you are dealing with, as it will help you select the correct pesticides or other preventative control methods. Rodents can often be eradicated with traps, whereas cockroaches may require poison spray.;
, The most basic form of pest control is eliminating the areas where they live and breed.


Take out the trash regularly.
Seal food containers and clean the property regularly.
Reduce moisture in the building. Repair any leaks in roofs and check for leaking pipes.

, Biopesticides are usually less toxic to humans than conventional poisons. They are made from natural materials found in plants, bacteria, animals and minerals.


Commercially available biopesticides target a wide variety of insects and weeds, which will be indicated on the label. For example, many products use the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, but each is designed to kill specific insect larvae.
Biopesticides are available at hardware and garden stores in many forms, from liquid sprays to pheromone lures that attract specific pests to a trap.

, There is a variety of trap types available depending on the task at hand.


Set snap traps if you have rodents, but keep them out of the reach of children and pets.
Set sticky traps for spiders and insects. These are often available in box form, which you should check regularly.

, These are available at most home-supply stores, but they can be dangerous if used improperly.


Read the label carefully. It will indicate the type of pest the product is designed to control, and it will provide necessary precautions.
Pesticides come in the form of aerosol, dust or bait and are often diluted to a specific ratio.
Sprays should be applied only to specific targeted areas, such as cracks in the wall.
Use poison bait if a rodent problem is not resolved with snap traps. Poison baits must be kept out of reach of children and pets.

,


Fumigation might be necessary in cases of extreme infestation, particularly with termites. This is the process of releasing poisonous gas or vapor throughout a vacant building, which is covered in a specialized tent.
Although it's a more expensive option, a pest management professional will likely have extensive knowledge of the issue and access to proper equipment.

Set aside fabric towels for buffing.,
Clean before buffing.,
Wipe the appliance down with a clean, dry buffing towel.",How to Clean Black Appliances," Terry cloth towels will be gentle on your appliance. Wet them and then squeeze out excess moisture.Terry cloth is the fabric used for most bath towels, bath robes, and slippers, but because of its soft, absorbent qualities it can be great for non-streak cleaning as well. Terry cloth towels are plush and soft.;
, Apply a cleaner to the towel. For store bought solutions, use an ammonium-based cleaner.

This will sanitize the appliance and remove dirt, but probably leave streaks. You will likely need to perform this cleaning frequently.Buffing immediately after cleaning will remove the remaining streaks.

, To protect against scratches, never use steel wool or abrasive scrubbing pads to pick up tough stains. Magic Eraser is good at picking up tough stains, without leaving scratches.For a homemade alternative, try mixing baking soda with a couple drops of liquid dish soap. Apply this solution to an old toothbrush and use it to scrub away tough stains., Ideally, you should have certain towels that you only use for buffing. This will prevent them from accumulating cleaning products, making them more effective at removing streaks. Wash them separately from your other towels, without bleach.Consider making all your buffing towels a single color to make them easier to recognize.
A simple fabric towel should suffice. Although some people recommend microfiber, a basic towel made of cloth should work in most cases., If you do not wipe your appliances down with a cleaning solution before every buffing, your buffing towels will accumulate dirt and become ineffective. Always be sure that there is no dirt or grime left on the appliance before you buff it., Do not wet the towel or apply cleaner. A dry towel should easily pick up the streaks. Gently wipe down the entire surface before the cleaner dries.If you allow the cleaner to dry on before buffing it, you will find it harder to pick up streaks that have dried on.

, When you cannot buy these foods in bulk, look for them in clear packaging so that you can still inspect the contents. Many grocery stores that don’t have bulk bins will still have prepackaged bulk items that are stored in clear plastic bags or containers.


When buying these items, use your hands to move the contents of the bag around to inspect for weevils.

, If you must buy prepackaged grains, flours, or other dry goods, inspect the packaging before you purchase them. Look for holes, punctures, or other signs of damage that could indicate an infestation., Weevils most often get into your house through contaminated food, but they can also make their way in through access points if they've already infested the area. Things to look for and fix include:Damaged weather stripping around doors and windows
Missing areas of caulk around doors and windows
Torn screens in doors, vents, and windows
Cracks and openings in your pantry (which can be sealed with caulk)

, Even if you buy all your grains in bulk, it’s still possible that contaminated food will end up in your home. Luckily, you can prevent an infestation by killing the weevils before the eggs hatch or the females lay eggs. There are two ways you can do this:Heating: This works best for whole grains (rice, for instance), but shouldn’t be used for ground grains or powders. Heat your oven to 140 F (60 C). Lay your grains out on a baking sheet. Bake the grains in the oven for 15 minutes. Allow to cool before storing.
Freezing: This is suitable for powdered and ground grains, but also works for whole grains. Simply place the newly purchased bag or container of grains in the freezer and leave it undisturbed for three days. Allow to thaw before storing.

, Once you’ve killed any weevils that might have been hiding in your grains, transfer the grains to glass, metal, or thick plastic containers that have airtight lids. Weevils can eat through paper and thin plastic.Along with storing all cereals, grains, and flours in weevil-proof containers, you can also store sugar, coffee, and other dry goods in these containers if your house is prone to infestations.

, To ensure that weevils don’t have time to invade your dry goods, buy your grains and flours in smaller quantities so you eat them quickly and don’t leave them in the back of the pantry for months.This is another time when buying in bulk can be beneficial, because you can control the exact amount that you purchase.

, Weevils may be attracted to your home if there are bits of food lying around in your pantry, such as flour dust, spilled cereal, or fallen grains of rice. To ensure that there's nothing in your pantry that might attract them, keep your shelves clean and free of food.


Once every month or two, remove all the food from the pantry or cupboards and vacuum the shelves.
Clean up spills and messes as soon as they occur., There are many herbs that may act as weevil repellants. You can use these herbs in your pantry and in your grain containers to help keep weevils away.


Herbs that may work as weevil deterrents include bay leaf, clove, rosemary, black pepper corns, and garlic cloves.A few bay leaves can be placed inside each grain, flour, and cereal container.
Use the other herbs on the pantry shelves, otherwise they may flavor your grains.

, When you discover a weevil infestation, the first thing you have to do is get all the food off the shelves in your pantry or cupboard. That way, you can clean all the shelves and inspect the food for contamination.Set up all the food in one location, such as in your kitchen.

, Go through all the food that was in your pantry or cupboards and inspect for weevils or signs of infestation. If you find weevils in whole grains that can be rinsed, you can clean the grains and salvage them.


Ideal candidates for rinsing include whole-grain rice, barley, and buckwheat.
Place the grains into a strainer and hold it under running water. Use your hand or a spoon to comb through the grains, making sure the water rinses them all.
When the weevils have been rinsed away, place the grains on a baking sheet and into a 140 F (60 C) oven for 15 minutes to kill any eggs and dry the grains.

, Many infested foods, such as flours and cereals, cannot be rinsed without being damaged. Throw these foods out. Place them in a large garbage bag and tie the bag tightly.Remove the bag with the contaminated foods from your house immediately so the weevils don’t eat their way out and infest again.
If you don’t feel comfortable salvaging infested foods like rice, simply discard them as well.

, Once you’ve gone through and thrown out all your infested foods, wash the containers with hot, soapy water to remove any eggs or larvae that might still be present.


For dishwasher-safe containers, run the dirty containers through the dishwasher instead., This will serve the dual purpose of sucking up weevils and removing their food source. Make sure you get into all the nooks, crannies, corners, and cracks.Vacuum the floor in your pantry as well, or the counter under the cupboards.

, Once weevils infest your pantry, they may travel out to explore new areas of your kitchen if they're attracted to any other food sources. Crumbs and forgotten bits of food can often be found under appliances, so it’s important to clean under these as well.


Pull out your stove and fridge and vacuum thoroughly underneath before replacing them.
You should also move and vacuum under your microwave, toaster, toaster oven, and any other countertop appliances you have.

, Weevils can hide in places you'd never think, including underneath old shelf paper on the shelves in your pantry or cupboard. To ensure that you don’t have any stowaways, and to remove any eggs and larvae, remove the shelf paper that’s lining your shelves.Discard the old shelf paper immediately.
Vacuum and clean the bare shelves before installing new paper.
Once everything has been cleaned thoroughly and the new paper installed, you can start returning non-contaminated food to your pantry or cupboard.

Choose houseplants suited for your available light conditions.,
Make sure your houseplants are potted in sterile soil.,
Clean your houseplants regularly.,
Inspect your plants regularly for insect damage.,
Control existing insect infestations as well as possible.,
Know when to give up on an infested houseplant.",How to Prevent Bugs In Your Houseplants," The first step in preventing insects actually arises when you choose your plants. Make sure each houseplant is well suited to the amount of light it will receive once in position. Plants in unfavorable light conditions are subjected to stress, which makes them more susceptible to insect infestation.;
, While bacteria, fungus, and insects are a vital component of outdoor soil health, houseplants are better planted in store bought potting mix, which will generally be sterile. Using outdoor garden soil can introduce insect larvae into your houseplants.


Make sure to include a drainage layer of gravel at the bottom of each houseplant pot. Poorly drained soil can saturate the roots, leaving them more susceptible to insect attack.

, Dust buildup on your houseplant leaves often contains organic compounds (like skin cells or pet hair) that insects can feed on. Furthermore, insects like mites thrive in thick layers of dust and will be less likely to infest a clean plant.


Large houseplant leaves can be gently wiped with a moistened rag. Use as nonabrasive a cloth as you can find; microfiber cloths work well for this task.
Plants with many small leaves can be picked up and submerged into a sink full of lukewarm, slightly soapy water. Swish the leaves around a bit and then turn the plant right side up to dry.

, This may sound obvious, but in fact most insect infestations can be mitigated if you are monitoring your houseplants closely enough to catch the early signs. Discolored, speckled, mottled, and chewed up leaves can indicate insect activity. Of course, you may also be able to see the insects themselves as well as their eggs, larvae, or cast off skins.

, Even if you take the precautionary steps above, you may still find yourself faced with insects in your houseplants. There are several method you can use to kill and remove insects.


Sticky traps can be used to control infestations of flying insects such as fruit flies, gnats, and winged aphids. These traps are usually yellow in appearance and can be hung near the infested houseplant.
Pruning can help control isolated insect infestations. If you notice that most of the insects are concentrated on a few leaves of a plant, prune these leaves away and throw them out.
Wash small insects away with soapy water. Small insects like aphids and mealybugs can be removed by rubbing the plant's leaves with a cloth moistened with soapy water.

, The unfortunate truth is that when a houseplant becomes badly infested with insects, it is near impossible to remove the insects and return the plant to health. In bad cases, throw the entire plant away before the insects spread to other houseplants in your home.

Perform a visual inspection and try to figure out where the entry point is.,
Check for squirrel babies (during baby season April-July).,
Purchase the appropriate Hewmain™ Squirrel Removal Kit and follow the instructions.,
Install the kit for fast and quick removal.,
Confirm and finalize the eviction.",How to Remove Squirrels Using Hewmain Removal Kits," Squirrels usually would chew through roof vents, exhaust pipes, roofline, side vents, and soffits. Check these areas first. When you find the entry hole, make note of its location.

If you can't find the hole or a part of the roof is inaccessible, check inside the attic during the day. You would usually see the light shining in through the hole on the roof.;
, If there are any babies, place them in a box and place it outside close to the entry hole (they will be reunited with their mother later), Removal Kits come with S33 one-way exit door, protective screening (16 gauge galvanized steel mesh), exit door replacement screening, zip-ties, screws, washers and instruction manual., Cover the entry hole with the protective screening. Use the screws and washers to fasten it. Cut a 3"" by 3"" hole exactly over the hole and install the one way door over it using the zip ties. You have done most of the work. Sit back and watch as the squirrels leave and cannot get back in. During baby season, place the box containing the babies’ right by the hole. This will allow the mother squirrel to find and relocate her young to a secondary den. Give it anywhere from 24 to 48 hours for the removal process to be complete., A day after you installed the kit, it should be all quite. You should not hear any scratching or running noises. This means that the squirrel has left. After you confirm the squirrel is gone, replace the one way door with the replacement screening provided. This secures the area against animal re-entry. Congratulations, you have successfully removed the nuisance squirrels without having to come in contact with them."

Use pointy tweezers.,
Disinfect the area where the tick is attached.,
Grab the tick’s head.,
Use a slow and steady motion to pull the tick backwards out of the skin.,
Clean the wound.,
Dispose of the tick.,
Think about getting the tick tested.,
Monitor the site where the tick was removed for signs of infection.",How to Remove a Deer Tick1," Household tweezers are too large and increase the chances of tearing the tick apart during removal, increasing the likelihood for the spread of Lyme disease or infection.If you do not have a pair of pointy tweezers, use a pair of household tweezers. They will work better than your fingers.
Do not use pliers. This will squish the tick and increase the likelihood of infection.;
, Before you remove it, be sure to disinfect the tick and the area surrounding it. Soak a cotton swab with a disinfectant, such as hydrogen peroxide, and apply it to the area of the bite. Applying disinfectant before removing the tick creates a sterile area and helps prevent the spread of infectious disease.

, With your pointy tweezers, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. The tick’s head is under your skin, and if it is agitated it will empty its stomach contents into your system. Therefore, the goal is to grab it by its head, and avoid squeezing the tick’s body, which will cause bacteria in its gut to squirt into the wound and possibly spread infectious disease.Getting the tick by its head will close off its throat and prevent it from regurgitating the toxins in its system into yours.

, Keep pulling straight back until the entire tick is out of the skin. Pulling too fast can cause the tick to tear, leaving the head of the tick still attached to the skin.Avoid twisting or jerking the tick.
Although it is best to removal the entire tick at once, do not be too concerned if the head breaks off. As long as the tick’s throat is closed, disease transmission will be limited.

, Rinse the wound with clean water and use an over the counter disinfectant on the area to reduce the chances of an infection. Be sure to clean off any blood or other bodily fluids, especially around the wound. Use iodine or rubbing alcohol, as well as soap and water, to clean the wound.
Do not rub too vigorously. This might irritate the bite area.

, Make sure that the tick is dead by squeezing it with the tweezers. Submerge the tick in alcohol, place it in a tissue or a plastic bag, and put it in the garbage. You can also flush it down the toilet.Avoid squeezing the tick with your fingers. This will cause the infectious contents of its stomach to spill onto your fingers.

, You may consider sending your tick to your state or local health departments for testing. This will tell you if the tick was carrying an infectious disease. However, these tests are generally not useful because they do not indicate if you are infected, just the tick. Also, if you are infected, you will probably develop symptoms before you get the tests results., If you see increased redness, pus oozing out, or feel pain, apply an antibiotic ointment or contact your doctor. It is important that you monitor your symptoms and keep an open for any complications. Write down the date you were bitten. This may help your doctor determine if you are experiencing symptoms of a tick borne illness.

Protect yourself and your family.,
Corral the bat.,
Open your doors and windows.,
Narrow the bat’s flight area.,
Secure the area once the bat leaves.",How to Remove a Bat from a Home1," Bats are not aggressive animals and most survive off of eating insects. It is not common for a bat to attack a person, but like all wild animals there is a risk that the bat could be carrying rabies or another infectious disease.Wear thick gloves if you think you may come in contact with the bat or if you are going to attempt to catch it.
Secure children and animals in a room the bat cannot access.
Avoid direct contact with the bat if possible.;
, Bats navigate using echolocation instead of sight, so the vast array of sounds in your house can make it difficult for the bat to find its way. Once the bat flies into a room with a window or door that has access the outside, seal off that room to prevent the bat from flying deeper into your house.Turn off the lights in the room and the exterior lights outside the door or window.
Turn off any television, radio, or air conditioner near the exit that might make the bat avoid the area.
Try to avoid making a lot of noises, as they will upset the bat and make it behave in less predictable ways.

, Most bats do not want to be inside your house. They’re wild animals and prefer to stay in their natural habitat. The bat is probably looking for a way out, so providing it with an exit may solve your problem.Choose one exit that you intend to direct the bat to, but open other windows too in case the bat decides to fly out one of them instead.
Use sheets with push pins to block off any doorways without doors into other rooms.

, Hold a sheet up at arm’s length to create a makeshift barrier or wall out of the sheet in front of you. If you can get a friend or family member to help this process will be easier.Move slowly toward the bat with the sheets up to limit its flying space and usher it toward the open exit.
Position yourself and your friend in a way that makes flying in any direction other than the exit difficult.
Keep closing in on the bat and the exit slowly until the bat has no choice but to fly out.

, Now that the bat has flown out of the house, close all entry points the bat may have used to enter your home. The bat is not likely to return, but if it is confused you run the risk of it returning.


Close all doors and windows you opened to create an exit.
Check the rest of the house for openings the bat may have used and seal them off.

Clear furniture.,
Vacuum your carpet thoroughly.,
Steam clean older carpets.,
Test the product.,
Spray the carpet.,
Keep away from the area while the carpet dries..,
Allow the carpet to dry completely.,
Vacuum your carpet daily.,
Wipe away spills promptly.,
Reapply Scotchgard every six months.",How to Scotchgard Carpet," Before you start cleaning your carpet, you should remove any objects in the room. This is both to allow easier access to the whole carpet and to protect your furniture from cleaning products and Scotchgard. Ask for help if you’re moving particularly heavy furniture.


If there’s furniture or other objects you can’t remove, cover them with a plastic tarp to protect them while cleaning your carpet and applying Scotchgard.;
, Slowly pass over your carpet, making sure to go in both directions. Starting at one corner of the carpet, vacuum in a straight line, going directly across the carpet. Turn and follow the line you just travelled, only in the opposite direction. Step to the side, and start a new line that just touches the line you vacuumed. Continue until you’ve cleaned the whole carpet.


This will work best if you use a rug attachment for your vacuum., Of course, a new carpet won’t need cleaning before applying Scotchgard. You can buy steam cleaners from home improvement and hardware stores, though you need to be prepared to pay up to $300. A better alternative might be renting the device instead. Some machines are smaller, with a nozzle you use to apply steam mixed with a cleaning solution to your carpet. Others are larger and are pushed along the carpet; the cleaning action is usually found at the bottom of these.


Alternatively, you can hire professional carpet cleaners to do this for you; you’ll be sure to get a deep clean with no mishaps., Before using Scotchgard on your carpet, you should always test a small inconspicuous area first. Spray a small amount of the product on a hidden area of the carpet then scrub with a white cloth. If there’s any transfer of color to the rag, avoid using Scotchgard on your carpet., Hold the can of Scotchgard upside down about two feet (61 cm) above the carpet. Push down on the button at the top of the can (now the bottom). The product should come out as a white foam. Spray it evenly over the surface of the carpet.


You don’t want to spray on too thick of a layer, just enough to cover the rug., It can take between two and six hours for the product to fully dry. If you have pets or children, you should restrict access to wherever the carpet is kept. If the carpet covers the floor of a whole room, that may mean closing the door until it’s dried.

, You’ll want to improve airflow to help the carpet dry more quickly. Try keeping windows open in the room. Turn on the ceiling fan if the room has one. Otherwise, add a standing fan., Even when protected with Scotchgard, you should regularly vacuum your carpet to keep it clean. If you find any dirt or other particles have fallen between carpet fibers, you should spot clean the carpet by vacuuming up this debris. You should also vacuum the whole carpet regularly to prevent odors and unseen dirt from accumulating., Scotchgard will prevent liquids from soaking into the carpet fibers; they’ll essentially bead on top of the fibers, making them easy to wipe away. Use a clean rag to dab and wipe away any spills.


With carpets, you typically want to avoid scrubbing or wiping liquids as this will make them soak into the carpet fibers. A Scotchgard coating will prevent liquids from sinking in, meaning you can safely wipe them away., While a Scotchgard coating is long lasting, it’s somewhat weaker than professional grade products and needs to be reapplied regularly. Foot traffic, moving furniture or excessive spills can wear down the coating further.


If you have to get your carpet professionally cleaned, you should reapply a Scotchgard coat after it’s been cleaned."

Place a drinking straw at a 45-degree angle over the tick.,
Tie a loose knot at the top or midsection of the straw.,
Slide the knot down the straw to the tick.,
Slowly tighten the knot around the tick’s head.,
Remove the straw and pull the thread upward.",How to Remove a Deer Tick2," Make sure that the straw is big enough to encircle the tick but not so big that there is too much room around it. The straw will act as a guide for the knot you will use to grab the tick.Although you can perform this operation on yourself, depending on where the tick is located, it is best to have someone help you. If you, or someone else, are unable to remove the tick, have a doctor remove it safely.

, Using either thread or dental floss, create a loose knot on your straw. Do not make it so tight that you cannot move it on the straw or so loose that it does not grab onto anything.The goal is to have a knot that can move on the straw.

, Once it has reached the tick, position the knot under the tick’s belly. This will encircle the embedded head and mouth of the tick, making it easier to remove the entire insect.Avoid tying the knot around the tick’s body. This will cause it to regurgitate its stomach contents into the wound.

, Gently and carefully pull the knot tighter. Pulling too forcefully or quickly may tear the tick. Your goal is to create a knot that closes off the tick’s throat and prevents regurgitation., Get the straw out of your way and begin pulling upwards on the tick with a steady motion. After a few moments, the tick will detach without spilling its stomach contents.Be sure to kill the tick and dispose of it.

Find the nearest doctor’s office.,
Let the doctor inject Lidocaine into the skin under the tick.,
Watch the tick detach itself.",How to Remove a Deer Tick3," If you are close to a clinical or hospital, you may want to have a doctor remove the tick using an intradermal blister. This procedure is great for cleanly removing a tick without pulling it from the skin and risking stomach regurgitation.The procedure is relatively quick and painless. However, it does involve needles, so it may not be perfect for those with needle phobias.

, This is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area. A Lidocaine filled blister will slowly begin to develop under the tick.


Lidocaine is also referred to as Xylocaine.

, Because the tick will find the Lidocaine unappealing, it will release its grip and remove itself from the bite on its own. Because it was not pulled from the wound, the tick will not have released its stomach contents into your body.Be sure to grab the tick before it runs off and finds a tastier spot on your body or attaches to someone else.
Once the tick is gone, you can squeeze the Lidocaine out of the blister or let your body break it down on its own.

Dispose of the old flooring.,
Pick up remaining nails and staples.,
Clean your work area thoroughly.,
Cut one board in half lengthwise.,
Pry up the remaining boards individually.,
Extract all nails and staples.,
Clean and store the salvaged wood.",How to Remove Hardwood Floor," Determine exactly how much flooring you need to pull up and where you’ll start. You may want to do away with the entire floor and put in a new one, or you might decide to only remove a particular section in order to have carpet, tile or laminate installed to change the layout of your floorplan. Having a clear idea in mind of how best to proceed will help you carry out the project more efficiently.Generally, it’s easiest to remove one or two central boards and work your way outward from there.
Use to tape to mark off specific boundaries and make cutting and prying more precise.;
, Use tarps to cover light fixtures, furniture, appliances and anything else that you don’t want coated in sawdust once you begin sawing. You should also remove as much clutter from the work area as possible beforehand to give yourself a maximum amount of room to work.Tack up your tarps with masking or painter’s tape that can be peeled away easily when you’re done.While it may be tempting to skip this step, it’s not recommended. Cleaning sawdust from unprotected surfaces is an exhaustive effort that will add greatly to your overall project time.

, Before you get started, make sure you’re prepared to tackle the project safely. Put on rugged work gloves to protect your hands while operating the circular saw, some protective eyewear and a breathing mask to filter out sawdust and mold. You should also make a point of wearing closed-toed shoes with thick soles, as you’ll be surrounded by loose nails and other exposed edges.Long-sleeved clothing will keep your skin from being exposed to dust and hazardous objects.
Since you’ll be spending hours kneeling to pry up the planks, a pair of knee pads can be a lifesaver., Cut across the boards perpendicularly at intervals. This will reduce them to a more manageable size and make them easier to pry up later. Run the saw in a straight line from one end of the work area to the other, then turn and continue in the opposite direction.Set the depth of the saw blade to the same thickness as the hardwood so that you don’t accidentally scar your subflooring. For instance, if your flooring is ⅝” thick, your saw guard should also be positioned at ⅝”.
Make your cuts approximately every one to two feet, and be sure to avoid sawing over the “tongue” end of the board., Wedge the tip of the pry bar underneath a section of flooring. Pull back sharply on the handle to wrench the board from its place. Assuming you’ve sawed the boards into small enough sections, they should pop right out. Repeat this process until all the flooring has been removed.Always pry up the boards in the same direction that they’re nailed down. This will help prevent cracking and splintering.
If the boards are stuck too firmly to be budged, strike the underside of the board where it meets the subflooring with a chisel to create separation., Keep a large, lined trash receptacle in your work area so that you’ll have something to drop the discarded wood fragments into as you go. This is a much safer and more organized approach than throwing everything into a loose pile. When you’re finished, the old flooring will be carted off to the dump or recycling center.


Be careful around the disposal bin, as there will likely be lots of stray nails and jagged edges exposed.

, There will likely be a few loose metal fasteners littering the floor, so be careful moving throughout your work area. You can collect these materials by hand or use a powerful handheld magnet to pick up whatever metal scraps happen to be lying around. Spent nails and staples should go straight into the trash.Protruding nails can be bent prior to disposal to make them less of a hazard.
Keep your work gloves on throughout the cleanup process in case you come into contact with any sharp objects.

, Sweep the sawdust, wood chips and other debris into small piles, then use a shop vac to suction them up. Take down the tarps, roll them up carefully and move them outside to be cleaned or thrown away. If necessary, go over the area again with a vacuum or mop to clear away any especially fine dust remaining.For deep cleaning jobs, use dust-attracting sprays and a microfiber towel to small particles.

, If your hardwood flooring is still in good condition, you may decide that it’s worth keeping and putting to use elsewhere. To successfully salvage hardwood, you’ll need to first saw one board straight down the middle along its length. After tearing out both halves of this board, you’ll have a sufficient amount of space to begin working on the others.It may be necessary to sacrifice one or two boards to put you in a position to remove the others.
Dig out a central board and work outward in both directions.

, Start at one end of the board and work your way down, keeping the tip of the pry bar positioned directly beneath the nails or staples. You’ll want to pull up on the boards rather gingerly to prevent them from splintering. Work slowly, doing your best to keep each board intact.Move the pry bar along about half a foot at a time, focusing on areas that are held down by fasteners or adhesives.
Preserving your flooring is a time consuming process, but the payoff is a fresh supply of useful hardwood.

, Once you’ve got all the boards up, go through them one at a time and ease out the fasteners that were used to secure them. The best tools for this task are a nail claw or the back of a hammer and a pair of locking pliers. Be patient—it will take a while to remove every last nail and staple.Work slowly and delicately to avoid causing unnecessary damage to the wood.
Use a handheld magnet to speed up the collection and disposal of small metal pieces., From here, you’re free to hang onto the hardwood or employ it in other projects. Wipe down each board with a damp cloth and keep them in a cool, dry environment until you’re ready to use them. If you wish, you can polish or sand and stain older wood to restore it like-new condition.Recycled wood can be used to provide flooring for another room in your home, create unique, rustic wall paneling, construct a garden footpath or any number of other projects.In some cases, you may be able to sell reclaimed wood to other companies or individuals seeking inexpensive building materials.

Remove the furniture.,
Protect the floor underneath.,
Fill the dent with ice cubes.,
Leave the dent overnight.,
Blot the area dry.,
Fluff the fibers.",How to Remove Furniture Dents from Carpet1," You can't address dents in the carpet if the furniture is still there. Move the furniture to expose the dent and either rearrange the room to find a new home for the piece, or take it out of the room while you work.


When the carpet is exposed, check the label to determine what kind of material it is.
Synthetic fibers can be fixed using the cold ice cube method. Common synthetic carpet fibers include nylon, olefin, and polyester.;
, This is important if you're removing dents from a rug or area carpet where there's a wood or other finished flor underneath. To protect the floor, place a towel, rag, or other absorbent material under the carpet where the dent is that you'll be treating., Use as many ice cubes as you need to fill the dent completely. As the ice cubes melt, the compressed carpet fibers will slowly absorb the water. The more water the fibers absorb, the fuller and more swollen they’ll become, and this will reduce the indentation.If you're removing multiple dents from the carpet, try out the method first on a dent that’s in an inconspicuous area to test the carpet for color fastness.

, Let the ice cubes melt and leave the carpet to absorb the water from the ice overnight, or for at least four hours. This will give the fibers plenty of time to swell and start regaining their original shape and plumpness., When the carpet has had several hours to absorb the water, use a clean towel to blot the wet area and absorb any excess.The carpet doesn’t have to be completely dry, but it shouldn’t be any wetter than slightly damp. Switch to a dry area of towel as necessary to keep absorbing more water.


When you’ve absorbed as much water as you can, remove the towel that’s protecting the floor underneath.

, Now that the fibers have regained their original plumpness, you can fluff them back into shape to remove all traces of the dent. Use your finger, a small coin, or a spoon to brush and fluff the carpet fibers in multiple directions so they stand up tall and straight like the rest of the fibers.You can also use a carpet brush or carpet rake to fluff the fibers and remove the dent.

Wait for the bat to land.,
Use a small box or bucket to catch the bat.,
Catch the bat in a net or blanket.",How to Remove a Bat from a Home2," Catching a moving bat can injure the bat and risk the bat biting or scratching you out of fear. Be patient and try not to make a lot of noise that scares the bat to encourage it to land.Catching a bat mid-flight can injure the bat or cause it to panic and attempt to bite you.
Waiting for the bat to land provides you with the safest opportunity to catch it for both you and the bat.

, Once a bat lands and is stationary, use a bucket, box or similar container to trap the bat. Find a container with a larger inside diameter than the bat is taking up in its stationary position to avoid injuring the bat by crushing a wing or ear.Approach the bat slowly and quietly then quickly place the container over the bat so that it cannot escape.
Slide a piece of cardboard or container lid under the container slowly and gently to enclose the bat within the container and lid.
Carry the container outside and release the bat back into your yard. While it is preferable that you release a bat after nightfall, you should not keep the bat contained until then if you catch one during the day.

, Another viable way to catch the bat is to use a decent sized cloth or net to capture the bat once it has landed. Depending on the thickness of the cloth or net, this method may involve more direct contact with the bat.Approach the bat slowly with the cloth or net in front of you.
Place the net or cloth over the bat rapidly to avoid giving it an opportunity to fly away.
The net may trap the bat immediately. If you are using a cloth towel or blanket, place it over the bat, then gently wrap the bat up with it.
Carry the bat outdoors while still in the net or cloth, then release it. It is better for the bat if you release it after nightfall, but you should not keep the bat contained until evening if you capture it during the day.

Inspect the situation.,
Seal off all but the main entrance and exit.,
Set up a one-way exclusion device.,
Make your own exclusion device.,
Seal off the exclusion device exit.,
Clean up the area the bats resided in.",How to Remove a Bat from a Home3," You will need to identify where the bats are getting in and out of your house in order to prevent them from returning once you have removed them. Bats often roost in attics, so look for gaps in the siding of your home, open windows or cracks.Many attics in older homes have gaps in the wood that are small enough for bats to crawl through, inspect the areas carefully as it takes very little space for a bat to get in.
Make sure traditional openings like windows and grain doors in barns are closed securely.

, Once you have identified the different places the bats have been accessing your house from, seal off all but one of them. Try to keep their “main” point of entry open.Determine the bat’s most highly trafficked point of entry by how much of the bat’s droppings you find in the area of the entry point.
The other holes and gaps can be as small as a half inch and can easily be filled with caulk or sealed off with a piece of wood.

, Exclusion devices allow bats to exit your house in the evening just like normal, but prevents them from being able to come back in. There are a number of different types of exclusion devices you can make or that are available for purchase.Netting and screens can serve as exclusion devices if you position them in a way that makes it easy to crawl out of, but low enough that it would be difficult for a bat in flight to find the opening again.
Funnels and “bat cones” narrow the entrance so significantly that it makes it difficult for bats to gain access to the funnel again while in flight.
Exclusion devices can be bought at the store if you would rather not attempt to construct one yourself., While you can purchase a variety of exclusion devices to help you remove the bats from your home, you can also create your own fairly easily with some screen and thumbtacks or a staple gun.Place the screen over the primary entrance and exit for the bats, with the screen flat against the side of your house but tented up a bit in the middle over the hole.
Narrow the tented space in the screen down to a point about an inch wide at the bottom so the screen resembles a funnel from the top of the entrance to the narrow hole in the bottom.
Bats will crawl out through the opening at the bottom of the screen, but be unable to grip and crawl back up to the entrance.

, After the bats are all out of your house, you will need to seal the main entrance that you had placed the exclusion device on to make sure no bats find their way back into your home.Bats have fairly long life spans and good memories, so they will attempt to re-enter your home if it is not properly sealed.
Bats are not good at chewing or clawing through barriers, so as long as you seal the entrance they won’t likely be able to re-enter.

, Once the area is secure and the bats have vacated, you should make sure to clean up all bat droppings in your house. Bat droppings and urine can create issues for you and your family.Large amounts of bat droppings can cause wood to rot, compromising the integrity of your home.
Bat droppings can lead to mold.
Clean up bat droppings using a vacuum and all-purpose cleaner. Make sure to wash your hands when you are done.

Expose the dents.,
Protect the floor.,
Apply steam to the area.,
Apply more direct heat for stubborn dents.,
Dry and fluff the fibers.",How to Remove Furniture Dents from Carpet2," If the furniture that caused the dents is still covering them, remove the furniture so you can address the dents. When the carpet is free, check the care label to determine what type of fiber the carpet is made from.


Dents in natural-fiber carpets are best removed with steam.
Common natural fibers for carpets include wool, sisal, and cotton., The best way to remove dents from natural fibers is with steam and heat, but this can damage the floor underneath if the floor is finished. To protect the floor under the carpet or rug, place a towel or other absorbent material between the carpet and the floor.

, Fill a steam iron with water. Turn the iron to the highest setting and allow it to heat up. Hold the iron 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) over the carpet and apply a steady jet of steam to the affected area. Continue applying steam until the carpet is moist and hot.Use a spray bottle to moisten the dent with water if you don’t have a steam iron. Then, use a blow dryer on the hottest setting to heat the area and steam the carpet. Hold the blow dryer 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the carpet, and run the blow dryer until the carpet is hot., Soak a tea towel with water and wring out as much excess as possible. Lay the damp towel over the dent. Turn an iron to the medium setting and let it heat up. Place the iron on the towel and apply gentle pressure as you run the iron over the towel for a minute.Remove the iron. Leave the towel to dry in place over the dent.

, Use a clean towel to blot the carpet dry. To return the plumped fibers to their natural shape and position, use your fingers, a brush, spoon, or carpet rake to fluff and brush the fibers. As you fluff, the dent will disappear."

Consult your veterinarian.",How to Remove Cat Urine from Wood Floors," If the urine is fresh use an absorbent cloth and blot away any wetness. Use adequate pressure to soak up the moisture. If needed, use several cloths so you can get as much of the substance from the floor.


You can also use absorbent paper towels but use enough to dry the areas as thoroughly as possible.
Keep rags handy until your cat no longer pees outside of his litter box.;
, There are a number of chemical cleaners on the market and it is best to research what chemicals will work best depending on the type of wood and the severity of the damage. Test the product on a very small and hidden area of your wooden flooring before tackling all the stained areas because it’s best to be sure that the product is safe for your floor’s finish., Some products including Nature’s Miracle and Urine Gone are recommended by some sites because the latter removes the odor and prevents pets from peeing in the same place, but does leave a musty scent behind unless cleaned up afterwards., Moisten a rag or paper towels thoroughly with the hydrogen peroxide mixture. Cover the stained area with the moistened paper towel or rag.Let the peroxide sit on the stain for a couple of hours or over night depending on the severity of the stain.Ensure that the rags or paper towels don't dry out. Check the area every so often and apply more peroxide regularly as you see fit. You can also cover the stain with plastic, creating a seal by taping down the edges.After several hours, remove any excess liquid with an absorbent material like baking soda or cat litter. First, remove the paper towels then cover the area. Look for products that will remove both moisture and odors like baking soda or cat litter.Once all the moisture and odor had been absorbed, scrape away the material or baking soda and let the area dry.,


For smaller stains, make sure to pour the peroxide only on the stain, checking it every ten minutes, and wiping up the excess as soon as the stain is gone., This bleach is made up of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide. This type of bleach will remove all color variations in the wood, which is the downside to the two-part peroxide bleach.


Two-part bleach has very specific instructions. The two components are to be mixed together so always read the manufacturer's warnings and instructions as these chemicals are very strong. It is best to wear rubber gloves and safety goggles to do the job and to keep your home ventilated.

, Vinegar neutralizes ammonia that creates the odor from your cat's urine. It is also better for the environment relative to stronger chemical compounds.

, Old urine may have been absorbed into the wood so the damage and odor may be removed by sanding down and refinishing your floor. Sand the floor and apply touch up wood floor stain using a paint brush.Consult a professional regarding what type of sandpaper to use depending on the type of wood and the degree to which the urine has been absorbed.
Use a wood floor stain that is the grain of your wood floor.Contact the company that sold you your floor because they often offer finish “touch up pens” that allow you to restore the level of detail that you want.Consider applying another coat of sealer to your floors once you have cleaned and resealed it to prevent further accidents from getting trapped into the subfloor., It may take several tries to fully remove the stain.If you smell urine but can’t find its source, try using a black light. Sometimes the urine is trapped so deep into the subfloor that it can't be removed without replacing your floor. If you do decide to replace your floor, seal the surface well.Apply an odor remover that you can find in pet stores. Look for one that has enzymes in it to attack any remaining bacteria.Be sure all the odor is gone so the smell doesn’t draw your cat back to that same spot., Cats pee for two reasons: to mark their territory with a general splatter or to clear waste with a large puddle.When cats eliminate waste they look for flat horizontal surfaces, that’s why floors are a perfect target.


Provide separate living areas if you are in a multi-cat household., Cats will urinate more when marking their territory when they feel the need to get possessive. When cats mark their territory they will lift up their tail and usually spray vertical spaces like walls.Cats will mark their territory to give other cats information like the right time to mate. Getting your cat spayed/castrated (neutered) may help this problem.Close windows, blinds, and doors so your indoor cat doesn't see other cats and become threatened, otherwise they may begin marking their territory.Be vigilant especially if your cat is in new surroundings. Address the urination before it becomes normal behaviour.Attach a motion-detection device to your lawn sprinkler and place is close to your windows or doors to prevent other cats in the neighborhood from getting too close to your home., Cats are naturally very clean and picky so providing a clean and comfortable litter box is key to preventing them from peeing on your floor. A litter box should be about 1 ½ times the length of your cat.They should have enough room to turn around once done their business.


Don’t use a covered litter box. A covered litter box will make your cat feel confined and will keep the odor within the box because it does not let air in to dry the soiled litter.In a multi-cat house it also limits a cat from having escape potential if confronted by another cat. This is integral because a cat may avoid a covered litter box if it feels it will be ambushed while inside.Make sure the sides of the litter box are not too high for your cat to easily step over. This is especially important if your cat has gotten on in years., So remember the equation one cat=2 boxes, 3 cats=4 boxes, and so on.


If you are in a multi-floor home you should have a litter box on each floor. Think about it, if you were on the fifth floor would you want to have to go all the way down to the first floor to pee?

, Make sure your litter box is at a convenient location for your cat’s needs. Just because it may fit your decorating needs, does not mean your cat will adjust to you. If your cat is peeing in the same spot, it may be wise to place the litter box there and gradually move it back to the spot that you want.Choose a location that is secure and convenient for your cat. Don’t place it near food, in a damp basement, in a closet or close to an appliance that will scare your cat.In a multi-cat home, spread boxes around the home making sure not to place them in a line in a single room because you don’t want a cat avoiding his litter box to avoid another cat.Place a box in each cat’s preferred area.
Make sure there is a litter box for every cat in your home and add one extra. If you have just one cat but live in a home with multiple floors, have a litter box on each floor., At minimum, scoop the waste twice a day and wash out the entire box once a month. If you’re not using scoopable litter, wash out the box at least once a week.Strong-smelling household cleansers can drive your cat away from their litter box. When you clean the box use bleach that is heavily diluted in hot water or you can even use dish soap that is very diluted.Check the type of litter. Cats like unscented, sand-like substrate for the softness and ability to dig and cover up.They also do not want scented substances because their sense of smell is highly sensitive.
Studies have shown that most cats favor loose, clumping, unscented clay litter containing activated charcoal.Make sure there is enough litter by keeping it at about 3 inches high and replenishing periodically after each cleaning.Do your research for high-tech self-cleaning litter boxes as they offer many drawbacks. These litter boxes may scare off your cat or easily clog. The main drawback is that it doesn’t allow you to monitor your cat's health as it will clean away large clumps before you have a chance to investigate., There are many factors that can cause your cat stress and avoid his litter box including moving, renovation, multiple cats, and generally any sudden change. Address these environmental factors to give your cat a sense of security and comfort in his own territory.Observe the social dynamics in a multi-cat home. Conflicts may cause inappropriate urination especially if they occur close to the litter box allowing one of the cats to associate it with bad memories.Do not punish your cat for urinating outside the litter box. Punishment will not only make your cat afraid of you but will make him think that peeing will get him in trouble. You should figure out why he is peeing outside of the litter box as punishment is counterproductive., Your veterinarian will perform a physical exam and urinalysis to find out if the problem is a result of your cat’s health. Urinary tract infections and kidney problems are common issues that cause your cat to change his urination patterns.Age can also play a big factor in urination problems and the older the cat, the smellier his pee.

Open doors and windows.,
Turn on your air conditioner or heater.,
Use fans.,
Keep the area ventilated for at least 72 hours.",How to Reduce New Carpet Odor1," Ventilation is the best means to get rid of a new carpet smell. Masking the odors or using removers only does so much, as it simply takes time and airflow to get rid of the scent.Open any windows and doors you can. If you have doors or windows with screens, keep them open as often as possible.;
, If you have items like a heater or air conditioner in your home, keep them on. This will increase air ventilation. This can help eliminate the new carpet smell quicker.However, if you pay for your own utilities, be careful about running the air conditioner.

Use carpet pads.,
Move furniture regularly.,
Use cups or gliders.,
Choose carpeting with a shorter pile.",How to Remove Furniture Dents from Carpet3," Carpet pads don’t just make your carpets more comfortable to walk on, because they can also protect your carpet. When you place a heavy piece of furniture on the carpet, the pad will help absorb the weight, and help prevent dents from forming.


Carpet pads come in different thicknesses, and it’s important that you choose the right pad for the type of carpet you have.
Typically, household carpeting pads should be between ¼ inch and 7/16 inch (6.3 and 11 mm) thick, and should have a density of about 6 pounds (2.7 kg) per cubic foot (30 cm)., Furniture dents form because heavy furniture compresses the same fibers in the same way for too long. An easy way to stop this from happening is to move the furniture often so that it doesn’t sit on the fibers long enough to compress them.Move the furniture by about an inch (2.5 cm) every one to two months to stop dents from forming.


This method works best with small furniture and furniture that’s on casters.

, Furniture cups and gliders are pads that you place under furniture feet. These spread out the weight of the furniture more evenly among more fibers. That way, the furniture isn't just compressing a few fibers, so dents don’t form.Cups tend to slide under furniture feet, and don’t get attached to the actual feet.
Gliders are also designed to help furniture slide without causing scrapes. They often have sticky backs that attach to the feet, or screws or pins that get inserted into the wood.

, Carpets with shorter pile (shorter fibers) are generally easier to maintain and clean, and they aren't as dent-prone as carpets with longer pile. When it comes time to re-carpet or change your rugs, look for shorter fibers as opposed to longer and shaggier ones."

Vacuum your carpet often.,
Sprinkle baking soda on the carpet.,
Try steam cleaning.",How to Reduce New Carpet Odor2," You should always vacuum carpet frequently, even if it's not new. However, vacuuming often when you first get your carpeting may reduce the smell. Try vacuuming every day or every other day and see if this does anything to eliminate the new carpet odor.You should always vacuum new carpet right after it is installed, as there may be debris and loose fuzz on the floor that needs to be vacuumed up.

, Baking soda is great at absorbing odors in the home. If the new carpet scent is bothering you, sprinkle a layer of baking soda or a carpet deodorizer (check your local hardware store) over the carpet.Allow the baking soda to sit for one to two days. Then, vacuum it up.
If you still notice a strong scent, you may need to apply baking soda a second time.

, If the smell does not seem to go away with other methods, you can try steam cleaning. You can try renting a steam cleaner and using it yourself. You can also pay for professional steam cleaning.Keep in mind, this should only be used as a last resort. Steam cleaning can be expensive and it does not really require steam cleaning for reasons beyond the smell.

Do not use detergents to remove the new scent.,
Try a carpet that's VOC-free if you're sensitive to smells.,
Avoid masking the odor with food.,
Have patience.",How to Reduce New Carpet Odor3," Detergents should not be used on carpeting in general and are especially unnecessary on new carpeting. Detergents tend to leave behind residue that can damage carpeting. Avoid removing smell via detergents., Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) produce a lot of new carpet smell. Some people are very sensitive to VOC's and may have respiratory problems in response to new carpeting. If your health is affected by the smell of new carpeting, go for a VOC-free carpet., Cooking smells are easily absorbed into the carpeting. While this can mask the odor of new carpeting, it's hard to get the scent of food out of the carpet. If you use food to mask the smell, you may regret it later as your carpet will continue to smell like food for the long term., There is no way to completely eliminate new carpet odor. It simply takes a few weeks for the smell to fade. Be patient and give it time. If the new smell truly bothers you, try to stay out of the room with the new carpeting until the smell fades.You can also use some air fresheners and burn incense to mask the odor until the odor is gone.

, Vacuum floors, walls, and shelves of storage spaces at least two or three times a month to remove dust, spider webs, and any inconspicuous eggs or larvae that are hiding in corners., Any trace of adult carpet beetles, larvae, and eggs can be removed with a good washing. Carpet beetles won’t have time to sustain life on your clothing if you stay on top of washing them.Wash and air out clothes immediately after they’re removed from storage. Don’t wait to do this until after you wear the clothes or hang them in your closet because this will allow any present beetles to find a new area to thrive in.Each month, make sure that any clothes kept in your closet or dresser that you haven’t worn and washed get a good warm wash and air dry too.

, Every time you take out your trash, wipe the inside of your trash can lid with a disinfectant wipe. Once or twice a year, spray down your trash cans inside and out with a mixture of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of bleach and 24 fluid ounces (709.8 ml) of water, rinse the cans thoroughly with a hose, and wipe them dry with a hand towel or paper towel., Constantly be on the lookout for dead insects in the cracks of the walls and flooring of your home.Try removing dead bugs by vacuuming over them or picking them up with a paper towel. Cracks are one of the more subtle living spaces that carpet beetles can thrive within.

, Get products made of synthetic fibers instead of natural ones as often as you can. Carpet beetles don’t feed on synthetic fabric. Keep this in mind when purchasing furniture, rugs, and carpets., The longer you keep fabrics folded in a compact manner in a dark, hidden place, the more likely it is that carpet beetles will get to them. This is the kind of environment that they prefer. Avoid keeping garments, bedding, wool rugs, or upholstered furniture in storage.Instead, if you haven’t used the items in the past six months or so, consider dropping them off for donation.

Check if there is already protectant on the floors.,
Wax the floors.,
Apply a protective seal to the floors.,
Consult with a professional floor cleaner.",How to Protect Hardwood Floors from Salt Damage1," Some hardwood floors have already been covered with a protectant that will protect it from salt damage. Contact your contractor to determine if the hardwood floors have a protectant already. Most hardwood floors have a surface finish, often made of polyurethane. This gives the wood a glossy, almost plastic looking finish. It will protect the top layer of wood from salt damage.Some hardwood floors have penetrating seals, made of oils and waxes. They will have a satin or matte looking finish.;
, If your hardwood floors have a penetrating seal, you can try waxing the floors for even more protection. Use floor polish or wax to create an extra buffer against scratches, grime, and salt.Do not wax your hardwood floors if they have a surface finish, as this can be bad for the wood.

, If your hardwood does not have a protectant already on it, make sure you apply a polyurethane sealant or varnish. Check that the product is safe for use on hardwood floors before you apply it., If you are nervous about putting protectant on your hardwood yourself, talk to a professional floor cleaner about doing this. Look for a professional floor cleaner in your area who has experience working with hardwood floors. The professional should be able to suggest a protectant that will work well on your floors.You should also check your warranty for the hardwood floors to see if it covers applying protectant to the floors. If so, use the warranty to get a professional to apply the protectant for you.

Store fabrics in tightly sealed plastic.,
Store fabric in a cedar-lined chest or closet.,
Seal holes and cracks in storage containers.,
Secure window screens and air vents.,
Hang sticky fly paper near windows and other potential entrances.",How to Prevent Carpet Beetles2," Especially if your closet frequently goes untouched and sees little sunlight, opt to put less used clothing into tightly sealed plastic bags. Use of plastic bags will reduce your chances of attracting any carpet beetles by creating a barrier., Initially, the oils in cedar help to deter carpet beetles. Unfortunately, this can only serve as a preventative tool for a few years because the wood will dry out and no longer be as powerful. This is a good short-term action to take, and is most effective when the chest or closet has the ability to be sealed well.You can also hang your clothes on cedar hangers to discourage carpet beetles.
Other cedar products such as cedar oils, chips, and repellent balls can also be beneficial but are usually only effective with killing or deterring larvae.

, Make sure that whatever you’re using to store your clothing has no openings whatsoever, whether you’re using plastic bags, garment bags, trunks, or boxes. Cover the cracks, tears, and holes with a durable tape, such as duct tape., Keep all small entrances to your home as sealed and secured as possible. Repair or replace any damaged or torn screens that you currently have, and make sure that your screens are made of a fine mesh. Use caulk along the outside edges of air vents to seal them securely.These security measures will prevent beetles from flying in from outside., Use fly paper near doorways and windowsills to catch any carpet beetles that attempt to enter your home. The beetles will stick to the paper and will die as a result of being unable to escape."

Inspect dark, secluded areas of your home for molted skins.,
Dispose of heavily infested items.,
Spray or dust your carpet and furniture with an insecticide.,
Store clothes and fabrics with resin strips or moth repellent.",How to Prevent Carpet Beetles3," If you’re suspicious or just want to be proactive, search through rarely lit, less trafficked areas of your home for fecal matter and most importantly, molted larvae skins.Larvae are commonly the ones who cause the most damage, and molted skins, identifiable by their translucent golden color and bug-like shape, are a strong sign that they’re present., If you can part ways with the items that were just infested, it’s probably best to do so. With keeping an item that was previously highly infested, you run the risk of reintroducing any remaining carpet beetles to your carpet and clothes., There are many different types of carpet treatment products that you can buy. Make sure that whatever spray or dust you’re applying is for killing carpet beetles specifically, and check the label of chemical insecticides to make sure that the product contains chlorpyrifos, bendiocarb, and allethrin in order to ensure eradication success.Chemical insecticides may be harmful to other animals, so if you have any pets make sure to secure them in a location away from where the insecticide is sprayed or dusted.
Spread boric acid all over your carpet and upholstered furniture, and make sure to vacuum it up within two hours of laying it down. While it is lethal for beetles, boric acid isn’t powerful enough to harm humans.Dehydrate carpet beetles with diatomaceous earth. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth on pet beds and in the back of cabinets and closets. It’s safe for pets and humans, but you’ll need to wear a respirator or mask while applying to keep yourself from inhaling the particles.Many common household pesticides that kill ants and roaches will also kill carpet beetles, or simply limit their food supply. Spray the product in corners of closets, on window ledges, and in any crevices that could potentially house carpet beetles., Because resin strips contain an active ingredient called dichlorvos, they are effective in protecting your fabrics for an extended period of time.Vapors of moth repellent are lethal for fabric pests if they are maintained at high concentrations for an extended period of time. Keep your resin strips or moth repellent in a tightly sealed container along with your clothing for two to three weeks for the best results.

Clean the hardwood floors at least once a week.,
Put floor mats down by the door.,
Have people take off their shoes inside.,
Keep towels nearby to wipe up water and salt.",How to Protect Hardwood Floors from Salt Damage2," Adopt a regular cleaning schedule for the floors. Sweep the floors or vacuum them with the brush attachment. Wipe down the floors with a damp (but not soaking wet) mop. Do not let water pool on the floors as you clean. Make sure you dry the floors well at the end of every clean.Try to get into the habit of cleaning the hardwood floors at least once a week. Doing this will ensure dirt, grime, and salt do not damage the floors.
Do not use too much water to clean your hardwood floors, even if they have a sealant. A damp but not soaking wet wipe, swiffer, or mop works fine.

, One of the major ways salt can get onto your floors is if it is tracked through your home on dirty shoes. This is a common problem in winter in areas that put salt on the snow, as the salt then gets onto the bottom of people’s shoes. Place floor mats by your doors so shoes that have salt on them do not make contact with the hardwood floors.Get waterproof or water resistant mats so the water and salt do not soak through the mats onto the floor.
You may also lay towels over the mat so you can throw the towels in the wash later without having to move the mat.
If possible, you may want to install a different type of flooring at the door, such as tile.

, To avoid salt from shoes on your floors, have a “no shoes inside” policy. Ask guests to take off their shoes and leave them by the door. Remind people you live with to take off their shoes before coming inside.You may keep slippers by the door for guests who do not want to walk around your home barefoot. This way, your floor is still protected and your guests feel comfortable.

, Stock a few clean towels by the door so you use them to wipe up any water or salt on your floors. Never let water sit on your hardwood floors, as it can warp the wood. Salt sitting on the floors can also cause damage.Try having a towel basket or bin by the front door so towels are always handy in the event you need to wipe up a spill or salt on the floors.

Look for a key ring the size of a penny.,
Secure the key ring to the loop on your zipper slider.,
Loop the key ring to the top button on your pants.,
Zip up your pants and button them.",How to Stop a Zipper from Unzipping Itself1," To fix your loose zipper, you can use a small metal key ring, about the size of a penny. Look for a key ring that is thin and durable.You can also use a small rubber band if you are looking for a flexible option. A rubber band can be good if your zipper tends to unzip itself and get stuck mid way on the zipper. The band can stretch enough to allow you to attach the zipper slider to the top button of your pants.;
, Slide the key ring through the hole in the zipper slider, usually located on the end of the slider. Make sure the key ring is secure on the zipper slider once it is attached.If you are using a rubber band, you can put the rubber band through the hole in the zipper slider and then loop the top part of the band through the section on the zipper slider to form a knot. You should have a knot with a long section of the band loose at the top of the zipper slider.

, Once the key ring is attached to the zipper slider, loop it over the top button of your pants.If you are using a rubber band, grip the long section of the rubber band and loop it over the top button on your pants.
If you are trying to fix another garment with a zipper besides a pair of pants, loop the key ring or rubber band over the top button on the garment, such as the top button on a dress or a skirt. Keep in mind this method looks better on dresses or skirts that have hidden zippers, as the key ring or rubber band will show if the zipper is exposed.

, Keeping the key chain or rubber band in place over the top button, zip up the garment. Then, button up the garment with the top button. Make sure the top flap by the button covers the top of the zipper as well as the key chain or rubber band. Your zipper should stay in place with the help of the key chain or rubber band.Remember to be careful when going to the bathroom, as you will need to remove the top button and then the key ring to take off your clothing.

Gather your supplies.,
Unzip the garment and locate the zipper stop.,
Use end nippers to remove the zipper stop.,
Slide the damaged zipper slider off the zipper.,
Put on the new zipper stop.",How to Stop a Zipper from Unzipping Itself2," If your zipper keeps unzipping itself, the zipper slider may be broken and need to be replaced. You can do this at home with a few supplies, including:End nippers. These can be found at your local hardware store and can be used to cut nails, wires, and zipper stops.
Tweezers.
Small pliers.
A replacement zipper slider, which you can buy at your local craft or fabric store. Be sure to get a replacement coil zipper slider if you have a coil zipper and a plastic tooth zipper slider if you have a plastic tooth zipper. Coil zippers are made of tight coil and plastic tooth zippers are made of plastic.A replacement zipper stop. Zipper stops can be made of metal (for coil zipper sliders) or plastic (for plastic tooth zippers).

, The zipper stop will be the small piece that is used to connect the zipper slider to the zipper teeth. Peel back any fabric that is covering the zipper stop and place your thumb and forefinger on the top of the zipper stop, on the side with the slider., Make sure you cut the plastic or metal stop only. Do not damage the webbing behind the stop as this could then damage the zipper.Once you cut and remove the zipper stop, use a pair of tweezers to get rid of any remaining pieces of the zipper stop. Make sure all of the zipper stop has been completely removed from the zipper teeth.

, Once the zipper stop is removed, you can slide the damaged zipper slider off the zipper. Then, replace it with the replacement zipper slider. You may need to tug the replacement over the old zipper stop gently.Make sure the zipper slider is facing right side up when you slide it on the zipper. The zipper slider should move easily up and down the zipper once it is attached.

, Use tweezers to hold the new zipper stop. Then, insert the teeth on one end of the zipper stop into the webbing on the zipper, right where the old zipper stop used to be.Take the pliers and bend the top of the zipper stop around the edge of the webbing. The single tooth on the stop should go through the back part of the webbing.
Use the pliers to crimp the stop into place. Try out your new zipper, making sure it runs smoothly and does not unzip on it’s own.

Close all zippers before putting your clothes in the wash. To keep your zippers in good shape, you should make sure all the zippers on your clothes are closed before you throw them in the wash. Do up zippers on your pants, your shirts, your skirts, your dresses and your shorts.To make sure the zippers stay closed, you can use safety pins.,
Dry clothing with zippers on low heat.,
Expect some puckering around the zipper.",How to Stop a Zipper from Unzipping Itself3," Loop the safety pin through the zipper slider and attach it to the top of the garment so the zipper stays closed in the washing machine and the dryer.

, High heat can be damaging to zippers, especially zippers made of plastic. Dry clothing with zippers on low heat and minimize the amount of time the clothing is in the dryer. The tumbling of the dryer can cause damage to certain zippers.You should also take clothing with zippers out of the dyer right after the drying cycle is done so you can lay them flat. Straightening out the clothing and the zipper on a flat surface will prevent the zipper from drying with crooked teeth. This could prevent zipper jams and other issues down the road.

, Don’t worry too much if there is puckering around zipper after it has been through the wash. Most clothing will shrink a little in the wash and this could cause puckering around the zipper. The puckering is usually not too obvious, depending on the material of the clothing and the material in the zipper.Clothing made with 100 percent cotton is especially prone to shrinkage, which can cause noticeable puckering around the cotton-polyester zipper tabs. You may want to hang dry clothing made of cotton and other materials that are prone to shrinkage, rather than run them through the dryer.

Designate laundry containers.,
Choose one for whites.,
Pick one for lights.,
Select one for darks.",How to Sort Laundry by Colors1," You’ll want three to six laundry baskets, bags, or hampers. The number will depend on the colors in your wardrobe: separating by whites, lights, and darks is a must, but you could also add one for bright colors such as reds and oranges, one for delicate items, or even one for just denim items. Put items in their designated container as soon as you remove them.;
, This basket or container will be for white clothing only. This means clothing that is pure white; it should not contain any designs, labels, insignias, or patterns. These items can be bleached with chlorine bleach since they do not contain any other colors. Wash white clothing in hot water, and dry at a high temperature., Add light-colored clothing only to this basket. Put white items with labels or designs in this container, as well as other light-colored items such as khakis or pastel items. Wash light-colored clothing in warm water, and dry them at a warm temperature., Dark clothing includes jeans as well as black, dark gray, blue, and purple items. Depending on the colors in your wardrobe and the way you choose to sort, red and orange items could be added to the dark container as well. Dark-colored laundry should be washed in cold water, and dried at a low temperature."

Check each item.,
Separate by color.,
Sort by fabric weight.,
Assign very soiled clothes to another pile.,
Create sub-categories.,
Strategize your sorting.,
Invest in a laundry sorter.,
Make your own laundry sorter.,
Use lingerie bags.,
Combine loads whenever possible.",How to Sort Laundry," If your laundry is in a giant pile, it’s a good idea to check each item as you sort it. This gives you a chance to make sure that a red sock doesn’t end up coloring your beautiful whites and see if articles have special laundering instructions.


Make sure to read the care instructions on each article of clothing the first time you wash it. Look at it again during the sorting process in case you forgot the care instructions or to see if you can put the item with other articles.
Consider checking each item you’ve sorted as you put it into the washing machine to prevent mishaps.;
, The first category by which you should sort is color of the items. This can prevent dye transfer problems during washing that often ruin or damage white or lighter colored clothing.Make piles for white, light, and dark clothing.Your white pile should be for articles like socks, underwear, t-shirts and other sturdy white cotton items. The light-colored pile should have colors like pink, lavender, light blue, light green, and yellow. Finally, your dark pile should have gray, black, navy, red, and purple articles.
Consider separating out denim into its own pile. You can either wash this as an individual load or together with your dark pile.

, Chances are that you have items made of different fabrics and textures. Sorting these out after you’ve put the articles in color piles can ensure everything from the quality of your delicates to preventing lint from sticking to certain fabrics.It can also help the drying process go more quickly and evenly.Put any delicates in piles by color. Delicates are items such as lingerie, pantyhose, washable silks and anything that you want to keep from harsh agitation in the washing machine.Segregate items that are “lint-givers” and “lint-receivers.” For example, you shouldn’t put towels with corduroy articles.Consider sorting out synthetics and natural fibers if you want to run another separate washing cycle. This can further prevent lint transfer.Separate out lighter and heavier weight clothing items. For example, you don’t want to have heavier cotton pants with thin t-shirts. The heavier fabric can damage lighter and more delicate articles by scratching during washing., If you have articles that are very soiled or stained, consider assigning them to a separate pile altogether. These items may require pre-treating stains or washing on a specialty cycle that is too harsh for other articles. In addition, it prevents soils or stains from redepositing on less dirty articles.Pretreat any stains or soils with a stain remover before putting it in washing machine. This can prevent further transfer or redepositing of stains.

, If you’re committed to washing your clothing and other articles in the most effective way, you may want to consider creating sub-categories as separate cycles. For example, items like towels and bedding are often heavier than articles of clothing while newborn or baby clothes are light colors. Creating these type of sub-categories can further protect your clothing and other articles from damage., Although it might sound like a lot of work, sorting doesn’t have to be. Consider sorting a part of your regular laundry routine. Depending on how often you do laundry, you can either sort as you put them into a hamper or do it immediately before you throw items in the washing machine.


Presort laundry as you throw it into the hamper if you do multiple loads per week. If you only do one or two loads per week or are just one person, it may be easier and more time efficient to sort before putting the clothes into your washing machine., If you do multiple loads of laundry a week or want to make loading different types of articles easier, get a laundry sorter at a local home store. This can speed up and simply the sorting and washing process.Figure out exactly what how many categories of laundry you are doing before you purchase a laundry sorter. For example, you might want a sorter with different sections for whites, lights, and darks.
Purchase your sorter or divided hamper at a local home store. Get a sorter that has as many compartments as you need. Most stores will have options with anywhere from two sections to six or seven.

, If you don’t want to spend money on a laundry sorter or divided hamper, you can fashion one by using items around your home. Homemade sorters are as effective as store bought products in easier the process of doing laundry.


Use items you have around the house such as boxes, shopping bags, or bins as hampers. Have one for each load of separate laundry you plan to wash.
Purchase individual hampers at a local home store. You can set these on the floor of your laundry room with an individual label for each hamper. Another option is to purchase separate hampers in white, a light shade, and a dark color. You may also want to have a “right away” hamper for items that need immediate attention.These can guide you and your family members know exactly what items go in which hamper.
Consider giving each family member a hamper for the person’s room. Although this doesn’t necessarily sort by color, fabric, or dirtiness, it can streamline your sorting process. You may want to give each person a color-coded hamper to further ease your sorting efforts.

, If you wash delicates and socks, invest in lingerie bags for each family member’s delicates and/ or socks. This can protect your delicates and keep pairs of socks from getting mismatched or lost.Make sure to keep socks and delicates in individual bags since they are often different colors and fabric weights.
Try using zippered pillowcases for delicates and socks if you don’t want to invest in lingerie bags.Pin together pairs of socks as you sort them.
Buy lingerie bags made of a simple mesh. Make sure the mesh openings don’t allow any articles to escape while washing. You can purchase these bags at most home and grocery stores.

, If you have smaller loads of laundry that need washing immediately, consider combing multiple loads into one. Washing compatible clothing types can reduce the work you have to do and save energy, water, and detergent.


Check the two loads and make sure they’re compatible. For example, you wouldn’t want to wash delicates and jeans. However, you could wash jeans with darker towels since they are both heavier fabrics.
Remove any articles that are different fabric or require different laundering. For example, if you have jeans mixed in with dark colors, remove any t-shirts or lighter items from a load of jeans and dark towels.

Try making a duct tape trap.,
Get a roll of duct tape.,
Choose your bait.,
Set the bait.,
Set up your trap.,
Wait.",How to Trap Cockroaches1," The premise of this strategy is simple: you'll need bait to attract the cockroaches, and adhesive to keep them there. This trap can be difficult to move once you have set it, but it is a simple trick, and you may yield a high reward for relatively little effort.


You can also find adhesive-based traps, if you prefer to buy them. Look at home-and-garden stores, or ask your local exterminators for advice.;
, Make sure that the tape is fresh and sticky – otherwise the roaches may be able to easily struggle out and escape. You can use alternatives to duct tape, but make sure that they are powerfully adhesive. Scotch tape will not do, nor masking tape; your trap must be able to hold the cockroaches until you are able to remove them from your home.

, Anything with a powerfully sweet or oily smell will work. Onion is a common choice, although you can use anything fragrant. Try using small strip of fresh banana peel or sweet, overripe fruit. Consider using a small piece of bread.If you have noticed the cockroaches in your house being particularly attracted to any given food item, try using that as bait.


If you wish to outright kill the cockroaches, you can buy gel baits spiked with active ingredients that poison the insects. Bear in mind, however, that these are not always attractive to roaches, and that they may not be as effective as advertised.Contact a local home-and-garden store or pest-control center.
Make sure to only use a small portion of your chosen bait. If the bait spills over the edge of the tape, there will be little motivation for cockroaches to get themselves stuck. Slice the onion, fruit, or other food into a small but substantial chunk.

, Place the fruit, onion, bread, etc. in the middle of a length of your sticky tape. Make sure that it is stable, and that it will not fall over.

, Leave the tape in an area where you've been finding a lot of cockroaches: a kitchen, perhaps, or a dark corner, or near a hole in the wall. Bear in mind that you will need to decide what to do with these cockroaches afterward – they will be stuck to the tape, helpless, and you will need to find a way to remove them or dispose of them without setting them free.


Try putting the trap in a high place – like the top of your kitchen cabinets, or the top of your fridge. Roaches like to scurry in high places., Cockroaches love the dark, and they tend to do most of their foraging at night. Leave the tape where it is overnight, and do not disturb it until the morning. When you check the trap at the end of the night, you should find a lot of cockroaches on it. To dispose of the cockroaches, you can either kill them or release them humanely.


To release the cockroaches humanely, pick up the duct tape and take it outside. Bring it at least 100 feet from your home, then shake off the roaches and throw away the tape. If you don't want to pick up the trap with your bare hands, wear gloves or use a dustbin. Alternately, place a box over the tape to enclose the trap, then side a piece of paper underneath to hold the roaches in place while you bring them outside.
If you're going to kill the cockroaches, you can simply throw away the duct tape with roaches attached. Make sure to close up the bag or bin once the insects are inside – otherwise they may crawl out, rendering your efforts useless!

Use a separate container for brights.,
Separate your jeans.,
Set aside delicates.",How to Sort Laundry by Colors2," Bright colored clothing includes reds, pinks, and oranges. These items are the most likely to bleed when washing, so it is a good idea to wash them separately from other items. Bright-colored laundry should be washed in cold water, and dried at a low temperature., Denim often bleeds when washing it, especially the first few times. The fabric is also heavier than many other clothing items. You can wash denim items separately from your other clothing to ensure there is no dye transfer, and dry them together to prevent other items from being heated too long. Washing your jeans inside out also helps preserve the color as well as clean the dirtiest part: the inside., Delicate items may include clothing with special trim, beading, sequins, or lace, as well as underwear, bras, or nightgowns. These items should be washed separately from your other clothes, and be sure to check the labels before putting them in the washer or dryer. You may need to hand wash these items and hang them up or lay them flat to dry."

Isolate cotton fabrics.,
Separate linens.,
Keep acrylic, polyester, and nylon together.",How to Sort Laundry by Colors3," Cotton is thinner than many other fabrics, meaning it does not need to dry as long. Washing and drying cotton items together will prevent the fabric from being over-stressed, as all your items should be dry at the same time. Cotton can also withstand higher temperatures than other fabrics, and can be washed in hot water and dried at a high temperature., Linen fabric is often more absorbent as well as more delicate than other kinds of clothing. Washing linen items together will ensure your clothing stays in good condition. Wash and dry linen fabrics at low temperatures to avoid shrinkage., These fabrics are synthetic and can be washed and dried together. Synthetic fabrics such as acrylic, polyester, and nylon are pretty durable and can be washed and dried at high temperatures. Remember to turn the temp down if these items are dark in color though, as lower heat helps keep the color from fading."

Try trapping cockroaches inside a jar.,
Give the cockroaches a way to climb into the jar.,
Make the inside of the jar slippery.,
Bait the trap.,
Set the trap.,
Empty the trap.",How to Trap Cockroaches2," This model is safe for children and pets, and it is easier to move than a duct tape strip. Find a quart-size mason jar that has a very slight bottleneck, like a mayonnaise or spaghetti sauce jar.

, Wrap masking or duct tape (sticky-side facing the jar) all around the outer surface so the cockroaches have enough traction to climb up the sides. Alternately, place the jar near a small ramp or rim so that cockroaches can easily find their way inside.

, Coat the inside with petroleum jelly (like Vaseline), at least four inches down from the top. This way, the cockroaches won't be able to get any traction when they try to climb back out of the jar. Consider mixing the petroleum jelly with gel bait to kill the cockroaches on contact – but bear in mind that gel bait is prone to drying out. A healthy increment of petroleum jelly with retain its oily moisture for as long as you need to catch your roaches.

, Put something smelly in the bottom of the jar to attract the cockroaches. A piece of banana peel or fragrant, overripe fruit works well, and some people advocate the use of onion slices. Make sure that the bait is not so large that the roaches can use it to climb out of the jar!


Try pouring a bit of beer or red wine into the bottom of the jar – just enough to drown the roaches. Fruit juices, sweet sodas, and sugar water may also work well. These sweetly-scented beverages will attract the roaches, then trap them forever., Place the jar anywhere that you have a roach problem, and make sure that there is room on the sides for the roaches to crawl into the jar. The idea is that the roaches will climb up and fall into the jar, where they can't get out.


Try leaving the jar in an enclosed space, like a closet, a garage, or a stuffy corner. The cloying smell of the bait will fill the air and draw hungry cockroaches into your trap.

, Leave the jar out overnight—or even for several days—until it has collected a good few roaches. Eventually, pour some boiling water into the jar to kill any surviving roaches. Flush them down the toilet or put them into a compost bin.Set the trap again to make sure that you've solved your roach problem. Recharge the jar with more petroleum jelly and a new piece of bait. Repeat as needed.

Try baiting cockroaches with a red wine bottle.,
Smear some cooking oil all around the inside of the top of the bottle.,
Set the trap.,
Dispose of the roaches.",How to Trap Cockroaches3," First, find a near-empty bottle. The glass or container design is very important however (tall, cylindrical containers, narrow-mouthed bottles, etc), as it should prevent the cockroaches from climbing out of it. Any tall bottle with a narrow neck will do. It will need to have a few teaspoons of wine left in it.If it is a dry red wine, add a quarter teaspoon of sugar and swish it around.
If you don't want to use alcohol, try some sugar and water with a bit of fruit, or just experiment. Boil the water first and let it cool to stop the concoction from going moldy before it has done its work on the cockroaches.

, This will make a slippery slide to the bottom of the bottle.


Alternately, use a pipe cleaner or another long-handled brushing tool to spread petroleum jelly inside the bottle, just below the neck. This will make it difficult for fallen cockroaches to gain traction when climbing back up.

, Place the wine bottle in a spot where you have seen some cockroaches: near the compost heap, for instance, or in a dark corner of your kitchen. Leave it out for at least one night. Bear in mind that it may take a couple of nights to ferment to the right composition to attract the critters.


The cockroaches are attracted to the sweet smell of wine or beer. They climb onto the top of the bottle, slip on the oil, fall into the bottom, and cannot get back out again.
Consider making a ""trail"" of spilled wine up the side of the bottle. This may help lead the cockroaches into your trap with the promise of sweeter things to come.

, When you check your trap in the morning and find cockroaches in the bottom of the bottle, carefully pour some very hot water into the bottle to kill them. Leave the hot water in the bottle for a minute or two make sure that it's worked – cockroaches are resilient creatures. Dispose of the dead roaches by pouring the hot water from the bottle into a garden, a compost heap, or a toilet bowl.


If one bottle doesn't solve your roach infestation, keep trying. You can set the trap with a new bottle every few days. Over time, the numbers of caught roaches should decline as there are fewer insects around to fall into your trap.
Try pairing the wine-bottle method with the jar method and the duct-tape method. Set up different traps in different areas of your home, then observe which works best. Consider that one trap might be catching more cockroaches due to its location or its bait type – not necessarily because of its trapping mechanism.

Snip loose strings and threads.,
Take care of pills.",How to Take Care of Your Clothes," This seems intuitive, but it more difficult than most people think. Sort laundry based on cleaning instructions, type of laundry, and color.Make sure that you are only washing dirty clothes, as unnecessary washing of clean clothes can shorter their life. Set aside any dry-clean only articles of clothing.
Group together any delicates or cold-wash only clothing.
Group towels and heavy linens.
Separate the rest of your clothes into whites and dark or colored groups.
Turn T-shirts inside out to prevent the outside from wearing out and fading.This is especially important with graphic tees.;
, Review cleaning instructions for whichever group of laundry you want to begin with. Pre-treat any stained items with a stain removing spray or pen.Add detergent and fabric softener (if desired) to the washing machine.

, Some washing machines have various preset cycles. If yours does, select the cycle that applies to your group of clothes. If yours does not, follow cleaning instructions on the tags of your clothes and follow a few guidelines.


Delicates and cold-wash only clothing need cold water and a gentle spin cycle.
Towels and linens can generally tolerate a warmer temperature and heavy spin cycle.
Whites will get cleanest using hot water, making it ideal unless any whites are not pre-shrunk.Hot water can cause some color bleeding for dark or bright colors, so use warm or cold water., This step is simple. Close the lid or door and press start! Be sure to observe the wash time - you'll want to dry your laundry quickly after washing it, lest it start to become stale.

,


Never wash the clothes marked as ‘Dry Clean Only’ at home, as these delicate clothes/ fabrics may lose their color, shine, texture or embellishments on washing.
Ones marked ‘Dry Clean First Wash’ should be given to professional cleaners the first time. Subsequently, you can wash them, using detergents meant for delicate clothes and tepid/ cold water.
Give them to professional and trusted dry cleaners for ‘petrol wash’.
Ethnic clothes like heavily embroidered Lehengas, delicate sarees and silk kimonos must not be washed/ dry cleaned frequently.

, When the washing machine is done, you'll need to get ready to dry your laundry. If you plan to use an automatic dryer some items may need to be sorted out. Bras, sports jerseys, and athletic wear are among items that often benefit from manual drying.

, If you live in a temperate climate with low humidity and available outdoor space, you'll need to decide whether you want to hang your clothes outside or use an automatic dryer. If you live in a less ideal climate or don't have space, you'll need to opt for an automatic dryer.


Hanging items to dry prevents them from shrinking. If you have the time, drying in natural sunlight and air is usually best.
Sunlight is a natural disinfectant, and drying outdoors is both eco-friendly and will save you money., If you are naturally drying your laundry outdoors, bravo! Simply check on it every few hours. If you are using an automatic dryer you will need to clean the lint filter, add a dryer sheet or two (if desired) and select your drying cycle. Start up the machine and return when it is done.


Just like you carefully selected a wash cycle, carefully select a dry cycle that is appropriate for your clothes.
Higher heat and a rougher tumble get the job done faster, but are harder on clothes.

, If you used an automatic dryer it is important to remove clothes from the dryer immediately. If you dried your clothes naturally there is less of a rush, but you shouldn't leave them out longer than necessary either.


Leaving clothes in the dryer for too long can cause them to wrinkle.
Clothes are much easier to hang and fold wrinkle-free when they are freshly dried.

, You'll want to get nice shirts, dresses, trousers, sweaters, and any other hanging clothes on a hanger and onto the rack. Be sure to use an appropriately sized hanger.


If you spot creases in your garments, try smoothing them out by hand. If the clothes are still warm this will often be successful.
If smoothing out by hand does not work, consider using a clothes iron.

, Neatly fold and store your clothes. When possible, try to fold along the seams of the garment. It is necessary to fold pants by lining up their seams and creases. If a garment is not amenable to folding, consider gently rolling the garment and storing it to ensure that it does not wrinkle. Don't pack stored clothes too tightly. , If you have clothes that you do not use often - particularly if they are in a closet - consider using pest deterrents like mothballs and dryer sheets to dispel moths. If clothes have been sitting unused for some time air them out rather than washing them again.


Washing adds wear and tear to your clothes. While necessary when clothes are dirty, unnecessary washing shortens the life of your garments., If you drop or spill an item on your clothes, dab ice water or seltzer immediately so that the stain does not set. Make sure that you dab rather than rub. Before washing spray the area with a stain pre-treatment.

, Hot sauces, grease, and food can splash and cause damage to clothes. Don't start making your favorite marinara or standing in front of your deep-fryer without an apron on.

, Rather than pulling on them and ruining more stitches, you should snip loose strings and thread as soon as possible. If the seam has already lost too many stitches, consider learning how to stitch or sew, so you can fix the small problem before it becomes a bigger one. , Proper washing and drying methods will prevent pills in the first place, but if you already have pilled clothes you can try to fix them yourself, rather than throwing the garment out.

Try a steamer.,
Vacuum your mattress.,
Pick an encasement for your mattress.,
Cover your mattress and box springs.,
Throw out the cover if it rips.,
Wash your bedding.,
Place clothes in black trash bags.,
Clean up.,
Vacuum your room.,
Use bed bug interceptors.,
Move your bed away from the wall and furniture.",How to Stop Bed Bug Bites Immediately1," One of the immediate ways to kill bed bugs is to steam them out. They cannot survive the steam, so any that you can see, you can steam. Use a handheld steamer to blow steam at the bugs. However, be warned. This solution will only kill the ones you can see, not ones buried down in crevices. Bed bugs like to hide., Strip your bed of its bedding, and store it in a double trash bag. Vacuum your mattress and box springs as best you can, including underneath both.Dealing with your mattress first is the most immediate thing you can do. Since bed bugs bite at night, you need to clear your sleeping area of bed bugs if possible by vacuuming and encasing the mattress, then isolate the bed from more bed bugs.

, The encasement should be one that is meant to keep out bed bugs. It should also be strong enough to not rip., Cover both your mattress and box springs with individual encasements. Bed bugs cannot move in and out of these casings, stopping the ones inside from biting you. The ones inside will eventually die, and the ones outside will have lost a place to hide. You should keep it on for a year., If your cover becomes torn, throw it out, and replace it. Bed bugs can move through small openings., Wash your bedding in very hot water, rinse it in hot water, as well. Then dry it on a hot setting. The hot water should kill any bed bugs in the bedding.Be sure to discard the bags the bedding was in outside, so the bed bugs aren't in your house.

, Set the bags in the sun on a hot afternoon. The heat should kill any bed bugs inside., If your room is cluttered, make sure you clean up. Clutter provides places for bed bugs to hide, so by removing the items, you reduce their chances of surviving., You can suck up a good number of bed bugs just by vacuuming thoroughly. Make sure to take the vacuum bag or contents outside once you are done vacuuming., Interceptors go under the feet of your bed. They're designed to keep bed bugs from crawling up into your bed. Commercial ones create a little moat that traps bed bugs before they can reach the bed post., If your bed touches the wall or furniture, bed bugs can still crawl in."
"
Know what the bugs look like.,
Check for bite marks.,
Find their hiding spots.,
Look for the following signs.",How to Recognize Bed Bugs," Bedbugs are tiny, oval, brown insects. They are wingless creatures with flat bodies and six legs.Though they are small, bedbugs can be seen with the naked eye; most grow to about .2 inches (.5 cm)., Bedbugs are most active at night, biting people while they are asleep.If you wake up with itchy, red spots that you didn't have before you went to bed, you might have an infestation in your home.


Bedbug bites are usually painless, but cause itching throughout the day.Unlike other types of bites, bedbug bites can appear anywhere on the body, especially areas that are exposed during sleep.
Many people mistake bedbug bites with bites from other insects like mosquitoes or spiders. In order to confirm an infestation, you must find the bugs themselves., Bedbugs usually hide in mattresses initially, because they provide easy access to human flesh. They usually spread, however, to furniture throughout the house, as well as stored items like clothing, towels, sleeping bags, and luggage.


If you think you may have bedbugs, then strip the blankets and sheets from your bed and examine your mattress and box spring for bedbugs or bedbug excrement.Check your bed as well as the area surrounding your bed. Examine clothing, books, telephones, carpets, etc. Stored items in your closet may also be infected.Bedbugs do not form nests of any kind, but usually appear in large numbers and scatter throughout the house., If you are having trouble finding or identifying the insects themselves, check for the following telltale signs that bedbugs are present:


Blood stains on your pillows or sheets.A strong, musty odor from the bedbugs' scent glands.Dark/rusty spots on sheets, clothes, and walls, which may be bedbug excrement."

Don't immediately reach for the pesticide.,
Call an exterminator.,
Know what to expect.,
Ensure the person is systematic.,
Try a heat treatment.,
Alert any management.",How to Stop Bed Bug Bites Immediately2," Pesticides are not that effective against bed bugs, so dousing your bed and room in one is not going to be that helpful., If you think you have bed bugs, the first step is to call a professional exterminator. You simply don't have the skills and tools you need to take care of the problem completely., The professional is going to need to get in and around most of your room, including headboards, baseboards, carpets, and your mattress and bedsprings., Watch carefully to make sure the professional is getting into every nook and cranny. He or she should be able to spot where bed bugs could be hiding, but you may need to point out hidden areas., Exterminators can heat up your rooms to very hot temperature to kill the bed bugs, which you can't do on your own. Ask the professional about performing a heat treatment., If you live in an apartment complex, you need to talk to management, as bed bugs may be spreading from apartment to apartment. When one apartment is treated, the apartments directly above, below and on either side should be treated at the same time. "

Wash thrift store clothes immediately.,
Avoid picking up furniture.,
Buy new mattresses.,
Inspect the room at a hotel.,
Wash clothes after a trip.,
Be considerate to others.",How to Stop Bed Bug Bites Immediately3," If you bring home clothes from a thrift store, wash them immediately in very hot water. You can also run them through a hot dryer. The process should kill off any bed bugs in the clothes., It may be tempting to take home what seems to be a perfectly good couch on the curb. However, furniture can harbor bed bugs, and you could be bringing them into your home., If you buy a used mattress, make sure it has been professionally cleaned first. To be on the safe side, you can encase the mattress and box springs in dust-mite covers to keep the bed bugs from biting at night., Before settling in, check your hotel room for bed bugs by inspecting the mattress and the area around the bed. Keep your luggage as far away from the bed as possible.You can use the luggage rack for your suitcase, especially if it is away from the bed. Try not to leave your luggage on the floor., When you return from travelling, immediately wash all the clothes you took on the trip on a hot temperature. Also, leave your suitcase in the garage if possible., If you have bed bugs, you may need to throw out furniture in bedding. Before doing so, you should slash up the pieces, so that other people will not take them. You should also consider leaving a note with the items for the same reason."
"
Look for them in crevices.,
Look for the signs.,
Check for bites.,
Compare to other bugs.,
Check other rooms.",How to Stop Bed Bug Bites Immediately4," Bed bugs are experts at hiding, and they can hid in cracks, in mattresses, or even behind items on your bedside table. Take a flashlight to look for them in those areas., Bed bugs leave behind small black flecks of feces. You might also notice small drops of blood on your bed in the morning., Not everyone is affected by a bed bug bite. In fact, only about 1/3 of people develop a spot on their skin after they are bitten. The bites usually result in a small pink bump that itches.Most often, they occur in groups of three., That is, if you find a bug, compare it to pictures online to determine it really is a bed bug, as opposed to a flea or tick., While your bedroom is the most likely to be infected, check out other rooms, as well. For instance, you could bring bed bugs in on a couch, so your living room could be infected."
"
Place infested garments and bedding in the dryer.,
Allow furniture to sit out in direct sunlight.,
Freeze furniture, instead.,
Use a portable heating device.,
Call the professionals.",How to Kill Bed Bugs1," Infested fabrics that are able to be laundered should be placed in a clothes dryer set to high heat for 10 to 20 minutes.""Dry-clean only"" garments can usually go through a dryer cycle safely as long as they are completely dry at the start and the dryer is only set to medium heat, which is less than 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).
Heat is an effective way to kill bed bugs, but garments must be laundered at temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in order for the heat treatment to be effective.
Avoid taking your garments to a dry-cleaner. Dry-cleaning your garments will usually kill the bugs, but your infested garments may cause a bed bug outbreak at the dry-cleaners.;
, Upholstered furniture, rugs, and other fabrics that cannot by washed or dried can be placed outdoors on a hot, sunny day.


Loosely wrap the item in plastic bag material. Any plastic will work, but dark colors absorb more heat, so a black plastic bag is ideal.
Place the wrapped item in direct sunlight. Choose the sunniest, hottest day possible.
Let the wrapped item sit in that position for at least 24 hours, if not longer.
The internal temperature of the bagged item needs to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) or higher.

, If your bed bug problem occurs in the middle of winter, you can use freezing temperatures to kill bed bugs, as well.


Wrap each infested item in plastic bag material. Sit it in a shaded area on the coldest winter day possible.
Note that this method will take longer than sitting your furnishing out in the sun. If the temperature is consistently at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius), you will need to wait two to four days. If temperatures reach up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius), you will need to wait for about a week., A portable heating device designed to kill bed bugs can be difficult to find and may cost you $300 or more.A portable bed bug heater is large enough to treat items like suitcases, backpacks, clothing, sleeping bags, purses, pillows, and shoes.
Place your items on the support rack inside the device and follow the instructions to heat the interior.
The heat will automatically turn off when the cycle is complete.
Note that a portable heating device is ineffective at treating an entire room or large space.

, If you need to treat an entire room, hire a pest management professional to treat the room with steam or specialized heaters.


A professional steamer session can range in price from $300 to $1200. Steaming takes a long time to complete, and the temperature of the steam must reach 160 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit (71 to 82 degrees Celsius).
One of the most effective treatments is the use of a whole room heating system. Industrial heaters heat the air inside an entire space to a temperature between 120 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit (49 and 57 degrees Celsius).
Ask your pest management professional if your beds and furniture must be stripped or moved before the company's arrival. Some companies will ask you to do so, while others like to inspect the items first.Note that turning up the heat in your home will not accomplish the same results as a professional heating session.

Familiarize yourself with what fleas look like.,
Examine your pets.,
Investigate small openings or narrow spaces around your home.,
Look for possible places where fleas may thrive.",How to Detect Flea Bites1," Fleas are very small insects. They do not have wings and are usually brownish or reddish in color. These insects have flat-shaped bodies with a mouth and sharp jaws. Their flat bodies enable them to move easily through an animal’s fur.Fleas have six legs equipped with hooks so that they can latch securely onto a host (such as your dog). While they don’t have wings, their strong legs enable them to jump long distances.
Adult fleas are generally 2.5 millimeters in length.;
, Fleas are common pests that attack furry and warm-blooded animals. These include cats, dogs, and other pets. A simple ocular inspection may tell you that your pet is infested with fleas.


A flea infested pet will constantly itch and scratch itself. This is because the flea’s saliva contains a protein that irritates your pets skin.
Look for red pimples or bumps on your pet’s skin. In most cases, these red pimples are evident under the legs, belly or groin of your pet. This may indicate that your pet is infested with fleas.
Do an ocular inspection. By simply having your pet lie on its back and inspecting their fur, you will be able to find fleas if there are any. Adult fleas are very small but visible to the naked eye.

, Even if your pet is not infested, there are other warm furry animals, like mice, that may share your living space. Some wildlife and pest animals may live in the crevices, nooks and crannies of your home. These animals may bring fleas into your place.


Some animals that may be infested with fleas are bats, rats, opossums, raccoons, and squirrels.

, There are places where fleas may reside such as beddings, pet areas, carpets, sofas and furniture.


Fleas can multiply very quickly. An adult female flea will lay eggs every single day while only having to mate once. Laid eggs can remain dormant for days and months until the environment is warm enough for them to hatch.

Load your laundry.,
Hook up the hose to a faucet.,
Plug in the appliance and start the wash.,
Drain the dirty water.,
Rinse the clothes again, if your machine requires it.,
Dry your clothes.,
Read your instruction manual before using the machine.,
Make sure to dry your hands before handling the machine's plug.,
Avoid washing coats.,
Make sure everything is in place.",How to Use a Portable Washing Machine," For the most part, you will have to do small loads with a portable washer. Your machine's instruction manual should have specific instructions regarding how much clothing it can hold. Most machines cannot hold more than 10 pounds.Place your clothing into the washer. You can separate loads by color and fabric type the same way you would when using a normal washing machine. Liquid detergent tends to work best with portable washing machines.
It's a good idea to add some liquid fabric softener, as portable washing machines only do spin cycles.;
, There should be a hose attached to your portable washer. This hose will be screwed onto your kitchen's faucet in order to fill the machine with water to wash the clothing. Hook the hose up to a faucet in your kitchen or bathroom and turn the water on.Use the water temperature that works best for your clothing type. For example, wash bright clothing in cold water.
Some machines may have two different hoses: one to load the water, and the other to drain it afterwards. Refer to your instruction manual to make sure you're plugging the right hose into the kitchen sink.
Most machines will have a line inside the washer marking how much water to add. Do not add water above this line as this can interfere with how the machine works and damage your clothing., When you load your clothes and fill the machine, make sure you choose an area with an outlet nearby. You need to plug in the machine for it to work. Once the clothing and water is loaded, you can plug in the machine and start the wash.Most machines have a timer, where you can decide how long you want to wash your clothes. In general, the dirtier the clothing, the longer your wash cycle should be. There will also be a switch to turn to get the machine to start the wash.Make sure to plug your machine directly into the wall. Portable washing machines do not work with power adapters or extension cords., After your wash cycle is done, there should be another nozzle that will drain the dirty water. If you're not sure which nozzle to use, check your instruction manual. Place this nozzle in the sink and allow all the dirty water to drain.Make sure the nozzle is securely in the sink. If the nozzle falls out, you could end up with dirty water all over your floor.

, Some machines do not have a rinse cycle. Once you've drained the water, you can remove and dry your clothing. However, other machines require a specific rinse cycle. If your machine requires a rinse cycle, fill the machine with cold, clean water and set it to rinse.You may have to drain the water again after the rinse cycle is over.

, If you have a portable dryer, you can dry your clothes there. You can also use a regular drying machine or air dry your clothes. If you don't have a dryer, there are other ways to dry your clothes.It can save money to air dry your clothes on a clothing line or drying rack. However, this does not work as fast as a regular dryer or portable dryer.

, While portable washing machines are all somewhat similar, precise instructions will vary. Before using your machine, read your instruction manual closely. You want to make sure you follow the rules for your machine closely., It's easy to get your hands wet when handling laundry. To protect yourself form electric shock, dry your hands thoroughly before plugging in or unplugging the machine., Heavy items, like coats, are generally too bulky for a portable washing machine. You will have to get such items dry cleaned or wash them in a regular washing machine., You want to make sure all the nozzles are screwed on tightly. You should also be vigilant about not overfilling the machine. You do not want to be left with a soapy mess to clean up."

Find the right pesticide.,
Follow the instructions carefully.,
Call an exterminator.",How to Kill Bed Bugs2," Many commercial pesticides can be used against bed bugs, but you must make sure that the pesticide you choose is specifically labeled for bed bug use. Many general pesticides or those used for other insects, like ants or wasps, are not effective against bed bugs.


Choose a pesticide geared toward use in a specific location for the strongest results. In general, there are pesticides used to treat the outdoors, mattresses, the whole home, a whole room, and cracks or surfaces.
There are also certain active ingredients that are commonly found in pesticides used against bed bugs. These include bifenthrin, boric acid, cold pressed neem oil, deltamethrin, tetramethrin, and propoxur, among others.
When possible, purchase a product that has been registered with the EPA. These products have been officially tested for effectiveness., There are not general instructions that apply to all pesticides; you must follow the instructions provided on the label of the specific pesticide you choose.


Never use an outdoor pesticide indoors.
Using a pesticide incorrectly could be dangerous for your health. It may also prove ineffective against the bed bugs.
Only throw the instructions away once the pesticide has been completely used up. Save the instructions as long as some of the chemical remains inside the container.

, If commercial, home-use pesticides fail, call a professional. The chemicals used by professional exterminators are often more powerful, and the techniques used to apply those chemicals are also more thorough and expertly performed.


Find out from the exterminator if he or she wants you to prepare your home in any particular way before fumigation occurs. The exterminator may have you discard bedding or fabrics that are damaged beyond repair or remove anything that can be harmed by the chemicals being used.

"
Vacuum away the bed bugs.,
Spread Diatomaceous Earth.,
Create a barrier of kidney bean leaves.,
Take a dewormer.",How to Kill Bed Bugs3," Use your vacuum cleaner to remove and visible bed bugs. During an infestation, you should also regularly vacuum all carpets, rugs, beds, and other upholstered furnishings.


While vacuuming may seem like an obvious remedy, it is fairly unconventional in the sense that it does not usually prove effective against the majority of the bed bugs in a contained area. Due to its low level of effectiveness, it is generally not recommended as a sole treatment. Vacuuming can, however, increase the effectiveness of other treatments.
The reason that this treatment does not kill all bed bugs is simply that a vacuum cleaner is unable to reach all the places that bed bugs might hide out in.
To improve your success rate, make sure to get in all cracks and crevices, and scrape the vacuum against all fabric surfaces to yank any eggs or stubborn adult bugs up.
Place the contents of the vacuum inside a sealed plastic bag when done. Placing the bag in direct sunlight for several hours to days may help kill any of the bugs that managed to survive the vacuuming.

, Apply a thin layer of this powder around problem areas, including both known and suspected hiding places. Gently rub the powder into carpeted areas so that it gets deeper into the carpet.This product is made from ground, fossilized shells. In fact, it is sometimes labeled as ""fossil shell flour"" or ""bed bug dust.""
Once a bed bug crawls through the dust, it immediately becomes dehydrated. Infected bugs should die within a few hours.
Use food-grade Diatomaceous Earth. There are some DE products marketed for use in swimming pools, and this can prove dangerous to humans. Food-grade DE should be perfectly safe, though.

, If the problem is still fairly minor, you could try killing off a small population of bed bugs by scattering the leaves of the kidney bean plant around your bed, couch, or other problem locations.This is an old folklore remedy that hails from eastern Europe.
Kidney bean leaves have microscopic hairs that hook the bed bugs' legs at their weakest points. Bed bugs that try to escape will be killed when their trapped leg is ripped off. Most bed bugs, however, will remain trapped. From there the leaves and the bugs can be burned.
Some scientists are looking for a way to develop a synthetic material that will mimic the fine hairs of the kidney bean plant while simultaneously remaining comfortable enough for human use.

, Studies suggest that a minimal dose of a prescription deworming agent known as ivermectin is effective at killing roughly 60 percent of bed bugs within a contaminated area.Note that these studies only began in December 2012, and unless they are officially accepted within the scientific community, your doctor may not be willing to prescribe ivermectin for your bed bug problem.
Ivermectin is considered to be a safe drug, however, and is used in deworming medications for both humans and animals.
This remedy relies on a technique called ""xenointoxication."" If using this solution, you would take a dewormer before going to sleep. The bed bugs will bite you in the middle of the night, as usual, but will die within a few days since the dewormer will be transmitted to them through your blood.

Be aware that fleas can bite any part of your body.,
Understand that flea bites might look different for some people.,
Stop scratching or you may develop lesions on your skin.,
Look for signs of severe allergic reaction.",How to Detect Flea Bites2," However, flea bites are commonly found on the ankles and lower legs because these body parts are the most accessible to these pests. In addition to this, the blood vessels of the ankles and lower legs are close to the skin, making them an ideal place for a flea to bite.


Flea bites on the forearms are more likely to occur when you play, stroke or hold your pet.
You might get flea bites on your body is you lie down on a sofa that is infested with fleas.
Flea bites are also commonly found in the folds of your body joints, such as the armpits, legs, and elbows.

, Because of this, it is important to know how flea bites can look based on the reactions that different people have to them.


Most flea bites will appear reddish and look like a small bump. They generally have a pink halo around the center of the bite. If you look closely, you may see a small hole at the center of the bump; this hole is where the flea sucked blood.
Most bites are unnoticeable until they start feeling itchy.
Depending on your skin sensitivity, the flea bite’s radius of redness may become larger with a darker red spot in the center.
Most flea bites will come in groups, as one flea can make multiple puncture wounds.
The bites may feel itchy and sore. They might get painful after you scratch them excessively.
Flea bites are not life-threatening—they simply get itchy and red. Because of this, if you are experiencing other severe symptoms, like flu-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, or fever, you most likely have not been bitten by a flea.

, When you scratch a bite, you can injure the sensitive skin where the bite occur. If this damaged skin gets exposed to bacteria, it could get infected and lesions could form.


These infected lesions can turn into skin rashes or bigger wounds if left unattended.

, Severe allergic reactions to flea bites are extremely rare. Some signs that would occur if you were experiencing this reaction includes:


Difficulty breathing.
Dizziness.
Nausea.
Swelling of the lips or tongue.
Chest pain.

Make a rosemary dip. Cover 2 1/2 cups of fresh rosemary sprigs with water and boil for 1/2 hour. Add the rosemary water to a gallon of warm water. While the water is still warm, pour it over your pet.
Make a lemon water dip. Boil the rinds of 2 lemons in 2 cups of water for 1/2 hour. Add the lemon water to a gallon of warm water. While the water is still warm, pour it over your pet.
Use soapy water. It may also be effective to use a solution of water mixed with a gentle foaming soap. Bathe your cat or dog carefully using warm water.;
, The dip solutions will have killed some of the fleas, but you still need to remove the eggs. Purchase a flea comb from your pet store and use it to carefully comb your pet's fur to remove all traces of fleas.

, Fleas are repelled by a few natural scents and oils that you can apply directly to your dog. Cats, on the other hand, can be harmed by certain oils, so avoid treating your cat unless a certain substance has been recommended by the vet. Here are a few options for treating your pet:


Lavender essential oil. Rub some on your dog's neck and back. This is said to both kill and repel fleas.
Eucalyptus oil. Make a spray by mixing 1 cup of water and 5 drops of oil, then spray your dog thoroughly to repel fleas. Do not use this treatment on cats.
Lemon spray. Boil lemon rinds for 1/2 hour and fill a spray bottle with the cooled mixture, then spray your dog. This one is safe for cats, too., In all likelihood, you'll have to dip, comb, and treat your pet several times before the battle is over. Keep an eye on your pet for signs of more fleas, and plan to dip your dog or cat once every week or so to kill the fleas that hatch over time.

, As soon as you realize your house has fleas, immediately wash your pet's bedding in very hot water to kill all of the fleas and their eggs. Wash other items your pet has touched, such as cloth toys, pillows, and so on.

, It's likely that the fleas have spread beyond your pet's domain, so go ahead and wash everything else, too. You may need to wash your clothes, your bedding (if your pet sleeps with you), your couch cushions, and anything else where fleas could live.

, Using a heavy-duty vacuum, vacuum your carpet thoroughly. Take your time, and go over the entire area more than once. You can also vacuum your sofa, upholstered chairs, and rugs. Use the hose attachment to vacuum the cracks in your baseboards, too.


Vacuuming has been proven to kill fleas. It sucks up adult fleas as well as their eggs.
After you vacuum, empty the vacuum bag. Otherwise, the fleas will hatch from their eggs and climb out of the vacuum to re-infest your home.

, Cover the entire carpet with a layer of baking soda. Go ahead and use up several boxes. Let the baking soda sit on the carpet for at least 4 hours or overnight, then vacuum it up. The baking soda dries out the eggs in the carpet, helping to kill the next round of fleas before they hatch.


You can use borax instead of baking soda to treat your carpets. Be sure to vacuum it thoroughly after the treatment.
Salt is another cheap and effective flea killer. Use it the same way you'd use baking soda.

, This completely natural powder kills adult fleas (and other insects) by piercing their exoskeletons when they walk over it. Wear a mask as you sprinkle it in areas where you have seen adult fleas. Leave it for 24 hours, then vacuum it up.

, If your home is on the humid side, you're providing the perfect climate for fleas. You can make your house less hospitable by using a dehumidifier to make the air drier. You could also turn on the AC, your fans, or a heater, depending on the season.

, If you have fleas in your house, they're probably in your yard, too. They thrive in tall grass, which shades them from the hot sun and keeps their environment moist. Exposing them to the sun is the best way to kill them. Mow your lawn frequently so that the grass won't get tall enough to shelter the fleas.

, Sprinkle it in areas where you have seen adult fleas just as you would any carpet deodorizer. Leave it for 24 hours, then vacuum it up thoroughly. This method will kill a full blown infestation in just days.

, Put a teaspoon of ACV in your pet's water dish. The vinegar is a natural flea repellant, and will help keep fleas at bay once the infestation is over. This is a safe treatment for both dogs and cats.

, Safe for both cats and dogs, homemade lemon spray will keep fleas from finding your pets appetizing. Spray it on them every few days to keep fleas out of the house.

, The smell of cedar is another natural flea repellant. Placing some cedar chips near your pet's bedding, outside in your flower bed, or in other strategic areas can help keep fleas away., If you have a cat, don't use this trick, since cats are sensitive to eucalyptus. Otherwise, spray your home's nooks and crannies, the carpet, your drawers, and your dog's bedding with a mix of eucalyptus oil and water to keep fleas out.

, Your pet will probably bring in a flea or two from time to time, but it doesn't have to become a full-blown infestation. Vacuuming regularly will kill fleas before they have the chance to reproduce.

Administer Capstar initially to rid your pet of a flea infestation quickly.,
Add deterrents to the pet's meal.",How to Kill Fleas in a Home," The easiest way to kill fleas is when they are at their most vulnerable—in the egg and larval stages of their development. An adult flea will live only about a week without blood from its host, while a flea larva can live several months, so it's important to attack the larvae first. This mixture will help prevent a full bloom of fleas.


Botanical dusts are perhaps the oldest natural insecticides. Borates are minerals that are used widely as wood preservatives, detergents, and insecticides, acting as stomach poisons to fleas.Care should be taken not to breathe in the botanical dust and borate mixture. Use a mask when applying the dust mixture in the home.






Dust the carpet, the furniture, the bed, the dog or cat's bed. It's best to do this when you're leaving your house for a good while, say 24 hours. Let the mixture settle for a day. When you come back, vacuum the carpet, the furniture, and wash the sheets on both beds.;
, The water and dish detergent mixture is like a toxic swimming pool for fleas. When they jump into the mixture, they die.


Place the water and detergent mixture in a very shallow bowl, low enough to the ground so that the fleas accidentally hop into it. An old frisbee does the job quite well.
Place the mixture next to a low-hanging light source, preferably a night-light. The fleas are attracted to the light. Approaching the light, many of them will fall into the mixture, dying in the process.







, Thinly slice one whole lemon and drop it into a pint of water. Bring the water to a boil. Then, let stand overnight for maximum potency. Pour into a spray bottle and spray onto affected areas.

, Cedar chips are available in your local pet or home improvement store. Fleas hate the smell of cedar and will do almost anything to avoid it.


Make sure your pet isn't allergic to cedar. Many dogs can be allergic to cedar. So while shooing the fleas away is a good thing, making your dog miserable clearly isn't.






Place cedar chips in the corners of rooms, in the dog pen or bed, and under furniture.






Place cedar chips in a cotton cloth underneath your pillow and, if possible, in your bedding. This will ensure that your bed remains pest-free. Plus, it will make your bed smell nice and fresh.







, Salt is a desiccant, meaning it saps the moisture from things and dries them out. When a salt crystal attaches itself to a flea, it will cause chafing and scraping on the flea, essentially bleeding the flea to death as it walks.


Use very fine-grained salt for this. The finer the better; you want it to be small enough to attach itself to the flea.
After 7-10 days, vacuum the salted area very thoroughly, making sure to pick up all the salt and flea carcasses from the carpet area. Repeat the process one or two more times.






When you're done vacuuming, discard the old vacuum bag and replace it with a new one.

, Vacuum over any affected areas, including high-traffic areas where the pets usually roam. Most fleas will not be able to survive a good tornado of a vacuum!


People often go for high-powered, super-suction vacuums, but the average vacuum should do the trick perfectly.Place moth flakes down on the carpet (or inside the vacuum bag) and vacuum them up. This will help kill any fleas you vacuum up!






Always discard the vacuum bag after you vacuum. This will help discourage re-infestation.

, Flea traps work in much the same way as the lighted detergent water combo (above) works. Fleas are attracted to the heat and the brightness of the light, and fall into the trap.

, IGRs, such as Nylar, stop the fleas from developing, thereby breaking the reproduction cycle. This is a blessing when attempting to bring large infestations under control. The most economical method is to buy a concentrate and mix according to the directions that come with the product. Typically, the application will need to be applied twice, at a minimum—about three and a half weeks apart. Often it is advantageous to spray the areas of the house frequented by your pets on a monthly basis during flea season.

IGRs are not poisonous to mammals. This makes IGRs a good option around a house that has kids or small animals such as hamsters, reptiles, or fish.

, Washing your pet will help kill the fleas that are living on it. There may be a host of other fleas in various stages of their life cycle waiting to hop onto your pet, so be sure to use this method with other preventative measures, such as vacuuming, borate mixes, and cedar chips.


Prepare your dog for the bath by applying the flea soap near the dog's ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and butt. When fleas feel water, they immediately look for safe places on the dog to hide out, such as around the neck, on the head, and near the anus. Do this before you get the dog wet.






After you've applied the soap to the dog's vulnerable areas, get the dog wet and lather the whole body up. Let the solution stand for at least ten minutes, working in the soap as much as possible. Comb out the dead fleas when dried.






If your dog doesn't react well to flea soap, try acquiring soap that has eucalyptus, tea tree oil, or cedar oil in it. Fleas don't like the oils of these trees, so use them to your benefit.

, Flea products, such as Advantage or Frontline, are spot-treatments that are applied to pets monthly.

Usually, these spot-treatments are dropped directly onto the skin of your pet, usually between the shoulder blades and at several spots down the spine. The treatment will then work its way through the skin (integumentary system).







, This will prevent flea adaption to the treatments. You may find that the use of some of the standard flea treatments are ineffective because the local flea population has adapted to a particular treatment (including the chemicals in flea collars). In this case, switch among other treatments and use an insect growth regulator (IGR) such as Nylar. The use of an IGR will not allow propagation of succeeding generations and will prevent, in large measure, adaptation to the treatments., Capstar is given orally and takes effect within several hours. For some reason the Capstar causes fleas bite in their death throes. Washing the animal to rid it of the dying fleas may help relieve the associated itching.

Some cats may become hyperactive, vocalize more, or show panting. If this happens, try cutting the recommended dose, but you may have to discontinue use of Capstar with sensitive cats.

, Since fleas feed on the blood of animals, you can treat fleas by manipulating what your pet eats.


There are oral tablets that you can give your pet. These tablets attack the flea’s nervous system via the bloodstream and tissue of your dog or cat. While they kill all the fleas feeding on your pet, they do not prevent fleas.
Mix vinegar into their water. Don't try this with cats, as their pH is much more sensitive than dogs'. Mix a tablespoon of apple-cider vinegar into the dog's water bowl, or bathe the animal using water and vinegar.

Grow catnip in your yard if you don't mind cats.,
Grow citronella in your garden or yard.,
Try growing other herbs that repel mosquitoes.,
Plant ageratum.,
Plant marigolds on the border of your lawn or garden.,
Try some other flowers that are known to repel mosquitoes.,
Plant horsemint if you live in dry climates or near a coast.,
Consider some wild plants.",How to Use Plants to Keep Mosquitoes Away1," Some people find that catnip is even better at repelling mosquitoes than chemicals, such as DEET. Best of all, catnip is safe. It can even be grown next to plants that typically attract mosquitoes as a deterrent. Keep in mind, however, that the catnip will attract cats into your yard.


Catnip is an aggressive grower, like a weed. Be sure to keep it reined in, or it will take over your flowerbed.;
, Citronella masks the surrounding scents around your home and garden that attract mosquitoes, preventing them from coming too near.


If you live in warm climates where frost does not occur, plant citronella directly into the ground behind your other plants. Citronella can grow to a height of up to between 5 and 6 feet (1.52 and 1.82 meters) and forms in large, grassy clumps.
If you live in a cold, freezing climate, plant citronella in large planters. This way, you can move the planters indoors during freezing temperatures and harsh weather conditions.
Verify that the citronella plants you use are called Citronella winterianus or Cymbopogon nardus, as opposed to plants labeled ""citronella-scented,"" which may not be authentic citronella plants.

, Not only will you have something that you can use in your cooking, but you will be keeping the mosquitoes away. Many herbs also develop small white or purple flowers. Here are some popular herbs that keep mosquitoes at bay:Basil
Garlic
Lavender, Lemon balm, and Lemongrass
Peppermint
Rosemary

, These small blue and purple flowers are hard, suitable for just about any climate. The plant grows up to 18 inches (45.72 cm) tall, making it ideal for the back of flowerbeds. It needs partial or full sunlight.


Ageratum secretes a scent considered offensive to mosquitoes.

, The smell that these flowers emit will prevent mosquitoes from entering a specific area, functioning similar to a border.


Plant marigolds in areas with fertilized soil that can be exposed to full sunlight at all times.

, They will add color and fragrance to your yard, while keeping mosquitoes at bay. Consider planting some of these flowers into flower pots, and placing them near doorways and windows. Flowers that repel mosquitoes include:Geranium
Mums
Pennyroyal
Tansy

, Horsemint works similarly to citronella, but can withstand dry weather, sandy soil, and salty air.Grow horsemint in either a shaded or sunny area with enough room to allow the plant to grow between 2 and 3 feet (60.96 and 91.44 cm) in both width and height.

, There are many other wild plants that also repel mosquitoes. If any of these plants are native to the area you live in, consider planting some in your garden. You may already have some growing in or near your garden.


Cedar trees
Mugwort and Nodding onion
Pineapple weed
Snowbrush, Sweetfern, and Sagebrush,
Wild bergamot, Wormwood, and Vanilla Leaf

Use some rosemary in your cooking.",How to Use Plants to Keep Mosquitoes Away2," This is great if you are going some place where your mosquito-repelling plants won't be present, such as on a hiking trip. You may want to do a small patch test first on your inner elbow, however, to ensure that you are not allergic to the plant. Keep in mind that these plants will only protect you for 1 to 2 hours.Consider crushing and rubbing any of these plants on your arms and legs:


Catnip, Citronella, Clove
Eucalyptus
Lavender or Lemon balm
Pineapple weed
Sagebrush
Tea tree
Vanilla leaf

, Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of hot water over a handful of fresh basil leaves. Wait 2 to 4 hours, then pour the liquid into a spray bottle. Discard the leaves. Add ½ cup (120 milliliters) of vodka. Close the bottle and shake it to mix. Be sure to squeeze the basil leaves to get every last bit of liquid out.
You can also use catnip and rosemary instead of basil. Let the herbs step for 1 hour instead.

, Take some of the herbs or flowers mentioned in the section above, and dry them out. Tie herbs into bundles, and hang them from doorways and windows. Separate the petals from the flowers, and arrange them in pretty bowls. Leave these bowls on windowsills and deck tables where mosquitoes are likely to be present.To release the mosquito-repelling sent, simply rub the herbs or petals between your fingers.

, The next time you decide to barbecue, sprinkle some rosemary onto your chicken or steak. Not only will you be flavoring your meal, but you'll be keeping those pesky biters at bay."

Close all of the zippers.",How to Set up a Mosquito Net1," Find a flat, dry area that is several yards from any open water. Self-supporting nets are like tents, so you can find a spot that you would feel comfortable setting up a tent on.If you’re inside, find a spot where you will feel the most comfortable and that has enough room for the net.;
, Remove the net, as well as any rods, strings, and stakes, from its bag. Separate the net from the other parts., Spread the net over the area you have chosen. Pull the stake loops on the ends of the tent out to the corners of your sleeping area.If your net has a base, it will be easy to tell if you have it right-side up. If not, check to make sure any zippers are on top of the net.

, The poles will be broken into small sections that are connected with an elastic rope. Connect the sections together to form the full length of the pole.If you have polls of different lengths, separate them so you don’t accidentally start to use a short poll where a long poll is needed.

, Depending on the particular net you have, there will either be fabric sleeves or clips that hold the polls in place. The polls will extend from one stake loop, over the top of the tent, and connect to the stake loop on the opposite side of the net.If you have a rectangular net, you will most likely have two long polls that cross each other in an X shape at the top of the net.
On more elaborate nets, there may be a space for a smaller poll that holds the entryway of the net up.

, Using the included stakes, or sticks if no stakes are included with the net, stake the tent to the ground by hammering the stakes into each corner of the net. There will be loops on the corner of the tent that the stakes pass through.If you’re inside, you don’t need to stake the net to the ground.

, Keep it away from the edges of the net since mosquitoes can bite through the net if your skin is touching the edges., Make sure every zipper is closed completely. Otherwise, smaller mosquitoes may be able to get through.

However, making it more difficult to get in may be enough to discourage rodents.


Check around your foundation, windows and door frames for small holes, cracks or improper seals.
Use caulk, putty or weather stripping to fill any access areas you find.;
,


Use snap-style traps designed to kill the rodents quickly.
Catch the rodents in live traps, such as Have-A-Heart traps, then drive them at least a mile from your home before releasing them.

,


Soak rags in ammonia and put mothballs in open containers and leave them in the corners of the basement, attic or other areas of your home where rodents are a problem.
Rub peppermint oil on beams and other areas where rodents travel. You can also scatter fresh or dried mint leaves, as both the oil and leaves repel rodents.
Get a cat. Even if your cat is not a great mouser, the smell of the cat's presence in the home deters rodents.
Purchase fox, coyote or bobcat urine at a garden center or hunting and sporting goods store. Alternately, you can get some used cat litter from someone who does own a cat. Put the urine-soaked cat litter out in the basement or attic, or soak cotton balls in the urine and place them around the area.
Spread Camphor balls in the attic or places frequented by rodents.The smell is intolerable for the mice and they will stop visiting the place.

Destroying a spider's web will encourage them to find a hassle free place to live. If your home remains clean, they may choose to leave in search of a better home.;
, Weekly vacuuming will remove spiders, webs and potential nesting places for spiders.


The vacuum is also a good tool to remove a spider in your home, if you do not want to squish it or let it outside.

, A solution with equal parts water and vinegar will deter insects and bugs of all kinds.


Spiders feast on insects. Make it your goal to attract fewer flies, ants and other critters, and you will have fewer spiders.
Distilled white vinegar is useful because it can remove insect tracks, so that other insects cannot follow the trail. You can also use another multi-purpose cleaning product.

, Wipe down counters, put food in air-tight containers or in the refrigerator and vacuum up crumbs. These measures will discourage other insects and the spiders that feed on them.

, Spiders like dark, cluttered spaces, so find ways to stack and seal your storage areas.


Vacuum and dust closet spaces before you re-organize them. This will rid your house of existing spiders.







, Stacks of boxes or cardboard are a good place for spiders to live. Make sure you clear places with stacked debris every week or 2.

, Piles attract insects, and the closer insects are to the house, the more likely they are to find their way in.

, Replace screens that have holes in them, to reduce the ways that spiders can enter the home.


Check your doors to see if there is day light creeping in around the edges. If your seal allows any light in, the seal is not solid and spiders are likely to get in. Replace the door or install a rubber strip that will seal it off.







, Use a very fine mesh to cover all the vents in your home.

, You can also stuff them with steel wool or fill them with foam. Older homes are likely to have a few hidden entry points where spiders can slip through the cracks.

, Make sure there is a distance of a few feet between all shrubs and your home. This will reduce your total insects that live right near the house and make it inside regularly.

Remove debris from your yard.Most spiders like to hide in dark places, and yard debris provides the perfect hiding spot for any arachnid wanting to set up camp in your yard.,
Keep tall grass and weeds out of your yard.,
Limit your outdoor storage.,
Remove webs when you spot them.,
Avoid using outdoor lighting.",How to Keep Spiders Away1,"


Remove piles of dead leaves, grass clippings, piles of wood, boxes, tires, plywood, and empty containers from the yard.
It is especially essential that your remove debris from around the perimeter of your home's foundation in order to keep spiders out of your house. If you want to keep spiders away from your yard as much as possible, though, you should remove these items from your yard altogether.;
, If debris is not available, the next place spiders will look will be shrubs, tall grass, and tall weeds. Trimming your weeds and cutting your grass short will reduce the number of spiders in your yard by creating a less appealing habitat.


You do not need to get rid of your shrubs and bushes completely, but you should at least avoid planting them next to the foundation of your house to limit the number of spiders wandering inside.

, Boxes and bags of items stored in outdoor sheds and garages are another appealing spot for spiders. Reducing the number of items you store outdoors will also reduce the number of spiders you spot.


If you do plan to store something outside, put it into a sealed plastic container instead of a cardboard box. Sealed containers prevent most spiders from squeezing inside, so you will have fewer unpleasant surprises to deal with when you open the container later on.
Check boxes stored outdoors before you bring them into the house.

, When you see a spider web on the side of a building or somewhere in your yard, physically remove the web to discourage the spider that built it from returning.


In most instances, you will need to remove the web with a broom, mop, or garden hose.
If you are near enough to an electrical outlet, you can also use a vacuum to remove webs and egg sacs you spot outside.

, While outdoor lighting has nothing to do with spiders directly, outdoor lights will attract many insects, and the increased number of insects will also lead to a spike in your spider population.


Use your outdoor lights as little as possible.
Direct the lights away from your house to draw the insects and spiders further away from your foundation.
Switch to yellow bulbs. The softer light is less appealing to insects and may not draw as many as a bright white light does."

Use topical preventative to repel fleas.,
Choose an oral preventative for convenience.,
Try a collar.,
Think about other types of topical products.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Choose Between Oral and Topical Flea Preventatives1," Many types of topical preventatives act as a flea repellent. This protects your pet by repelling fleas and ticks from them. It keeps them off your pet in the first place. Oral preventatives do not offer any repelling properties.An oral preventative only works if the flea bites the animal or is on the pet.;
, Oral medications are often chosen due to their convenience. With an oral preventative, you don’t have to worry about a drying period where the pesticide can transfer to children or other pets. Once the pet swallows the medication, you are finished.Some oral preventatives only kill the eggs or adult fleas, but not both. You may need an additional preventative if your oral tablet only focuses on one threat.Be aware that your pet may refuse to swallow the oral medication or may spit it out after you place it in their mouth. Even if you place it in their food, they may eat around it.
Some brands of oral preventatives come in flavored chewable tablets, like beef flavored., Collars are a different kind of topical preventative. Collars are easy to use because you put them on your pet and they are protected. Most collars kill and repel fleas. With collars, you have to make sure no one touches the collar, especially children, since it contains the chemical preventative.Collars may be less effective for fleas because fleas generally live close to the bottom of the body, around the rear area, instead of near the head where the collar will be.Collars may have a strong, unpleasant odor. They may also irritate your pet’s neck or skin.

, You may be interested in other types of topical preventatives, such as sprays, powders, and shampoos. Sprays, powders, and shampoos work immediately to kill fleas, but they do not protect your pet from reinfestation and do not repel fleas.Powders generally last for about a week and shampoos last for a day.Sprays generally last for up to a month, but your pet cannot get wet. This includes swimming, baths, or rain.If you want ongoing protection from fleas, consider something stronger than these products.

, If you are not sure what kind of flea preventative to give your pet, talk to your vet. Flea preventatives are a type of medication, which means if your pet already takes medication or has existing health issues, the preventative may interfere. Discuss which type and brand of preventative will be best for your pet with the veterinarian before choosing one.The age, breed, and species of your pet may also influence what you give your pet.

Make sure spiders can’t get through any gaps in your exterior doors. Install door sweeps on all of your exterior doors; spiders can squeeze through an opening that is 1/16” (mm) tall.
Use caulk to seal the outside edges of your doors, but use foam weather-stripping to line the bottom track of sliding glass doors.;
, Gaps, cracks and holes can be filled with caulk, foam, cement and steel wool. Look for openings in these common entry points:


Outdoor faucets
Gas and electric meters
Cable TV wires
Dryer vents
Telephone wires
Outdoor electrical receptacles

,


Be sure to use a good caulking gun, one that has a back-off trigger which will stop the flow of caulk when you press it; otherwise, you will end up with too much caulk and you’ll end up with a mess.
Smooth the bead of caulk you apply with a damp rag so that it is even and you can see if you’ve missed any cracks.

, You can purchase screen repair kits at your local home and garden store.

, Wear gloves when you do this because the edges of the wire mesh are sharp and you may have to cut the mesh with wire snips to ensure it completely covers each opening.

, Spray the pesticide around the perimeter of your foundation.

This will usually be a hook, pin, or fixture on the ceiling.If you can’t find a spot over the head of your bed to attach the net, consider moving the bed to a more suitable spot.
An overhead beam will work at an attachment point.
If there are no good spots available, you can screw a hook into the ceiling or use a strong adhesive hook. Adhesive hooks work well in hotel rooms.

Consider using sticky glue traps if your objective is to kill spiders.,
Place sticky glue traps against baseboards, behind and underneath furniture and inside cabinets.

,
Use at least 3 traps in every room.

",How to Set Spider Traps1," While spray pesticides kill spiders fast, they are harmful to humans, pets and plants. Sticky traps have a sticky material coating on one surface. They are placed wherever spiders tend to move in search of prey; the glue traps the spiders when they walk across the trap. Buy glue traps or make your own:


Fold a piece of cardboard into a triangular shape—about 4” long and 3” high.
Brush on a sticky coating on the inside of the bottom piece of the trap. You can use glue or you can buy a commercial product at a nursery or home and garden store.
Sweeten the trap by adding a bit of honey or peanut butter to the glue. This isn’t strictly necessary, but a little scent might help attract the spiders more quickly.
Discard the trap when it is filled with dead spiders or other insects.;

Seal cracks in your walls.,
Install tight-fitting screens, weather stripping, and door sweeps.These are the other types of passageways spiders use to invade your home.,
Clean away clutter.,
Place storage items in sealed plastic bins.,
Dust and vacuum regularly.",How to Keep Spiders Away2," Apply silicone caulk to any cracks around your windows and doors or along the foundation of your home.


Most spiders will sneak into a building through these various cracks and unintended openings. Sealing the cracks will prevent the spiders from coming in.
You can purchase caulk from a hardware store. Follow the instructions provided on the label to prepare and apply the caulk correctly.
When you apply the caulk, make sure that the cracks are completely filled and covered.

,


Weather stripping and door sweeps will seal the gaps left at the bottom and sides of your doors and windows. Door sweeps are especially important because you cannot use caulk to cover the crack at the bottom of the doorway, making a properly fit door sweep your only means of cutting that path off from spiders.
A tight-fitting screen is also an essential tool. Spiders can slip in through the gaps left by loose screens, and so can many insects spiders like to feed on. Install screens over your windows and vents.
Repair any holes in your screens as soon as you spot them. If you spot a hole in your screen, repair it or replace the screen. Otherwise, spiders and insects may find their way into your home through that hole.

, Spiders gravitated toward clutter inside a building as readily as they do outside a building.


Do not let piles of clothing, papers, towels, linens, or shoes sit on the floor.
If you do leave a pile of clutter on the floor, shake out each piece of material as you clean the clutter up to shake off any unwelcome spiders.

, Spare clothing, holiday decorations, extra linens, and other objects that belong in long-term storage should be stored in sealed containers to prevent spiders from sneaking in.


Do not use cardboard boxes. If you must rely on cardboard boxes, however, cover all exposed openings with packing tape.
Good storage methods are especially important for items stored in a dark basement or attic.
Consider storing outdoor tools and sports equipment in sealed storage containers, as well. This includes roller skates, gardening tools and clothing, ski boots, and team uniforms. If you do not want to store these items in plastic bins, store them in a large plastic bag with a tight seal and no holes.Cover all sources of pet and human food. Spiders are not interested in human and pet food, but insects that spiders feed on are very interested in these food sources. As a result, keeping food hidden away in sealed bags and containers will attract fewer insects, thereby attracting fewer spiders.

, You should regularly clean your general living area, but every couple of weeks, you should also clean around the areas where spiders like to dwell.


Vacuuming and dusting removes both full-grown spiders and egg sacs, preventing the latter from hatching and producing a vast quantity of baby spiders.
Vacuum under furniture, inside closets, under heaters, and around all baseboards.
Dust high wall corners and other areas prone to little human or pet activity.

Use essential oils.,
Coat entry points with the scent of lemon.,
Scatter horse chestnuts around the perimeter of your home.,
Let the scent of cinnamon drift through your house.,
Make a solution of coconut oil and vinegar.,
Only use chemical insecticides to get rid of possible food sources.",How to Keep Spiders Away3," There are a number of essential oils that are touted as spider repellents. If you mix these oils with dish soap and warm water, you can create a repellent that may ward away most common house spiders.Peppermint essential oil is the most popular option, but you can also try tea tree oil, citrus oil, lavender oil, or neem oil.
The idea is that the above mentioned essential oils have potent smells that are unappealing to spiders.
You need to add dish soap to make the solution more effective. The soap breaks apart the oil molecules, allowing the oil to mix more consistently throughout the water.
Use 5 to 10 drops of essential oil. Put the essential oil in a 16-oz (500-ml) spray bottle and fill the bottle to the brim with warm water. Place the cap back on the bottle and shake to combine.
Use this spray along openings spiders may squeeze in through, including window frames and door cracks. Reapply every few days, or as the odor fades.

, You can accomplish this by rubbing lemon peel around the area or by spraying diluted lemon juice.Cut a lemon and remove the flesh. Rub the peel around door and window frames so that these areas are thoroughly covered by the scent.
Alternatively, you could mix equal parts water and lemon juice in a spray bottle and spray any exposed cracks, door frames, or window frames with the solution.
Like essential oils, lemons are thought to repel spiders due to their potent scent.

, The seeds of the horse chestnut tree, also called ""conkers,"" have been used as spider repellents for ages.


Gather a few handfuls of horse chestnuts and line them up around the perimeter of your house on the interior and exterior walls. Doing so should discourage spiders from breaking the barrier and coming into your home.
Change out the horse chestnuts every other week to prevent them from rotting and causing more problems.

, Burn cinnamon scented candles or cinnamon oil in an oil burner.


As with many other home remedies, this fix relies on the notion that spiders find the strong odor of cinnamon repulsive.
As a result, anything that puts the smell of cinnamon in the air qualifies as a potential spider repellent. This includes cinnamon baked goods, cinnamon oil, cinnamon candles, and cinnamon bath and body sprays.

, Fill a spray bottle with this solution and spray it around suspected entry points and hide-outs.


Combine one part coconut oil with two parts white distilled vinegar in a spray bottle. Cap the bottle and shake well to mix.
Spray this solution around door and window cracks and dark places where spiders may hide out.

, Most insecticides and chemical repellents do not work against spiders.


You could try a chemical repellent labeled for use against spiders, but if you opt for a chemical treatment, you might have better luck if you use a chemical to kill off the spiders' food, instead.
Determine what the most prevalent food source around your yard and home is and purchase an insecticide or repellent labeled for use against that source.
Read the package instructions carefully so that you apply the chemical properly. Wear protective gear when applying poison and do not let animals or small children come in contact with it.

Decide if you want a prescription medication.,
Determine if you want a preventative that protects against more than fleas.,
Think about the best choice if you have small children.,
Consider which type is appropriate if you own multiple pets.,
Use caution with topical preventatives if you have a cat.",How to Choose Between Oral and Topical Flea Preventatives2," Many topical and oral flea preventatives are available only with a prescription from your vet. Some professionals believe these are more effective and safer than buying over-the-counter medication. Most oral preventatives require a prescription, while many topical preventatives can be purchased without one.If you need to take your pet to the vet, you can discuss getting a prescription preventative during a regular visit. You may be able to call your vet and ask for a prescription without taking your pet in.
If you don’t want to go through a vet, you may want to choose an over-the-counter method.

, Many preventatives that protect against fleas also protect against ticks, mosquitoes, and heart disease. These multi-preventatives can be found in oral and topical preventatives.Determine what you want to protect your pet against. For example, you may not need a tick preventative, but you may need a heartworm preventative instead. Talk to your vet if you are unsure what you should protect your pet from.

, If you have small children in the house, you may consider whether or not you can safely allow a topical product to dry. If your children touch any topical preventatives that have not finished drying, there is a pesticide risk.If you follow the directions on the label and allow the topical flea preventative to dry, your children should be safe.
If you feel uncomfortable with the potential risk, give your pet oral preventatives.

, Having multiple pets may also be another concern when you are trying to decide between an oral and topical preventative. If you use a topical preventative, make sure that your pets don’t lick, groom, or play with each other until the preventative is dry.As long as you let the topical preventative dry on each pet before they play, lick, or touch each other, using a topical preventative should not be a problem. You may want to keep your pets in different rooms until the preventative dries. You can also keep them in separate kennels or place some pets outside.
You can use oral preventatives to reduce any risk of this problem.

, There are many topical flea preventatives marketed for dogs. You shouldn’t use these topical products on cats unless they are safe and designed to be used on cats. Using canine preventatives on a cat can cause serious health issues or even death.If you have both dogs and cats, use caution with topical canine preventatives around your cat. If you use a spot-on treatment, make sure that your dog is completely dry before it interacts with your cat.

"
"
Notice any topical skin reactions.,
Check for any digestive issues.,
Bathe your pet gently if using topical preventatives.",How to Choose Between Oral and Topical Flea Preventatives3," Your pet may experience a skin reaction if you use a topical preventative. This reaction may cause skin irritation, redness, a rash, or even hair loss. If your pet experiences this, you should switch to an oral preventative.This type of reaction is not common.

, An oral preventative may cause problems with your pet’s digestive tract. Your pet may have a sensitivity to the oral medication, an upset stomach, or other digestive issues. If your pet experiences this, switch to a topical medication.You should give the oral preventative with a meal. This helps reduce the risk of digestive problems.
Digestive problems are not common.

, Once it dries, topical preventatives protect your pet's entire body. They can get wet, swim, and be bathed. However, when you bathe your pet, you should use gentle shampoos. This helps reduce the likelihood that the shampoo will strip the skin, and therefore, the medication.Look for gentle or sensitive skin shampoos for your pet. Refrain from anything that is maximum strength or strong.

Catch spiders in their webs if you don’t want to kill them.,
Secure the lid, either by screwing it on or by taping it securely to the jar.

,
Punch air holes in the lid with an ice pick or sharp knife.

",How to Set Spider Traps2," Once you have found a web with a spider in it, follow the steps below to safely capture it:


Wear gloves, especially if you aren’t sure about what type of spider you are trying to catch.
Use a glass jar or similar container to hold the spider.
Have a lid handy, or use an index card or other flat piece of cardboard to cover the opening of the container once you get the spider inside it.
Hold the container behind the web and use your other hand to position the lid or piece of cardboard at the front of the web.
Push the jar or container towards the spider and nudge it into the container and quickly slide the lid over the opening.

Install a draft strip and weatherstripping at the shed’s entrance.,
Caulk windows and any cracks or gaps.,
Seal any vents and utility holes.",How to Spider Proof a Shed1," Inspect your shed’s entrance for gaps between the door and its frame. If any are present, seal the door using weatherstripping or a draft strip.Pay special attention to the entrance’s corners. If the shed is large enough, and if you’re brave enough, get inside, close the door, and see if any light is visible where the door meets its casing.;
, If your shed has windows, apply a silicone or acrylic latex caulk to seal any gaps in the casing. Check the roof’s soffits and fascia boards, and use caulk to seal any cracks you find.Inspect the shed’s structure regularly to make sure no gaps or cracks have formed, and reapply caulk when needed.

, Some sheds feature vents and other openings, such as entry points for utility wires. Use the finest wire mesh you can find to seal vents (preferably 1/16 inch or 1.5 millimeter). Plug any utility holes with caulk, expandable foam, or steel wool.Wear gloves when cutting and installing wire mesh, since the edges are razor sharp.

Then fill the spray bottle up until until about one inch (2.54 cm) from the top with warm water.Use either peppermint, tea tree, citrus, lavender or neem essential oil, as these oils are proven to repel spiders.
Try to use a glass spray bottle, as essential oils can sometimes react with plastic.;
, Add a small squirt of liquid dish soap into the spray bottle, then place the top on the bottle and shake so that the mixture is combined.Because oil and water don’t mix, dish soap is needed to break apart the oil molecules so that they can mix in with the water.

, Spray the essential oil spray on any entry points in your house, including around window frames, door cracks, and any crevices that you may notice in your home. Also spray any corners where spiders tend to congregate.If you are spraying furniture or carpets, keep in mind that the oil may leave a stain. Spot test an inconspicuous area of the upholstery or carpet by spraying and making sure the repellent doesn’t alter its color before using.

, Natural repellents need to be reapplied more often than chemical-based ones, so make sure that you reapply the spray once a week."

Keep the space around the shed clear.,
Keep storage containers lidded or taped shut.",How to Spider Proof a Shed2," Make it habit to give your shed a quick cleaning every week. Sweep or vacuum any spider webs you find. Don’t disregard old cobwebs, as these can contain egg sacs that could yield thousands of spiderlings., When you sweep away those spider webs, be sure to clean up leaves, dirt, and other debris from the shed’s interior. Removing as much litter and clutter as possible will help eliminate the spaces spiders use as dwellings.Don't forget to get rid of any food in the shed, which can attract insects. If you store bird seed or other edibles, keep them in tightly sealed boxes or bags.

, You can use warm water and dish soap, bleach, or your preferred disinfectant to periodically wash your shed’s walls. Keeping the walls clean can make the environment less hospitable for spiders and deter them from spinning webs., Avoid storing firewood, building materials, and other items around the shed’s exterior. Remove weeds, shrubs, and other growing vegetation, and clear away any dead leaves from the areas around your shed.Periodically pressure wash the shed and sweep or rake its perimeter to help repel spiders and other many-legged critters.

, Invest in plastic storage bins with securely sealing lids. Ziplock bags are also a good storage option. If you do use cardboard boxes, tape them shut to keep out spiders.If possible, keep storage containers on shelves and off of the floor.

Place glue traps throughout your shed.,
Apply a pesticide barrier around the shed’s exterior.,
Try vinegar, osage oranges, and other natural repellents.,
Consult a professional exterminator.",How to Spider Proof a Shed3," The more glue traps you use, the more spiders you’ll catch, so place lots at spots like each of the shed’s corners and on shelving. Go for flat glue traps without raised perimeter edges, as these are the best for catching spiders.Check the glue traps regularly, and replace them when they’re covered with critters. Get help from a brave friend or family member if necessary!
You can find glue traps at your local grocery or hardware store.

, Choose a liquid pesticide that contains synthetic pyrethroids and apply it around the shed’s exterior base, as well as at any vents or other openings. While pesticide barriers don’t always work against spiders in the long-term, they do keep out flies, ants, and other creepy crawlies that provide food for spiders.Bug bombs and foggers aren’t very effective in deterring spiders, but they could be useful if you have a fly or ant problem and need to get rid of spider food sources.If you go with an insecticide, remember to read and follow the instructions carefully.

, You could try spraying white vinegar at the shed’s entrance and other openings to keep away spiders. While hard to find in most locations, Osage oranges contain a chemical that might deter spiders and insects. If you can find one, cut it in half and leave the halves in the shed.You could even paint your shed blue, which is said to repel spiders. Just keep in mind there’s no scientific evidence that supports natural repellents like the color blue, vinegar, and Osage oranges., If sealing points of entry, decluttering, cleaning, store-bought insecticides, and natural repellents don’t work, it might be time to consult a professional. Spider control is usually part of the basic services provided by most professional exterminators.A first-time professional application typically costs around $100 (US). Taking care of an infestation of dangerous spiders could cost up to several hundred dollars.

You can also lay down cedar mulch in your garden or around the perimeter of your house. The strong smell of cedar will deter spiders and drive them away., Sprinkle 100% food-grade diatomaceous earth lightly on points of entry around your home, such as around window sills and doors. Keep in mind that diatomaceous earth will kill spiders, so if you only want to deter them, use a different substance.Diatomaceous earth is picked up on spiders’ legs and lower bodies and works by slowly dehydrating the spiders until they die.
Though diatomaceous earth kills spiders and insects, it is safe for you and your pets.

Slide the affected clothes through a metal hanger.Immediately before putting your clothes on, glide a wire clothes hanger through the interior of the item.,
Hide a safety pin inside your clothes.Tuck a metal safety pin into the inside seam of your garment.,
Wear a metal thimble.,
Change your shoes.Swap out your rubber-soled shoes for a pair made with leather.,
Spray hairspray on your clothes.Stand 1 foot (30.5 cm) or more back from your clothing and spritz the inside with a fine coating of standard hairspray.,
Spray fabric conditioner on your clothes.",How to Get Rid of Static Cling1,"


The metal discharges the electricity, thereby removing static. You could accomplish the same task by running another metal item over your clothes.
You can also pass a metal hanger in between your skin and your clothes after putting the clothes on. In fact, it is best to use this trick either immediately before putting the clothes on or while the clothes are on.
This trick works especially well with delicate fabrics, like silk.;
,









The metal discharges the electrical build-up in your clothes, preventing that build-up from shocking you or causing your garment to stick to your skin.
Place the pin on the inside seam of your clothes or any other covered area. Avoid placing it on the front or near an exposed hem, since others will be able to see it if you do.

, Touch everything with the thimble before touching it with your bare skin.









As with other tricks involving metal, the idea is to discharge the electrical charge to prevent static. Touching any metal object will accomplish the same goal if you do not have a metal thimble.
If you don't want to walk around with a thimble on your thumb, you can tuck it away in your pocket and pull it out only as necessary. This may also help to reduce the amount of static building up in your clothes as you walk around.
Note that this trick is more effective at preventing static shock than static cling, but it can help prevent your clothes from sticking to your skin.

,









Rubber accumulates electrical charges, and those charges are responsible for static cling.
Wearing leather shoes will help you stay grounded since leather does not build up electrical charge as easily as rubber.

,









The hairspray should be sprayed from a distance to prevent it from leaving visible traces on your clothing. For best results, focus your efforts on the areas of clothing that usually stick to you the most.
This trick should be done immediately before you wear your clothes so that it does not have time to wear off. You could also spray down your clothes after you have already put them on.
Hairspray is formulated to combat static in your hair, but it can work against static in clothing, as well.

, Spray clingy clothes with a solution made from 1 part liquid fabric softener and 30 parts water.









This formula is only a rough estimate, but the amount of water you use should be much greater than the amount of fabric softener.
Spray the areas of your clothing that are clinging to your skin. Focus on spraying the inside of the clothing, where the clothes are most likely to rub against your skin.

Moisturize your skin.,
Use silicone-based styling products on your hair.",How to Get Rid of Static Cling2," Apply the lotion to any area where your clothes stick to your skin.









By moisturizing your skin, you remove dryness that would otherwise attract the highly-charged item of clothing.
You can apply the lotion to your skin directly. Alternatively, you could rub a small amount on your hands and lightly run your hands over your skin to add a small amount of moisture.
Also rub lotion over your hands before removing laundry from the dryer or folding your clothes. Doing so prevents excess electrical charge from transferring to your dry hands and to the fabric.

, Use silicone-based conditioner and styling products after you wash your hair.









The silicone in these products coats each strand of hair, creating a barrier that neutralizes electrical charges. With the electrical charge neutralized, static is kept in check.

Air dry your clothes.,
Run a humidifier.",How to Get Rid of Static Cling3,"









For larger loads, you may need to increase this amount to 1/2 cup (125 ml) of baking soda. When used in conjunction with other static-neutralizing techniques, you can decrease the amount to roughly 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml).
Baking soda effectively creates a barrier around each garment, preventing negative and positive charges from building up and causing the garments to stick together or to themselves.
Using baking soda also has the added benefit of neutralizing odors.

, After the washing machine completes its initial wash cycle, pause the machine and pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of white distilled vinegar over your clothes. Restart the machine and allow it to continue its rinse cycle.









Vinegar softens fabrics, preventing them from becoming too stiff and dry. This also helps to reduce the amount of static build-up.
If you have a softener dispenser in your machine, you can pour the vinegar inside at the start of the entire cycle.
Do not use vinegar with bleach, as the two products combined can create a noxious gas.
White vinegar works best, but in a pinch, apple cider vinegar can also be used. You may not want to use apple cider vinegar on white or light colored clothing, though.

,









The tinfoil serves as a method of discharging positive and negative charges that the washing cycle may produce.
Only add tinfoil to the washing machine. Do not add it to the dryer, since this could pose as a hazard.

, Both liquid softener and softener sheets can help prevent static.









As wet clothes are tossed around in the dryer, they build up an electrical charge that causes them to stick together or to themselves. Fabric softeners contain chemicals designed to stop that electricity from building.
Preventing electricity from building during the washing and drying cycles can make treated clothes less dry and less likely to build up static after hanging in your closet.

, Place one or two dryer balls in your dryer before you start the cycle.









Dryer balls are designed to soften clothes without the use of chemical softeners. They help prevent clothes from becoming too stiff, and stiff clothes are more likely to develop static cling than softened clothes.
Dryer balls also minimize the amount of contact fabrics have with one another in the machine. Electrical charges build up in fabric as one piece rubs up against another, so minimizing this contact also minimizes static.

, Switch the dryer to the lowest heat setting for the last 10 minutes and throw a clean, mildly damp washcloth or towel into the machine for the remainder of the cycle.









Electrical charges are more likely to build up when the air becomes excessively dry. Adding a damp washcloth to the end of the drying cycle prevents the air inside the machine from becoming too dry.

,









The idea is to prevent static from setting in. This only works if you pull the clothes out of the dryer as soon as the cycle stops, though.

, Hang your clothes out to dry completely or pull them out of the dryer before they completely finish drying and hang dry the rest of the way.









A good portion of the electrical build-up responsible for static clean occurs when wet clothes are completely dried out using warm heat. Air drying prevents clothing from becoming extremely dry, which also prevents it from developing too much of an electrical charge.

, Place a humidifier on the floor of your closet, bedroom, or laundry room.









Using a humidifier makes the immediate space less dry. Placing it in an area where you store clothes can keep the air around those clothes semi-moist, which prevents many electrical charges from developing into static inside a garment.

, Delicates are fragile and can easily snag, stretch, or lose their shape during washing.To minimize this risk, sort your delicates by type. For example, lace should be washed with lace, cashmere with cashmere, silk with silk, and thin knits with thin knits.


Never combine a lace article with a sequined article, for instance, because the sequins might snag the lace.

, Just as you do with regular laundry, it is important to also separate delicates by color; wash whites with whites, darks with darks, and colors with colors to prevent bleeding.

, If your delicates have any clips, clasps, zippers, or buttons, be sure to do those up to reduce a chance of snagging or stretching.

, Use a pre-wash stain spray or treatment to fight stains before you put your delicates in the washing machine. This will help reduce the amount of work your machine has to do, which reduces the amount of washing stress on your delicates. Grass, dirt, oil-based, and most beverage stains can be pre-treated with dish soap, if you don't have stain spray.For stains on whites, you can use a bleach pen.
For blood or body-fluid stains, use cold tap water and light scrubbing as a pre-treatment, followed by a common hand sanitizer to disinfect the garment.

, It’s important not to crowd your delicates. By putting only a few delicates (sorted by type and color) into each mesh bag, you decrease their chances of getting stretched, snagged, or losing their shape.It’s fine to put mesh bags with different types of delicates into the same washing load (the bags will keep them safe from each other), but make sure not to mix colors.
For a standard-sized washer, you can wash two to three mesh bags (filled with a few delicates each) at once.
If the load is unbalanced, add a few sheets or towels alongside the mesh bags., Although mild detergents – like Woolite – or cold-water detergent are designed for washing delicates, they are more expensive. Most regular detergents work just as well, so use what you have on hand. Just be mindful to use the correct detergent based on the colors you are washing.

, Soaking your delicates before the actual wash is especially important for heavy stains.

, To wash delicates, you want your washer to be on the shortest, most gentle wash and spin cycles. Most modern washers have a “hand wash” option, which is best for washing delicates. Be sure to use mild or cold water, as this will prevent bleeding and shrinking., Dryer heat can ruin your delicates because it can cause shrinkage, so it's best to air dry them. However, if your dryer has a “no heat” and/or “air fluff only” setting, you can toss the mesh bags in the dryer to dry halfway.

, This is especially important for knits, cashmere, or other snuggly-fitting garments that have a specific shape to them. Water and detergent can temporarily warp these materials and cause them to dry in the shape they are in when taken from the wash if they aren't re-shaped by hand.

, Delicates dry best when they are hung over a line or laid flat to air-dry. This helps them keep their original shape intact. Once they are completely dry, it's safe to fold and store your delicates for future wear.

Air-dry your garment.",How to Wash Velvet1," Before you even consider washing your velvet clothing, make sure to read the label. If it says “dry clean only,” take it to a dry cleaner to ensure that the piece isn’t damaged. If the label only says “dry clean” then it means that dry cleaning is the preferred way to wash velvet, not the only way.


Take the velvet article to a dry cleaner if you have any doubts. This can save a cherished article of velvet clothing from irreparable damage.Consider washing any velvet with a tag that says “dry clean.” This article may not be a pure velvet and can withstand hand-washing or even the gentle cycle of your machine. For example, crushed velvet and polyester velvets are usually fine to hand- or machine wash.;
, The safest and most effective way to wash velvet is to dry clean it. You can choose to dry clean your velvet at home or take it to a professional dry cleaner.


Consider getting a commercially available home dry cleaning kit if you are worried about the cost of using a professional dry cleaner. Make sure to read the product’s instructions before dry cleaning your velvet at home. Most products have a hotline that you can call if you have any questions.
Take your velvet article to a professional dry cleaner. Remember that most dry cleaners have been trained to handle delicate fabrics like velvet. Ask your cleaner any questions you may have and make sure to point out problem spots., If your clothing item is crushed or polyester velvet, you can either throw it in the washing machine or wash it by hand in a sink or tub. Washing the article yourself can save money on dry cleaning and may be just as effective as a professional.Make sure to read the label before you start. If you have any misgivings about washing the item yourself, err on the side of caution and dry clean it at home or through a professional.
Avoid washing the item with hot water, which can shrink it and cause it to lose elasticity. Consider using a detergent for delicate fabrics or specifically for velvet. Set a washing machine to either the “gentle” or “hand wash” cycle to ensure that the machine doesn’t damage your clothing.
Hand wash your velvet by filling a tub with lukewarm or cold water and a small amount of detergent. Swish your piece of velvet clothing through the sudsy water by using gentle movements of your hand. Do this until the item is clean. Avoid scrubbing or twisting the item, which can stretch or damage the fabric. When you’re doing washing the item, empty the tub and refill it with cool water. Push the garment up and down until you don’t see any more soap or residue., You can also wash a velvet garment by just addressing individual spots or stains. This can protect your entire garment from laundering and may save you money, too.


Mix one teaspoon delicate care laundry detergent with 2 cups cold water in a tub or sink. Dip a clean, soft white cloth into the mixture and wring it out well. Dab—don’t rub-- any stains with the white cloth until all of the stains are gone. Make sure to remoisten the cloth as needed. Once the stain is gone, rinse the white cloth with cold water and wring it out. Then dab the spot to remove soap and any lingering residue.
Mix a paste of lemon juice and baking soda and dilute it with water. Gently dab the solution on the spot until it is gone. Be aware that this is a very potent combination that can damage your garment if you do not dilute the mixture or apply it lightly.Consider using a dry cleaning solvent to spot clean stains. However, be aware that they often contain harsh chemicals that can quickly damage your velvet article if not used properly.

, If you only need to make your velvet garment fresh again, use a hand held steamer. This can remove wrinkles and make the fabric appear clean and lush again. Follow up steaming with a spritz of fabric freshening spray to make it smell nice.Hold the steamer about 6 inches from the garment to prevent soaking it. Run the steamer from the outside hems toward the middle of the garment.
Consider turning the garment inside out when steaming and spritzing it with fabric freshener. This can have the same effect as directly steaming and spritzing the garment.
Try hanging the item in a steamy bathroom if you do not have a hand-held steamer. Putting a velvet garment inside of a steamy, hot shower without exposing it directly to the water stream is as effective as a steamer.

, No matter what, do not put your velvet clothing into a dryer. This can shrink the garment and ruin the fabric’s luxurious texture.Hang any item you’ve machine washed and allow it to dry thoroughly. If necessary, use a steamer to move any wrinkles.
Push out any excess water from a hand washed garment with gentle pressure. Make sure that you do not twist or wring the item. Then lay out the garment on a flat surface. Put a clean, white towel under the item to prevent discoloration and allow it to dry thoroughly.If the white towel becomes saturated, replace it with a new, dry white towel.
Consider allowing your garment to sit on top of a dryer. The gentle heat will speed up the drying process while protecting your velvet garment from damage."

Use undiluted detergent.,
Clean the entirety of the tulle.",How to Wash Tulle1," Check for any dirt and stains. If it is a dress, look at the interior, hem, and train if there is one. Take note of all of the stains or problem areas. Some problems may not be able to be fixed if damage has been done to the tulle.Spot cleaning may not be worth it if large areas of the tulle are stained.;
, Even if you have deep, set in stains, a mild remover is what you should use on tulle. A strong stain remover may remove tough stains, but it will most likely do permanent damage to the tulle. OxiClean offers a gentle stain remover, and you can also choose to make your own.Make your own mild stain remover with 1 tablespoon of baking soda, four tablespoons of mild dish soap, and eight tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide. Combine the ingredients, pour into a jar, and allow it to sit overnight., Apply the stain remover to the fabric by spraying it, or pouring a small amount directly onto the fabric or sponge. Use your fingers or a soft sponge with cold water to gently scrub the stain. Rub until you see the stain start to let up. Then, allow it to sit for thirty minutes.Do not use a hard sponge or toothbrush because the tulle could be damaged by using something too tough on it.

, If the stain is still there after thirty minutes, you can use an undiluted detergent to try to remove the stain. Use cold water and a small amount of the detergent and gently use your hand to rub it into the tulle. Rinse with cold water until all of the spot cleaner and detergent is out of the tulle. Hang it up to dry.Tide, Downy, and Arm & Hammer are a few brands of detergent you can use., Spot removing can often leave rings or marks behind. Wash all of the tulle by hand or in a washing machine if the stains have not been removed, or if marks are present from the spot removal process. If the tulle is fragile, take it to a specialist to see what can be done about it.

Check the cleaning code.,
Hire a professional.,
Vacuum the item.,
Make a lemon juice and baking soda solution.,
Test the mixture.,
Wipe away stains gently.,
Allow the item to dry thoroughly.",How to Wash Velvet2," Most pieces of furniture will have a cleaning code on the tags under or inside the article. Looking for this code can provide you the recommended and safest way to clean velvet furniture items. In general, velvet is coded as “S,” which means that it requires cleaning with solvents or dry cleaning and will not react well with water.Call the manufacturer if you cannot locate the cleaning code. Most companies will have a database of furniture items and can provide you important information about the cleaning code and caring for the piece. Ask any questions you may have in the course of your call.

, If you are unsure about your velvet furniture’s code or the piece is an heirloom or has special meaning to you, take the safest route and hire a professional cleaner. It may cost you a bit more, but a professional cleaner has the training and know-how to most effectively and safely clean velvet items.


Consider using a commercial dry cleaning kit for smaller household items such as pillow covers or duvets. Make sure to read the cleaning code and the kit information before you start any cleaning efforts.

, If you decide to spot clean your household velvet item, you should always vacuum it before you begin any washing efforts. Use your vacuum’s brush attachment and run it along the nap, which is the raised and fuzzy surface of fabrics like velvet. This will puff up the fabric and prepare it for cleaning., One of the most effective ways to remove a stain from a velvet household item is gently applying a solution of lemon juice and baking soda. These two potent ingredients can lift and remove any stains from your item.Mix two tablespoons of baking soda in a bowl filled with lemon juice. Stir the mixture until it form a good amount of foam, which is what you will use to clean the item. If you are cleaning larger objects, use a larger bowl or tub.

, Before you begin cleaning any stains or spots, or wash the entire item, it’s important to do a spot test. This can let you know if the mixture is too potent for your item. In this case, you should allow a professional to clean the object.Apply a small amount of the mixture to a spot on your item that is not visible. The can be under the object or at an inconspicuous seam. Make sure to test the mixture using the same gentle dabbing method you would on other spots.

, Just as with velvet clothing, you need to be delicate when cleaning stains on your household items. Gently dabbing or wiping away stains can ensure that your item gets clean and remains lustrous and beautiful.Skim the foam from the top of your mixture with a soft, clean cloth. Using long, straight movements, gently wipe or dab at the stains along the nap of the velvet. Make sure to not rub the solution into the fabric, which may cause stains to go deeper into the velvet or damage the item. Check the spot in between wipes to see if the stain is gone. Continue to repeat the process until the item is clean.
Remove excess solution or residue by rinsing out the cloth and dabbing the spots until you can’t detect anything on the velvet. Make sure to wring out the cloth before dabbing it on the velvet so that it doesn’t soak the item and ruin the nap or texture.

, In most cases, it won’t take a long time for a household item to dry from cleaning it. However, you may want to give it a few hours or full day to completely dry before letting others use it. This can ensure that the velvet stays lustrous and isn’t exposed to any other potential staining agents."

Make sure it isn’t too fragile.,
Lay the tulle between two towels.,
Run a bath with soap and cold water.,
Submerge the towels.,

Allow it to dry.",How to Wash Tulle2," Inspect the tulle to see if it is strong enough to withstand a thorough washing. If you have any doubts whatsoever, take it to a specialist to have a second opinion. Specialists will be able to test it to see if it is able to withstand washing.A specialist may be a dry cleaner or maker of tulle items, like tutus. Research specialists in your area on Google or in the phonebook.

, Take two clean, white towels and place the tulle in between them. You will not remove the tulle during the washing process. The towels prevent the tulle from tearing under its own weight and from floating to the top of the water.Tulle floating to the top of the water can result in uneven cleaning.

, Fill the bathtub with water. Once it is filled, add a few drops of a mild detergent or soap to the bath. If you have white tulle, you can choose to bleach it instead of cleaning it with soap. The only thing you would do differently is use warm water and an all-color bleach.Clorox 2 is a bleach that would work. Mix the bleach with a small amount of hot water and add it to the bath.

, If you are simply washing the tulle, submerge the towels for five minutes. If you are using bleach, submerge the towels from anywhere between twenty minutes and two hours. Check every twenty minutes or so if you are leaving the tulle in the bath for along period of time., Rinse the towels and tulle together thoroughly with cold water. Remove the towels from the tulle. If there are any spots left, you can gently scrub them with a soft toothbrush. Rinse until there is no soap left. Wring it out gently to remove excess water., You can choose to let the tulle dry on a dry towel, or by hanging it up. If using a towel, make sure it is clean and lay the tulle flat and wait until it dries. If hanging it up, make sure to use a plastic hanger, and hang it in a place where it has fresh air and enough open space surrounding it."

Then, turn the tulle inside out. This will prevent tearing and color fading.Loose hooks can get caught on the tulle in the washing machine and cause it to tear.

, It is not absolutely necessary, but it is safer for the tulle if you use a mesh laundry bag. Mesh laundry bags are often used to store dirty clothing, but they can also be put in the washing machine to protect delicate fabric. You can buy mesh laundry bags for fairly cheap at places like Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and online at Amazon., Make sure to use a mild detergent when washing tulle in the washing machine. Stronger detergents may remove the stains, but the tulle will probably be damaged. Dreft, Seventh Generation, and All Free and Clear offer mild detergents.Mild detergents do not have any dyes, perfumes, or any harsh chemicals.

, Set the machine to a gentle cycle. Set the time to the shortest time setting possible unless the tulle is excessively dirty. Make sure cold water is being used., You can choose to hang the tulle up to dry on a plastic hanger in an open space. Or, you can tumble dry in low heat. If the tulle is extra delicate, it is better to hang it up to dry."

Wash and dry your tie-dyed fabric with the rest of your laundry.",How to Wash Tie Dyed Fabric," Your work area should include a sink that can be washed and rinsed out with dish soap and water, usually either a kitchen or laundry-room sink. To prevent splattered dye from staining the surrounding countertop, lay down several layers of paper towels or newspapers., Fabric dye leaves strong stains that could remain on your skin for several days. Prevent these stains by wearing thick rubber gloves that reach past your wrists. Check the gloves frequently for holes or tears, and replace them if necessary.If you do get dye on your skin, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Then, mix a small amount of baking soda with a bit of water to make a paste. Apply the paste to your skin and scrub to remove dye., Your fabric needs sufficient time in the dye for the colors to set. The longer you allow the material to remain in the dye, the easier it will be to remove excess dye while still leaving behind vibrant colors and patterns. If you can, leave the item in the dye overnight., Leaving your item securely tied or rubber-banded, run it under cold water. Allow the loose dye to rinse from the material until the water runs clear. This may only take a few minutes, but rinsing times vary. Be prepared to hold the fabric under cold water for 20-30 minutes., Now that you’ve rinsed out the first portion of the loose dye, it’s time to remove the strings or rubber bands that formed your pattern. Use scissors to cut through these ties and gently unfold the material. Take a minute to enjoy seeing your fabric for the first time!, Run your item under the warmer water until this, too, runs clear. Be sure the water isn’t so hot that it burns your hands. Your rinse time will vary under the hot water as well. Generally expect to rinse for at least five minutes and up to about twenty., To prevent your fabric from staining your countertops while you prepare your washing machine, set out a layer of plastic wrap large enough to lay your material flat on top of it. For added protection, place the plastic wrap on top of the paper towels or newspapers., While you may prefer to hand wash very delicate tie-dyed fabrics such as silk or rayon, most materials do best in the washing machine. Using the machine provides the efficient and complete wash your fabric needs. Leaving loose dye in the material may cause bleeding in the colors and patterns.

If you don’t have a machine at home, ask a friend if you can use theirs. Be sure they understand that you’re washing tie-dyed material and may need to run the machine several times. You can also visit a laundromat. Check with the company to ensure they’ll allow you to wash tie-dyed fabrics.

, Just as with hand-rinsing, tie-dyed fabrics should be washed first in cold water. This allows the loose dye to slowly rinse out, preventing the fabric from losing too much color at once. Most fabrics can be washed for the full length of a normal cycle. Check any tags to ensure you’re following the proper instructions for your particular item.For rayon or other delicate fabrics, use a mesh laundry bag on the delicates cycle. This will protect those fabrics from damage. Use a mesh bag you don’t mind replacing, as it may become stained with dye.

, Synthrapol is a special detergent that’s particularly good at rinsing excess dyes from fabrics. It’s a highly concentrated substance that will create a sudsy wash, so it should only be used in top-loading washing machines. Add 1-2 tbsp. (14.79-29.57 mL) to the machine. For heavily dyed items that you’re hoping to wash more thoroughly, add up to a ¼ cup (118 mL)., To prevent front-loading machines from leaking suds, stick with regular laundry detergent. Use the normally recommended amount of detergent to wash your items. Be aware that you may need to repeat the washing process a few extra times when using regular detergent., Avoid overfilling the machine. While it’s safe to wash tie-dyed fabrics together, they need enough space in the washer to get fully washed and rinsed. You also don’t want the water to get too “muddy.”If you’re worried about your items bleeding together in the machine, you can wash them entirely separately.

, It’s a good idea to wash your tie-dyed fabric separately from your other laundry for a few more cycles. Most items will need at least one or two more washings before the loose dye is completely washed out. Continue to use either synthrapol or normal laundry detergent, depending on your type of washing machine., During these final washings, look to see if your fabric is rinsing clean. Open the washing machine (or, if you have a glass door, peek inside) during the rinse cycle to examine the water. If it looks clear instead of muddy with dye, your item is done washing. Your fabric may need to be washed in warmer water a few times before it rinses clear., Different materials require different drying methods. Cotton, for example, may shrink a bit the first time it goes through a full dryer cycle. Other, more delicate fabrics may need only a tumble-dry. Check the tag to ensure you’re drying your material correctly.If you’re worried about damage or shrinkage, allow your items to air dry.

, After you’ve rinsed, washed, and dried your tie dye, it’s ready to wear. When it’s time to clean the fabric again, you can add the items to your typical laundry load. Wash and dry them normally. Use your usual laundry detergent and dryer sheets, following the instructions for the specific material type.

If you’re worried about the bright colors fading, put your tie-dyed fabric in cold-water cycles with any other brightly colored clothing you need to wash. Use a color-safe detergent. This will extend the life of the colors.

To begin washing the garment, fill a large basin or bowl with enough lukewarm or cold water to submerge the garment inside., Add in a few drops of gentle detergent to the basin of water. Try to use an all-natural or extra gentle brand to protect the gentle fibers of the silk. Then mix the water around with your hand to mix in the soap.You can also use baby shampoo if you don’t have a fitting detergent.

, Place the garment in the water of the basin and push it under the water once to get the whole garment wet. Then let the piece of clothing soak for about 3 minutes to let the soap interact with the garment., Take the garment and gently plunge it up and down in the water to move the water through the fabric and wash out any dirt or residue. This motion simulates the motion of a washing machine but is much more gentle., Remove the garment out of the water and pour the water down the sink. Then turn on the cold water and rinse the silk garment to wash out all the soap.Move the garment around under the jet of water to rinse the entire surface of the garment. Stop when you no longer see soap suds.

, To begin the process of drying the silk garment, lay a clean towel out flat on a table or counter. Place the silk garment on top of the towel, then begin rolling the towel from one end to the other with the silk garment inside. Once you have rolled the towel all the way up, unroll the towel and take out the silk garment.Don’t wring or squeeze the rolled towel, as this can damage the silk material.

, Hang the piece of clothing up to dry on a drying rack, making sure not to place it in direct sunlight, as this could fade or damage the fibers of the silk."

Read the care tag on garments before washing them.,
Turn polyester garments inside out before washing.,
Soak white polyester fabrics overnight.,
Choose permanent press cycle for polyester fabrics.,
Use warm water when washing polyester garments.,
Pick a standard detergent that won’t be too rough on your polyester.,
Pour in some fabric softener to reduce the effects of static cling.,
Hand-wash polyester garments to protect quality.,
Use a dryer sheet with fabric softener, if you want.,
Place the fabric in the dryer on low heat.,
Air dry the fabric to protect quality and avoid shrinkage.",How to Wash Polyester," The best way to properly wash polyester clothes is the follow the directions on the care tag on the item. By following these directions, you’ll maintain the look and feel of your polyester clothes for a much longer time than you would otherwise. Consider:


Items that indicate ""Dry Clean Only"" should be taken to a professional dry cleaner instead of washed at home.
However, tags that simply say, ""Dry Clean"" may often be washed safely by hand.
When in doubt, follow the directions on the care tag.;
, A polyester-knit blend fabric can be snagged easily and may catch on clasps, trim or buttons from other items. To avoid any snags or damage to your garment, turn it inside-out before tossing it into the washing machine. , Soak white garments overnight in a mixture of 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water and 1/2 cup of automatic dishwasher detergent. This will help remove dirt and stains from your white fabrics in advance of washing them.


If you have less time, you can soak for 1-2 hours.
The dishwasher detergent helps to brighten the whiteness of the item.
Consider bleach for colors if you have extra-dirty colored polyester fabric.
Avoid using bleach when washing white polyester items., Many experts recommend using permanent press for your polyester. With permanent press, your fabrics are cooled before the spin cycle. This lowers the chance that your clothes will emerge from the washer wrinkled., Most experts agree that polyester is best cleaned with warm water. Warm water strikes the best balance to clean and protect your polyester clothes. As a result, stick to warm water if you want to prolong the life of your polyester.


Cold water may not effectively remove stains from polyester, especially oil-based stains.
Hot water may cause gradual shrinkage and color bleeding.
Warm water will help to remove stains and retain the garment's shape and size., Most standard detergents will work well with polyester fabrics. Try to avoid picking a detergent that is “tough on stains” or formulated for deep-stains. This might fade the color of your fabric or otherwise harm the quality of the fabric., Polyester is susceptible to static cling without fabric softener. Static cling is when light and small objects cling to larger objects. For example, if you wash polyester shirts with white towels, you’ll notice small pieces of white lint clinging to your polyester shirt., Hand-washing your polyester fabric is the surest way to maintain quality. But if you choose to do this, you need to make sure you’re gentle with the fabric and not in a hurry. When hand-washing:


Soak them in warm water with a light detergent.
Swirl them in warm water.
Rinse with cold clean water.
Fold them and press them against the basin side to squeeze out extra water.
Items that are stained with an oil-based stain or have yellowed with age should be machine washed to restore them to prior condition., Since polyester is susceptible to static cling, you may want to consider using a dryer sheet. A dryer sheet may help to reduce static cling in the dryer. In addition, dryer sheets might help reduce wrinkles on your polyester fabrics. Consider:


If you’ve already used a fabric softener during the wash, you don’t need to use a dryer sheet.
Most dryer sheets are scented, so make sure you pick one you like.
This is optional., Before drying your polyester fabrics in a conventional dryer, make sure to place the dryer on low heat. This is because polyester can melt or shrink when exposed to high heat levels. Depending on the reliability of your dryer, low heat is safe for most all polyester fabrics.


Run a test with a polyester fabric you don’t care too much about if you have a new or new-used dryer.
If you’re concerned about maintaining the quality of your polyester, use the lowest heat setting possible.
Read your dryer's manual if you have any questions about the heat level., One of the easiest ways to avoid shrinkage or other damage caused by drying your clothes in a conventional dryer is to air dry your polyester fabrics. Consider the following:


Hang your polyester fabrics on plastic coat hangers or a clothes line.
Make sure they’re hung outside on a dry and sunny day or in a place in your house with excellent air flow.
Take them down when they are dry."

Check that the tag recommends machine washing.,
Load the washing machine.,
Start a delicate cycle.,
Add gentle detergent.,
Soak up excess moisture after the wash. Once the wash is over, take the silk garment out of the washing machine.,
Hang the garment to dry.",How to Wash Silk Garments2," Before you put a silk garment in the washing machine, check the tag to make sure that the garment can be machine washed. Machine washing a silk garment that isn’t designed to be machine washed can wash out some of the color or damage the makeup of the silk., Once you have made sure that you can wash your silk garment, place the garment in the washing machine by itself or alongside other delicates. Use a mesh bag if you have one to protect the garment and prevent it from snagging on anything.Don’t place any heavy pieces of clothing like blue jeans in with your garment. Also avoid adding any clothing with metal buttons or snaps that the silk could snag on.

, Adjust the washer to put it on a delicate cycle. Also make sure to choose the shortest spin cycle to so that the wash is as gentle as it can be for your garment., As the water begins to fill up the washing machine, add in mild laundry detergent. Try to use natural and gentle detergent as opposed to detergent that contains brighteners or enzymes that could harm the silk., Spread out a clean towel on a counter or table and put the silk garment on top. Roll the towel with the silk garment inside from one side to another. Then unroll the towel and take the garment out., After soaking the excess moisture, lay the garment flat to dry or drape it over a drying rack. Don’t place the drying rack in direct sunlight because this can fade the garment and damage the silk material."
"
Hang the garment overnight.,
Hang the garment in the bathroom during a shower.,
Iron the garment on the “silk” setting.",How to Wash Silk Garments3," If you notice wrinkles in your silk garment, there are a few ways that you can remove the wrinkles without exposing your garment to high heat. If your silk garment only has minor wrinkles, use a plastic clothes hanger to hang the garment, making sure that the garment is hanging completely straight and isn’t folded over on itself. Keep it hanging overnight and see if the wrinkles are gone in the morning., If simply hanging the garment overnight didn’t straighten out the wrinkles, keep the garment on the hanger and hang it from the towel rack in the bathroom while you are taking a shower. The indirect heat from the shower is a gentle way of straightening out wrinkles., If you didn’t succeed in getting out stubborn wrinkles, check the garment tag to see if it can be ironed. If so, dampen the silk garment in the sink and turn it inside out. Turn the iron onto the cool “silk” setting, then iron gently.


Make sure to use a cool iron setting, because the hot setting can pucker or even burn the silk.

Stuff the Lycra into a mesh bag.,
Add a mild detergent to the machine.,
Set the washer for a delicates cycle.",How to Wash Lycra1," A mesh laundry bag holds clothing so it is protected during the machine cycle. The tumbling of the machine makes it easy for a button or other object to get stuck in loose Lycra and stretch it. If you don’t have a bag, try an old pillow case., Don’t use anything harsh to clean the Lycra. Get a detergent made for delicate clothing or even athletic wear. Add the detergent after the machine fills with water, if possible.To remove bad odors, add a splash of vinegar to the wash. Place it in the fabric softener slot. Make sure your detergent doesn’t have chlorine in it when using vinegar.
Never use chlorine bleach to treat Lycra.

, Lycra needs to be washed in cold water so heat doesn’t ruin the fibers. The delicate setting, if your washer has one, uses cold water and minimal tumbling. Choose the lowest heat setting on your device. The water temperature should be no more than 86℉ (30℃)."

Remove the clothing and dump out the soapy water.,
Return the delicates to the spinner, fill it with water, and spin.,
Pour out the water, and clean the spinner.,
Spin the delicates several times to get out moisture.,
Allow your items to air dry the rest of the way.",How to Wash Your Delicates with a Salad Spinner," Take the bowl from your salad spinner and fill it approximately halfway with lukewarm water. Next, mix in some laundry detergent for delicates according to the bottle’s instructions until the water becomes soapy.If you don’t have laundry detergent for delicates, you can substitute baby shampoo because it’s gentle enough not to damage the clothing.;
, Once the salad spinner is filled with soapy water, gather your delicates and fasten all of the closures, such as buttons, hook-and-eyes, and buckles. Turn the items inside outside to protect them during washing as well.If there are any loose buttons or other damaged closures on the delicates, repair them before washing them in the salad spinner. While the spinner doesn’t move the items as aggressively as a washing machine, the movement can still cause buttons and other closures to come loose.

, When the delicates are ready for washing, place them in the salad spinner so they’re submerged in the soapy water. Allow them to soak for 2 to 5 minutes to give the detergent a chance to penetrate the fabric.When you first place the clothing in the water, it’s a good idea to knead them gently. That helps work the detergent into the fabric so it can get the dirt and stains out more easily.

, After you’ve let the items soak for several minutes, place the lid on the salad spinner. Next, pump the spinner to spin the items in the water several times to ensure that delicates are washed thoroughly.The number of times that you should spin the items depends on how dirty they are. If they are lightly soiled, spinning the items for one minute is usually sufficient. For items that are dirtier, you may want to spin them for two to three minutes.  

, Once you’ve finished spinning your delicates in the soapy water, remove them from the spinner and place them on a towel. Dump out the dirty water, and rinse the spinner thoroughly to ensure that it’s clean.There’s no need to dry the inside of the salad spinner after rinsing it, but you may want to quickly wipe it down with paper towel to make sure it’s not dirty.

, When the spinner is empty, place your delicates back inside. Add enough cool water to cover the items, and spin the spinner several times to thoroughly rinse the delicates of the dirt and soap residue.If the items still seem soapy after you rinse them, you may want to repeat the process. Dump out the water, refill the spinner with cool, clean water, and spin the delicates again until they are completely rinsed.

, After the delicates are fully rinsed, take them out of the spinner and dump out the water. Rinse the spinner’s bowl under running water to remove any residue, and wipe down the interior with a piece of paper towel to ensure that it’s clean and dry.Place the wet delicates on a towel after you remove them from the spinner. You can squeeze the items inside the towel once or twice to start the drying process.

, When the spinner is clean and dry, place the delicates back inside. Spin the items several times to drive the excess water out of the fabric to help dry them.The longer you spin your delicates, the less time it will take them to dry afterward. On average, though, spinning them 4 to 5 times is usually sufficient to drive out the excess moisture.

, After you’ve spun your delicates to remove the excess water, take them out of the spinner. Lay them flat on a clean towel to air dry.You can also hang your items to dry if you prefer. However, be sure to use a non-metal hanger to avoid warping your delicates.

Squeeze out excess water.",How to Wash Lycra2," Wash the Lycra in a sink or tub. Fill the container with enough water to soak the clothing. Make sure the water is cold or lukewarm before adding the item. Never clean Lycra with hot water. It’ll cause stains to set as well as damage the item’s threads., Pick a mild laundry soap such as one made for delicates. It shouldn’t have any chlorine bleach in it. Mix in the detergent so it appears soapy.

, Put a little bit of the soap on your finger. Be gentle. Don’t try to scrub out the stains. Rub the detergent into the stains to help lift them., To combat bad odors such as from after a workout, treat the Lycra with vinegar. Add one part vinegar to four parts water. Let the clothing soak for at least 30 minutes. Lycra that doesn’t smell badly doesn’t need to be treated this way.A cup of baking soda can also be substituted in for the vinegar.
Treat stains before tackling odors.

, Place the clothing under cold or lukewarm running water. Again, don’t use hot water. Use the water to remove any detergent left on the Lycra., Don’t wring the clothing. Be very gentle to avoid damaging the fibers. Squeeze out what you can, then move on to drip drying the Lycra."

Roll the Lycra up in a towel.,
Air dry away from direct sunlight.,
Machine dry the clothing on a low heat setting.",How to Wash Lycra3," Lay a towel flat. Place the Lycra item in the center of the towel. Next, fold the edges up over the clothing. Roll up the clothing. Gently squeeze out excess water, then lay the towel and clothing flat again., Heat and direct sunlight are damaging to the stretchy Lycra fibers. To keep your clothing fresh, pick a safe area. Find an out of the way area where you can lay out a towel.Hang drying is a quicker alternative, but the water pulling downwards will stretch out the Lycra over time.
Avoid using an iron on full Lycra clothing. On Lycra blends, if you still want to risk ironing, use as low a heat setting as possible.

, Set the laundry bag filled with Lycra items in the dryer. The heat of a dryer can be harmful to the stretch of the fabric, so pick the lowest heat setting you can find. Pick the delicates setting, if your machine has it, or a low heat tumble dry.Air drying is the better alternative. Machine dry only when you’re short on time.
Don’t use fabric softener when Lycra is being dried.

Vacuum the felt.,
Steam clean your felt.",How to Wash Felt1," If there is surface dirt on the felt, gently brush it away with a soft bristled toothbrush. Brush only in one direction. Don’t rub in a circle or up and down. Scrubbing in alternate directions can cause the material to pile up., Dip a cloth in some warm water until the cloth is slightly damp. Press and dab at the dirt with light pressure, making sure not to rub. This may help remove some of the dirt., If there is loose dirt and dust on the felt, you can try to vacuum it away. Use a small vacuum nozzle and run it over the felt. If the suction on your vacuum is too hard, you can place some old panty hose or tights over the nozzle to help.Be careful when vacuuming around beading or ribbons. Make sure they are secure so you don’t suck them off the felt.

, You can clean your felt at home by steaming it. Use a tea kettle or pot and boil water in it. When the water starts steaming, place the felt over the steam. In your other hand, hold a soft sponge, lint-free cloth, or soft bristled brush. While holding the item in place, use the soft tool to gently brush the dirty area.This can be time consuming since you can only clean a little bit at a time.

Pick a mild detergent for delicate clothes.,
Try a no rinse detergent for silk and lace.,
Use detergent with lanolin for wool and fine knits.,
Wash light and dark clothes separately.,
Fill two tubs with water.,
Add the detergent to one tub.,
Wash the clothes in the water.,
Rinse the clothes in the other tub.,
Do not wring out the clothes.,
Lay the clothes flat to dry.,
Flip the clothes over to dry completely.",How to Wash Clothes by Hand," Mild detergent is fine to use for most clothing items as long as they are not made of delicate fabrics like silk, lace, wool, or fine-knit material. Look for liquid detergent that is made for delicate clothing. Brands like Woolite or Soak are good options.In a pinch, a regular detergent like Tide or Gain will work for delicate clothing that’s not made of lace, silk, or wool.
Baby shampoo or mild liquid soap would also work well.;
, For clothes made of delicate fabrics like silk and lace, go for a detergent that does not require any rinsing once you have soaked the clothes with it in water. This will make cleaning silk and lace clothing easier, and ensure the clothing is not damaged by too much rinsing.You can find no rinse detergents online or in the detergent aisle at your local store.

, Lanolin is a natural oil produced by sheep to help waterproof their fleece coats. It also makes wool and fine knit garments softer. Use a detergent with lanolin on any wool or fine knit clothing so they stay soft and do not get damaged during washing.You can find detergent with lanolin online or in the detergent aisle of your local store.

, Start with the lightest colored items first. Save the darker colored items for last. Wash each item one at a time to avoid bleeding color from one item to another.If you have a new item of clothing that is dyed or colored, wash it separately in a different tub or basin so the color does not get on other clothing.

, Use wide deep tubs that can fit at least one item of clothing. You can also use your sink as a basin. Fill both tubs ¾ full with water that is 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), or just warm to the touch. Water that is too hot can make clothing dye bleed, and water that is too cold will not remove stains well.








If you are worried about shrinkage, use colder water in both tubs to prevent any shrinking of the clothing with warmer water.

, Use one teaspoon (5 grams) of detergent for one item of clothing. Mix the detergent into the water.








You can then add one teaspoon (5 grams) more detergent per item to the water if you are washing more than one item of clothing at a time.

, Put the clothes in tub with the water and the detergent until they are submerged. Then, use your hands to gently move the clothes around in the water so dirt is removed. Make a swishing action with the clothes in the water. Continue doing this for two to three minutes, or until the clothes look clean.









Do not scrub, twist, or rub the clothes in the water, as this can damage them.
Do not let the clothes soak in the water for longer than three to four minutes, as this can lead to shrinkage.

, Once you have washed the clothes well, remove them from the water. Then, carefully place them in the other tub of clean water. Rinse the clothes by pulling them in and out of the water for two to three minutes. This will help to remove any soap still on them.








Check that the clothes look clean, not soapy. If there is still soap on them, dump out the water in the tub and rinse them again with clean water.
If you are using a no rinse detergent to clean the clothes, you can skip this step.

, Avoid twisting and wringing the clothes to dry them. This can warp the clothes and damage them. Instead, lift the clothes above the water and let excess water drip off it it into the tub or basin., Place the wet clothes on a clean surface, such as a countertop or a table. Re shape the clothes so they lie flat and in their natural shape.You can also lay the clothes on a drying rack as long as they lay flat and do not hang off of the rack vertically. Hanging the clothes vertically can ruin its shape.

, Wait two to four hours for the clothes to dry on one side. Then, flip the clothes over so the other side can dry. Let the clothes dry overnight and check that both sides are dry in the morning."

Separate your sheets according to color.,
Pre-treat flannel sheets with vinegar.,
Set the washing machine to a low temperature.,
Add a small amount of mild detergent.,
Wash the sheets on a gentle cycle.",How to Wash Flannel Sheets1," Before you begin washing, sort your bedding into two or more separate piles: lights, darks and colors. Washing dark or brightly colored sheets with white ones could cause bleeding or fading, leaving your sheets with a dingy, discolored look.In addition to sorting lights and darks, it may also be a good idea to wash dissimilar colors like red and blue separately.
As long as you don’t mix-and-match your flannel bedding, you should have no problem keeping it separated when it comes time to do laundry.;
, The first time you put your flannel bedding through the wash, add one half cup (120ml) of distilled white vinegar. The acidity in the vinegar will prevent pills from forming. It also has the added bonus of locking in colors, making them less likely to run during future washings.Pills are little clumps of tangled napping, or the loose fibers on the surface of flannel. Pilling occurs when fabrics like flannel aren’t properly maintained.
Adding a splash of vinegar to the wash cycle now and then may also help keep your sheets fluffy and free of oily residue.

, It’s best to wash your flannel sheets with warm water, although some manufacturers even recommend that the water be cold. Lower temperatures will be easier on the delicate structure of the fabric as well as the color.High temperatures can shrink the tiny fibers in flannel, resulting in pilling and a less comfortable sleeping experience.

, Choose a detergent that’s been specially formulated for use on delicates. Be careful not to use more than necessary—some detergents contain chemicals that put fabrics (especially soft ones like flannel) in danger of fading.


A color-protecting detergent will come in handy for preserving the look of brightly colored bedding.
Add colored detergents to a laundry ball or the dispenser on the washing machine so you don’t have to pour them directly onto the sheets themselves.

, A slow setting that uses minimal agitation is perfect for cleaning flannel sheets without harming the delicate weave of the threads. When you’re loading the washer, be sure to distribute the bedding evenly throughout the drum to prevent it from becoming bunched or tangled. If your washing machine doesn’t have an option for different wash cycles, set it to a timed wash for the shortest duration."
"
Handwash the item.,
Wash the felt item on the delicate cycle.,
Remove excess water.,
Air dry the item.",How to Wash Felt2," The best way to clean felt is to handwash the item in a sink. Use cool water. Handle the felt carefully as you move it around. Gently squeeze it a few times to wash it.Using hot water can damage the felt fabric.
Some people use mild detergents, while others think using detergent will cause fuzzing on the surface.

, Though most felt items should not be washed, if you have an item you want to machine wash, you should wash it on the delicate cycle. Use a gentle detergent, like Woolite.Only wash the felt in a washing machine when it is extremely dirty, smells terrible, or you have tried everything else.
Don’t wash felt items often. Only do this occasionally.

, You can remove excess water from the felt by pressing it between two towels. Don’t twist or squeeze out water. Flatten the felt as much as possible to its original shape., You shouldn’t dry the item in the dryer. Instead, you should air dry them. This may be on a clothing line or on a hanger in your home. Just make sure you place it in a cool area and not in the direct sun."
"
Determine if your felt is wool felt or synthetic felt.,
Use a home dry cleaning kit.,
Take the item to the cleaners.",How to Wash Felt3," Wool felt reacts more negatively to washing than synthetic felt. Wool felt may shrink, bleed, or start to fuzz. Synthetic felt typically can be washed without too many problems. If you have wool felt, take more care washing it. If you have synthetic felt, it will probably be more durable.Wool felt should be dry cleaned because you could damage it by wet cleaning it.

, Many cleaning companies, such as Clorox, Proctor & Gamble, and Dial, have dry cleaning kits on the market. These kits come with directions that will walk you through the cleaning process so that you can safely clean your item.These kits cost around $10.

, If you have the time and money, you can take your felt article of clothing to the cleaners. A professional dry cleaner can clean the felt, which may be helpful if you’re nervous about trying or don’t want to mess up the item."
"
Dry the sheets on low heat.,
Allow the sheets to air dry.,
Replace or put away the sheets.",How to Wash Flannel Sheets2," As with washing, drying flannel sheets with too high a temperature may lead to shrinkage and pilling. To prevent this, always select the lowest available heat setting, or simply let your sheets tumble dry. It will take longer, but it will be worth it to preserve the comfortable feel of your bedding.Give yourself plenty of time to get your laundry taken care of so you won’t have to worry about soggy sheets at bedtime.

, If space permits, you might also choose to dry your flannel sheets by hanging them up. After removing the sheets from the washer and wringing out any excess water, stretch out the sheets to expose as much surface area as possible and hang them on a clothesline or drying rack.Save money on your energy bill by getting the sheets started in the dryer, then letting them finish air drying.
If it’s a nice day, you can speed up the drying process by placing the damp sheets in direct sunlight. Not only will the warmth of the sun help them dry faster, sunlight also makes a great natural disinfectant and deodorizer., Once your sheets are dry, you can put them right back on your bed, or neatly fold them and stash them in the linen closet until cold weather comes around again. Leaving them to sit in a pile makes them more susceptible to wrinkles.


Be sure to check your bedding for large pills, lint and loose threads.Give the sheets a good shake to fluff them up before making the bed.

"
"
Treat stains right away.,
Avoid using fabric softeners.,
Change out your sheets periodically.",How to Wash Flannel Sheets3," Once stains set into a soft surface like flannel, they can be next to impossible to remove completely. In the event of spills, leaks and other accidents, blot the affected area with a damp cloth while it’s still wet. Afterwards, clean your bedding as usual, adding one quarter to one half a cup (60-120ml) of white vinegar to the washing machine as it fills.Use a mixture of warm water, hydrogen peroxide and mild liquid detergent to deal with substances that are likely to leave stains, like coffee or red wine.Be careful not to scrub the sheets too forcefully—over time, it’s possible to wear holes into the fabric.

, Though they may sound like a good thing, the chemicals in fabric softeners have a tendency to coat and stiffen flannel fibers. Over time, this can leave your sheets feeling waxy. It’s also a good idea to say no to dryer sheets for the same reason.To keep older flannel sheets soft to the touch, try throwing a couple (clean) tennis balls into the dryer with them. The movement of the tennis balls will help loosen up clumped fibers.
One of the main selling points of flannel is that it’s already soft, so there’s no need to use a lot of conditioners and other products to keep it that way., Rather than constantly washing and reusing the same set of sheets, invest in one or two additional sets and cycle them out between uses. Each set will last longer, and you’ll appreciate the fresh new look your bed gets every time you do laundry.Remember to keep lights, darks and colored sheets separated in the wash.

For jackets: Jackets have to be washed with proper care.,
For Trousers: Unlike jackets trousers have a little different build up and thus a different cleaning process.,
Your waterproof jacket and trousers are now stain proof and are now as new as when they were purchased.

",How to Wash and Reproof Waterproof Jackets and Trousers1," The following steps will make it clear on how to wash your jacket:




Check for any unwanted material in the jacket pockets and remove them. Now close all the zippers and Velcro flaps present in your jacket. This is to ensure that nothing unwanted goes in or comes outside while washing.
Dry-brush the jacket with a soft bristled nail brush or a toothbrush to remove any mud, grease or any easily removable stains. Use a minute quantity of spot fabric remover solution to ease the process.
Now put a moderate quantity of waterproofing liquid cleaner like Granger's and Nikwax in the washing machine and use cold water for washing. These waterproofing liquids preserve the DWR (durable water repellent) layer of the jacket while ensuring to remove dirt, oils and stains without harming the DWR. These liquids will make your jacket work like new again and will restore its original performance. For stubborn grease and dirt use non biological detergent containing no softeners or conditioners provided the care label on your jacket allows it.


Now machine wash your jacket at 30 °C (86 °F) for a short interval of time while ensuring that the jacket doesn't start bubbling while inside the washing machine.


As the cycle gets over , put the jacket for Tumble drying at a low heat setting (Duration: 20 minutes or as instructed on care label) to rejuvenate the DRW layer.(Skip if care label doesn't allow tumble drying)
Now hang the jackets in hangers and let them air dry in shade.
If you prefer a hand wash then use a slightly lukewarm water with a little amount of liquid cleaner or special cleaners to wash your jacket. Avoid using detergents and detergent based soaps or fabric softeners as they affect the DRW layer of waterproof jacket. After washing once Wash under running water to get rid of any leftovers. Also, Avoid scrunching or kneading as this will crush the feather stalks. (Duration: 15min approx.)
After washing just roll the jacket or shake it to get rid of excessive water. Now hang it in a hanger under shade for air drying.;
, Here are the steps to wash a waterproof trouser:


Wear your trousers and also wear some waterproof shoes.

If your trousers are made up of rubberized Flexothane then wash them with a solution of hot washing up liquid and use a hog brush to brush away the stains
If you are wearing the woven type then you can probably wash them with cool washing up liquid with a little biological powder but make sure you brush the mud off first.
Now as the washing is over, try drying with a sponge or just jump here and there a little to get rid of all droplets. Now remove them and leave for air drying in a hanger.

Read the garment's label.,
Mix soap with cold water in a basin or bucket.,
Dip the garment in and out of the soapy water.,
Rinse the garment.,
Lay the garment out on a clean absorbent towel.,
Reshape the garment and lay it flat to dry.",How to Wash a Dry Clean Only Garment1," If the item is made from wool, silk, or cotton, you may gently wash it by hand.


Avoid washing suede, leather, fur, feathers, and other extremely fragile fabrics by hand. These should be taken to the dry cleaner for a professional cleaning.;
, Use soap flakes or a mild detergent, and agitate the water a bit so that it produces some foam.


Never use hot water on items that are meant to be dry cleaned. It will damage the fibers and cause the fabric to shrink.
Woolite is an acceptable detergent to use when hand washing wool.

, Submerge it completely, then lift it from the water and dip it again.


Rub any areas that are soiled, such as the armpits and collars, using your finger tips.
Don't use an abrasive scrubber on the clothing, since this may damage the fibers.

, Drain the basin of soapy water and fill it with fresh cold water. Dip the garment in and out of the clean water until it is no longer covered in soap.

, Roll the towel up with the item inside, squeezing gently to remove water.


Unroll the towel, move the garment to a dry spot, then roll the towel again. Repeat the process three to five times until the garment is no longer dripping.
Do not wring the garment out, since you could damage the fragile fibers.

, If it is made from a stiffer fabric that won't get misshapen by hanging, place it on a hanger and hang it up to dry.

Re-proofing your jacket is required to restore its breathability, comfort and performance so it can continue to protect you.,
If you have noticed the above symptoms then its time you reproof your waterproofing jacket or trouser.",How to Wash and Reproof Waterproof Jackets and Trousers2," Over time waterproof jackets and trousers lose their water repellent ability or breathability. One can make out these signs when they notice the following symptoms:


When water starts soaking into the fabric of your waterproof clothing instead of just slipping away on the outer surface.
The water repellent coating has worn off and you start getting wet from your sweat inside.
Increased weight of the jacket or trouser.

, Follow the following to reproof your waterproof jackets and trousers:


Once wash your jackets and trousers to get rid of all stains and dirt.
Spray a waterproofing agent on to it while ensuring a proper spread on the whole jacket.(spray from a distance to increase spread area) Some sprays work best on dampened jackets and trousers so spray them while they are still wet.
Now tumble dry it at a medium heat (for best results use the temperature mentioned on the bottle of spray) set to activate waterproofing.
If you don't have a spray then use the normal tech cleaner, such as Granger's 30'c wash as we did while washing.
For trousers instead of simple drying, use the tumble drying to reproof it.

Fill a small plastic tub with cold water.,
Mix in a mild cleanser.,
Spot test your hat.,
Soak the entire hat.,
Rinse the hat.,
Remove excess water.,
Allow the hat to air dry.",How to Wash a Hat1," Warm or hot water can cause colors to run and may even cause the hat to shrink depending on the material. You only need enough space to keep the hats submerged. If you only want to wash one or two hats, you can even use a large plastic bowl instead of a tub.


This method works best for hand-knitted hats or delicate baseball caps that you're afraid will come undone or stretch out in a washing machine.If you knitted the hat yourself, check the yarn label for washing instructions.;
, Stir about a teaspoon of detergent or soap into the water until it is completely dissolved. The type of cleanser you use will be determined by the material your hat is made of and what kind of grime you're trying to remove.


If your knit hat is woolen, you should select a soap that is specially formulated for wool fabric. This will reduce the chance of pilling, discoloration, and other types of damage. If this type of cleaner is unavailable, a mild detergent without bleach or other additives may work.
Never use chlorine bleachor enzyme treatments on woolens., If you're using this method on a hat for the first time, you should soak a small patch before immersing the whole garment. Hold the patch underwater for about two minutes.


Check for bleeding colors while the hat is still wet. You may notice dye coming off in the water. If you don't, try dabbing the hat on a light surface or object.
When dabbing the patch, make sure to do so with something that is either easy to bleach or that you don't mind discoloring.
Pick a part of the hat that is not easily visible to others when you wear it. That way, if the discoloration is noticeable, it won't affect the hat's overall look.
If you don't notice any bleeding colors or general discoloration, you can move onto the next step.

, If your test patch does not show any signs of damage after two minutes, go ahead and submerge the entire hat. For a light, ordinary cleaning, you only need to soak the hat for roughly 30 minutes. If there is mud caked onto the hat or if the dirt is more stubborn, you may need to soak the hat for a few hours., Remove the hat from the soapy water. Rinse it under a strong, steady stream of running tap water to get all of the detergent out. Keep using cold water to prevent discoloration and shrinkage. Continue rinsing until it no longer feels sticky and no additional soap can be spotted., Hold the hat in between your hands and gently squeeze your hands together. Place the hat on a clean towel and continue patting it until there is no longer any water dripping out of it. Do not wring or twist the hat, as doing so may distort your hat's shape or cause pilling., Place the knit hat in a location with good air circulation. Lay it out flat on a towel and arrange it in its original shape. You can speed the process up by running an electric fan nearby on low power, but do not use a hot blow dryer. Heat may cause your hat to shrink. Do not place the hat near direct sunlight, which may cause your hat to fade."

Brush the dirt spots on your suede.You can find brushes specifically made for cleaning suede at stores like Target or Walmart.,
Erase over the stain.,
Repeat the process.",How to Spot Clean Suede1," However, a toothbrush or generic clean scrub brush will also work.


The bristles on your brush should be fairly stiff to clean well.
This method works well for getting the scuff and dirt marks off of suede shoes.
First, lightly brush across the suede in one direction to remove the top layer of dirt.
Then, brush back and forth over the area of suede with the stain. Use short, quick strokes to avoid making any marks on your suede.;
, Once you’ve brushed off all the dirt that you can, use an eraser to rub over the stain area.Art gum erasers work best for this task. Don’t use a colored eraser, as this can make the stain worse rather than erasing it.
Don’t be afraid to rub at the stain vigorously.
Consider laying out a towel as your work station, as the eraser can get messy and leave small pieces on your floor, table, or clothes.

, Brush and erase your suede stain several times before moving on to another method of stain removal. It can take a bit of time and elbow grease to really remove a stain.


This method is great because it doesn’t involve any cleaning substances that could potential harm or mark your suede.

Scrape solid waste from the diapers and flush it down the toilet.,
Run your diapers through a cold wash cycle.,
Allow the diapers to go through a cold rinse cycle.,
Fill a small cotton drawstring bag with four or five whole soap nuts and draw the bag closed.,
Place the bag in the washing machine with the pre-washed, wet cloth diapers.,
Alternatively, add 3 tablespoons of soap nut liquid into the wash instead of the bag of whole nuts.,
Run the cloth diapers through a cold rinse cycle, but do not remove the soap nuts.,
Dry the diapers as usual.,
Save your bag of soap nuts after the wash. At minimum, soap nuts can be reused four times without losing effectiveness.",How to Wash Cloth Diapers With Soap Nuts," Note that this step only applies if your baby or toddler is already on solid foods and, as a result, also has solid waste. Fluid waste will come out in the wash and does not need to be removed beforehand.;
, Cold water is preferable to hot water, since hot water is more likely to set stains into the cloth. Do not add the soap nuts yet, since this is only a pre-wash cycle meant to remove additional waste. Instead, add 1/2 cup baking soda or washing soda to the cold wash to aid in the removal of stains and odors.

, The rinse cycle will flush away any baking soda and may help in the further removal of solid waste.

, Many soap nut sellers will include a bag with the purchase of your nuts, but if you do not receive a bag, simply choose one made of thin cotton that seals tightly upon being drawn. The bag must allow the saponin to seep through, but it must also prevent the nuts themselves from falling out and bouncing around the washing machine. Break the nuts apart so the water can circulate in them freely.


Check the soap nut label for more specific instructions on how to determine the correct number of nuts to use. Usually it is between 3 and 8 soap nuts.

, There is no need to dry the diapers before starting this new cycle. Run the machine through a hot washing cycle. Do not use cold water this time. Hot water is needed in order to release the saponin, which acts as the cleaning agent inside the nut.

, Soap nut liquid is made from real soap nuts, contains no chemical additives, and works just as effectively as the actual nuts themselves. Add the liquid directly into the machine’s bucket with the cloth diapers. Do not add it into any of the compartments meant for liquid fabric softener or bleach.

, The soap nuts will not leave any residue on the diapers as long as you use cold water to rinse them. Moreover, the nuts actually act as a natural fabric softener, and keeping them in for both the wash and rinse cycles improves the softness of your diapers upon removal from the machine.

, Pin them to a clothesline and allow them to dry in the sun or toss them directly into the dryer. Do not dry the diapers with your cloth nuts, though. The nuts should be removed as soon as the final rinse cycle completes itself and serve no purpose in the drying cycle.

, Some soap nuts may even be used up to ten times. Check the seller’s label to verify how often your nuts can be safely reused.

Place the garment in the dry cleaning bag.,
Place the bag in the dryer.,
Place the garment on a hanger.",How to Wash a Dry Clean Only Garment3," These kits come with a bottle of stain remover, dry cleaning sheets, and a dry cleaning bag.

, Dry cleaning kits are useful for silks, polyesters, and other delicates that are not heavily soiled. If your garment is heavily soiled, it's best to take it to the dry cleaner instead.

, The stain remover that comes with dry cleaning kits is the same as stain remover that you buy separately at the store Apply it according to the instructions it came with.


If you're concerned that the stain remover may leave a mark on your clothing, do a spot test in a discreet place to make sure it's safe to use.
Don't use stain remover on large stains. If a stain is covering a large spot on your clothing, it's best to take it to a dry cleaner instead of trying to remove it at home.

, Add a dry cleaning sheet to the bag. The sheet will release perfume and a little moisture to freshen the garment during the dry cleaning process.

, Start the dryer's gentle cycle, making sure the dryer is set to use only low heat. When the cycle is complete, remove the bag from the dryer.

, As the garment airs out, the wrinkles should ""fall out,"" and the dry-cleaning process will be complete.

Place delicate knit hats in a laundry bag.,
Prepare a large load if possible.,
Start the wash cycle on cold before adding your laundry.,
Add a cap of liquid soap or detergent.,
Let the laundry soak.,
Run your washer on ""spin-only."",
Allow your hats to air dry.",How to Wash a Hat2," Some hand-knit hats, especially those made with wool, can get damaged by the motion of the washer. To prevent this from happening, place these hats in a pillowcase, netted intimates bag, or washable garment back. Close the bag by its drawstring or tie the top if it doesn't have one. This will prevent your hat from falling out, which is especially important if you're doing a small load.Be careful which knit items you choose to wash using this method. If your hat is made from acrylic, superwash wool, or cotton yarn, then it is likely to be fine in the washer. However, wool that is not specifically labeled as ""superwash"" or otherwise machine-washable may felt in a washer, ruining your garment., Knits are more likely to felt in an under-loaded washer. Although your laundry bag should protect your hat, the bag may end up undone during the wash cycle. Make sure that the other items are of like colors. Ideally these items should be knit, as well.

, Allow the washer to fill with cold water. Pause the machine before the agitation cycle begins and add your garments.If you have a front-loading washer, go ahead and load your laundry as normal before starting. While it isn't ideal, your hat is likely to be fine.

, If you're washing wool items, a specialty wool detergent works best. These detergents often contain lanolin, which will condition your wool to decrease static and increase water resistance. If you aren't washing wool or you can't find a specialty detergent, use any mild liquid detergent that is free of bleach and other harsh chemicals., Do not re-start your washer. Allow the load to soak for at least one hour. Especially-soiled items may need to be left overnight. Don't be alarmed if your wool items float to the top at first. They will eventually take on enough water and sink back down on their own., This will put your garments through what is normally the last part in a wash cycle. The washer will very mildly agitate its contents before draining off the soapy water. The spin cycle will also work to partially dry out your garments by removing excess water through centripetal force. If your items are still soaking wet, run them through the spin cycle once more., Spread a clean, dry towel out on a flat surface. Lay your knit garment(s) spread out on top of it. A well-ventilated location, such as a room with a ceiling fan, works best. Allow the hats to dry naturally. This should only take a few hours."
"
Pre-treat the liner or headband.,
Toss your cap in with your normal laundry.,
Leave your cap to air dry.",How to Wash a Hat3," The liner is likely to be the dirtiest part of your cap, as it soaks up sweat and skin oils while wearing. Pick an enzyme-based laundry pre-spray and spritz some on to break down this type of grime.


Most modern baseball caps made in the last 10 years or so can be easily machine washed without issue.
It's better to hand wash wool baseball caps.
Older baseball caps tend to have cardboard brims. These caps should never be soaked completely in water. Instead, it's best to clean them with a spray bottle and washcloth., At this phase, treat your cap like any other type of laundry. Pair your cap with similarly-colored clothing and use whichever laundry detergent you prefer.


Wash with cold water for the best results. However, warm water should be fine, too. Do not use hot water when washing your cap.
Do not use bleach., Once the wash cycle has finished, remove your cap and place it on a flat surface in a well-ventilated area. You may choose to position an electric fan nearby to speed up the drying process. Do not put your cap in the clothes dryer; it would likely shrink or lose its shape."

Verify that the straw hat can be washed.,
Remove any decorative pieces, if possible.,
Sponge lightly with a washcloth.,
Clean the whole hat using a hydrogen peroxide solution.",How to Wash a Hat4," Some types of straw are too delicate to wash, even by hand. Most straw hats are made from sturdier types of straw, however, which makes a gentle hand-washing possible. Check the manufacturer's tag. Baku and shantung straw is likely to be sturdy.If you are unable to find out what type of straw the hat is made from, gently bend the rim of the hat. If it resists or begins to draw back to its original shape slightly, it might be durable enough. If it bends easily or starts to fray, it is too delicate.

, Ropes, ribbons, buttons, or other elements are often held onto a straw hat with small pieces of crafting wire. Wire can be easily unwound so that the decorations are simple to remove. If the decorations are held on by thread, however, you do not need to remove them. You are more likely to damage them when trying to sew them back on rather than while cleaning.

, For light cleaning that can't be done with a brush, use a damp washcloth. Carefully dab the hat directly, sweeping away grime from its surface. Do not allow the straw to become damp itself., If simple water isn't working to clean your hat, you can use hydrogen peroxide as a gentle cleaner. Fill a spray bottle, half with hydrogen peroxide and half with water.


Spray the solution onto a soft cloth. Carefully wipe down the entire hat with the cloth.
For especially stubborn stains, spray the solution directly onto the hat and wipe it off with a washcloth. Avoid soaking the straw, as this may cause it to warp and shrink."

Apply white vinegar to the stain.The vinegar helps to break up the stain and bring it to the surface so that you can wipe it away.,
Use rubbing alcohol for ink stains.,
Repeat this process with patience.",How to Spot Clean Suede2,"


Vinegar works well as a cleaning agent for suede because it doesn’t stain. It’s also a natural option.
Dampen a clean cloth or cotton ball with vinegar, and lightly wipe it over the stained area.
If the cloth or cotton ball becomes too dirty while you are still cleaning, use a new one so that you don’t spread the stain back onto your suede item.

, If the stain is fresh, first try to soak up as much of the ink as you can with a clean cloth. Then, use rubbing alcohol.


Apply rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball. Then, dab it on the stain area.
Repeat this a few times with clean cotton balls.
Make sure to keep a light touch on your suede.

, Rather than rubbing hard on your stain with your cotton ball or cloth of either vinegar or rubbing alcohol, you want to softly keep repeating the process.


Change out your cotton ball often in order to remove as much of the stain as possible.
It can be helpful to first use a cleaning brush to brush over the stain and use an art gum eraser to erase what you can of the stain. Then, you will have less to remove with the alcohol or vinegar method.

Use a cloth or napkin to remove what you can.This is especially important if you notice a stain right after you create it.,
Cover the stain with cornstarch or baking soda.,
Brush off the cornstarch or vinegar.,
Use vinegar.,
Use a degreaser specifically for suede.",How to Spot Clean Suede3,"


Dab the cloth or napkin, rather than rubbing it, to prevent the stain from penetrating deeper into your suede.

, You want to use quite a bit to create a little mound that completely covers your stain.


The cornstarch or baking soda will draw the oil up out of your suede item.
Let this sit for at least 10 minutes.

, To do this, you can use either a cleaning brush or a cloth. Remove all the powder so you can assess the stain beneath.


If it was a minor stain, it could be completely gone already.
If you notice a lot of residual oil or grease, repeat the process with the cornstarch or baking soda.

, If you repeat the powder removal process a few times and a bit of oil remains on your suede, you can use vinegar to remove it.


Simply dampen a clean cloth with white vinegar and gently wipe it over the suede.
Once the stain has been removed, allow the suede to dry completely.

, You can find these types of cleaners at leather stores or shoe stores. These types of cleaners are formulated to lifting excess oil out of the pores in suede, and bring it to the surface to be blotted away.


For extremely set in or old stains, you will probably need to use a suede cleaner.

Fill it warm water and mix in about a capful of mild baby shampoo., Submerge your rayon in the water. As it soaks, gently massage the rayon with your hands. Work the shampoo/water mixture into the rayon so the fibers relax. Keep massaging and soaking the rayon until the mixture is thoroughly mixed in. Times will vary depending on the size of the garment you're shrinking.The goal here is to make sure all the fibers are completely saturated, so keep massaging until the rayon is thoroughly wet.

, Remove the rayon from the water and rinse out any lingering baby shampoo using cold water. After rinsing the garment, get some of the moisture out by gently pressing it with your hands. Only press the garment. Do not wring it, as wringing can break fibers in the garment. , Lay a cloth or towel down on a flat surface. Take your rayon garment and stretch it flat over the towel., Roll up the towel your rayon is lying on. Roll the rayon inside the towel tightly. Press the towel gently once it's rolled up to remove any excess moisture from the rayon., Un-roll the towel so the rayon is lying flat again. Use your hands to reshape the rayon into its original size. There is no secret or special method to use. You simply need to stretch the rayon with your hands as long as it takes to get it to its original size. Times will vary depending on how much shrinking occurred.Be careful not to stretch the rayon larger than it originally was. You do not want to create another problem while trying to resolve shrinking.

, Rayon should be transferred to a dry towel after you've stretched it out adequately. Lay it flat, like you did the first time, and let it air dry.If you want to speed up the drying process, you can leave a fan running in the room.
Dry rayon in a room where it will not be disturbed by other household members or pets.

, As rayon is a more delicate type of fabric, it's more prone to damage during washing and drying. If at all possible, have your rayon clothing or other items professionally dry cleaned. This will prevent shrinking and stretching over time.If an item is labeled ""dry clean only,"" do not attempt to wash it at home.

, If you do wash rayon at home, treat it gently. Wash it in cold water and on the gentle cycle. Rayon should also be placed in a mesh bag prior to washing to protect it., It's usually best to air dry rayon on a flat surface to avoid shrinking. If you do decide to dry rayon in the dryer, place it in a mesh bag first. Do not dry it for a full cycle. Only dry it for about half a usual cycle and then let it air dry the rest of the way.In general, only use a dryer to speed up the drying process. Do not use a dryer to dry rayon completely.

Wash your fabric in the washing machine.,
Roll the fabric into a damp towel.",How to Shrink Rayon1," Rayon can be easily manipulated and permanently changed when exposed to water. Gently hand wash the garment and let it soak in the water for several minutes to significantly shrink your fabric but also protect the material., If your rayon garment is much too big, throw it in the washing machine with some regular detergent and wash on a warm or hot cycle., If you don’t want to make any drastic changes to your rayon garment, shrink it in a more subtle way. Soak a bath towel in water, lay the rayon flat on the towel, and then roll the towel up and let it sit so that the moisture can soak into the fabric.Try this method first if you’re worried about shrinking your garment too much. If you want it shrunken more, you can always resort to one of the other methods for your second attempt.

Dry rayon fabric in the dryer.",How to Shrink Rayon2," After you’ve washed your rayon fabric, you can simply lay it down flat on a counter for a while and wait for it to dry naturally.This may be your best option if you’re trying to only shrink the garment a little bit, or if you want to be extra cautious about making sure the shrinking occurs uniformly., You can dry your wet rayon by gently pressing out excess water and then hanging it on a clothes line to let the outdoor air dry it.

Avoid squeezing the water out because this could potentially create wrinkles and stretch the fabric out unevenly.
This method may make the fabric stretch the most lengthwise.

, Put your wet rayon garment in the dryer on the gentle setting until it’s completely dry. Drying your fabric in this way will most likely allow for the greatest possible amount of shrinkage."

Read the instructions.,
Sort your baby clothing.,
Set your washing machine.,
Add detergent to the water.Babies have very sensitive skin, so be sure you use a detergent formulated for infants.,
Make your own detergent.,
Load your washing machine.,
Await the end of the cycle.,
Rinse your baby clothes again.",How to Wash Baby Clothes1," The fabric of your baby clothing might require special treatment for best washing, or may be washable with your normal laundry.Check the tag on each article of baby clothing and note washing temperatures, drying procedures, recommended detergents, and so on.


Pajamas and sleepwear are sometimes made of fire retardant material. This material usually requires special cleaning to preserve its flame retardant properties, so be extra careful to check tags on sleepwear.;
, Divide all articles of clothing into smaller loads of white, light, and dark colors.Keep any flame retardant garments separate to ensure you do not wash these with the regular laundry, as this can ruin the fire-resistant properties of those clothes.


If there are any differences in the temperatures at which you should wash the clothing, sort like temperature clothes into a separate pile.
You should always wash cloth diapers in a separate load, though you might consider washing these with towels to help balance the washing drum of your washer., Now that you've checked the tags on your baby clothing and know the recommended settings you should use, set both the temperature and washer cycle.Then turn your washer on and allow it to fill with water. If garments don't have labels, wash these in warm water except for:


Cloth diapers, which should be washed in hot water to improve sanitation.Flame retardant garments, which should be washed in cold or warm water to preserve their flame retardant features., Strongly scented detergent, too, should be avoided, as these can be overpowering to very young children. Measure the correct amount of detergent based on the size of the load according to tag and label directions.


Baby-friendly detergents are made by most major brands, and are usually clearly labeled as being recommended for babies' sensitive skin.

, You can make your own baby-friendly detergent by combining 1 cup of castile soap flakes, 1/2 cup washing soda, and 1/2 cup borax.Add 1 cup of the mixture to your washer and you're ready to launder!


It is not recommended that you use homemade detergent on flame retardant garments. The oils used to formulate castile soap can break down the flame retardant fibers.

, Scatter the load of clothes you are washing into your washer. Submerge each garment into the water and make sure weight of the clothing is distributed equally throughout the washer. Be careful to not overfill your washer., After you close the washer you will have to allow your baby clothes to run through the normal cycle. This will take some time, usually somewhere around 30 - 45 minutes. During this time, you might want to sort more laundry to prepare for the next load, read a book, or tackle some other chores around the house.

, Any remaining soap in the fibers of your baby clothing can irritate your child's skin. To be extra sure this does not happen to your child, you should set your washer to run the clothes through a second rinse cycle.If you are using homemade detergent, castile soap tends to leave more residue behind than store-bought detergent. Add 1 tbsp. of white vinegar to the cycle to help with this.
If you are concerned your dryer might be too indelicate for your baby's clothing, you may want to consider allowing your clothes to hang dry on a clothesline.

Use a pail with a lid.,
Line your pail with a nylon or PUL tote.,
Sprinkle baking soda into the bottom of the pail or use a deodorant disc.,
Remove any solid waste from the cloth diaper before sticking it into the pail.,
Separate and unroll the diapers.,
Dampen a towel with vinegar or essential oil to reduce odor.,
Lay a fabric softener sheet on top of the diapers to reduce odor.,
Add a few more sprinkles of baking soda as needed.,
Empty your pail every two days.",How to Use the Dry Pail Method for Cloth Diapers," A lidded container will trap most of the odor inside. Select one with a capacity of 20 to 24 quarts to make sure that you have enough room to store two days worth of cloth diapers.


A flip-top garbage can usually works well and allows air to circulate inside the container, preventing the odor from becoming too overwhelmingly potent while minimizing the amount that seeps out. If you have rowdy youngsters, however, you may wish to consider a container with a tighter seal, since these are more likely to remain closed if accidentally tipped over.;
, If you do not line your pail, you will need to clean it out separately every time you wash a load of diapers. A cloth pail liner can be removed and washed alongside the diapers, saving you time and energy. Do not use bags made of cotton or other woven fabrics, however, since these will absorb the odor and moisture from the soiled diapers. Instead, use a bag made of nylon, PUL, or another water-resistant or laminated fabric.


Alternatively, use a disposable plastic bag to line the pail. Plastic bags will contain the moisture and odor created by your baby's diapers, and they do not need to be washed afterward. You will need to change the bag each time you wash a load of cloth diapers, though, which can get costly and wasteful.

, Generally, 1/4 cup baking soda should be enough to greatly reduce the potency of diaper-related odors. Pour it directly into the bottom of the container or into the liner. You can also sit a reusable deodorant disc at the bottom of the container, but make sure you do not accidentally wash this disc.

, You do not need to worry about waste from babies still on breastmilk or formula, since it is water soluble and will not be solid enough to remove. Babies and toddlers on solids will have more solid waste, however. Dump this waste off into the toilet. Allowing it to fester inside the dirty diaper pail will only intensify the odor, and it may also lead to a less thorough cleansing when the time comes to actually wash the cloth diapers.

, Most cloth diapers consist of an absorbent insert and a waterproof outer covering. Separate the pieces before throwing them into your pail so that you do not need to separate them before throwing them into the washing machine. These pieces must be separated for the wash; otherwise, the diapers may not be cleaned as thoroughly.

, Tea tree and lavender oils are the most commonly used essential oils. A few drops, soaked into an absorbent fabric rag or paper towel, can greatly cut down the odor of ammonia that urine-soaked diapers produce. A few drops of vinegar can accomplish the same task.


Note that some dirty diaper bags have a small strip of fabric sewn into the inner seam of the bag. This strip of fabric is specially designed for deodorizing purposes, so if your dirty diaper bag has it, add your essential oils or vinegar directly to this strip.

, Even though many cloth diaper experts do not recommend drying your baby's diapers with fabric softener sheets, laying a sheet on top of the dirty diapers in your dry pail can be an effective counter-measure against particularly smelly diapers. Gravitate toward sheets that use baking soda rather than those that contain a lot of perfume. Perfume can interact negatively with the odors produced by your baby's diapers and may actually make the situation worse.

, If you do not want to use essential oils, vinegar, or fabric softener sheets, stick with baking soda. As your pail gets fuller, the baking soda you initially sprinkled at the bottom will become less and less effective at eliminating odors. An additional, small sprinkle of baking soda on top of your dirty diapers can go a long way in freshening things up again.

, You should aim to wash your child's dirty diapers within 48 hours, especially if you use the dry pail method. Otherwise, ammonia and other hazards, both chemical and bacterial, can build up and create health problems.

Wash your clothing often.,
Use scented laundry detergent or essential oils.,
Remove items from the washing machine as soon as possible.,
Deep clean your washing machine with vinegar every six months.",How to Make Your Clothes Smell Good1," The more you wear something, the more it smells. If you’ve worn something several times, don’t store it with your clean clothes, because that dirty smell can transfer to them. Keep your dirty laundry completely separate from your clean clothes. While some items should only be worn once before washing them, other items can be worn several times before they start to smell. Try to wash sweaty or very dirty clothes as soon as possible after wearing them.Leggings, shirts, socks, swimsuits, tights, camisoles, tank tops and underwear should be washed after each wearing.
Dresses, jeans, slacks, pajamas, shorts, and skirts can be worn three or times before washing.
You can wear a bra two to three times before it will need to be washed. Consider buying several bras, so that you never wear the same bra two times in a row.
You can wear a suit three to five times before it will need to be dry cleaned. Suits worn to clean environments, such as offices, can last longer between cleaning. Suits worn to smoky or smoggy environments will need to be cleaned more often.;
, Most laundry detergents have a fresh scent, but some are more strongly scented than others. Look for brands that advertise a specific scent on their labels. Always use the recommended amount of detergent. It’s tempting to pour in a little extra, but this can leave a residue and actually cause clothes to smell bad.If you’d rather avoid commercial perfumes, try adding ten to twenty drops of essential oil to the washing machine during the final rinse cycle.Make sure you like the smell before purchasing a scented detergent, since they tend to be a little pricier. Unscrew the cap and give it a quick sniff in the store.
Experiment with essential oils to find your favorites. Don’t be afraid to combine different oils to create a custom scent.

, After running a load of laundry through a wash cycle, try to take out your clothing quickly. Hang the items up to dry or transfer them to the dryer immediately. Leaving wet clothes in the washer too long causes mildew to form, which can create a musty and unpleasant odor on your clothing. If you accidentally forget about clothes in the washing machine and they become mildewed, you can easily deodorize them with white vinegar.Pour one cup of white vinegar in the detergent dispenser and wash the mildewed clothes again.
This will get rid of the bad smell, but if you want your clothes to smell good, you may want to follow that up with another cycle using detergent., Over time, washing machines can develop unpleasant odors from mold and mildew, which then transfers to your clothes. Start with an empty washing machine. Add two to four cups of white vinegar to the detergent dispenser. Run a complete cycle on the highest and hottest setting. Add one cup of baking soda and run another cycle. Wipe down the inside and top of the washer with a microfiber cloth.If you prefer, you can use bleach or a commercial washing machine cleaner instead of vinegar.
If you use bleach, wash white clothing in the first laundry load after cleaning.
Leave the lid or door open when you’re not using it. Closing it traps in moisture and allows mildew and odor-causing bacteria to grow.

Check the label before cleaning.,
Use a steamer on the velvet.,
Try delicate care laundry detergent.,
Hang velvet clothing instead of folding it.",How to Clean Velvet3," All velvet is not the same. You will need to dry clean some types of velvet, such as knit velvet and fine velvet with a plain weave.


You can machine wash some forms of velvet clothing, such as crushed velvet, though. Check the label, and it should instruct you whether the material needs dry cleaning.
If you are not sure, err on the side of caution, and dry clean the clothing.

Wash the diapers.,
Lay the diapers out flat, with the stains facing up.,
Alternatively, line-dry the diapers or drape them over a drying rack.,
Choose a sunny day to achieve the best, most potent results.,
Spray lemon juice onto the worst stains.,
Bring the cloth diapers in after a few hours pass.,
Repeat the process for stubborn stains that do not come out after the first round of bleaching.,
Throw the diapers into the dryer for a few minutes.",How to Solar Bleach Cloth Diapers," Run the cloth diapers through a cold wash, cold rinse cycle, using whichever sensitive cleanser you find safest and most effective. Opt for a cold-cold cycle instead of one that uses hot water, since hot water is more likely to set stains. Stains will be easier to solar bleach if they are not set deep in the fabric.


If the cloth diapers are clean and dry, you do not need to send them through a full wash cycle. Instead, just rinse them long enough to make sure that they are wet. Wet fabrics generally bleach faster and more effectively in the sun, even though dry diapers can also be solar bleached.





;
, The stains must be struck with direct sunlight for the sun's ultra violet rays to do their stuff. If the stains are facing down, the UV rays may get blocked by the rest of the fabric, and the bleaching process may not work. Similarly, if the fabric is crumpled or if some diapers overlap others, parts of the stain may get covered, causing the sun's rays to be less effective on those areas.

, These methods are especially helpful if the diapers have stains on both sides.


Set up a wooden or metal drying rack in your yard. Drape the diapers over the rack, with the stains facing upward. The diapers with the worst stains should be dried on the upper bars of the drying rack, since diapers on the lowest bars may be hidden under shadows.
Pin your diapers to a clothesline to ensure that all sides get equal exposure to the sun. Pin the diapers onto the line, starting at the edges of the line and working your way inward. This way, the middle of the clothesline is less likely to get weighed down by the heavy, damp diapers.

, Since the sun's UV rays are always present, you can technically solar bleach on any day, whether it is sunny, cloudy, or even rainy. Solar bleaching will take much longer on an overcast day, however, and the stains may not come out quite as effectively as they would on a sunny day. As a result, you may need to leave the diapers out longer or put them through an additional bleaching cycle on another day, making the fabric stiffer and prolonging its exposure to the UV light.

, Lemon juice reacts with the sun, creating an even more effective bleaching process. Mix 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) lemon juice with 2 cups (500 milliliters) water in a squirt bottle. Shake vigorously to combine, and spray the solution onto the worst stains as you lay the cloth diapers out in the sun.


Alternatively, add 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) lemon juice directly to the wash cycle when you wash your diapers in preparation for bleaching. Only do this if you plan on solar bleaching the diapers immediately after you take them out of the wash, however. If allowed to dry, the lemon juice will lose its potency.







, On a sunny day, 4 to 6 hours of strong sunlight should be enough for mild to moderate stains. On an overcast day, you may need to leave the cloth diapers out for as long as 12 hours before noticing much difference.

, If a few of the darkest stains did not fade enough for your liking, bring the diapers in and set them out for a few hours the following day. Heavy stains may need to be bleached two or three times in order for the fabric to become near white again. Do not allow these diapers to remain outside in uninterrupted sunlight, however, since prolonged exposure to UV rays can actually damage the fibers of the fabric, weakening the integrity of your cloth diapers.

, Cloth diapers that bleach and dry in the sun tend to feel stiffer than diapers that dry in a machine dryer. Tossing solar bleached diapers into the dryer will loosen the fabric up, making them more comfortable for your baby or toddler to wear.

, This will clean any remaining debris from your item. Be very careful when wiping and avoid any aggressive scrubbing, since this can damage the surface of your felt.


The wipe won’t cause a lot of wetness to begin with, but still allow the moisture to air-dry before using or wearing your felt item.Do not air-dry in direct sunlight because this can damage the fabric.

, Persistent lint and hair can be eliminated by patting the sticky side of masking tape over the surface of the felt, then quickly pulling it off.

Avoid using a chemical stain remover. It could create even more damage, especially if it isn't designed for use on suede.

, Use a cloth to blot the liquid. Don't apply too much pressure, as this will force the water deeper into the fabric. Allow the water to dry after blotting.


If the dried water stain is a different color from the rest of the item, try spraying the entire item with a light mist of water and allow it to dry. This will help the spot blend in.
If your suede shoes got soaked, stuff them with paper or a shoehorn before letting them dry, to prevent the suede from getting misshapen.

, Place a paper towel directly over the stain, and a second towel on top of that. Apply pressure to the stain using your hands or by placing books on top of the towel.


Try rubbing off the stain using a wet towel dipped in white vinegar. Don't completely soak the suede; just use the dampened towel to swab at it.

, Blot excess oil liquid and sprinkle the spot with baking soda. Let it sit for a few hours, then brush it away using a suede brush.

Use a leather cleaner made specifically for suede.,
Consider having your suede professionally cleaned.",How to Clean Suede3," If none of the techniques you've tried appear to be working, buy special leather cleaner. These can be used to remove oil or grease stains from suede shoes and garments.


If possible, use a cleaner made of natural ingredients. Some leather cleaners actually do more harm than good.

, It may be expensive, but sometimes turning to an expert is the safest and most effective way to take care of suede items.


If you have suede clothing, take it to a dry cleaner that works with suede. Ask a dry cleaner if they also handle suede purses and other accessories.
If you have suede shoes, take them to a cobbler. Cobblers have the appropriate skills and supplies to tackle the toughest stains.

Dab a tiny amount of very gentle soap (Ivory, Dawn) directly on the stain.,
Dampen a soft, clean cloth with cool water and dab at the stain until clean.Take care not to rub the fabric or agitate it in any way.,
Rinse the rag with cool water to remove all of the soap.,
Dab at the spot again using the wet rag.,
Use a clean, dry towel to soak up any excess moisture.",How to Clean Felt2," Be sure you dab the soap on without rubbing at the fabric. Spot cleaning small and relatively minor stains this way is preferable to immersing your felt item in water, since the dyed color in felt can run easily.Try to get started with the spot cleaning process as soon as possible after the stain occurs.

, If the stain is being stubborn, add another dab of soap on the remaining stain and dab again until it’s gone.


For extra stubborn stains, you can use diluted white vinegar to clean the felt.
Use one part vinegar and two parts water to get the proper dilution for this. Concentrated vinegar can bleach the colors out of your felt.
Repeat the same process of dabbing at the stain with your vinegar/water solution. The vinegar not only removes stains but can also destroy any bad odors.

, Once free of soap, re-soak it with cool water. Try to use approximately the same water temperature throughout the entire process.

, This will force clean water through the stained area, rinsing any remaining soap from the felt. You may find it easier to use two wet rags to rinse the soap from the felt.


Using a flat surface, put one rag on each side of the felt and press down over the cleaned area, forcing clean water through.
Rinse out the rag and repeat the process, if necessary.

, Simply press down on the spot a few times until the towel has soaked up the excess water. Allow the item to air-dry in a cool place.Do not air-dry felt in direct sunlight, because this is damaging to the fabric.

Brush away any loose debris while the felt is still dry.If the spillage isn’t completely liquid, brush away what you can of any loose debris with a soft bristled brush before moving on.,
Use a clean towel to blot up any liquid spillage.,
Fill your sink or a bucket with cold or cool water.,
Add a small amount of gentle soap to the water.,
Submerge the felt and gently wash the stained area.,
Rinse the soap from the felt using cool water from the tap.,
Place the wet felt on a clean, dry towel.,
Lay the felt out flat and allow to air-dry in a cool place.Hanging the item from a drying rack is also acceptable.",How to Clean Felt3,"


Take care not to brush with too much pressure, or the debris will get embedded in the fiber of the felt.

, Gently dab at the stain, taking care not to rub any of the liquid around or into the surface of the felt. Blot until there is no visible liquid left, just the stain.

, Do not use warm or hot water because this will cause dyed color to run and bleed. Make sure there is enough water in the basin to submerge your item.

, Use as little soap as possible and make sure you are using something very gentle, such as Ivory or Dawn. Baby shampoo or wool wash (soap created specifically to clean wool felt) will also work well.


If you are working with a dirty piece of felt that has a bad odor, cut up a couple of lemons and squeeze their juice into the water.
Lemon will help to disinfect and remove odors from the fabric., Do not use aggressive scrubbing motions, since these will damage your felt. Repeatedly squeezing and pushing on the felt under the soapy water will wash the stain away.Once clean, drain the soapy water from the sink.

, Make sure to rinse it carefully until all of the soap is completely removed from the felt. Try to do the rinsing as quickly as possible. The less time you have to submit your felt to water, the better.


Once rinsed, shut off the tap and gently squeeze the item one time to remove excess water.

, Use another dry towel to press down on the felt, so that both towels are soaking up moisture from the item. Repeat until the felt is damp rather than wet.


Do not rub the felt. At this stage it is particularly vulnerable, and rubbing it can damage the fabric and cause it to pill.
You made need to use additional dry towels to get the job done, depending on how large the felt item is.

, Make sure the fabric is completely dry before using or wearing your felt item.


Do not let the felt air-dry in direct sunlight, as this can be damaging to the fabric.
If all else fails, take your fabric to a dry cleaner to be cleaned by a professional.

Determine if the color will fade or run.,
Use lukewarm water, lemon juice, or a mild vinegar solution to spot clean.,
Use a mild ammonia or alcohol solution to remove tough stains.,
Fill a sink or wash basin with water.,
Put your silk item into the water.,
Wash the item by delicately rubbing the silk against itself.,
Rinse the item in cold water.,
Use a towel to extract excess water from the silk garment.,
Hang the silk garment to air dry.,
Remove wrinkles.",How to Clean Silk," Spot test the silk fabric by blotting a water-moistened cotton ball on a hidden point in the garment, such as an inside seam. If the color does not fade or come off onto the cotton ball, the garment is safe to hand wash.


Whenever using any cleaning product, such as vinegar or alcohol, first test it out on a hidden portion of whatever item you’re washing.
If any discoloration occurs, bring the item to a local dry cleaner to have it professionally cleaned.
For spot-treating stains, the faster you get to the stain, the better. Immediately flush the affected area with cold water, rubbing the silk against itself to work the stain out without wearing the fabric. If water doesn’t work, proceed to use a natural cleaning product.
Never use chlorine bleach on silk.;
, Mix a couple tablespoons of either vinegar or lemon juice with two cups of lukewarm water to create a mild solution. Test it on an inconspicuous area. If there’s no discoloration, dip the stained area of fabric into your solution, use a clean spray bottle to apply it, or gently pour the solution over the stain.Mild solutions made with lemon juice or vinegar are good for getting out stains from perspiration or deodorant.
Never apply undiluted vinegar or any other cleaner to silk. Always make sure vinegar, lemon juice, ammonia, or alcohol are diluted with lukewarm water.

, For tougher stains, such as persistent food stains, you’ll need to use a slightly stronger solution. You can try increasing your ratio of vinegar to water, using equal parts of each. If a stronger vinegar solution doesn’t work, mix equal parts ammonia or alcohol with lukewarm water.Diluted alcohol is great for getting out ink stains.
Use ammonia to remove stains from chocolate, wine, or cosmetic products.

, Pour cool water into a wash basin. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) mild detergent or soap to the water. Woolite or Dr. Bronner’s Baby Soap are both good, mild products.Swirl the water around to mix in the detergent.


If you have hard water, mix a teaspoon of borax with the washing water.Lukewarm water should be the warmest water your silk comes into contact with. Never use hot water on silk.

, Immerse the garment completely in the water basin. Gently pulse the water with your hands, moving it around so soapy water penetrates through the fibers. If desired, soak the item for up to three or four minutes.


Wash only one silk item at a time. You don’t want to risk mixing colors.

, Gently move the silk fabric around in the soapy water. Work any stains with your fingers, and rub the fabric against itself. This will provide some friction without wearing out the fabric. Don’t use any sponges or clothes that are harder or more fibrous than the silk, as they might be too abrasive for the fine fabric.When finished washing the silk item, pour the water out when finished washing your garment.
Give the wash basin a good rinse to remove any lingering detergent or suds.

, Fill the basin with cold water. Rinse the silk item a second time to remove soap from its fibers. Once again, work the fabric against itself to provide gently agitation. Turn the garment over and around to ensure it is completely rinsed and free of soap.


If you haven’t already spot cleaned with vinegar, consider rinsing the garment in a vinegar solution. White vinegar removes soap, restores shine and softens silk.
Add 1/4 cup (50 ml) white vinegar to the basin of cold water. Gently move the garment around in the water to thoroughly rinse it.
Empty the basin, then fill it one more time with cold water, and give the silk one last rinse.
Alternatively, or if white vinegar is not available, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) hair conditioner into the rinse water to soften your silk garment., Take the item out of the water. Do not wring or twist it, or you’ll risk damaging the fibers. Instead, gently roll it up in a fluffy towel. Press the towel against the garment as you roll it, causing water and moisture to be squeezed out.


Never put silk items into the dryer. The heat from the dryer will destroy the silk fibers and shrink the garment.

, Use a strong plastic or wood hanger to air dry your garment. Never use a wire hanger, or you’ll risk leaving an imprint on the fabric. Fasten any and all buttons, zippers, or ties to help ensure the garment holds its shape and dries without wrinkling. Make sure any wood hangers you use won’t leave any dye or stain residue on your garment.
Avoid drying in direct sunlight, or you’ll risk discoloration or fading.Do not dry silk on a radiator or any other heat source.

, Avoid using an iron to remove wrinkles from silk fibers. Hanging a silk garment overnight should remove most wrinkles. If absolutely necessary, you can consider using an iron on its silk or lowest possible setting to remove persistent wrinkles.Before using an iron, try hanging the silk item in the bathroom while you take a hot shower to release lingering wrinkles. Close the door and keep any vents off so the shower produces as much steam as possible.
If you do use an iron, don’t wet a wrinkled spot, as this could cause rings or increase the risk of puckering or burning the fabric.
Turn the garment inside out before you use the iron.

Clear any debris.,
Choose the right lime product.,
Spread the lime.,
Mix the lime into the soil.,
Compact the soil.",How to Dry Out Dirt1," Before you add anything to the dirt, you should make sure that all interfering debris has been cleared away from the area.


If you keep the debris in place, you may work undesirable material into the soil while working in the lime. The presence of surface debris can also cause the soil to retain more moisture by blocking potentially drying sunlight.
At minimum, rake away soggy leaves and old mulch to clear the soil. Remove other highly absorbent debris from the site, as well.
It's also a good idea to cut back dead flower stalks, heavy shrubs, and shady tree branches since these can all block sunlight from the soil.;
, There are multiple varieties of agricultural lime, and each one has its own uses. For the purpose of drying out dirt, however, you should use either quicklime or hydrated lime.Standard agricultural lime is simply pulverized limestone and won't be very effective.
Quicklime is actually a calcium oxide, and hydrated lime is actually calcium hydroxide. The chemical structure of both materials make it possible for them to dry out standing out.
Of the two options, quicklime will generally work at a faster pace than hydrated lime, but both will perform the same function.

, Put on your gardening gloves and spread at least 2 inches (5 cm) of lime over the soggy soil.If you're working with a large area of dirt, you may need to spread the lime mechanically using a push spreader or pneumatic bulk truck. For gardens and small yards, however, hand spreading the lime is usually best.
Leave the spread lime in place for one to two hours before continuing with the next step. During that time, the lime should be able to dry off most excess surface water.

, Use a rake or hoe to chop up the soil, mixing the spread lime into the top 6 inches (15 cm) or so as you work.


When working in areas that are especially soggy, you may need to work the lime even deeper into the dirt.
If working at a large scale construction site or similarly wide spread area, you ma need to use a pulvimixer, front-end loader, or disc harrow to mix the soil. For small gardens and yards, however, a standard rake and hoe are better options.
Make several passes over the treated area to work the lime into the dirt. You should notice rapid drying within roughly one hour of treatment. If the dirt still isn't dry enough, you will need to spread and mix more lime.

, Using a hand tamper, press the treated dirt until it feels firm.


Small areas should be compacted with a hand tamper, but large areas may require a sheepsfoot roller or flat wheel roller.
Compacting the dirt encourages it to hold the lime in place. As a result, the dirt should remain dry, even after you receive additional heavy precipitation.
After compacting the soil, the process is complete and the dirt should be thoroughly dry.

Read the washing instructions on the tag.,
Fill a spray bottle with water or alcohol.,
Remove the stain(s).,
Fluff the fabric.",How to Clean Polyester Fiber1," Most tags on furniture contain codes in the washing instructions. “W” means you should only use water-based solutions. “S” means the fiber can only tolerate solvent-based solutions. “S-W” allows you to use either solvent- or water-based solutions. If you see an “X,” however, you should only vacuum the material., If your tag is coded with “S” or “S-W,” you can fill it with rubbing alcohol or vodka. Otherwise, you should only use water. Avoid using soap, which can leave a stain on the fabric.If your tag is coded with an “X,” you should skip this step.

, Spray the stained area and allow the water or alcohol to sit for about 30 seconds. Then, blot and gently rub the stain with a clean cloth. Move the cloth with the grain of the fabric. The cloth may be made of any absorbent material.If your upholstery is vacuum-clean only, attach the brush to the extension hose of your vacuum cleaner. Gently glide the brush across the fabric until the stain has been removed.

, This step is necessary only if the fabric feels stiff as it begins to dry. Use a scrub brush with soft bristles or the scrub side of an unused dish sponge. Move the brush or sponge in gentle circles until the fabric feels soft."

Clear away possible obstructions.,
Allow the dirt to dry slightly.,
Spread gravel over the soil.,
Spread organic matter.,
Mix the amendments into the soil.",How to Dry Out Dirt2," Dead plant matter, debris, and other obstructions block sunlight and air from the dirt beneath it. As a result, the soil does not have access to the natural drying process and will stay soggier for longer periods of time.


Additionally, you may accidentally work these unwanted obstructions into the soil as you add your desired soil amendments. Doing so can cause the soil to become more waterlogged than before.
Rake away soggy leaves, old mulch, and other highly absorbent organic and inorganic material. You should also cut back the branches of shady trees and shrubs, as well as any dead flower stalks hanging over the area.

, If possible, allow sunlight and air circulation to dry the cleared soil slightly before you amend it. You don't need to dirt to dry completely on its own, but try to wait until most of the major puddles recede.


Wet dirt is heavy and dry dirt is lighter, so it will be much easier to mix amendments into the soil when it is less damp.
If you don't have time to spare or if the puddles refuse to clear without additional work, you can amend the soil while it is still at its soggiest. Just be aware of the fact that you will need to use more muscle power.

, Apply 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of pea gravel over the surface of the soggy soil.Working gravel into the soil will add non-absorbent space in between the particles of soil. As more of the soil particles are kept apart, less water will be retained.
You can use sand instead of pea gravel, but only if you are working with non-clay soils. Adding sand to clay can cause the dirt to set like concrete.

, Lay out 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of compost or similar organic material directly over the gravel.Use roughly the same amount of organic material as gravel.
When you add gravel to dirt, you increase the amount of space occupied by non-nutritional components. The organic material boosts the nutritional value of the soil to offset this effect. If you don't plan on growing anything in the dirt, though, you can usually skip this step.
Adding organic material to the soil also makes the soil lighter, thereby further improving its ability to drain.
When working with clay soils, you should generally use roughly 1 cubic yard (0.8 cubic meters) of total soil amendments for every 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) of dirt. The ratio of amendment to dirt will be similar for non-clay soils, but may vary slightly depending on the type of soil.

, Use a rake, hoe, or shovel to turn the soil and work the amendments into the top 6 inches (15.25 cm).


Once the soil amendments have been worked into the dirt, the process is complete. The remaining water currently in the soil should drain away faster than usual. You should also have fewer problems with soggy dirt from this point on.

Remove plant matter and other debris.,
Allow the dirt to dry slightly.,
Choose the right equipment.,
Bore out plugs from the soil.,
Keep the area clear.",How to Dry Out Dirt3," Clearing the surface of debris will improve access to sunlight and air, both of which can help dry out the dirt naturally.


Depending on how you aerate the soil, there is also some risk that the debris will work its way into the soil as you dig into it. For that reason, you should clear the area before aerating it instead of waiting until afterward.
Remove anything presently sitting on the surface of the soil. It is especially important for you to remove absorbent plant matter, like dead leaves and old mulch, but any obstruction can keep the dirt soggy and should be cleared away.
You should also improve air circulation and access to sunlight by trimming down sources of shade, like heavy branches or dead flower stalks.

, This method will only work if the dirt isn't soggy. It can be wet, but if there are huge puddles of water on the surface, you will need to wait for those puddles to disappear or try a different method.


Sunlight and increased air circulation might help dry some soggy dirt if you don't get additional precipitation for several days.
The soil is ready to aerate once it becomes firm. It can be firm and wet, but it cannot be so soft that it loses its shape and turns into mud.

, For yards and similarly small patches of dirt, a step aerator will work best. Long-pronged gardening forks and rakes may also work.


When working with a larger area of wet dirt, you may need to invest in an aerating machine.

, Work across the entire patch of wet dirt with your aerator, removing plugs of dirt every 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm).If using a step aerator, you'll need to position the aerator over the ground and press it into the dirt using your foot. Remove the aerator and plugs by simply tilting the handle bar back.
When using a rake or garden fork, stab the prongs into the ground and rock the tool back and forth to loosen the soil.
If using an aerator machine, follow the manufacturer's instructions while operating it.

, Rake away the plugs of dirt when finished and try to keep additional debris away from the area.


By removing plugs of dirt, you've given the soil more room to expand, which should improve its ability to drain, too.
The process should be complete once most of the soil plugs have been removed.

Read the washing instructions.,
Pre-treat stains.,
Wash the pad in cold water.,
Tumble dry on a low setting.,
Air dry the pad as an alternative to the dryer.",How to Clean Polyester Fiber2," Follow the instructions closely to avoid damaging your mattress pad. Pay attention to the recommended cycle (regular or gentle) and which fabrics you can wash the pad with. For example, if your mattress pad is white and the tag specifies “like colors,” avoid throwing dark or dyed materials into the washing machine with it., Spray the product directly on any stains you find. Commercial pre-treaters are usually safe to use. You should only avoid them if the tag warns against them., Always default to cold water, even if the tag doesn't specify a temperature or allows hot water. Cold water will prevent shrinkage and decrease wear over time. Any kind of laundry detergent is acceptable. Avoid using bleach, which can damage the material., Low heat will prevent shrinkage of the material or stretching of the elastic. Add two dryer balls (available in most big box stores) if the pad is larger than twin size. If you don't have dryer balls, use two tennis balls. This will prevent the pad from twisting into a ball shape and allow it to dry more thoroughly., Hang it on a clothesline or lay it on a clean flat outdoor surface. Place it in direct sunlight for the quickest drying time. If the weather isn't cooperating, air dry the mattress on a drying rack or clothes hanger in the warmest location in your home. Make sure both sides are dry before putting it back on your bed."

Use the dryer as an alternative.",How to Clean Polyester Fiber3," Look for the phrases “Dry Clean Only” or “Machine Wash.” Most tags specify cold water and a delicate cycle for machine washable fabrics. Take dry-clean-only fabrics to the dry cleaner for best results., Use this step if you can't afford or don't have the time for the dry cleaner. Laundry bags protect delicate fabrics from the agitation of the wash cycle. You can buy them in most big box stores. Use separate bags for the pillow and the blanket. Seal each bag before placing it in the washing machine., Place the materials in the washing machine. Set the machine to the delicate cycle. Avoid using detergent unless the washing instructions call for it. Add about a capful of fabric softener to the wash., Because pillows contain fabric fill, it's important to take extra steps to remove excess water after the spin cycle completes. Otherwise, you'll risk mold growth. Shaking and punching will also loosen any areas of fill that clumped together during the wash cycle. Do this until you don't feel any clumps inside the pillow., On a hot, sunny day, hang the pillow and blanket on a clothesline in direct sunlight. If it's raining or cold outside, dry the materials near a heating source, such as a heating vent. Avoid laying them directly on objects like space heaters or radiators, as this is a fire hazard., Take precautions if you choose this step. Place the pillow and blanket in separate drying bags, which you can find in most big box stores. If you don't have drying bags, wrap each item in a separate towel. Set the dryer for the most delicate setting that doesn't use heat. Check the pillow and blanket every 30 minutes. Remove them when they're completely dry."

Use a protective bag for “dry-clean” clothing.,
Machine wash most fabrics in cold water.,
Hand wash very delicate fabrics, such as knits.,
Air dry the garment.",How to Clean Polyester Fiber4," If you see the words “Machine Wash” on the tag, you can toss the garment into the washing machine unprotected. Pay attention to the temperature of the water and the type of cycle you should use. Most tags specify the gentle or delicate cycle. Others state “Hand Wash” or “Dry Clean Only.” For best results, stick to these instructions., If you don't have the time or money for the dry cleaner, you can use a sealable mesh laundry bag in the washing machine. If you don't have a mesh bag, use a pillow case. Turn the garment inside out before you put it in the bag. When using a pillow case, seal it with a clothespin or hair tie. Limit one piece of clothing per bag to allow the water and detergent to circulate properly.If you plan to hand wash your garment, you can skip this step.

, Thicker fabrics can withstand this method. Set the machine to the delicate or gentle cycle. Allow the machine to continue to the rinse and spin cycles., For this step, fill a sink with cold water and gentle detergent, such as Woolite. Then, completely submerge the clothing in the soapy water. Take the opposite sides of the garment in each hand and gently rub them together to loosen any debris. Allow the garment to soak for a few minutes.

Drain the soapy water water and refill the sink with clean water. Move the garment up and down in the clean water until the detergent has been completely rinsed out. Roll the garment in a towel to gently push out the excess water. Avoid wringing, which can damage the fabric., Even if you don't have to worry about shrinking, the heat of the dryer can damage the fabric. Weather permitting, hang the clothing on an outdoor clothesline and allow it to dry in the sun. On a hot summer day, your garment could be dry in as little as three hours.

If it's raining or too cold to hang your garment outdoors, air dry it on a drying rack or clothes hanger. Depending on the temperature and humidity level of your home, your garment will be dry in 24 to 36 hours."

",How to Clean Faux Suede," While most faux suede fabrics used for clothing, towels, drapery, and other garments, accessories, or decor will be machine washable, always check the labels first to be sure. If the label is missing or too worn to read, err on the side of caution: hand wash the garment with a gentle soap or detergent and hang or lay it to dry.


A care label with a washing basin full of water on it means you can machine wash your item. If there is a number as well, this indicates the temperature at which to wash it.For a washing basin with a hand on it, wash the garment by hand instead of the washing machine.
A square with a circle inside means you can tumble dry your garment as well.
A single circle means dry clean only.
A triangle means it’s safe to use bleach.
If any of these symbols appear on your care label with an X or cross through them, it means you cannot use that method of cleaning.;
, Before washing or cleaning any new fabric, you should always do a spot test on the fabric to ensure that the cleaning product you want to use won’t damage the fabric in any way.


Choose a small spot on the fabric that won’t be seen, and apply a small amount of your desired cleaner to the area.Let it sit for five to 10 minutes, and blot the area with a clean, white cloth.
Check to see that no color bleeding, discoloration, or shrinking has occurred. Use a damp cloth to remove the cleaner.

, For tough stains or hard-to-clean dirt, spot clean the stains with soapy water, a clear alcohol like isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or vodka, or a gentle liquid laundry detergent that’s been diluted in water (use a teaspoon (6 ml) of detergent in one cup (240 ml) of water). To spot clean:


Apply a small bit of cleaner to the fabric with a cloth or clean sponge.
Gently rub the area with either the sponge, a lint-free cloth, or a soft-bristled brush, such as a clean toothbrush. If you use a cloth or sponge, make sure it’s white or undyed, as the dye could transfer to the fabric.

, Sometimes fabrics just don’t want to come clean, but there are methods you can use to remove stubborn stains from your favorite clothes.To remove deodorant or perspiration stains, rub a small amount of liquid laundry soap into the armpit areas and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing.
For oil stains, lay the stain face-down on a clean wash cloth or hand towel. Pour some liquid laundry soap onto the back of the stain and let it sit. As the oil and soap soak through and dry, replace the cloth with a clean one. Rinse the area once it has dried and launder it normally.
To get rid of stubborn organic matter (such as food, beverages, grass, and blood), pre-treat the stains by rubbing them with a detergent that contains enzymes, such as OxiClean, Tide Stain Release, and Ultra Plus.Let it sit for 10 minutes and wash normally.

, For machine-washable items, always wash faux suede items together to prevent the material from collecting lint. Wash larger items, such as curtains and bedding, alone. To machine wash a single faux suede item, place it in a lingerie bag to separate it from the rest of the clothes in the load.


To be on the safe side, always use the delicate or gentle cycle and a mild liquid detergent when washing faux suede.
To hand wash your item, fill a large bowl or sink with warm, soapy water. Place your item in the water and let it absorb the water. Gently agitate the fabric with your hands, concentrating on areas that are particularly soiled.

, If the care label indicates that your item is safe for the dryer, follow the heat settings, or use a low- or no-heat setting to dry your faux suede.


You can also hang your items to dry on a clothesline, or lay them flat on a towel to dry.

, Washing faux suede can make the fabric stiff. Use a soft brush or clean toothbrush to gently brush the fabric and return its softness., Use a soft brush or cloth to remove excess dirt, dust, salt, mud, and other dry grime.

, Faux suede is a popular choice for fashion items like boots, shoes, bags, and purses, and it is possible to clean these when they are dirty. To do this, you will need:Some newspaper (for shoes)
A soft wash cloth or cotton balls
A mixture of equal parts water and vinegar, or plain isopropyl alcohol

, Dip the wash cloth into the cleaning solution and wring out the excess water. You want it slightly damp, not soaking wet. Gently rub the fabric with the damp cloth, rinsing and re-dampening the cloth as needed, until the dirt, salt, or stains are gone.


If you are using alcohol instead, transfer it to a spray bottle and spray the alcohol onto a clean cloth before rubbing the fabric.

, When you are cleaning shoes, stuff them with newspaper as they dry to help them retain their shape.For bags or purses, lay them flat on a towel or hang to dry.


If the newspaper inside the shoes becomes damp, replace it with dry paper.

, Any faux suede item, including a fashion accessory, will become stiff after washing, so use a soft brush to brush the fabric once it’s dry.

, Weekly vacuuming will keep your furniture free of crumbs, dirt, allergens, pet hair, and dust. It will also stop dirt and dust from accumulating in the fibers, and help to maintain and overall clean appearance.Vacuum the pillows, cushions, nooks, crannies, and crevices.

, Furniture tags will tell you what types of products to use for cleaning, but that’s only helpful if you know what the codes mean. Most faux suede will have one of the following labels:W: clean with water-based solutions, like soapy water
S: clean with solvent-based cleaners, like furniture spray or alcohol
SW: clean with either water- or solvent-based cleaners

, Faux suede is water resistant, meaning that when liquid gets spilled on it, the liquid will bead up so that you can wipe it away.Spills that aren’t cleaned immediately will cause stains from watermarking, dyes, or food marks.


Dab, don’t rub, spots with a clean, dry cloth to remove liquids and water.
For food spills, use a spoon or spatula to scoop up the mess right away.
For mud, allow it to dry before removing the clump and brushing off the dust and dirt., Choose a cleaner based on the label on your furniture and test it on the fabric in an inconspicuous area before spot cleaning elsewhere. Your best bet for a cleaner will be isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle.


Spray a small amount of alcohol on the soiled area, and gently rub it with a clean, undyed sponge or lint-free cloth.Blot stubborn stains if necessary, and use a clean spot on the cloth for each soiled area. Allow the area to dry before using.
Always use strong cleaning agents in a well-ventilated area, and never near an open flame.
To clean the entire piece, work in small sections using the same method. Don’t forget about removable pillows and cushions.

, Because of the nature of furniture, it is sometimes bombarded with pretty nasty stuff that can stain, such as dirt, oil, and even wax. Luckily, faux suede is quite durable, and most stains can be removed without damaging the fabric.


To remove oil, wipe up as much of the oil as possible with an absorbent cloth or paper towel. Soak a rag in alcohol and wring out the excess. Use this cloth to blot at the oil stains, then remove the oil and dirt with a clean, dry cloth.
To remove wax, heat an iron on high. Lay a clean cloth over the affected area on the furniture, and gently rub the hot iron back and forth over the cloth.As the wax melts, it will be absorbed by the cloth.
To remove gum, apply an ice cube to the gum to freeze it. When it’s very cold or frozen, gently scrape it off with a spoon or spatula.,"

Take your faux fur to the dry cleaner.",How to Clean Faux Fur," Most items (including faux fur) will have tags on them with specific cleaning instructions. Whether you want to follow those guidelines explicitly or not is up to you, but they will include important tips for you to notice.


The tag should tell you if you should wash it by itself, if the colors will run, or if you should only wash it with similarly colored items.
The tag may include standardized symbols that indicate how the item should be cared for.Use the tag information to help you decide what to do next.;
, If it's part of a garment, turn it inside out. This will limit the wear on the fur. Place it gently in the machine without any other items.

, Set the washing machine to use cold water and the delicate wash cycle. Turn the machine on and add a mild laundry detergent. Even though you are laundering by machine, consider using a gentle detergent designed for hand washing.Use the machine setting with the least amount of agitation in the spin.
Put fabric softener in when the rinse cycle starts and rinse in cold water.

, Remove the item when the wash cycle stops. Shake it to fluff up the faux fur and help remove any additional excess water.You can try absorbing excess water by rolling the item in a thick towel.
Pull the item into its original shape and dimensions. Do this carefully so you don't damage it.

, Wash the faux fur item in cold or lukewarm water. This will help the faux fur maintain its shape and texture. Use a mild laundry soap designed for hand-washing., Rather than submerging the entire garment in the water, use the spot-cleaning technique to clean only the places that need it. This will help your item last much longer and maintain its original texture.Use the mild detergent on the areas that need cleaning and gently rub the soap in with your fingers. You can also use the item itself to gently rub two sections that need cleaning together – just take care not to be too rough in your scrubbing so you don’t damage the item.
Rinse the item in cold water until all the suds are gone.

, First, shake out the item to fluff the faux fur and to get rid of any excess water on the surface. Then proceed to remove the additional excess water from the item by rolling it in a thick towel.Reshape the item, taking care not to damage it.

, Never use an electric dryer, even on a no-heat setting, because the friction caused by the faux fur item tumbling around in the dryer creates heat that destroys the fibers. Only air-dry faux fur items.Choose a site that's well ventilated for air drying. You may want to put it outside or add a fan to speed the drying process.
Hang your item on a plastic hanger or lay it flat.
Be sure all the excess water is removed before you hang the item. If you don't, the weight of the water will pull the item out of shape.

, Brush and fluff up the faux fur using a pet care brush with widely spaced metal bristles – this kind of brush is called a slicker brush. Brush and fluff carefully so you don't damage the faux fur's backing fabric., Perhaps the safest option to wash and dry your faux fur items is to take them to the dry cleaner. Dry cleaners have more supplies and more knowledge about fabrics than you, so they will be able to clean your faux fur item more effectively.Make sure you choose a dry cleaner you trust so you know that they will handle your item with care.

Use a high-spin wash.,
Wring your clothing out so that it will dry more quickly.,
Twist the clothing into a towel to absorb the water.,
Try salad spinning your clothes.",How to Dry Your Clothes Quickly1," If you're using a washing machine, you can prime your clothes to dry more quickly. Use a high spin setting on your washing machine to remove as much water as possible from your clothes before you even take them from the wash. According to the Energy Saving Trust, the increased energy used to do this is negligible compared to the energy that it takes to run a standard tumble dryer., Hold a garment firmly in both hands. Squeeze, twist, and knead the fabric to wrench out as much water as possible. Be careful not to pull too hard, or you might stretch the fabric. If you're inside, wring the water into a sink or tub; if you're outside, you can wring the water directly onto the ground.


Wring your clothing before drying, whether you intend to tumble-dry or hang-dry. The more excess water you can remove before starting a dry cycle, the more quickly a garment will dry.

, Put down a large, fluffy towel, then lay the wet garment on top. Roll up the towel tightly with the clothing inside. Twist the bundle: start at one end, rolling methodically, and work your way along until the entire towel is tightly twisted. This squeezes excess water out of your clothes and into the towel.


If this trick doesn't remove all of the water the first time around, consider using another dry towel to repeat the twist.

, Put your wet clothing into a salad spinner, if you own one. This device serves as a quick pre-dryer, or a low-energy version of a high-spin wash: it will fling the excess water from your clothes. You'll still need to let your clothing dry afterward, but the spinning should make the process substantially faster by ensuring that your garments aren't so waterlogged."

Spot clean with a gentle vacuum cleaner.,
Avoid washing.,
Hang to dry the spot dampened gossamer fabric in a wind- or breeze-free environment.,
Do not iron.",How to Clean Gossamer Fabric," Use the finest soft nozzle and avoid pulling against the fabric.


Or, try using a very soft brush to remove dirt, fluff, etc. The brush bristles must have plenty of give and be extremely soft.





;
, Gossamer is very fine and is not meant to be washed. Never machine wash an item made with gossamer; that will be the end of it. You might get away with a gentle spot clean using a damp cloth but do not rub or scrub and don't expect this to work–-the gossamer may fall apart instantly where it gets damp.


If the item made from gossamer has sentimental value and is stained, take it to a professional fabric cleaner for advice.

, Drape over a supportive structure to air dry. This way, any wrinkles should fall out.

, If wrinkles are present on clean gossamer, hang the item and let the wrinkles drape out.

Use a hairdryer.,
Use a clothesline or drying rack.,
Use an iron and a towel.",How to Dry Your Clothes Quickly2," If you have access to a handheld blow-dryer, you can use it to quickly and intensively dry your clothing. First, wring out the wet garment and lay it on a clean, dry surface. Turn the hairdryer to a warm or high setting – it's more about the air flow than the heat. Hold the blow-dryer near the clothing, and dry it spot-by-spot with quick blasts of hot air. Work your way slowly around the entire surface of the garment, front and back, inside and out, until the whole thing is dry.


Rotate the garment frequently to dry any pockets, sleeves, and collars. Dry them from the inside and the outside to ensure that you do a thorough job.
Be careful not to point the blow-dryer at one spot for too long. If some garments or surfaces get too hot, they might catch fire.

, Hang your clothing on a line, if possible, or use a drying rack. A line is usually fastest, but it is not always practical. Make sure to hang each item individually so that it has the space and ventilation to dry quickly. Rotate and flip garments periodically to ensure an even dry.Try setting up your line or rack near a heat source. Hang your clothing a few feet away from a fireplace, radiator, boiler, or furnace. Be very careful when placing flammable materials near heat; if you let your clothes get too hot or cover up a heat source, you may risk fire. Do not drape your clothes over a heat source.
Try setting up your clothing to dry somewhere with a brisk airflow – anywhere air is moving. Hang your clothes by a window (or outside) if there's a breeze, or set up a fan to simulate the airflow inside the house.If you use a drying rack with individual bars, try hanging must-dry items over two bars rather than just one. The more surface area you expose to the airflow, the more quickly a garment will dry.

, Lay your wet garment on an ironing board, as if you are going to iron it, but lay a thin towel on top. Iron the towel firmly and thoroughly using a high heat. Make sure to turn the garment over so that you press both sides. The iron-and-towel combination channels some warmth into the fabric, and the towel will absorb some of the moisture.


Do not put a hot iron directly onto a wet piece of clothing. This may stretch and damage the fabric, rendering the garment unwearable. If you use an iron on wet clothing, always use a towel for protection.

Dry a wet garment with a few clean, dry towels.,
Put your garment in the dryer along with the towels.,
Clean out the lint trap.,
Dry the clothes.,
Wait fifteen minutes, or as long as you can.",How to Dry Your Clothes Quickly3," The towels will absorb some of the moisture from the wet clothing, and the whole batch may dry more quickly as a result. You can use as little as one towel or as many as five; in general, the more towels you use, the more quickly your clothes will dry.Bear in mind that this trick works best when you only need to quickly dry one or two pieces of clothing. The more wet garments you add to the dry cycle, the less effective the towels will be – and the longer your clothes will take to dry.

, Do not add any other clothing. At most, add two or three pieces of wet clothing, but nothing too heavy. Be aware that towels are often lint-heavy, so there is a chance that lint will build up on your garment.


If lint is a concern, you can use cotton T-shirts in place of the towels – although T-shirts will not be as absorptive as towels. Adding dryer sheets can reduce the chances of lint from the towels building up on your garment., When lint builds up, it can prevent your dryer from moving air efficiently, making it work harder and use more energy to dry clothes. Depending on the design of your dryer, the lint trap will either be on the top of the dryer or located just inside the door. Locate the trap and pull out the screen. If it is covered in a layer of lint, it is already somewhat blocked. Pull the lint away, or scrape it from the screen using your fingernails.Consider using a vacuum cleaner to quickly and efficiently remove the lint. You can do this to finish the job after pulling away the bulk of the lint. Don't worry too much about getting it absolutely clean – if the lint screen is mostly unobstructed, the dryer will run near top efficiency.When you have cleaned the lint trap to your satisfaction, simply slide the screen back into the trap. Make sure that it fits neatly. You are ready to dry.

, Load the wet garments and the dry towels, and make sure that the dryer isn't overfull. Turn the dryer on to the highest heat setting that is safe for the garment you're trying to dry – this will vary from machine to machine, but you should generally use a lower heat for delicates and other thin clothing. Set the dryer to run, then do whatever else you need to do to get ready.

, Open the dryer door and pick your garment(s) out from the towels. You should find your garment mostly dry. If not, put it back in and run the dry cycle for a few more moments. Be patient, depending on your dryer, it could be +/- five minutes.


Make sure to remove the dry towel (which may no longer be so dry) if the cycle takes 20 minutes or more. After this point, the now-damp towel may actually slow down the drying process.

Turn your blowdryer to a warm and high setting.,
Blow-dry the pockets, collars, or any other embellishments a little longer than the rest of the garment.",How to Dry Laundry Without a Machine," The wringing technique is a fast and easy way to wring out the excess water from a wet article of clothing. You will use your towel to absorb all of the excess water, so choose a big, fluffy towel.Your garment should not overlap the towel at all. Lay your garment flat on top of the towel, making sure the entire garment is on the towel.;
, Begin by placing your wet garment on the towel. Take one end of the towel, and roll it tightly with the garment inside. As you roll your garment in your towel, it should look like a log or sausage. The ends of the towel should be swirled, like a cinnamon roll., As you do this, the towel will absorb water from the wet garment. Once you have done this, unroll the towel and remove your garment – it should feel barely damp at this point.Only wring out one garment at a time so that you can get the most excess water out of each garment. Once your towel has become very damp, switch towels. Your towel must be relatively dry to absorb the most amount of water.
If you're drying small items, such as socks, spread them out on your towel so that you can wring them at the same time. As long as these small items aren't touching, it will be like wringing out one large piece of clothing.

, After you've squeezed out the excess water, hang your clothing on hangers to fully dry. Hang one article of clothing on each hanger, and leave space between each hanger to allow air to get to each piece of clothing.The best hangers have notches or hooks to keep shoulder straps from slipping off.
Shower curtain rods make for great clothes hanging rods. If you don't have a shower curtain rod, make a temporary hanging rod by propping a broom (or any other long, cylinder shaped item) between 2 even surfaces.

, Drying racks are typically stand alone wooden racks that have different levels to hang multiple pieces of clothing on. Drying races can be purchased online or at most home goods or big box stores.


Place small items like socks, underwear, or washcloths on the lower racks.
Place large / long items like sheets, towels, and pants on the higher racks. This will prevent them from touching the ground.
Put the rack near a heat source. This could be a heating duct, a radiator, or sunny window. This will help speed up the drying process.Don't place the rack too close to space heaters or radiators to avoid the risk of fire.

, If you live in warmer, sunnier weather, take advantage of being able to dry your clothing outside. All you'll need to make your own clothesline is a strong rope that you can tie between two trees or two poles. Your clothes should take a few hours to dry.


Avoid hanging your bright and dark colors in direct sunlight, as the sun could make the colors fade.
Hang your line high enough off the ground so that if you hang something heavy, like a blanket or something denim or made from other heavy fabrics, it will not touch the ground and get dirty.
Pin your clothes onto the line using clothes pins. These can be purchased online or at most home goods or big box stores., Because of their heavy or stretchy fabric, certain items may get stretched out if you hang them to dry. Flat air drying is preferred for items like sweaters and other knit garments. You should shape the item as you flay it flat to dry so that it dries into the proper shape., When you're ready to dry your clothing with a blowdryer, start by hanging it or placing it on a flat surface that is located near a power outlet. Using a hair blowdryer will speed up the drying process if you're in a rush and can't wait for your clothing to air-dry. Start by wringing out the excess water from the clothing, and then finishing with a blowdryer.

, Most blowdryers have low and high settings for the pressure of the airflow – put your blowdryer on high. You should also put your blowdryer on warm instead of cool – this is for the temperature of the air. To avoid damaging your clothing, hold the blow-dryer a few inches away from your fabric. Blow-dry the entire surface of the garment, front and back. Continuously move the blowdryer so as not to burn the fabric in any spots.


For fabrics prone to shrinkage (like wool), use the cool heat setting instead of warm., The areas of clothing that have more layers or thicker fabrics will take longer to dry. Once you've dried the entire garment, make sure to go back and give those thicker areas of fabric a little extra blowdrying time."

Take a good look at the hemline. Unless you lifted your skirt and carried your train everywhere you went on your wedding day, your train will be dirty. Wedding dress trains are like great big dry mops that clean the floors of churches and reception centers!
Inspect the different layers. Wedding dresses can consist of more than one layer of fabric, so it's a good idea to look over each layer for any stains. Inspecting every element of your dress will help you recognize what needs to be cleaned so you can plan accordingly.;
, Use a heavy stain remover (e.g. Stain RX) as soon as possible, but before you use it on your wedding gown, be sure to test it on a small area to ensure it doesn't ruin the fabric. Pick out a spot that is the least noticeable and test it on that area., While cleaning a stain on one layer, place a piece of paper towel underneath so the stain doesn't transfer to that layer. The paper towel should absorb the stain so it doesn't transfer onto another part of your dress., Don't rub the stain remover into the dress because your dress is fragile and may tear. Instead, apply the stain remover then use a wet towel to gently push away from the stain. Apply this method to the edges of the stain., Use a hair dryer to dry the water off the dress. Leaving it to air dry may create water rings in the dress.

Try a stronger stain remover.,
Rinse your dress.,
Dry your gown.,
Hang your dress after it's dry.",How to Clean a Wedding Gown2," Keep the body of the dress out of the water while following this step. Make sure the bathtub is clean and use warm, sudsy water to soak your hem for a couple of hours.


Working your way around the dress, use a toothbrush and the liquid detergent to ""massage"" the hemline clean. Be careful not to scrub too vigorously on lace or trims, and clean the underside of the hem and dress lining, as well.
Rinse the hem thoroughly when you are finished cleaning it.

, Turn the dress bodice inside out, and spray the lining of the bodice area (the part that fits on your upper body) with a dish soap and water solution. Use the toothbrush and the detergent to clean perspiration stains that may appear in the underarm area., If your dress has many layers of lining in the skirt, be sure to look over all of them and clean all the stains you find with a spot-cleaner. This is where inspecting every area of the dress comes in handy.

, Spray any stains on the outside of your dress with your spray solution using the toothbrush if necessary. Be very gentle and carefully blot the fabric. Be particularly careful of laces and trims.

, If soap and water do not remove the stains, mix up a solution of a stain remover, such as OxyClean®, and water. Place the stained area in the solution to soak until the stain disappears. Do not use chlorine bleach, such as Clorox, as it leaves a film that is very difficult to remove.

, When you are satisfied with the cleaning of your dress, fill the bathtub with warm water and place the whole dress carefully in the tub. Swish the dress around in the water as soaps from the cleaning process are rinsed out. Let the water drain and then fill the tub again and repeat the process.


Follow this procedure several times until the water is very clear without any soap bubbles. It is critical to get all soap and cleaning solutions rinsed out of the dress to avoid potential damage from chemicals.

, The dress should be ""line"" dried, but not by hanging it on a hanger because the weight of the wet dress could damage it. Line dry it safely by placing a fold-up drying rack (vinyl coated) in the bathtub and hanging the dress over it.


Place the dress so the weight is equally distributed over the rack.
You can also place a clean towel over a shower enclosure, and then place the dress over the towel. If you do this, be sure to place some towels on the floor underneath the dripping dress to protect the floor.
Do not place the dress on bare wood.

, After the dress has dried for several hours and the bulk of the water has dripped away, it may be possible to hang the dress to finish drying it. Carefully spread any layers of tulle in the skirt or lining and smooth out all wrinkles in the dress as much as possible. This will make the pressing process easier.

Take your time and use caution. When it is finished you are ready to preserve your gown. We recommend that you first wash and dry your ironing board cover to remove any dirt, starch, or sizing.


Where possible, press the dress from the inside. If you have a thick, cushy, ironing board cover, the sequins and beads can press into it. Start at a low temperature, and increase it gradually. If it starts to stick, reduce the heat immediately.

, Loosely fold your wedding gown before storing it, and store it away from sunlight because direct sunlight will cause it to yellow. Protect it from light in an acid-free chest covering it in acid-free tissue paper. Don't store the dress in plastic or hang it up., Put your box in your closet or under your bed away from the light and far from any areas with mold or mildew.

So, you'll need to know the local rules first, including that of the local homeowner's association.If you live in an area where this is an issue, you might like to join those advocating for relaxation of such rules so that you can save money and energy too.;
, This can be as simple as one you put up yourself by stretching a nylon rope between two wooden posts. There are also retractable clotheslines, freestanding-frame rotary (umbrella) clotheslines, and pulley clotheslines for loading clothes from a fixed location.A variety of materials, such as paracord, plastic rope, or cotton cording will work well for a clothesline.Be careful about which trees you use for the ends of your clotheslines. Conifers drip sap, and some are common roosting places for pigeons.

, If your clothesline is not wiped down regularly, it will accumulate dirt, sap, and other soiling over time. Naturally, this can transfer onto your ""clean"" clothes, so to prevent this from happening, give the clothesline a quick wipe-down with a kitchen sponge and a bit of detergent and water every month and allow it to dry before using.


Also clean the clothespins regularly, as they can sometimes get dirty, or even build up soap residue. Throw out broken ones, and remember that you can never have too many clothespins, so replace them regularly as well.

, These days, there are excellent foldaway rack options available made from lovely new materials that won't snag your clothes. Alternately, you could put a table near the clothesline for items that must be laid flat to dry rather than hung up.An old folding table can be easily turned into a sweater-drying stand. Simply remove the table top and replace with nylon netting (or a similar waterproof surface).The beauty of this is that it can be easily folded away when not in use!

, This can be used for a variety of delicate clothing items or for small loads that you'd like to place just outside the door, on a porch (with a waterproof floor), or to catch an unusual patch of sunshine in your yard that might not be big enough for the clothesline.If there is a child around, choose a clothes horse with safely-spaced rods instead of potentially dangerous strings.
The clothes horse has the benefit of being portable, so you can even ""chase the sun"" if you like as the shadows move around your yard.

, Stainless steel clothespins are ideal for sheets, towels, play clothes, and any other items that won't pull out of shape or stretch.Metals pins can easily secure bedding and other heavy items and they won’t rust or decay.


Stainless steel clothespins last the longest.

, Sheets, blankets, pillowcases, and sturdy clothing such as denim can be hung with wooden clothespins. Delicate clothing or items with lace, beading or other trim should not be held by wooden clothespins, as they can catch and tear the fabric. Wooden clothespins can also develop mildew, so be sure to allow them to dry before storing them., Plastic clip-on pins are best for underwear, t-shirts, knit items, and stretch wear. They won’t stain or catch on your clothing, and lighter items will be held securely by plastic clothespins., The outdoor elements can deteriorate your clothespins quickly. Allow them to dry after use, collect them in a plastic container, then store them indoors, such as in the laundry room., This will help drive excess water off and save time. Otherwise, simply wash your laundry as usual. Then, remove the clothing from the washing machine and take it to the clothesline in a laundry basket. If a shorter drying time is not needed, save the cost of electricity for the extra spin if the laundry can be left on the line longer.

, Place the piece of clothing on a plastic hanger and clip the hanger to the clothes line to prevent the hanger from blowing off the clothesline. Be careful using hangers on the line on a windy day, as the hanger might blow off, or the item slip off the hanger.


You may need to pin the clothing with great care to the hanger, and only ever use plastic hangers to avoid staining.

, Hang towels by folding them over the line one end and pinning each end. To help achieve a softer dry, shake towels a lot before hanging them on the line, with a ""snap."" Doing this loosens the pile. Do it again when removing them from the line.Towels that dry faster on the line can feel softer, such as hanging them out on a windy, warm day.
You could give them a quick 5 minute tumble in the dryer before hanging them up or after bringing them in off the line.
Adding vinegar to the rinse cycle might also help to reduce towel stiffness.

, Hang sheets by folding hem to hem, pinning one hem over the line, then pinning the other hem to the corners of the first hem, just a few in/cm inside the first hem corners. Have the sheet open toward the wind, to allow it to billow like a sail, and run your hands down the edges to ensure it is hanging square and even.Widthwise is best for hanging items such as sheets, tablecloths, and flatwork because it takes up less space on the line and puts the stress on the warp yarns (the yarns that run lengthwise), which are stronger than the filling yarns.Hang blankets and other heavy items across two lines, or more, as needed.
Always hang pillow cases and similar items with the open side down.

, Pants and shorts can be line-dried. Hang shorts and pants/trousers by the waistband on the line if you want to minimize wrinkles., Most tops can be hung on a clothesline. Hang t-shirts by folding the hem a little over the line and pinning on at each end.When hanging 100% cotton items, don't pull or stretch the wet clothing and pin it, as this may cause items to widen.

, Most dresses and skirts can be line-dried, although you may want to use a hanger to reduce wrinkles. Hang dresses from the shoulders if straight, or from the hem if it has a full or gathered skirt.Hang straight skirts by turning over the waistband and pin each side; hang gathered or full skirts by the hem., Hang socks by the toes, bras by the hook end, and fold the waistband of underpants over the line and pin either side onto the line. Fold handkerchiefs in half over the line and pin at each end., To keep your colored items from fading, you should hang them in the shade. White clothing and linens can be hung in the sun, which will naturally bleach the items. Alternatively, you can hang colored items inside out to preserve the fabric dye., To prevent clothes pin imprints on clothing, try to pin the clothes in discreet locations. If you hang clothes with care, line drying can often result in clothing that dries without wrinkles, saving on ironing time.To conserve clothespins, overlap garments and use one pin to hang the end of one piece of clothing and the beginning of the next. This can be space-saving on the line as well, although don't do it where the overlapping would prevent drying on thick items. Use caution when overlapping colored items to be sure the dye doesn’t bleed., Different clothes and fabrics dry at different rates. If you need to free up line space, check regularly for dried items, remove them, and add new wet items to the line for drying. Sheets are a great thing to get off the line quickly, as they'll dry fast but also take up a lot of space.

, This saves time on ironing and also makes putting them away easier. As you remove the clothes from the line, shake and snap them to restore shape, then fold neatly. If you intend ironing the clothes, remove them slightly damp and iron them immediately.


Do not store damp clothes. They will grow mildew.
If you toss clothes into the basket without caring how they fall in, you will have a basket filled with wrinkled clothing. Not only is this disheartening but it undoes all the good you did hanging the clothes so carefully!

, Items that stretch when wet such as wool and loosely knitted garments should be dried flat on a surface such as sweater drying rack. This can still be placed outside, perhaps on a table or other clean surface., Some items might not look as good after line drying, such as flannelette, terry cloth, chenille, and napped or pile fabrics.It pays to test each item rather than assume the item won't look good, as most fabrics will line dry fine.


If the care label says not to dry in direct sunlight, hang the item over the clothes horse in the shade or indoors instead.

, Sleeping bags and duvets don't always dry so well on the clothesline because the down can drop to one end. To avoid this, hang them across several lines, as if they were like a tablecloth covering a table. This will evenly distribute the weight.

, The best weather for drying clothes outdoors is a warm, sunny day. A slight breeze will help your clothing dry faster.It is more important to have a good breeze than it is to have direct sunlight.
The sun can fade your clothes, so don't leave them out too long! To lessen fading, dry clothing inside out or dry them in the shade, and collect the item as soon as it has dried.
Airborne pollen may cling to clothes, so watch out for your outside clothes-drying aggravating your allergies. If it does, use a dryer in the spring.

, A slight breeze is ideal for drying clothes, as the breeze will ""iron out"" the wrinkles for you and speed up drying time.However, strong and gusty winds can result in your clothes being blown away or into a neighbor’s yard. There is also an increased risk of clothes catching on wire, plants, etc. and ripping.


Clothespins will hold best on a windy day if placed at an angle., If you know the winds are going to kick up, or it’s likely to rain, don’t put your clothes outside to dry. Wait for another day, hang the items inside, or use the dryer.


You can also use a rotary clothes dryer cover such as the Rotaire Dryline. It fits over a rotary line and allows you to dry clothes outside even when it's raining! You could also cover your rotary dryer with a piece of polyethylene (or an old shower curtain) to keep your clothes dry.

, Not only will you be cold, but your clothes will take too long to dry. If it's really cold your clothes will freeze, and since water expands when it freezes, so will the fibers in your clothes and they may not revert to their original shape.You can dry clothes in the basement, on a line or on racks, during the winter if the clothes are wrung out well beforehand. However, avoid doing this if you live in an already humid environment, as you'll be increasing the humidity.

Use sturdy clothespins.,
Alternatively, springless clothes pegs made of hardwood or plastic also hold laundry securely.",How to Use a Clothesline," You wouldn't want to have to iron your shirts to get those marks out. Irons draw a huge amount of wattage, negating some of your energy savings from using the clothesline in the first place. Alternatively, hang your t-shirts at the seams so that they hang straight (assuming the shirt has seams, and those seams are straight).;
, This allows them to dry quickly without shoulder marks or wrinkles.


Alternatively, a you could hang shirts and t-shirts out on the line on a coathanger. This means no pegs and no marks and minimal ironing.
Or you could try hanging T shirts at the armpits; peg marks won't be seen here.

, If your clothes come out of the washer very wrinkly, lower the spin cycle; they might take a little longer to dry, but they'll dry smoother. Just don't ""snap"" (sharply shake) the clothes right before hanging them, as this can break the threads in them over time.Some people even put the clothes in a dryer for a just a few minutes before hanging them to air dry., That will make them more secure and less likely to blow off the line. Use more than 2 clothespins for heavy items.

, The weight of the upper part of the pants will help smooth it out while drying, lessening the need for an iron., Sun fades dyes.

, This image shows three types of clothespins. The one on the left, with the pom poms glued to it, is the style you will find most frequently in the stores. They are made in China and extremely cheap. The other two are made in the American Midwest and harder to find. They cost twice as much as the ones from China. The one shown on the extreme right has been in use since 1990. The one in the middle has been used for two years.
Compare the gauge of the metal used in the spring that holds the clip together. The cheap imported ones are better used for art projects (hence the pom poms). Entrust your wet and heavy laundry to the cheap clothespins and you may learn the hard way that they are not trustworthy. Your local Home Depot probably only stocks the cheap ones that you don't want to use. Go to your independent hardware store and ask if they will special order the sturdier ones for you. It takes a few days, but it is worth the wait. Maybe if enough people insist on the better ones, the default item stocked in stores will be the sturdy ones.

To be effective, make sure you use mothballs that list paradichlorobenzene as an ingredient.;
, Bird feathers may be carrying bacteria and viruses. Once you’ve taken care of possible mites, the feathers need to be sanitized to kill bacteria. Create a mixture that is half rubbing alcohol and half hydrogen peroxide. Soak the feathers in this solution for at least half an hour.








The higher the concentration of peroxide and alcohol, the better.

, If the quills look dirty or have a foreign substance on them, they should be sanitized. Bring a shallow pot of water to a boil on your stove. Place the quills into the water. Hold them there for a few minutes, which will kill any germs present.









Lay them out flat on paper towels to dry.
If boiling loosened up any unidentifiable gunk on the quills, wipe them gently with a soft cloth to remove it.

Get the large size wooden clothespins, they will not break and be durable. Avoid a small diameter cord because it will tangle easily and also avoid using a large diameter cord because a large cord will interfere with the function of the clothespin. Use clear nail polish, fabric glue or some other waterproof glue to keep the cords in place on the hanger and to keep the knots from unraveling.;
, A thin wire hanger by itself will be weak, so two is preferable. 

, One at a time, fasten a clothespin to the doubled-up hanger. Fasten the cord to the clothespin first with a noose knot on the spring hole. Cinch the noose knot to the spring hole and make additional simple knots for good measure. If the cord is too thick, the clothespin will not open and close easily.  If the braided line has its breaking strength labeled, buy some line that is between 25 - 75 pounds.

, Top off the clove hitches with some sliding knots (these sliding knots are not fixed and will tighten from the hanging load on the clothespin). Tie the cord to the hanger tight so it will not slide sidewards.  The knot to the hanger also binds the two hangers together.  Keep the length of the cord between the hanger and clothespins to about three inches.

, Attach the cord to the top of the hanger first and then to the horizontal rod (it will be easier to adjust the cord length when doing it in this order).

,, Also use the horizontal rod to drape small items on, this is a feature that typical drying racks do not have.

A shirt may cost anywhere from one to five dollars depending upon your location and your cleaner, while something like a blanket or quilt might cost up to thirty dollars.

, Your tag will tell you what, exactly, you need to take care of your rayon piece. The general standard, though, is a mild detergent and warm water.Fill a clean sink or basin with water slightly above room temperature. Add a mild detergent, such as one that says it is made for delicate fabrics.
Soak your rayon fabric in the basin until it completely wet. Then, gently swirl your fabric around the basin using your hands. Avoid harsh or rapid movements, such as those that would cause a splash.
Agitate your fabric for three to five minutes.
Remove the fabric from the basin and rinse under a faucet of warm water until suds stop forming.
Gently squeeze the excess water out from the fabric. Avoid harsh wringing and twisting of the fabric.

, It will need the short, delicates cycle in your washing machine on a medium to low temperature.Understand that rayon fabric may shrink or deteriorate in the machine, especially if it is not recommended for machine washing.

, Dry rayon knits flat. Use a sweater drying cage to drape the rayon over, or lay the rayon over the top of a drying rack so that it sits flat across multiple bars. Woven rayon can be hung to dry. Simply clip to a drying rack or use a hanger.Avoid using a dryer or anything that may tumble the clothes, as this may damage or rip the fabric.
A knit fabric will stretch in all directions, while a woven fabric will only stretch diagonally. Try stretching your fabric lightly both side to side and diagonally to tell. If it only stretches diagonally, it is woven."

It's a great deodorizer because it chemically neutralizes odors.Do not wash your clothes prior to soaking them in baking soda.
Add 1 cup of baking soda to a large bucket or tub, or add ½ cup of baking soda to a small bucket or sink. Soak the clothing in the baking soda mixture overnight – for 8 or more hours.If your fabrics are machine washable, this method will work just fine. If clothes are dry-clean only, you should avoid this method and take them to a cleaner.;
, To better remove bad smells from your clothes, add ½ cup of baking soda to your regular detergent when you wash your clothing. It will help to neutralize the odors, leaving your clothes smelling fresh and clean.


Wash your clothing in the water temperature indicated on the tag. Some fabrics and colors are better in hot water, some are better in cold water.

Iron rayon clothing inside out.",How to Wash Viscose1," Generally, rayon clothes are fairly fragile, but can still be machine-washed with care. However, some rayon clothes are un-washable. To avoid tearing your clothing, bleeding colors, or otherwise ruining your favorite clothes, always follow the instructions on the care label.


Though this section contains instructions on both machine-washing and hand-washing viscose (rayon) clothing, these instructions should be taken as generalities and not as hard and fast rules. In other words, always prioritize your garment's unique care instructions over the ones provided in this section.;
, If your rayon clothing's care instructions specify that it can be washed, it's almost always better to hand-wash it than to machine wash it. Rayon clothing is extra-fragile when it's wet and, thus, is less likely to be damaged by your own careful hands than by the agitation of a washing machine. Place your rayon clothing in cool or temperate water and add hand-washing detergent. Gently work and massage the soap suds into the clothing, taking care not to handle the clothing roughly.


Never squeeze, bunch up, or wring out rayon clothing to remove water, as this can tear the delicate fibers. Instead, gently shake any excess moisture out.

, If you're confident that your rayon clothing won't be damaged by machine washing, try to ensure that only similar types of rayon clothing are in the load. Rougher clothes, like denim jeans, can catch on the rayon during the wash cycle, pulling and tearing it.


Use cool water and a gentle washer setting for added security.

, Another way to protect your rayon clothing in the washing machine is to place all of the rayon clothing in your load into a net laundry bag. This ensures it doesn't mix with the other clothing in your load, eliminating much of the risk of tearing.

, When your rayon clothing is washed, remove each piece of clothing individually and gently shake it to remove moisture. Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands. Then, hang on a non-metal wire to dry (metal wires can leave rust spots).


Alternatively, you can use a drying rack or simply dry your clothing on a clean, flat surface.

, In addition to having the problems associated with washing machines (harsh agitation, etc.), electric dryers are also known to shrink rayon clothing and drastically shorten the life of the garment.If you can avoid using an electric dryer for your clothing, do so. If you can't, use a low temperature setting and dry only with other pieces of rayon clothing.

, Never apply a hot iron to the outer face of a rayon garment - this can burn and melt the fibers in the fabric, creating an unattractive ""shine"" that can't be removed.Always turn rayon clothing inside out before using an iron. To provide additional protection, you may also want to iron the clothing while it is slightly damp.


If you must iron rayon clothing right side out, place a cloth between the hot surface of the iron and the garment to protect the fabric.

"
"
Iron on low heat.,
Iron with a protector.,
Use a wrinkle-releasing spray.",How to Care for Rayon2," Use a low setting on your iron. Higher temperatures may burn the rayon. Iron the piece in sections and avoid pulling on the piece while ironing to prevent misshaping.Turn a rayon garment inside out when ironing, as the area that comes in contact with the iron may develop a slight sheen.
Do not use any steam when ironing. Rayon loses strength when wet, and adding steam may make the fabric easier to damage while ironing.

, If you want to avoid the shine that comes with ironing rayon, iron using a protective barrier. Place a hand towel over the section you intend to iron, and iron the rayon with the towel on top.Only use a clean, heat resistant protective barrier, such as a cotton fabric. Some recommend using aluminum foil, but this can heat the foil and lead to potential burning.
Keep the iron set to low. While it may take a little longer to smooth out the piece, adding excessive heat to rayon is still potentially damaging.

, These types of sprays are available at most grocery or home goods stores. They are formulated to work on most types of fabric, and can help get the wrinkles out of rayon without applying heat.


Rayon treated with the spray should be set flat until the spray is dry, so as to avoid excess pulling on the relaxed fibers.
Always read the label of the spray to see if it states that it is not safe for use on rayon.

Have the rug dry cleaned if it is very important to you.,
Shake your rug outside.,
Vacuum the rug.,
Ensure the rug won't move while you're scrubbing it.,
Use a soft brush to gently scrub with soap and water.,
Wash with vinegar to minimize yellowing.,
Vacuum again.,
Optionally, spritz the rug with dilute fabric softener.,
Dry face-down.,
Don't place the rug on or near any carpeting until it is completely dry.",How to Wash Viscose2," Viscose is a fairly fragile fiber and also one that is very vulnerable to bleeding dye. Because of this, it's easy to damage viscose rugs or cause them to bleed by simply trying to clean them. If your viscose rug has sentimental value, it may be a better idea to have the rug professionally dry-cleaned than to risk irreversible damage or dye-bleeding by cleaning it yourself.

, The goal of cleaning a viscose rug is essentially to get the rug as clean as possible while keeping it as dry as possible. Thus, before using any liquid detergents, it's a wise idea to try to clean your rug with methods that don't require getting it wet before trying to clean it with methods that do. Take your rug outside and shake it firmly to remove any loose dirt or dust. You may also try beating the rug against a railing or pole for added power.

, Next, use a vacuum to remove any ground-in dirt or sediment. Run the vacuum head over the rug several times both with and against the grain, paying extra attention to any extra-dirty spots.


If you can, use a head attachment that doesn't have mechanical brushes. Viscose is fairly fragile and the rough action of mechanical brushes can easily cause it to tear.

, If your rug is still dirty, you may need to carefully wash it. Place the rug on a mounting board or secure it to a table you don't mind getting dirty before cleaning. Washing viscose carpeting requires some scrubbing, so you won't want the carpet to slip around on the floor while you scrub it and you definitely don't want it to bleed dye into the floor or any nearby carpeting.

, Heat water to a lukewarm temperature and combine with a few drops of soap or carpet detergent to create a cleaning solution. Use a soft-bristled brush (like a window-washing brush) to scrub this solution into problem areas of the rug. Avoid hard-bristled brushes or mechanical brushes, as these can easily tear the fragile viscose fibers. Be conservative with your cleaning fluid - the less moisture you use, the lower the chance of dye bleeding.


It's wise to test your cleaning solution on a small portion of the rug that won't be seen before cleaning the whole thing. This way, you'll know immediately whether your solution causes dye bleeding or other distress to the fabric before proceeding.

, Cellulose fibers (including viscose) turn yellow when wet. To help minimize this unsightly yellowing, lightly rinse the the wet portions of the rug with a mixture of vinegar and water. The acetic acid in the vinegar helps prevent yellowing as the rug dries, though it may not eliminate yellowing entirely.

, To remove as much moisture as possible from your rug, vacuum a second time after you've finished using your liquid cleaners. Pay special attention to any wet areas.


As directed above, you'll want to avoid using head attachments that have mechanical brushes to prevent damage to the rug.

, Viscose fibers can stiffen as they dry, creating clumped, splotchy sections on your rug. To help prevent this, you may want to mist the rug ever-so-delicately with a mixture of fabric softener and water using a spray bottle. This can prevent the fibers from stiffening and lessens or eliminates the dreaded ""clumps"".


You may still find that you need to break up clumps after the rug dries. Do so gently, by hand.

, Allowing your rug to dry face-down lessens the yellowing effect that can occur as viscose dries. Place your viscose rug in a clean, dry place or hang it horizontally as it dries. However, note that this will make the underside of the rug yellow more than normal., As mentioned above, viscose is notorious for bleeding dye when wet. Thus, you'll want to keep your rug far away from any light-colored fabrics (especially expensive carpeting) while you're waiting for it to dry. Dye stains can be very tricky to remove from carpeting and the bleeding of dye from the rug itself is virtually irreversible.

If you cannot dry outside on perfect breezy, sunny day, dry inside in a well ventilated, warm room or use a tumble dryer. You can dry laundry at the laundromat too.
, If your shirt got wet in the rain, you have wet dirty towels, your bathing suit is wet from a trip to the pool or your kid pissed the bed, wash this damp laundry as soon as possible.

Allowing damp laundry to sit in your laundry room can encourage mold growth and stains to develop on your cloth.



 



,

Soiled laundry is a prime place for mold to grow, even if it isn't wet. Mould can grow on even small food stains, apparently. Mould can also appear on clothes if the place where the clothing is kept is at a certain temperature and humidity.







, Remember bleach will lighten dark colours. Love your navy jeans? Don't bleach them.


Adding regular bleach or color-safe bleach to laundry loads can help remove and prevent the scent of mold on clothes.

, Simply run your washing machine like normal and, while the machine is filling up with water, add vinegar into your washing machine in lieu of detergent. If you prefer to use detergent in the wash, add the detergent as usual and then add vinegar during the cycle's final rinse.







,

If you've left your clothing in your washing machine for several days and find that they smell moldy, rewash your clothes like you normally would. Use hot water whenever possible.







,


Color-safe oxygen bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and borax, or combinations of these, can be used to soak and pretreat mold and mildew stains before they go into the washing machine for a wash. Pretreating with these items can ensure the success of mold smell removal from your clothes.
Applications of these solutions can be done with a sponge. Some clothing may be able to be soaked in the solutions for a period of time.

,,, This will allow air to enter the machine and dry excess moisture. Look for products that clean your washing machine. Don't let the so as p drop get gunky.

, Instead of clothes, put bleach into the machine and run the cycle as usual.

,


Cracked mortar, inadequate drainage, and poor ventilation in a home can provide the conditions that encourage mold growth. Repair anything that keeps the humidity high and the moisture locked into your laundry room, and you might see a reduction in the incidence of mold smell.

Choose your stain remover.,
Place a dab of your remover onto the stain.,
Rub the stain remover in.,
Rinse the stain in cool water.,
Wash as usual.",How to Wash a Leotard1," The source of the stain will play a role in how you get rid of it. A tomato-based stain, for instance, requires a different approach to removal than an ink stain. Removal tools include chalk, baking soda, peroxide, and vinegar, each of them ideally suited to a certain type of stain.Vinegar is great for whitening and removing grass stains.
Oil stains (including face and body oils) are best removed with chalk or salt, as they absorb oil.
Coffee and other dark stains are best removed with a 1:1 ratio of baking soda and water to make a paste.
Peroxide is the most effective way to remove bloodstains, though it can have a bleaching effect.;
, After you have identified which stain remover is appropriate, place the removal method onto the stain, making sure your hands or laundry brush are clean and free of oil and debris.


Wash your hands before handling your leotards to avoid depositing dirt or your body’s oils as you clean.

, Use a finger, a soft-bristle toothbrush, or a delicate laundry brush. If the stain is small, you can use your finger to rub the detergent in. If the stain is larger, enlist the help of a soft-bristle toothbrush (hard bristles can snag fabric) or a dedicated laundry brush with soft bristles., Rinse the stain in cool water--never hot. Hot water can set stains in fabric. Rinse the stained area with cool water, avoiding getting the rest of the garment wet, as this can cause the color or stain to run onto the rest of the fabric.


If you are treating a leotard with many different colors, all of them prone to running, you can place your hand underneath the stain to make sure only that portion of the leotard gets wet.

, After pre-treating, launder your leotard as usual, turning it inside out before washing. While all leotards can benefit from hand washing, make sure you at least wash your performance leotards by hand.


Your practice leotards may hold up well inside of a machine wash.

Check your washer.,
Don’t use too much detergent.,
Let your clothes air-out.,
Use a bit of vinegar.,
Try baking soda.,
Wash with a heavy detergent.,
Use borax.,
Try using oxiclean.",How to Remove Mildew Smell from Clothing," It may sound strange, but your washer could be the source of the mildew. Front-load washing machines are especially prone to trapping moisture and growing mold and mildew over time. Pour percarbonate solution in the detergent slot, and vinegar in the fabric softener slot. Run your washer on the sanitary cycle, and toss some of the percarbonate solution into the gasket for good measure. Wipe the washer out with a dry towel when finished, and leave the door open between uses to keep the inside aired out and dry., When your clothes begin to smell musty, the first reaction you might take is to use a bit of extra detergent. This could actually be what is worsening your clothes’ smell though. Too much detergent won’t get washed out and will cling to clothes, trapping in moisture. This detergent buildup will increase mildew growth and make your clothes smell worse. Therefore, use the regular amount or less of detergent to keep your clothes from being overwhelmed with soap.

, If your clothes are just lightly mildewed, the easiest option is to let them air-out. Hang them up (whether they are wet or dry) on a clothesline outside. The natural scents of the outdoors and the constant breeze will remove the mildew stench. You can also air-dry your clothes outdoors after trying other mildew-killing treatments on them., This all natural product is a deodorizer as well as a disinfectant, and will kill any mold and remove the mildew smell that accompanies it on your clothes. Add a cup of vinegar directly into the gasket with your clothes and let your washer run on the longest cycle it has. Add an additional cup during the rinse cycle, and your mildew stench should be gone!

, Yet another all natural cleaning solution, baking soda will clean and remove odors from clothing. Add a cup of regular baking soda to your clothes in the wash cycle. Use the longest and hottest wash cycle you are able. You can do this multiple times on the same load to get rid of really deep mildew odors. Dry your clothes with some fabric softener, and voila! Your clothing should now smell clean and fresh.

, You may think that you are washing with a strong detergent, but there are some specifically marketed for clothes that are dirty and smelly on a regular basis. Look for detergents advertised for hunters, mechanics, or construction workers. These have extra strong odor-fighting ingredients that should work away your mildew concerns. Wash as per the directions on the bottle and you should be good to go., This is one of the stronger cleaning methods; borax is an all natural mold-killer which is sure to get rid of the mildew smell in your clothes. To use, mix ½ a cup of borax with a cup of very hot water, allowing it to dissolve. Add this solution to your washing machine after it has filled with water (and you’ve put your clothes in). Run your washing machine on the hottest and longest cycle your clothes can tolerate, and you should be set.

, Yes, this infomercial cleaning product may be worth the purchase. Oxiclean has shown to work wonders on getting rid of the mildew smell in clothes. Follow the package directions for adding the detergent to your wash cycle. You can continue to use the product over time with your laundry to keep them smelling fresh and looking brand-new."

Hang rayon garments.,
Fold large pieces.,
Remove plastic bags.",How to Care for Rayon3," If you have a rayon piece of clothing, store it by hanging it on a sturdy hanger with a good grip. Rayon isn’t really inclined to wrinkle when hung properly, and should be stored vertically to prevent any creasing of the fabric.If you must fold a rayon garment, try to fold along the clothing’s seams, and don’t put too many other items on top of they rayon. This prevents deeper creasing from pressure.

, For larger rayon pieces such as drapes or blankets, consider investing in a large plastic storage container to help keep the fabric safe and prevent anything from sitting directly on top of the rayon. Fold along the seams of the fabric when possible.


Rolling rayon may cause more smaller wrinkles, but may help prevent larger creases to the fabric.

, If you have your rayon dry-cleaned, it may come back to you in a plastic dry-cleaning bag. Excess exposure to these kinds of plastics may cause some yellowing of the fabric if left on for extended periods of time.If you prefer to have your rayon piece covered while in storage, cover it with a clean, colorless muslin, or purchase a garment bag meant for rayon storage."

Sort clothes normally.,
Soak clothes in warm water and baking soda.,
Wash clothes by hand, or restart your washing machine.,
Hang outside to dry, if possible.",How to Remove Body Odor from Clothes1," Remember to separate lights and darks and to keep delicate fabrics separate from tougher fabrics. This method will require you to use warm water, so if some of your clothes can only be washed in cold, you may want to use a different method to eliminate the smell of body odor from your clothes.;
, Put clothes in a laundry basin, bucket, sink, or tub. Add enough warm water to that they are all completely submerged. Add two cups of baking soda to the basin. Stir it around a bit so that the baking soda is dispersed into the water. Let sit for at least several hours, if not overnight.


You can also soak your clothes in a washing machine. Add your clothes to the machine and turn it on, so the basin of the machine begins to fill with water. Once the basin is filled, add two cups of baking soda to the basin and stop the machine. You should then let your clothes sit in the water and baking soda for a couple hours.

, It's necessary to wash the baking soda out of your clothes after they have soaked. If washing by hand, use a normal amount of laundry detergent. You may need to change the water several times to get all of the soap and baking soda out. If using your washing machine, just turn it back on and add laundry soap, as usual.


You can also try this method with vinegar. Add one cup of vinegar to your laundry and allowing it to soak for several hours, however, after soaking your clothes in vinegar water, you will need to wash them with bleach-free detergent. Combining bleach and vinegar will create toxic fumes that are hazardous to your health. , If that is not possible, you might consider laying your clothes out on a towel to dry. Wring the clothing out so that it is not dripping wet and lay it flat on a towel. Leave the clothing to dry for 24 - 48 hours.


Hanging or laying your clothes out to dry will help your energy bill as well as your laundry. If you have not gotten all of the body odor out of your clothes during washing, dryers tend to lock the odors in place.

Try using coffee grounds.",How to Make Your Clothes Smell Good Overnight1," Hang your clothes up to let air circulate around them and blow away bad smells and fumes. Hanging your clothes up is good way to help ensure that they smell fresh and clean when you put them on in the morning. If you can hang them up in fresh air, such as in your yard or on your balcony, then you will get the most benefit.You could also hang your clothes up near to an open window.
This can be a good way to ensure that they are exposed to lots of fresh air even if you have to keep them indoors.;
, Even if you can’t hang your clothes up outside or with exposure to fresh air, you should still hang them up overnight. You won’t get the same amount of freshness as you would if you hung them up outside, but it is definitely preferable to leaving your clothes in a heap on the floor.Hang them up in your closet or on a clothes rail.
Try to ensure that there is some circulation around the clothes.
Be wary of putting your closet in a dark and damp corner of your room.

, Once you have hung your clothes up in the closet, there are a whole host of things you can add that will help your clothes smell fresh in the morning. One of the most popular methods is just to spray a couple of cotton balls with your favourite perfume, or other scented product, and hang the balls up in your closet.


You could use some scented essential oils rather than perfume.
You can also just place the cotton on a shelf in your closet.
The scent will transfer onto your clothes overnight.
This method will effectively cover up bad smells with good ones., Give your clothes a quick spray before you go to bed to help them stay fresh and smell good in the morning. You can use all sorts of different things to spritz your clothes, and it depends on what kinds of smells you like. There are a range of products you can buy to freshen up stale clothes by spritzing them, but you can also easily concoct your own at home.


Add a few drops of an essential oil to a spray bottle of water.
Some good choices are lavender, grapefruit and lemon., Coffee grounds are known to absorb unpleasant odours, and you can use them to help keep your clothes smelling good overnight. Take a pot of coffee grounds, and make a few small holes in the top of the container. Tuck this container of coffee grounds in your closet, and leave it to soak up the bad smells.


You should generally replace the pot of coffee grounds once a month."

Make your own scented dryer sheets.,
Dry clothes thoroughly.",How to Make Laundry Smell Good1," Add a few drops of your favorite scented oil to a small spray bottle. Fill it with water and give it a few shakes. Mist your dirty clothes with it before adding them to the washer., Laundry detergents come in a variety of scents, so go with whichever one appeals to you most. However, be aware that scented varieties may leave behind more residue than non-scented detergents, which can lead to mildew in your machine.As an alternative, try using a laundry soap that is scented naturally, without additional chemicals, like Dr. Bonner’s Peppermint Laundry Soap., Choose a scrap piece of cotton to use (such as a piece of an old hand towel, sheet, or shirt). Give it a soak under running water so it’s totally wet. Then squeeze out the excess liquid. Give it about a half dozen drops of your prefered scented essential oil. Add it to your dryer’s load in the last ten minutes of the dry cycle to scent your clothes.You should be able to reuse the sheet a few times without having to do anything more than soak and wring it before each use. Give it a sniff after each use to judge the scent’s strength. If it’s weak or undetectable, include it in your next wash cycle and then add more drops afterward.
Alternatively, you could do the same with wool dryer balls if you already use those., Whether you air-dry them or toss them in the dryer, make sure they aren’t damp at all before folding them up and putting them away. Expect mildew to take advantage of any lingering moisture, no matter how small of an amount it might. Leave the clothes hanging or restart the dryer if they feel even the tiniest bit wet."

Use bluing liquid.",How to Whiten Clothes1," Chlorine bleach is a powerful whitener, but it should only be used on white clothes. If you have a patterned or multi-colored item you want to brighten up, use a method aside from chlorine bleach. Here's how to use chlorine bleach:


Check the labels of your items to make sure it's safe to use with chlorine bleach






Start your washer with the regular detergent






Add 3/4 cup of chlorine bleach to the water






Add the laundry





;
, Non-chlorine bleaches use oxygen or hydrogen peroxide to whiten fabrics. This is a safer bet for fabrics that aren't safe to use with chlorine bleach, because it's gentler. OxyClean, Clorox 2 and other products bleach items without using chlorine. Here's how to use them:


Check the labels of your items to make sure it's safe to bleach them with non-chlorine bleach






Make a solution of the non-chlorine bleach product according to the instructions on the bottle






Soak your items in the solution overnight

Add 1/2 cup of distilled white vinegar to the washing machine for enhanced brightening







, You can also treat smaller stains with non-chlorine bleach or just plain hydrogen peroxide. Try to catch the stain before it dries and sets if you can. Here's an effective stain removal method:


Pour the non-chlorine bleach or peroxide on the fresh stain, completely soaking it






Let the item sit in a non-chlorine bleach/water solution overnight






Launder the item as usual the next day







, This liquid is a combination of ferric ferrocyanide and water. It brightens whites by adding the slightest hint of blue, offsetting that yellowish hue that t-shirts, socks and sheets can take on.

Press water from the fabric.,
Hang or lay flat to dry.",How to Wash a Leotard2," The best indicator of how a leotard should be washed is the care tag. While these are usually attached to leotards, some come separately.


Many care tags will say “Dry clean only.” Although this can be a bother, you should adhere to the instructions on the tag, as this will ensure your leotard performs optimally.

, Fill a large basin with cool-lukewarm water. You should be able to place your hands in the basin without discomfort.

, To clean your leotards, place a quarter-sized amount of detergent into the basin, avoiding powders. Powdered detergent may not be able to break down fully in cool water and may snag your fabric, so liquid detergent is a must.Gentle detergents such as baby detergent are best for leotards, as the fibers present in leotards are quite delicate and easily damaged.

, Using your hands or a spoon, stir the detergent in the water until you see bubbles on the surface of the water, and all of the detergent has dissolved. If your hands or the spoon still feel slimy, continue to stir.


If the slimy feeling persists, you may have used too much detergent. You can dump out ½-⅔ of your mixture, and refill the basin the rest of the way with water.

, Lower your leotard into the water, stopping along the way if you notice any of the color fading or bleeding. If the color continues to bleed, make sure it does not stain any other suits by washing each of them separately.If you have a multi-colored leotard and see the color running, wash each side of the leotard separately, if possible.
If the color continues to run and washing each color separately is not possible, you may need to have your leotard dry cleaned.

, Swish the leotard through the water in circular strokes, then agitate it between your palms to apply the detergent. Do not bunch your leotard during this process; instead, place the fabric between your palms and rub your hands together. Keep moving down the fabric until the entire leotard has been washed in this manner., Once all of your leotard has been covered in soap and water and thoroughly cleaned, remove it from your basin and rinse it in fresh, cool water--again, avoiding hot water. Rinse until the water runs clear of both soap bubbles and color.


Removing all of the soap from the fabric will help your leotard last longer. Leaving soap behind can result in the breakdown of fabric, and a loss of vibrant color.

, Gently press your hands together, but do not wring your leotard. Instead, press the water from the fabric using a towel or your hands, keeping the leotard in its original shape.Wringing your leotard can cause it to lose its shape and can damage the elastic and spandex in the fabric. If you are having trouble removing water on your own, you can hang your leotard to drain water over a bathtub or sink.

, Using either a line or a hanger, hang or lay your leotard to dry, avoiding the sun and spots directly beneath or beside a heater vent.If you are using a hanger, pin the leotard to the hanger to avoid making “dents” in the fabric.
If you are laying over a drying surface, quickly wipe it down to make sure you do not deposit dirt on your freshly-cleaned leotard.
If your leotard has multiple colors, it should be laid flat to dry to prevent the colors from running together.

"
"
Separate your practice leotards.,
Place your washer on the “delicate” cycle.,
Run cold water.,
Place your leotards into the washbasin.,
Hang or lay flat to dry.",How to Wash a Leotard3," Because competition and performance leotards are usually adorned with foil, sequins, rhinestones, and other delicate decorations, these are not fit for use in a washing machine. Instead, wash only your basic leotards in a machine.


If your practice leotards are prone to bleeding, washing one at a time, or washing with similar colors will prevent discoloration.

, If you use your washer, you must use the delicate cycle, as the delicate cycle will not agitate the wash as drastically, and will not pull or yank on the delicate fibers of your leotard. “Permanent Press,” while a more delicate cycle, is still too harsh a setting.Use the shortest delicate cycle possible. The longer your leotards are in the machine, the higher the risk of damage is, so use the shortest cycle possible for your machine, including a single rinse.

, Because you can use your hands to gauge the water’s temperature, hand-washing is fine in lukewarm water. A washer’s “warm” cycle, on the other hand, might be a bit too warm for delicate fabrics.Note that some powdered detergents do not dissolve well in cold water, and some liquid soaps do not disperse. Check your detergent to make sure it is formulated for cold water.

, Place your leotards into the basin, gently layering around the agitation spindle, if your washer has one. Do not overload the washer’s chamber, instead washing only 3-5 leotards at one time.


Overloading your washer can cause your leotard to get caught on the machine’s spindle, or caught in the door.
Overloading can also make the rinse cycle less effective, leaving behind dirt and detergent.

, Do not place your leotard in the dryer; although a washer can be placed on a delicate mode to protect your leotard, the heat and tumbling of a dryer can damage your leotard.


Excess heat will damage the elastic properties of the fabric, dramatically increase wear on metallic or other effects, and may even shrink the leotard.
If you must use a dryer, use a no-heat setting and make sure the leotard is inside-out.

Assess where the odor is coming from on your clothes.,
Apply a spot treatment to the odorous area.,
Launder as usual.,
Hang outside to dry, if possible, or lay out on a towel to dry.",How to Remove Body Odor from Clothes2," This method of treating body odor on clothes is a spot treatment, so you should focus your work on specific areas. In most cases, the smell is usually coming from the underarm area of shirts or the crotch of pants.

, There are many commercial products that you can buy at the store but using a bit of your own laundry detergent may very well do the trick. You can also try mixing a paste of baking soda and water. Make it thick, but not so thick you can't spread it. Apply the paste onto the area where the odor is most pungent.
Some suggest crushing up uncoated aspirin and rubbing it onto the odorous areas of clothes. The salicylic acid in the aspirin should help eliminate body odor smells.

, Remember to keep your colors and types of fabric separate. A warmer wash cycle will probably help get the smells out more effectively but always remember to follow the wash instructions on the labels of your clothes.

, Try to avoid using the dryer if you are not sure whether the odor is gone. Dryers can lock in the odor, making it even harder to remove next time you was your clothes.

Figure out where the smell is located on your clothes.,
Spray a treatment of vodka on the smelly spots.,
Let the area dry before putting the clothes back on.",How to Remove Body Odor from Clothes3," This method of treating body odor on clothes is a spot treatment, so you should focus your work on specific areas. In most clothes this is usually the underarm area of shirts or the crotch of pants.

, Simply put undiluted vodka into a spray bottle and spray the affected area directly. You will need to saturate the area completely, as a light misting will not do the trick.This is an especially good method for getting rid of odors in dry clean only clothing. You don't always have time to take your clothes to the cleaners and that can get really expensive. Spraying spots may allow you to launder your nice clothes less often.
You can also use isopropyl alcohol, vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide, but vodka has been used for removing a variety of smells from fabrics. It is odorless and evaporates quickly from your clothing, so you will not necessarily need to launder your clothes after using it, as you probably would with vinegar.

, Once dry, the odor should be gone. If it's not totally gone, try soaking the area again with the vodka treatment. It may take a few treatments to get rid of a very strong smell.

Use a soap bar.,
Use herb sachets.,
Try dryer sheets.,
Consider draw liners.",How to Make Your Clothes Smell Good Overnight2," If you are keeping your clothes in a container overnight, you can help them stay smelling good by just using a bar of soap. Carefully fold your clothes into the container, and then place a breathable cloth, such as a napkin or a thin tablecloth, over the top of the clothes. Get a sweet-smelling soap bar that you like, and place this on top of the breathable cloth.


Put the lid back on the container, and leave it.
The clothes should have absorbed the smell of the soap after around four hours.
Try out a few different soaps to see which one you like the most.
Lavender and lemon are good choices to start with.You could repeat this method with a drawer rather than a storage container.

, Making a small sachet or a nice smelling herb and adding to the container or draw where you store your clothes overnight will help you wake up to fresh smelling clothes. You can buy small sachets of potpourri, but you can also make your own at home. Get a few small cotton bags that are breathable.


Then fill them will dried herbs that you like the smell of, and put them in the drawer or container.
Lavender is a popular choice, and you can also try lemongrass.Experiment with some different scents to find the one that works best for you.

, Dryer sheets are a tried and tested way to keep clothes smelling nice and fresh when they are being stored. If you have a big drawer or container full of clothes add a dryer sheet between each layer to help keep them fresh and smelling good.You can also just place one dryer sheet at the bottom of each drawer or container.
Adding a dryer sheet to your suitcase is also great for keeping clothes fresh when travelling., You could opt for getting especially designer drawer liners to help keep clothes fresh overnight. These work in the same way as the dryer sheets, but they are generally scented and designed to last for longer. You will find these in department and homeware stores, and they come in a range of fragrances."

Wash wet clothes right away.,
Rewash clean clothes left in the washer.,
Prevent mildew with lavender essential oil.,
Deodorize your machine.,
Air your washer out after each use.,
Cut back on the detergent if needed.",How to Make Laundry Smell Good2," Remember that mildew starts to grow wherever moisture is present. Be aware that damp dirty clothing can start to stink up before it ever makes it to the washer, even if it didn’t smell bad when you first stripped it off. Use wet clothes as an excuse to start a load as soon as you take them off.


If this isn’t possible, don’t ball up your wet clothes and dump them in the hamper. Let them air-dry on a hanger, drying rack, or clothesline before adding them to your other dirty laundry.

, If you forgot all about your last load sitting in the washer, wash it a second time to get rid of any funky smells that may have developed in the meantime. Use the highest temperature possible that’s still safe for your fabrics. Instead of detergent, however, choose between adding color-safe bleach or chlorine to kill the mildew and eliminate that smell.Or, if you want to avoid chemical products, use plain white vinegar instead.These all smell pretty strong in their own right, so you may need to wash your clothes a third time with laundry detergent to get rid of any residual smells.

, If you’re really prone to forgetting about that last load in your washer, take preemptive action. Add several drops of lavender essential oil to your load when pouring in the detergent at the start of your cycle. Use this mold-resistant product to protect your clothes from developing mildew for longer.This can stall mildew from growing for at least a couple of days.

, If the washer itself is the smelly culprit, fill the drum with hot water. Add 2 cups of white vinegar. Let the water sit for 30 minutes or so. Then start a regular wash cycle without adding any laundry. Give it a test sniff once it’s done and repeat if necessary., Remember that mildew loves moisture and darkness. So don’t shut your washer’s lid or door once you empty it. Either leave it open all the time for more air circulation and light, or give it at least the length of your dryer’s cycle to air out before you close it., If the washer tends to stink up on its own pretty frequently, reduce the amount of liquid detergent and fabric softener that you use. Keep in mind that these are thicker than water and don’t always dissolve all the way during a wash cycle. This means that residue is left inside your machine, which can be a breeding ground for mildew.Remember that many detergents are concentrated, so you only need a little bit. If you experience buildup in your machine, check the detergent's directions for recommended amounts.

Separate these from other clothes.,
Wash in small loads.,
Presoak them in dish soap.,
Pretreat smelly stains.",How to Make Laundry Smell Good3," If a used article smells strongly of some offensive odor, don’t throw it in the hamper with the rest of your dirty laundry. Store it separately until it’s time to wash it. Prevent your other clothes from picking up the foul smell.


Seal it in an airtight container if you’re worried about the offending article stinking up the whole room.

, Don’t fill the washer’s drum all the way to the top with laundry if you have any clothes that smell particularly gross. Keep those articles more accessible to water and detergent by washing them in smaller loads. If you have a bunch of smelly clothes, wash them together as one small load (or break them up into multiple small loads if you really have a lot). If you only have one or two stinky articles, however, either:


Wash them by themselves with no other dirty clothes.
Wash them with a small load of smaller articles, like socks.

, If the article in question has picked up a general odor like cigarette smoke or fish (as opposed to a smell emanating from a localized stain), squeeze some drops of dish soap into a container large enough to hold it. Then fill it with warm water. Add the clothes and let them soak for roughly ten minutes. Then:Pour all the contents (soap, water, and clothes) into your washer. Stir them around by hand and then let the clothes sit for a half hour.
Add detergent and start the appropriate wash cycle for that article, including a spin cycle to dry. Use the hottest water that your clothes’ fabric-care tag recommends.

, If the odor is due to a localized stain (as it would be with, say, a dirty diaper), create a thick paste by mixing baking soda with water. Depending on the size of the stain(s), start with a tablespoon of baking soda. Stir in just enough water to hydrate all of the baking soda without dissolving any so you can still spread the paste around easily. Then:Spread the paste over the stain and give it about ten minutes to set in.
Add the clothes with the paste still on them to the washer, plus 1 cup of white vinegar.
Start the appropriate wash cycle for that item, including a spin cycle, with the hottest water that your fabric allows.
Repeat if the odor is still detectable afterward.

Add 1/2 cup of baking soda to your laundry detergent.,
Use borax.,
Use distilled vinegar.",How to Whiten Clothes2," Wash cotton and linen sheets, tablecloths and other white laundry items. Afterward, allow them to dry in direct sunlight. Hang them on a clothesline or lay them on the lawn to let the sunshine help whiten them. The sun's UV rays will brighten your items right up.

, Add 1/2 cup of lemon juice to the wash cycle, along with your detergent. Lemon is a great natural whitening agent. Be careful though - it can leave bleach marks on colored items. It's best to use lemon juice only on pure white items.

, This is an excellent natural whitener you probably have in your kitchen cabinet. To remove stubborn spots from whites, pretreat the spot by applying a thick paste of baking soda and water.

, Sodium borate, or borax, is a natural mineral that helps break down stains that cause items to yellow. Add 1/2 cup to your washing machine at the beginning of the wash cycle for best effect., Pour 1 cup of distilled white vinegar into the washer with your regular washing detergent. This is a great way to perk up clothes that are looking a little dingy.

Check care tags.,
Spot treat any stains.,
Wash pillows in a mixture of vinegar, washing soda, and detergent.,
Run a second cycle with just hot water.,
Check for color.,
Place in dryer with tennis balls.",How to Whiten Yellowed Pillows1," As a basic rule of thumb, always check care tags before laundering something. While most pillows are machine washable, some might require dry clean or spot cleaning only, as either the fabric or the pillow’s filling will degrade in the wash.Although you could forego the manufacturer’s instructions and machine wash your pillows anyway, this will void any warranties you might have on your pillows, and could even leach toxic water, in the case of some foam pillows.;
, Pillows are prone to staining due to sweat, dirt, and makeup, primarily, although oils and food stains often find their way onto pillows. Before you toss your yellowed pillows into the washer, spot treat any small stains, using a standard stain removal spray, or a paste of baking soda and water., Instead of laundering your pillows only in your standard detergent, run a load with your standard detergent, as well as vinegar, washing soda, and dishwasher detergent.Use 1 C (8 oz) of dishwasher detergent, ¾ C (6 oz) washing soda, and ½ C (4 oz) of vinegar for every 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of regular laundry detergent you use. This mixture was formulated to wash two pillows.

, The mixture above can be thick and grainy, and may adhere to pillows without a thorough rinse. After you’ve run a cycle with the mixture, run a second cycle with only hot water, or hot water and and ½ C (4 oz) of vinegar. This will remove any remaining detergent, and will give your pillows a quick sanitizing session., Remove your pillows from the washer, and check to see if the color has improved. If not, you can place the pillow(s) back into the washer, this time running a load with approximately ¼ C (2 oz) of peroxide as a safer bleach solution.


If the pillow is still yellow following this procedure, the color may not be salvageable. If the color is the only issue, and the pillow does not smell of mildew, mold, or sweat, you can simply place it in a pillowcase to hide its unsightly color.
If the pillow persists in having an odor, it is time for a new pillow.

, Once clean, your pillows should be placed in a clean dryer on the “air dry” setting, with tennis balls thrown in. The tennis balls will “punch” the pillows as they dry, creating a more even dry cycle and giving your pillows a chance to fluff up.Using tennis balls alone may result in a rubbery smell on your pillows. If this is the case, or you are sensitive to smell, you can wrap the balls in socks or an old shirt to mask the smell.

Separate white clothes from light- and dark-colored clothes.,
Separate whites with colors from all-white whites.,
Sort whites into different piles based on filth level.,
Sort whites according to care instructions.,
Separate whites that produce lint from whites that collect lint.,
Wash whites in hot water whenever possible.,
Add the right amount of detergent to your load based on packaging instructions.,
Use the right type of bleach, or natural alternatives to bleach.,
Consider using a bluing agent to neutralize yellow stains on white fabric.,
Transfer whites from the washing machine to dryer immediately when the washing machine stops.,
Inspect all clothes for remaining stains before placing in the dryer.,
Dry whites accordingly based on care instructions.,
Hang all whites to dry outside in the sun whenever possible.",How to Wash White Clothes," Whites should always be washed separately from colored clothes to avoid colors transferring to and staining white clothes.;
, This helps prevent colors from bleeding onto all-white clothes, despite how small the surface area of color may be. For example, separate a white shirt with bright red stripes from all-white t-shirts.

, This prevents dirt, food, and other debris on soiled white clothes from staining other white clothing. For example, if a white shirt is caked with mud after spending an afternoon gardening, separate that particular shirt from cleaner, brighter-looking whites.

, Tags and clothing labels provide washing instructions for water temperature, washing cycle, and whether or not you can use bleach. For example, place all gentle-cycle clothing in one pile, and regular, permanent-press clothing in another pile., This prevents lint from accumulating and sticking to fabrics from which lint is difficult to remove. For example, wash white towels separately from white pants made from corduroy to prevent lint from sticking to corduroy.

, Hot water is more effective at killing germs and bacteria, and helps keep whites looking white.


Make adjustments to water temperature as needed based on care labels to prevent clothes from shrinking or becoming misshapen. For instance, clothing made from nylon, spandex, lycra, and certain cotton blends may shrink in hot water.Use cool water when washing stained white clothes. Stains from items such as wine, chocolate, and tea come out better in cool water, which also helps prevent stains from bleeding onto other whites.

, The amount of detergent you should use depends on load size, and on the strength level of your detergent brand.


Avoid adding more detergent than recommended by the packaging. Excess detergent can lead to filmy buildup that attracts more dirt and is more noticeable on white clothing.

, Bleach helps whiten clothes, but can be toxic and irritating to sensitive skin. Consider using chlorine bleach to help remove heavy stains, or combine one part bleach and one part baking soda to neutralize the toxicity of pure bleach.


Use bleach as directed on the packaging label to avoid using too much, which can stain your clothes gray or yellow.
Avoid using bleach on delicate clothing, since chlorine- and oxygen-based bleach brands can weaken fabrics and lead to tearing or fraying.
Substitute bleach with household ingredients that have natural bleaching properties, such as lemon juice, white vinegar, baking soda, or hydrogen peroxide. These ingredients make whites whiter without the added risks of toxicity and skin irritation.

, Bluing agent formulas make whites whiter by releasing a small amount of blue dye to the water and removing during the rinse cycle.

, This helps prevent whites from developing mold or mildew as a result from sitting in the washer for too long.

, This prevents dryer heat from setting in stains if stains aren’t completely removed.


Rewash stained clothes in the washing machine as needed before transferring to the dryer.

, Some clothes may instruct you to “lay flat to dry,” or recommend a particular dryer setting. For example, fabrics such as nylon and acrylic may require a lower temperature setting since these fibers tend to absorb less water.

, The sun’s ultraviolet rays have a natural bleaching effect on clothing that helps keep whites white. Allowing clothes to hang-dry is often more cost-effective than using your dryer."

Air-dry your wet laundry if possible.,
Scent your drawers and closets with soap.,
Fill cotton bags with herbs.,
Spritz your clothes with a fabric spray.,
Deodorize your closet and drawers.",How to Make Laundry Smell Good4," Hang your laundry to dry on a clothesline outside once they’ve finished washing. Freshen your clothes with more sunlight and air circulation than a dryer allows. This is an especially good idea if any articles were particularly stinky to begin with.Of course, this is only a good idea if outside is smelling nice and fresh. So if your neighbor is smoking meats for a barbecue or something like that, stick to the dryer instead.

, Choose a strongly-scented bar of soap to store with your clean laundry to make them smell fresh and clean long after they’ve been washed. Simply place the soap in a cotton muslin bag or stitch together a pouch for it using a similarly light fabric that will allow the scent to escape. Then place one in each drawer to your dresser, as well as your closet., If the smell of soap isn’t something you want to carry with you, try filling cotton muslin bags with your favorite herb(s) instead. Store these in your drawers and closets to scent your clothes. Additionally, fill some bags that are small enough to fit in the pockets of whichever clothes you wear the least to keep smelling nice for longer periods., Keep your clothes smelling sharp with a scented fabric spray. Use a store-bought product like Febreeze if that suits your fancy. Or, make your own by filling a spray bottle with water and adding some drops of your favorite essential oil.Some essential oils may stain white or light fabrics. Before spritzing your whole wardrobe, do a test spray on an article that you don’t care about to make sure it won’t do so., If your closet or dresser has its own distinct smell that you’d like to keep out of your clothes, open a box of baking soda and keep that inside to absorb the closet or dresser’s odor. Alternatively, try filling an open container with coffee grounds and use that instead. Either way, replace it periodically (about once a month) since these can only absorb so much."

Adhere to care tags.,
Place pillows in the sun.,
Put microfiber pillows in a basin with warm water and gentle detergent.",How to Whiten Yellowed Pillows2," If you have a down or memory foam pillow, do not ignore the warnings printed on the label, as the materials in these pillows are not water safe. Instead, use spot treatments alone. If this is the case, you can treat stains using a paste of baking soda and water, or spray vinegar to eliminate odor.

, Because you cannot use a washer, get creative with your pillow whitening. Set yellowed down or microfiber pillows in a sunny window to lighten them, apply bleach or vinegar using a small toothbrush, or apply baking soda to the pillow to soak up dampness and odor., Squeeze your pillow 3-7 times, allowing the detergent to work its way through all of the material, then rinse under cool water and squeeze to dry.Do not wring your pillow, as this can damage the memory foam and tear the netting holding the foam in place.

"
Change pillowcases and bedding once per week.,
Use linen spray.,
Machine wash pillows at least twice per year.,
Go to bed with a clean face and hair.",How to Whiten Yellowed Pillows3," To keep your pillows in prime working condition, change your pillowcases and bedding at least once per week. If the bed’s owner is prone to sweating, bedwetting, or wearing makeup to bed, change the sheets and pillowcases twice per week.Keep at least two sets of sheets on hand--one on your bed, and one at the ready when laundry day rolls around. Regularly rotating your sheets will keep your mattress and pillows clean, and will help your sheets last longer.

, To keep your pillow smelling fresh and clean, use linen spray in between washes. Many linen sprays are made from safe, fresh ingredients such as witch hazel or essential oils, many of which can be tailored to suit your preferences. A quality linen spray will keep mold and mildew at bay.Linen sprays can double as sleep aids; a spray using lavender or cedarwood oil, for instance, may help you relax and get to sleep.

, Some experts recommend machine-washing your pillows every 3 months, but all agree that pillows should go no longer than 5-6 months before getting a thorough cleaning. Washing your pillows regularly will help prevent yellowing and buildup.The number of times you clean your pillows will, again, depend on your body’s natural composition and your sleep habits. If you are prone to sweating during the night, your pillows will need more frequent washings.
If you often go to sleep without cleaning your face and hair, you may need to wash your pillows even more frequently, such as every two months.

, Although you do not have to shower each and every night, quickly washing your face and brushing your hair will help prolong the life of your pillows and pillowcases. Many cosmetic ingredients are harsh and can not only discolor fabric, but also break fabric down.Sweat and oils from your face and hair are inevitable, but their effects can be minimized with a simple cleaning routine each night. Even doing something as simple as splashing water on your face and tying your hair back can extend your pillows’ life.

Know what caused the stain.,
If it is an oily stain, avoid using water.,
If it not an oily stain, rinse with cold water.,
Apply stain remover to the stain.,
Place it in your washing machine.",How to Get Stains out of White Clothes1," The first thing to do when you are deciding how to deal with a stain is to work out what caused it. The principal thing to determine is whether it is an oily, or a non-oily stain. It’s important to figure this out because it influences what you’re first step will be.


The majority of chemical stain removers are designed to work on all kinds of stains. Finding out if it is an oily or non-oily stain is mainly to direct your immediate response.
Tips for which home made stain removers work best for specific stains are highlighted in the third method.;
, If the stain is oily, avoid the obvious temptation to rinse it under cold water straight away. Oil repels water, so any water than comes into contact with the stain could contribute to it setting more strongly.Instead, dab it with a dry paper towel. Oily stains have a variety of sources, but most commonly include:


Grease stains.
Mascara.
Lipstick.
Foods which are rich in oil or butter.

, If the stains comes from a non-oily source, then usually the first thing to do is dab off any excess and the rinse it in cold water. If you hold the garment under the tap so that the water is hitting the back of stain, it can help to flush out the stain from behind.Holding the stained side facing the flow of water could press the stain further into the fabric. Typical non-oily stains on white clothes can include:


Sweat stains.
Non-oil based makeup.
Foods that aren’t oily.
Blood.
Dirt.

, You can buy stain removal sprays, liquids and powders from your local store. There will most likely be quite a variety of products available, so look for that is designed to work on white clothes if possible. The next step is simply to apply the stain removal powder or liquid to the stain according to the instructions on the packaging.









Some products will recommend you apply it to the edges of the stain, others at the heart of the stain.
Generally, you won't need to apply a particularly large amount for a small stain.

, Once you have applied the stain remover, you simply put it into your washing machine and wash it as normal. Be sure to read the instructions carefully before you do this to check if the product you have recommends a particular temperature.

,
Soak socks or other heavily soiled whites in the solution for about 30 minutes.,
Air dry your clothes in the sun as the sun acts as a natural whitener, and the air leaves the clothes smelling fresh and clean.

",How to Get Whites White,"


The less time stains have to set, the less stubborn they will be to remove. This especially applies to yellow stains under the armpits from perspiration and deodorant.;
,,


Too much bleach can actually damage or yellow your whites, so measure the bleach and water carefully.

,


Many detergents have stain-removing enzymes that take several minutes to activate and bleach will cease this reaction. Don't add the bleach too late as it needs at least 5 minutes to activate in the wash cycle.

,


When you use baking soda to get whites white, reduce the amount of bleach by half.

,


The vinegar scent will be present when the clothes are wet but will fade and dissipate as the clothes dry.

,,


If you want the most environmentally friendly option, make sure that the dishwashing detergent does not contain phosphate or chlorine.

,,,


Soak overnight to whiten the laundry more thoroughly.

Clean out potential hiding spots.,
Prevent spiders from entering your home.,
Call a professional exterminator.",How to Kill Black Widow Spiders1," Black widows hole up in seldom-disturbed areas, such as woodpiles, storage boxes, the back of closets, and so on. Not only will cleaning these areas eliminate potential habitats, you'll also get rid of areas for black widow prey to live.


Wear gardening gloves. Just in case you do stumble over a spider, your hands will be safe from bites.
De-clutter. If you have unnecessary boxes, wood or other items crowding your house, getting rid of them can remove potential hiding places.
Vacuum. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment, use it to clean out dark nooks and crannies. If you see a web without a spider in it, the vacuum is your best bet. Just be sure to seal the bag and dispose of it (outside the house) as soon as you're done so nothing can escape back into your home.
Spray down the outside of your house. Use a high-pressure hose to destroy webs and egg sacs. Pay particular attention to window wells, window frames, and door frames.
Clear vegetation that is in direct contact with your home. Ivy and other plant life on your house or around its perimeter provide a home for these pests.
Clean regularly. Chores like vacuuming and keeping your living area clean aid in preventing spider infestation. Vacuuming is especially important because it clears out dust, eggs and the spiders themselves.;
, The best method to avoid black widows is prevention. By keeping your doors and windows caulked, you are taking an important step in preventing spiders and other insects from getting into your home. Weatherproofing your exits is also very helpful.

, If you suspect that your black widow problem is bigger than you can handle on your own, call a professional who's licensed to use heavier insecticides. If possible, ask around a few different businesses for quotes depending on the size of your house and the suspected severity of the infestation.

Although whites do not have to be stuffed into the back of your closet or set aside only for calm, careful lounging indoors, to keep your whites a brilliant white, you do have to be careful how and when you wear them.


White can be useful to wear in the summer heat, so you may not be able to avoid wearing white outdoors or in inclement weather. If this is the case, try to only wear white on top; white bottoms and shoes will tarnish quickly.;
, White clothes and pizza do not mix. The same goes for virtually any dish with a tomato-based sauce, or a food item with a dipping sauce. Opt instead for fresh ingredients (think vegetables and salads) whenever possible, as few of these ingredients stain.If you are wearing white when you go out and have no choice but to eat stain-prone foods, use your napkin to your advantage; tuck it into your collar, or spread it over your lap to catch dripping food.

, Children spiffed up in their Sunday best are undeniably adorable. Children covered in dirt and food, while also adorable, are highly likely. Trying to keep whites white with children is a difficult task. Although using these tips and tricks will help, largely avoiding whites for children will prove an easier task.


If you must use whites with your children, treat any stains immediately upon removal.
White onesies and T-shirts are often stained yellow from drool. To prevent this difficult-to-remove staining, use drool bibs or handkerchiefs.

, While some clothing items allow you to wear them 2-3 times before needing a wash, whites do not hold up quite as well. Each time you wear your white clothes, they should be washed. Even if you can’t see dirt or grime, everything from the sweat of your body to the chemicals contained in your deodorant has the potential to turn your whites a dingy yellow or gray. These items should not be allowed to linger any more than necessary.For jeans and skirts, wash every 1-2 wears. Bottoms are typically made of a hardier fabric and can take more of a beating, so to speak.

, If you are out and about, blot the stain carefully, but do not rub. If you have a laundry pen with you, you can dab the stain with that. If not, immediately remove the stained article of clothing upon coming home and use either a stain remover or a toothbrush and your standard detergent to pre-treat the stain.When pre-treating, always use a white cloth to dab away the stain, as a colored cloth may leave behind some dye.

, You can even go so far as to have a pile of more dingy whites, such as underclothes and socks, and a pile of crisp whites, such as dress shirts, or work attire. Whatever you decide, this is a step that cannot be skipped under any circumstances.While it may be tempting to throw really light colors in with your whites, or even light grays, stick to white alone.
Keeping your whites separate may mean washing whites in small loads. If this is the case, adjust your washer’s settings accordingly; using too much water could interfere with the laundry soap’s ability to clean properly.

, After each spot treatment, rinse and soak them for 30-60 minutes in hot water. This will help lift any lingering stains, and will give the treatment a chance to dissolve.If you used a lot of soap, you may need to repeat this step twice, gently squeezing the garment in between soaks.
If your laundry is sensitive to hot water, a warm or cold soak will achieve the same effect, though to a lesser degree.

, The type of fabric will determine the ideal wash cycle; some fabrics can withstand extremely hot water, while others will shrink or become disheveled. Sort your white laundry according to color, as well as fabric, to avoid discoloration and disrepair.Cotton is a tough fabric, while wool and linen are both prone to shrinking. While cotton can withstand high temperatures, wool and linen should be washed in cold or warm water. Synthetic fibers vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.

, The fabric and cut of your clothing will play a significant role in the type of wash cycle you should use. Instead of merely sorting your piles into whites and throwing all of your whites into a one-size-fits-all washer setting, wash and dry each of your whites according to the tags’ specifications.Although it may seem easier to just throw all of your delicates together, different fabrics require different care and washing settings. Failing to adhere to the labels’ instructions could damage the fabric, cause colors to run, or void warranty and return policies.

, Hot water lifts debris and disinfects. To keep your whites white, use the hottest setting your washer (and your fabric) will allow. The exception to this rule is, of course, when delicate fabrics such as silk, linen, and wool come into play.Although hot water is ideal, your washer itself should be disinfected regularly to prevent buildup from transferring to your clothing. Once per month, run an empty load with hot water and vinegar to remove buildup and residue.

, A rinse cycle is designed to rinse away detergent, dirt, and debris. If the rinse cycle is impeded in any way, dirty water will soak into your whites. If you have the option, run your whites through a second rinse cycle to make sure everything has been washed away.Using an extra rinse cycle can get expensive quickly. If having multiple rinse cycles each wash is too difficult, simply pay careful attention to how clean your washer is, and the amount of laundry soap you use. Never exceed the recommended amount.

, The heat from the dryer can set stains deeply into fabric. Whenever possible, avoid drying your white clothes, instead hanging them to dry. As an added benefit, your whites will last longer; the extreme heat used in the dryer can cause fabrics to break down and wear through more quickly, which means replacing your favorite white items more often., If you have the option, dry your whites in the sun; the sun acts as a wonderful bleaching agent, and can be an indispensable tool in keeping whites white. In addition, the outdoor air may provide a natural method of giving your clothes a fresh, clean smell.When drying in the summer, be sure to check for bugs on your clothing before bringing them in. The last thing you’d want while folding laundry is to encounter a large beetle or spider.
If you cannot dry clothes outdoors in the sun, drying next to a sunlit window is the next best thing.

, Vinegar’s acidic nature helps disinfect and remove stains, and can also remove unpleasant smells, such as mold mildew, and body odor. If your whites have been overtaken by poor smells, vinegar is the best option to remove them. All it takes is between 1 tablespoon and ¼ cup poured directly into the wash basin or detergent reservoir.Do not overdo vinegar use; because vinegar is acidic, too much can cause damage to your clothes over time.

, Lemon juice is an all-natural bleaching agent. You can use lemon essential oil, pre-squeezed lemon juice, or juice directly from a lemon. If you juice your own lemons, be sure to strain the juice through cheesecloth or a thin strainer to prevent getting lemon residue on your clothes.If you are using lemon juice, you can place the juice of two lemons in a bowl or tub with one gallon of warm water and allow them to soak for 30-60 minutes.
If you are using lemon essential oil, simply place 2-3 drops directly into the wash bin.

, To remove stains, you can make a paste with baking soda and warm water, then apply this mixture directly to the stain using a toothbrush or clothes brush. Allow the stain to soak in the mixture for 10-15 minutes before running it under warm water.This treatment is gentle enough that it can be done multiple times to get rid of a stubborn stain. However, be sure to thoroughly rinse the clothing item between each soak, as leaving baking soda in place can cause clothes to become brittle.

, Peroxide is an excellent, safe way to get tough stains out of clothes. Peroxide is particularly useful for removing blood and other dark, hard-to-lift stains. Once you have pretreated a stain, place the stained or discolored item in a tub filled with hot water and peroxide. Peroxide disinfects and cleans, and provides a safer alternative to bleach.Peroxide is used as an alternative to bleach for a reason: it acts as a bleaching agent, not merely a brightening or cleaning agent. Do not use peroxide on clothes you not wish to whiten.

, Although bleach is useful in disinfecting and whitening clothing items, there is some doubt as to how safe it is for use. Being a harsh chemical, bleach can begin to break down the fibers in a given fabric, weakening it and causing tears.If you do decide to use bleach on your whites, be sure to store it away from the reach of children and pets, and away from fire hazards such as the stove or dryer.

Obtain hydrogen peroxide and dishwashing liquid.,
Mix the liquid together and pour it into a spray bottle.,
Do a spot test.,
Spray the cleaner directly onto the stain.,
Consider soaking it for larger or stubborn stains.",How to Get Stains out of White Clothes2," There are any number of possible home made stain removers, but one particularly effective and simple one requires just hydrogen peroxide and dishwashing liquid.The recipe is easy, just pour two parts low-strength (3/4%) hydrogen peroxide and one part dishwashing liquid into a bucket.These parts will be quite small, but will depend on how much of the cleaner you want to make.









You can try this for oily and greasy stains, as well as normal dirt and food stains.
This home made cleaner can work on cotton, canvas and other clothing fabrics.
It is not recommended to use it on silk or wool.

, Once you have mixed hydrogen peroxide and dishwashing liquid together in the bucket, grab an empty spray bottle that you have cleaned out. Carefully pour the liquid into the bottle. You might want to use a funnel for this, especially if you are pouring it out of a large bucket.








, With all stain removers, but especially home made ones using chemicals, it is recommended that you do a spot test before applying a lot of the stain remover to your fabric. A spot test just means testing out a very small amount of your mixture on a discreet part of the fabric.









You are checking to be sure that the stain remover does not discolour or damage the material.
This mixture should be safe for all colours, but do a spot test to check before proceeding., Fasten the lid of the spray bottle securely, and test it once by spraying it into the sink. Once you are happy with it, spray the solution directly onto the offending stain or stains. Apply it liberally to the stain and leave to it soak for a few minutes or longer, depending on how patient you are.









Rinse it off with cold water.
If necessary, repeat this for harder stains.

, If you have larger stains that wouldn’t be tackled best with a spray bottle, you can modify this method to suit your needs. A diluted version of this cleaner is great for soaking a larger garment in. Simply add the same ratio of hydrogen peroxide and dishwashing liquid to a bucket of hot water.Place your clothes in the liquid and leave it to soak.
Rinse it off, and repeat if necessary.
You may find gently rubbing the affected area while it is submerged will help loosen the stain.

Use baking soda.,
Use lemon juice.,
Use white wine.,
Use white chalk for an oily stain.",How to Get Stains out of White Clothes3," The chemicals in store-bought stain removal products can be very effective, but can also irritate the skin and some people might prefer a more natural alternative. Baking soda is one of the classics of stain removal. It is well-known as a something to grab if there is spill. Just make a quick paste with some water, gently apply to the stain and let it sink in.








You can also combine it with some distilled white wine vinegar., Lemon juice is known as a particularly effective way to tackle unpleasant sweat stains on your white shirts and tea-shirts, especially under the armpits. Mix up a solution that is equal parts water and lemon juice, and then rub it into the affected area of the garment.








Lemon juice and salt can work well to tackle mildew and rust stains on white clothes.Adding some lemon juice to a white wash can generally refresh the clothes.

, One of the worst things to spill all over your white clothes is red wine, but, perhaps surprisingly, a good remedy for this is to spill more wine on yourself. Take a little white wine this time, and carefully pour it onto the stain and it will work against the red wine.Dab at the edges of the stain gently with some kitchen towel to prevent it spreading.This won’t make the stain disappear, but can help it come out in a normal wash subsequently.

, Oily stains are particularly tricky to deal with as water can make the problem worse. One natural method for oily stains is to use white chalk. Rub some white chalk onto the fabric without being too rough. By doing this, it is the chalk which will be absorbing the oil rather than the clothes.








Dust off any excess chalk before putting the garment in the wash.
Only wash it in cold water, and don’t put it in the dryer as this can cause the oil to set."

Differentiate between oxidizing and chlorine bleaches.,
Use bleach to spot clean persistent stains.,
Add bleach to your wash. A less precise way to use bleach to lighten whites and work against stains is simply to add some bleach to your normal wash.",How to Get Stains out of White Clothes4," Oxidizing bleaches are less severe than the chlorine versions, and as such are kinder to fabric. Hydrogen peroxide is a commonly used example of an oxidizing bleach which is often used to tackle stains. Chlorine bleaches are much stronger, more toxic, and should be used with care.Chlorine bleaches will damage colour on fabrics, but for white fabrics that is less of a problem.
If you use bleach regularly in your machine washes you may find some yellowish marks appear on white clothes., If you have a really tough to shift stain on something white, the careful application of bleach can help. After a quick spot test, gently dab some bleach onto the reverse side of the affected area of the garment with a cotton swab.Then rest the fabric face down on some kitchen towel.Don’t push down on the fabric or rub against it.









After treating the stain with bleach, wash it as normal.
Wear rubber gloves if you are using bleach like this.

, Always be sure to read the label to see how much it is recommended for you to add to a washing load. As well as checking the label of the bleach, check the label of any garments you are washing to see if it acceptable to use bleach to clean them, for example you mustn’t use bleach with silk or wool."

Add ammonia to your wash. Ammonia is an alkaline solution that can be very good at tackling grease and dirt stains.,
Use an ammonia turpentine solution.,
Sponge tricky spots with ammonia.",How to Get Stains out of White Clothes5," You can use it in a similar way to bleach, by adding a small amount to your normal wash. It is also a strong chemical that is often found as an ingredient in cleaning products, but can be bought on its own.You should NEVER mix bleach with ammonia as the reaction causes highly toxic and potentially deadly fumes.Work in a well-ventilated room and wear rubber gloves if you use ammonia.

, If you want to apply the ammonia directly to the stain, you can mix it in equal measures with turpentine to create a good cleaning solution. Once you have mixed up a small amount pour it onto the stain and let it sink in. You can leave it for up to eight hours, before washing it.








The first time you wash it after this treatment, be sure to keep the garment separate from other clothes.
Concentrated ammonia can damage and stain your clothes., Difficult stains can be treated with ammonia at source by dabbing them with a sponge, which has been dipped in ammonia. This is particularly recommended for stains from bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat and urine.After sponging the stained area wash it as normal.

Spray spiders with an aerosol pesticide.,
Squash it.,
Hunt Them.",How to Kill Black Widow Spiders2," If you see a black widow on the loose, try to spray it with a pesticide first. This is better than trying to smash or stomp on it because the spiders are aggressive and will run at you, if threatened.

, If you don't have a pesticide handy, grab a shoe or other flat object and kill the spider the old-fashioned way. Keep in mind that black widows are quick, and they might run toward you instead of away from you (like most other spiders do).

, A bit after sunset, say 9 or 10 pm in the summer time, search for widows in the places you know they are making a home. This is evident by the tough webs they make. Arm yourself with a flashlight, spray glue or hairspray (some sticky aerosol), long pants, shoes,etc. look for them about a foot off of the ground. When you see one, spray it. This alone will kill the widows, reduce the numbers, and keep you from needing long term pesticides.

Powder the web.,
Apply residual insecticide to dark corners.",How to Kill Black Widow Spiders3," Black widows spend a lot of time on their webs, whether it's to guard an egg sac or wait for prey. Sprinkle a non-repellant insecticidal dust over the web when you find it — the dust will eventually kill the spider. Return to the web to make sure the spider is dead, and dispose of both in a sealed plastic bag.

, A wettable powder applied to corners and nooks will prevent the formation of new webs, making it harder for the black widows to catch prey and thrive.
