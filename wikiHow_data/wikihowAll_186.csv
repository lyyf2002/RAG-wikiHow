Look for a union jack impression on a Wolf spider’s back.,
Identify Black House spiders by their velvet-like texture.,
Spot Hobo spiders by their chevron pattern.",How to Kill a Venomous Spider1," If you see a black spider in or near your home that has a bright red hourglass marking on its abdomen, you’ve spotted a Black Widow spider. These are extremely dangerous and are potentially fatally venomous. Be extra careful around the outside of your home if you live in a temperate climate and have woodpiles; Black Widows are most frequently found there., If you see a long-legged brown spider that has a violin shape on its head, then you’ve most likely come across a Brown Recluse spider. These are very dangerous spiders who have an extremely venomous bite. Brown Recluses like to lurk in dimly lit areas such as clothing, so be wary when you’re putting on old socks or shoes., Mouse spiders can get up to 1-1 ½ inches in length. You might be dealing with a female if you notice big fangs and a big, stocky build and you might be dealing with a male if you notice a slimmer version with a bright red head. They are venomous and have an especially painful bite., Wolf spiders have what looks similar to a map of the United Kingdom on their back, except brown or grey in color. Although they aren’t as aggressive as other dangerous spiders, their bites are still venomous. Don’t squish this type of spider because the females carry their young on their backs. Keep an eye out for Wolf spiders in your garden., Black House spiders are usually either a dark brown or black color, appear velvety, and like dry, secluded areas. Be cautious around windowsills and in sheds, because they’re often found there. Their venomous bites can make you nauseous and give you a headache., If you see a chevron-patterned spider in your basement, it might be a Hobo spider. The females are a little rounder and the males have two palpi that look like boxing gloves. These spiders have initially painless bites, but make sure to take action quickly if you think you’ve been bitten by one. A day after the bite, your skin may blister and you may get a bad headache."

Learn the identity of the species of fly that lays eggs in the trash can that produce maggots.",How to Prevent Maggots from Getting in the Trash1," All species of fly produce maggots which are also called fly larvae but not all flies lay their eggs in trash or rotting meat. Fruit flies are the ones that lay eggs in fruit such as apples. Bee fly larvae are parasitic and eat the larvae of other insects. The ones that lay eggs in trash are called filth flies.


Blow fly, family Calliphoridae are commonly referred to bottle flies. This nickname comes from their coloring, which can be iridescent blue, green or copper. They can be rather pretty but their maggots can reach full size within 3 days after being laid as eggs by the female. They reproduce rapidly during the warm weather. Some species also have an adaptable appetite for sweets as well, which is why they are found feeding on flower nectar and leftover sugars on food containers.



 



House fly, Musca domestica is very easily recognizable by it's dull gray to brown body. Females live for about 3 to 4 weeks before laying 60 to 100 eggs. They reproduce less abundantly than blow flies but also will cause maggots in manure and rotting vegetation.







Little house fly, Fannia Canicularis is similar to the house fly but smaller. Their life cycle is 3 to 4 weeks. They also rest with wings held to together.

Stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans and False stable fly, Muscina Stabulans look similar to house flies but have checkerboard markings and are smaller. Stable fly has a painful bite as well as sucks blood from mammals and False Stable Fly does not. These species can live for 17 to 50 days and lay eggs in soiled pet bedding and food dishes. The False Stable fly also lays eggs in dead insects and bird nests to feed it's parasitic larvae. Both can lay eggs in tainted meat products as well.;

Spray the spider or dust the area with an insecticide.,
Vacuum the spider up.,
Squish the spider with a heavy object.,
Dispose of the spider immediately.",How to Kill a Venomous Spider2," Buy an insecticide dust or spray that’s specifically for killing spiders. You can spray an aerosol insecticide directly on a spider to successfully kill it. If the spider you’re trying to kill is especially agile, you may want to apply an insecticide dust to the entire room., Get out your vacuum cleaner and suck the spider up with it. This is a better method to go with if your vacuum has a bag that you can easily remove and throw away. Don’t reach your hand in the debris if you use a bagless vacuum in case the spider is still alive., Use your shoe or a rolled-up magazine or newspaper to squish the spider.To ensure that the impact kills the spider, have confidence and use force.

, Once you’ve killed the spider, double check to make sure that it’s dead, and then use a paper towel to carefully pick it up and throw it in your trash can or drop it into your toilet and flush it.


Pets and young children often attempt to eat anything and everything. Even if the venomous spider is dead, it still may have poisonous venom that could be extremely harmful if ingested.

Keep your outdoor lights off.",How to Kill a Venomous Spider3," Vacuum on a regular basis to suck up and kill any spiders or egg sacs in your home. Pay special attention to the cracks and corners in your home and remove any spiderwebs that you notice. Make sure to keep your storage in the basement, garage or attic well organized and clutter-free., Regularly wipe down your shutters, caulk all cracks, and put weather strips on your doors. Make sure to de-clutter piles of rocks, wood, or compost around your home so that your yard is a less appealing environment to spiders., Dissolve regular table salt in warm water, put the solution in a spray bottle, and spray the plants surrounding the outside of your home to keep spiders away. You can also mix water with lavender, cinnamon, citrus, tea tree, or peppermint oil and spray it in problem areas to repel and even kill spiders., Bugs will be less drawn to your home if you keep the exterior lights off. Because of this, you can cut spiders’ food supply with just the flick of a switch. Replace your lights with sodium vapor lights or yellow lights as an alternative. These types of lights are much less attractive to bugs."

Choose trash containers that don't strongly hold odors which attract flies.,
Choose better quality garbage bags.",How to Prevent Maggots from Getting in the Trash2," Opt to upgrade old trash containers to newer versions that don't hold odor if you can. Some communities provide the designated container to residents already. But others the resident of the home has to provide the container on their own. When choosing plastic ones look for ones with smoother interiors and number 5 plastic which lets odor causing juices slide off in case your bags bust inside the can. Metal cans should be made of polished stainless steel or high quality aluminium., If you can't upgrade the can at least consider a better bag. Low quality bags also can mean doubling you bags which is a waste of extra bags. Bad quality bags that break, bust and lose handles are open invitation to flies and other pest. Shop around different brands to find a quality bag.

There are bags with fragrances which can be irritating to some people and don't smell like the real source of the original fragrances. You can always find natural alternatives and make your own.

Learn which time of the year is maggot season.",How to Prevent Maggots from Getting in the Trash3," This gas is produced as organic aka living things rot. The female fly has a sense of smell for this gas and are attracted to it. This gas also gives off the stinky, musty smell we associate with rotten food or a rotten houseplant that has been over watered. To eliminate the risk of maggots you must eliminate the sources of methane gas/rot., Female flies smell the rotting meat scraps in the garbage can and will flock to it.  Make note of your community garbage truck day of the week. Try to dump your meat scraps the night or day before to limit the time the flies will smell it. If you can't use this timing, place all your meat scraps into a zip lock bag and freeze them until that day.

, The bones and fat can be placed in a pot of water and boiled overnight and seasoned. This is also less expensive and more flavorful than prepared box broth in the store. The boiled bones and meat will have less meat smell thus attracting fewer flies.


Give your leftover meat bones to your dog for crunching. Dogs like to chew on things and meat bones are their favorites. Just make sure the bones however are not too sharp to cut the animals throat. You can also give dogs the gristle and boiled and cooked meat scraps as a treat. Although you should talk to a vet before doing this.

, Maggots don't need much meat or meat juice food to develop into more flies so cleaning up all meat juice and meat smells will starve them and prevent them for turning your trash can into a buffet. Use the same techniques when discarding tools and equipment used to cut meat.


Also clean the rags used in cleaning up the meat juice and newspaper clippings used in preparation (keeping the fish scales neater instead of all over the place) with scalding hot water or in a tightly sealed bag or container before tossing out.

, Not only is a smelly trash can a maggot magnet but a disgusting thing to smell for you and those who live in or visit your house. Rinse your trash can even if it's every 2 or 3 months with plain water during the warm seasons to keep the maggots away and the trash can smelling decent.

, Place such trash in sealed containers. Kitty litter, feminine products, leftover pet food,dirty diapers need to have their bags tightly closed so the stable fly can't smell the methane gas and want to lay eggs in the trash can. Same goes for manure and animal bedding including hay and straw. Don't put dead animals in the household trash either.

Don't put rotting plant matter in the same can as the household trash. If you do you'll have triple trouble with stable flies, blow flies and houseflies. Put it in a separate landscape bag or in a sealed container before tossing it out into the trash can.

, Cold weather doesn't bring maggots but hot weather does. Don't worry about maggots if it's freezing outside because there aren't any flies to lie the eggs that hatch into maggots. If you live in warmer climates you'll have to be extra vigilant in controlling maggots.

Slap the fly with one hand.,
Propel one finger to hit the fly.,
Clap the fly between two hands.",How to Swat a Fly Without a Fly Swatter1," Swat a fly by trapping it between one hand and a hard, flat surface that you have gotten it to land on. Move slowly toward the fly, then slap it quickly and firmly with your hand.


Approach the fly very slowly until you are within an arm’s length of it. Keep your arm still until you are in position, then move it as quickly as possible in one motion toward the fly to hit it.
If you are approaching the fly from behind it, anticipate its quick forward motion by aiming your hand slightly (a few inches) in front of it for the slap. If you are coming at the fly from the front, arc your hand over and slightly behind the fly in case it flies backwards.;
, Lift up one finger on your swatting hand using your other hand (the pointer or middle finger works best). Then position that hand flat on the surface that your fly is on, then release your finger to snap it down and hit the fly at a quick rate.Move your hand very, very slowly until it is in position on the flat surface that the fly has already landed on. Make sure the finger you have pulled back is in perfect position over the fly before you release it.
Because this method requires you to place your hand so close, it may not work with quickly-moving flies. Try it on flies that have slowed down due to age, colder weather, or time of day.

, Approach a fly slowly with two hands on either side of it, palms facing toward the fly. Then bring your palms quickly together as if you were clapping to trap the fly between them.


Aim a few inches above the fly when you bring your hands together to anticipate it escaping upward.Use a variation of this method if you want to humanely capture a fly and release it outside without killing it. Instead of bringing your two palms together, make one of both of your hands into a cupped position before bringing them together to catch the fly in the space made between your hands.

Maintain a dry trash can as much as possible.",How to Kill Maggots," Permethrin is a synthetic chemical that is used as an insecticide, insect repellent or an acaricide. Usually used to kill scabies and lice, it comes in liquid (shampoo) and cream form.For the simplest solution, boil some water, add a dog shampoo with Permethrin in it, and dump over any maggots.


While permethrin is safe for use in human hair and scalp, take care not to get it in eyes, ears, nose, or mouth. If you do happen to accidentally get it in your eyes, flush them with water right away.
If you don't have dog shampoo with permethrin, use lice shampoo or lice bedding spray. These products often employ permethrin as the active ingredient.
Permethrin and synthetic pyrethroids can be fatal to cats and fish. Products suitable for dogs may be dangerous to cats and fish.
;
, Household bleach is a great maggot murderer. Dilute one part bleach with one part water and pour it over the unfortunate maggots like you're king or queen of the world. If dumping bleach into a trash can, close the lid and let the fumes of the bleach suffocate the maggots. Now, your trash can is effectively prepped for a cleaning with the bleach. A definite plus!

, Although not quite as effective as permethrin, Raid will eventually kill maggots, although it may take some time (30+ minutes) for it to start taking effect. Bug sprays that act as fumigators, wasp and hornet killers, as well as ant and roach killers.

, On the hierarchy of effectiveness, these work a bit less effective that either permethrin or Raid, but if you have no other option, they're worth trying out. (Usually, you'll have plenty of options — see section below.) The following household items may be useful in killing maggots:


Hairspray such as AquaNet
Pledge multi-surface cleaner
All-purpose cleaners like Fantastic  or Formula 409.


, This is especially useful if you have a lot of maggots in, say, a garbage can. Mix a cup of carburetor cleaner with a couple gallons of hot water. Dump the ad hoc chemical cleaner into your trash can (after having disposed of the trash, of course), close the lid to the trash can, and allow the toxic fumes and hot water to work its magic on the maggots for an hour or so. Dispose of the dead maggots.


Note that carburetor cleaner is extremely toxic. Take pains to not get it on your skin or inhale its fumes. Always wear proper clothing and gloves. Request for your carburetor cleaner solution to be picked up after use.
Do not mix carburetor cleaner with any other solvents. Chlorinated carburetor cleaner can interact with other solvents to form a toxic mix of gases that can be harmful if inhaled or come in contact with. Use at your deepest discretion.

, This method is especially useful if you have your maggots quarantined somewhere like your garbage bin. Set a large pot of water to boil. Remove the garbage the maggots were feeding on in the meantime. When the water reaches a boil, carefully pour it into your garbage bin or otherwise over the maggots. If you can, close the garbage bin to keep in the heat.

, Diatomaceous earth is a sedimentary rock with a wide range of cleaning and insecticide applications. (It's especially good for treating fleas!) Sprinkle some diatomaceous earth over the maggots and wait for them to meet their end. Diatomaceous earth sticks to the maggots exoskeleton and slowly dehydrates them. The maggots then ultimately die of water pressure deficiency. Problem solved and style points awarded!

, Working much in the same way that diatomaceous earth kills maggots, lime or salt literally dries out the maggots and causes them to die of water pressure deficiency.


Of course, the ""lime"" we're talking about is a bit different from the fruit, lime. The lime you should be using in this instance is the calcium-rich lime (calcium-oxide or calcium-hydroxide).


, Maggots find a water-vinegar mixture uninhabitable, which means that cleaning with water and vinegar will also help prevent a re-infestation in the future.

, Put a bit of beer in an open container, and set it close to the maggots. Supposedly, the maggots are attracted to it. They crawl inside and drown in the beer. This is an option you may use for a few stray maggots, probably not a long-term solution for large-scale problems.

, Again, not a solution for a horde of maggots, but workable for a few stray grubs. Place them in a resealable bag, and freeze them until they die. This and the boiling may sound gross, but if you are going to reintroduce them to your trashcan, you want them dead this time and not re-infest it.

, Flies breed and ultimately lay their eggs, which become maggots. Flies breed mainly in decaying meat and fish. This means that if you want to prevent maggots from being able to hatch, you'll need to stop allowing excess meat and fish into your trash. Here are a couple solutions for attacking the source of the problem.


Wrap excess meat and fish before you toss it. Wrap bones, scales, fat, and even meat tightly with paper towels before introducing it into the trash. If flies can't get at it, they'll have a difficult time laying eggs.
Upcycle your meat and bones. Have you ever tried to make fish or meat stock out of a few bones? It's surprisingly easy and fun. All you do is dump the leftover bones into a pot of boiling water, add a few bay leaves and spices, and set to simmer for at least an hour.
Save some of the meat/bones in a separate refrigerator (or freezer) until garbage day, and then dump it en masse. Your meat won't spoil as easily if it's refrigerated or frozen.

, Mothballs are chemically treated orbs that are filled with insecticides. If you place one or two mothballs at the bottom of your trash can and regularly close the lid to the trashcan, they can be effective at repelling intruders.

, Peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, and bay leaves are all reputedly excellent at repelling flies and maggots.Here's how you can use essential oils to keep flies and maggots away:


Coat your trash can with a bit of essential oil. Dilute a bit of essential oil in a spray bottle filled with water. Lightly spray the inside of your trash can with the diluted mix. Your trash is now coated with a fly repellent and smells good to boot!
Clean with essential oils. Add a couple drops of your favorite essential oil to your detergent when you choose to clean the trash.

, If your trash can isn't well insulated and regularly has bits and scraps of food lodged in it for long periods of time, there's a good chance it's becoming a breeding ground for maggots. Out of sight, out of mind, right? Until the maggots attack and you're left wondering what went wrong. Clean your trashcan regularly or keep it better insulated with trash bags.

, Maggots really like moisture, so take it away from them. Make sure your trash bags aren't leaky, you don't miss the trash bag, and any moisture that does make it to the bottom of the bin gets wicked away as soon as possible.


Here's one hack that you can use to help keep the bottom of your trash can dry. You know that silica packets that you find at the bottom of new shoes or in other packaging? Keep a few of those in the bottom of your trash. Silica is a natural absorbent, so it wicks away moisture effectively. In fact, it's one of the primary ingredients in diatomaceous earth.

Wash your hands.",How to Kill a Fly Quickly1," Get a bottle of Formula 409®, Febreze®, Windex®, or any noxious spray that will not damage the items in your house.


Note: Febreze® might provide the added benefit of acting as a fly deterrent.—No self-respecting fly will inhabit an area that smells fresh and clean, so it will vamoose out of there as quick as can be.;
, You may need five or six on-target squirts to accomplish the job, maybe even as many as twenty if you are a gung-ho, Rambo-style fly killer.


Make sure the bottle has enough spray to completely asphyxiate the fly or, failing that, drown the unfortunate victim.

, Don't approach it from the front or from the side. Instead, creep up from behind. (Make sure to wear your ""sneakers."" - They are quietly stealthy and will zip you out of there should your victim turn on you.)

, Keep spraying until you're sure the fly is completely dead.

, Remember: the deathly chemicals will need to be cleaned up as well.

, You can give it a proper burial, but it would be inappropriate to ""fly"" a flag at half mast (unless you were creating a YouTube video and were really into hyperbole).

, Washing your hands is important after killing a fly because flies carry disease and germs. (That is about all they can carry.)


You did know that flies are aerodynamically amazing, right? But, you have never heard tale of a fly being able to carry fifteen or twenty times its weight, have you? Nope, but they do carry germs.

Drop a sprig of any sweet basil to the trash bag.,
Throw in some evergreen clippings.,
Drench the trash can, meat containers, and bags with wintergreen alcohol.,
Sprinkle Diatomaceous Earth on the meat and in the trash can.",How to Prevent Maggots from Getting in the Trash4," Basil has a nice licorice like smell that flies hate. Just a sniff of basil will cause many species of flies too get confused and act crazy. It also makes the trash smell nicer and doesn't have allergens like many perfumed bags or bag scents. Oregano and Lavender can have similar effects. You can use dried, fresh basil or the basil oil.

, Not enough to get noticed by the garbage man but a thin layer or grass, leaves, or conifer needles will reduce the smell of the meat in the trash can enough to keep the fly and maggot  population inside that container in check. However do not place clippings in the trash can abundantly unless the garbage pick up is the next day or rotting vegetation will attract stable flies.

, Wintergreen alcohol burns the maggots and has a very strong pleasant minty fragrance that many pests including flies don't like. You can also regularly rinse and clean the trash can with this substance to keep maggots and other pests out.

Swat with a spatula.,
Hit with a solid, heavy object.,
Try a dish cloth or towel.",How to Swat a Fly Without a Fly Swatter2," Use a spatula just like you would a regular fly swatter to catch a fly between it and a flat surface. Move close to the fly slowly, then move the spatula quickly so the flat part of it hits the stationary fly.


Choose a slotted spatula or one with small holes if possible. This will cause less air resistance and make the change in air pressure less easy to detect by the fly.Remember to wash the spatula with dish soap and water after you’ve used it to swat flies and before you use it for food.

, Swing at the fly with a heavy object, which will help propel the swatting motion with its weight. Try a shoe, a book, or a similarly solid object.


Choose something that is small enough and easy enough for you to swing with one or two hands. As always, you want to move slowly to position yourself close to the fly, then move in one very fast motion to swat with your object.
Many people like to use a rolled-up newspaper or magazine to swat flies with, as the paper becomes sturdier when rolled but remains light enough to swing quickly and easily. Just make sure it doesn’t come unrolled and that you aim carefully when using this method.

, Pull at opposite corners of a dish cloth, rag, or small towel with two hands. Then release one hand as you bring the towel down in a swinging motion to hit the fly with it.Dampen the towel with water to make it heavier and more likely to hit the fly with force.
Make sure to use a small hand towel size of fabric that you can easily swing at the fly. A larger towel will be too unwieldy and not reach the fly with as much force.

"

”Shoo” the fly into the desired direction.,
Locate a good flat surface.,
Wait until the fly lands in a good spot.",How to Swat a Fly Without a Fly Swatter3," Get the fly to an area you can more easily swat at it, like a small, clean room with lots of flat open surfaces. Wave your hand near it to disrupt its current resting place and move it in the direction you want.


Close off interior doors in your house to contain the fly to one room. This will give it fewer objects to land on, and help you see it and keep track of its movements in a smaller space.
You may also use an object like a newspaper or magazine to help shoo the fly by “fanning” or moving the air around the fly with it to help guide it in the right direction.

, Find a suitable surface for swatting at a fly effectively with your hands or another object. Look for hard, flat, and even surfaces that will make it easier to hit the fly.


While a vertical surface like a wall may work sufficiently, a horizontal surface like an empty tabletop typically works best, as you have the additional help of gravity when swatting downward.
It helps to pick out several possible surfaces in the fly’s area that it might land on and that you can be ready to approach slowly.
Be sure that any surface you have in mind is clear of items that might get disrupted or broken by a heavy swatting motion. For instance, avoid a wall with hanging pictures or a glass-topped coffee table.

, Once you’ve ushered a fly into the room you want, wait until it lands on one of the surfaces you’ve picked out as good for swatting. Be patient in waiting for this to happen.


Try waiting earlier or later in the day to catch a fly if you can. Houseflies are more active in the hottest part of the day, when their food sources are decomposing quickest, so they will be harder to catch resting in any one spot.You can also try to tempt a fly to one of your ideal surfaces by placing a small amount of moist food containing proteins or sugars on it. Try a small dab of fruit jam, for example, or even a little piece of raw meat.

You'll want to make a fist out of your forward hand with your thumb on top, flat and pointing forwards. Then place the rubber band on the tip of your thumb, so it's hooked in place, and pull the opposite side of the band back, with your other hand - a finger or a pinched finger and thumb.Ideally, everything is parallel and flat, so there's little chance for the band to hit your thumb or hand upon release.
When you're ready, sight along the rubber band, at the target, and release the band cleanly from the back hand, allowing it to shoot over your thumb towards the target.
Once you have your aim right, you can work on increasing your power. Though you don't need fly-smashing contact, the rubber band cannot just barely get there. The speed and power need to be moderate, at least.

, Ninja style is great, if you are so inclined. Mimic a cat, try a nonchalant saunter, or just sidle up rustler-style.

, There should not be any delicate knick-knacks near the fly because these might get damaged by an errant shot.

,, Make sure you achieve sufficient tension to shoot well past your target, but not so much as to risk breaking the rubber band (especially if you don't have a back-up weapon at hand).

Use flypaper.,
Use fly traps.,
Hang clear plastic bags half-filled with water near your doors and windows.,
Take advantage of your spiders.,
Use a fly swatter.",How to Keep Flies Away From You and Your Room1," If you really have a fly problem, put flypaper in your room to keep the flies away. Though it won't look pretty, it will definitely get the job done. Hang it in the sunshine and away from any wind for it to be most effective., Place fly traps outside your window or out in your yard to catch the pesky creatures. Don't install them in your room, though -- they can be quite smelly and the odor will quickly overwhelm your abode., The water in the bags will reflect light and will make the flies become disoriented and unable to enter your home., If you've noticed a spider or two in the corner of your room or hanging from the ceiling near your window, live and let live. As long as the spiders aren't dangerous, they will help kill flies and keep you and your room safe from these pesky creatures. The next time you see a spider in your room, ask yourself if you really need to kill it.

, If you see fly, you can use the swatter to put it out of its misery. Just position the head of the swatter over the fly and use your wrist to flick the swatter over the insect. Though it's not a good long-term solution, it'll work great if a fly approaches you, or if you see a fly coming into your room without being invited.

Wait until the fly is stationary.,
Sneak up behind the fly.,
Swing at the fly.,
Clean up the mess.",How to Kill a Fly1," It is much easier to hit a fly that is not moving. Be stealthy! The fly is probably scoping you out as much as you're scoping it out.


If it's in a position you don't like, wreak havoc around it. It'll be forced to go into a different, hopefully, more open area. If you know it's somewhere but don't know where, turn off the TV and anything else that's making noise. This will enable you to hear the fly and track it more easily once it takes to the air.;
, Get close enough to be able to swing and hit the fly, but not so close that it startles the fly into flying around again.


This takes some skill. You are up against an evasion artist. Before the fly takes off, it is executing a complex pre-flight routine: precise leg-to-eye positioning is taking place moment-by-moment. The extraordinary eyes (viewing field nearly 360°) pinpoint your location and the fly's nervous system translates this perception into precise leg positioning. These optimize instant take-off in the most likely evasive direction.And this is why it often seems that the fly is blessed with precognitive powers.

, You'll need to be able to swing fast and accurately. If flies are a constant problem, start practicing your aim and stealth (and clean up and shut your windows and doors).


The fly is planning to fly away at the last second. What you have to do is to predict where it is going to fly and aim there. You're going to beat him at his own game. Try to get him into a corner to limit his possibly flyaway zone.

, Be sure to clean up the remains of the fly after swatting it. Or you could leave it, completely creep out your family, and leave a stain on the wall.


You may want to use Windex, Pledge, or some sort of cleaner. This goes double if your victim was one of those huge, bulbous, super-buzzy flies.

Tighten your trash cans.,
Drain any extra water from your room.",How to Keep Flies Away From You and Your Room2," If you want to keep flies away from you and your room, then you should close your windows and doors, which can let in the flies. If you have a screen over your window or door, then you can leave that open, as long as it doesn't have any cracks or holes in it.


If a fly has buzzed into your room, then open your door or window until it flies out, and then shut it again.

, If you keep food in your room or in the kitchen, you should keep it covered to protect it from the flies -- flies love the smell or a sweet or hearty meal and will try to get close to your food as much as they can. Here are some ways to cover your food:Once you've cooked a meal, put away any extra cooking ingredients or extra servings before you start eating, or they will attract flies.
When you're done eating, wash your dishes right away to keep any food particles from attracting the flies.
If you're putting food away, make sure all of the containers are tightly sealed.
Obviously, fruit flies love fruit. Don't leave your fruit out in the open -- cover it with a muslin cloth bag.

, Flies especially love the smell of cooked meat. If you're cooking meat, make sure to put away any leftovers and to wash your dishes when you're done.If you need to leave the door open while you cook the meat, have a fan blowing at the open door -- this will scare the flies away.
If you're having an outdoor barbecue, make sure to keep your doors and windows closed.

, If you have a cat and the litter box is in your room or home, make sure to scoop it at least once a day and to throw out the remains in a dumpster or outdoor trash can to keep the flies from your home. If you have a dog, make sure to throw his poop out in a closed container, which is also preferably outside your home. If you have a yard, try to keep your dog from pooping in the yard, or that will attract more flies.

, Make sure the lids are firmly placed on the trash cans in your room, and that they have an outer bag to keep food or other particles from sticking to the inside of the trash can. This can help keep flies away from your environment.

, Flies love moisture, so make sure not to leave a puddle of water in your room after you take a shower, or to leave wet gym clothes lying in a heap on your floor. Don't leave open containers or water out and try to keep water from collecting in your room, or you and your room will attract more flies.

Check for leaks in any pipe entryways, like in your air conditioning unit. Fill any gaps you find with a can of expandable foam., Check your screens for holes or tears -- even if they're tiny, they may still be big enough to let in flies. Replace them, or cover them with tape for a temporary solution, and see what a difference it makes. Make sure that the edges of the screens fit snugly and that there's no space for the flies to pass through.

, There are many herbs and plants that repel flies, so consider setting up a mini garden in your room and see how much it scares off the pesky flies. Here are some plants and herbs that will help you keep flies away:Basil. Grow a basil plant outside, near your room, and watch it keep out the flies. It will not only deter flies, but it will deter mosquitoes as well, and it can make a great addition to any meal.
Bay leaf. You can grow it outside during the summer, but you should bring the plant indoors during the winter to scare off the flies. You can also just put a bowl of dried bay leaves in your room to keep the flies out.
Lavender. Not only does lavender smell delicious, but it will scare off the flies. You can grind it into a powder and sprinkle it over your furniture, grow it in a container, or grow it in your kitchen garden.
Mint. Place a mint plant in your room and scare away fleas, ants, and flies.
Tansy. Tansy is another herb that is known from repelling flies, ants, fleas, and moths.

, Dogs are not only cute and lovable, but they love eating flies. Consider getting a dog to not only add some fun to your life, but to get rid of those pesky flies.

, Cats are cuddly, cute, and they love batting and fighting off flies. A bonus: it's absolutely adorable when cats try to fight flies.

Windex is a pretty safe bet. As is Lysol, Formula 409, and Fantastik. Hairspray will work eventually, but you'll need to douse it thoroughly.

, Get as close as you can to it without scaring it away. Then bam! Grab that bottle and drown him in that toxic fluid! He never stood a chance.


Make sure he's dead and not just stunned. If you don't, he might end up reviving and taking off in flight. If you're using hairspray, this goes double. Make his pain as short as possible by doing a thorough job.

, You don't want a sticky mess on your wall from whatever you sprayed it with -- especially if it's a window (double the reason to use Windex -- no streaks!).


Of course, if you used Febreeze, good thinking! Now your house smells great, too.

Be careful setting these up. Light traps could never seriously injure anyone, but it's still quite painful to be zapped by them.

, Flies avoid the smell of vodka. So, try hanging bags of vodka around your porch or any other recreational outdoor area.Quarter gallon freezer bags, tied with string to a gutter, work well.
Any cheap vodka will work.
You can also try putting small amounts of vodka on your skin, although beware of the pungent smell and your skin drying.

, While some plants simply repel flies, others actually eat flies: Venus Fly Trap, Pitcher Plant, etc.

, Flies are deterred by the scents of some plants, so keep potted plants on your patio or near your doors that repel flies: Basil, Elderberry, Lavender, Mint, and False Indigo.

, Spiders eat flies, but if you destroy their webs, the flies lose a natural predator.

, The smell of cloves repels flies. Decoratively placing cloves on an outdoor dinning table can deter flies from landing on food., Flies are strongly attracted to the smell of meat and will swarm your barbecue grill the minute you bring meat outside to cook it.


Keep all meat covered tightly when it is not on the grill.
Keep the barbecue grill lid closed while the meat is cooking.
Protect your grilling tongs and utensils—flies will smell the meat and land on them. (If you see flies have landed on your grilling utensils, take them inside and wash them before you pierce or turn the meat with them.)

The quicker you can start trapping rats, the less time the population of rats will have a chance to expand. Start by heading to your local hardware store and buying plenty of rat traps — the more you're able to set, the better chance you stand of trapping rats. Most disposable rat traps are available for quite cheap, so it's not a bad idea to buy one or two more than you think you'll need. If the extra money prevents major rat problems in the future, it will have been a wise investment. See the steps below for information on the different types of rat traps available.


The sole exception here is when dealing with live traps. Since live traps are almost always significantly more expensive than ordinary disposable rat traps, it can be impractical to buy more than one. Thus, live traps are best-suited for small rat problems — instances when there's only about one or two rats loose in your house. Any larger, and you run the risk of being unable to catch all of the rats before they breed. See below for more information on live traps.;
, The ""classic"" spring-loaded wooden snap trap is a proven, effective way to start trapping rats. These traps work by snapping a metal wire over the rat's neck when it tries to grab the bait. Snap traps usually come in several sizes, so be sure to pick one that's big enough to kill to the rats at your residence — using traps that are too small may maim the rat without killing it or lead to a protracted death from strangulation.



Pros: When used correctly, kills rats quickly and effectively. Traps are reusable and are basically effective forever until they're sprung, so they can be left in ""problem areas"" semi-permanently.Cons: Can occasionally cause bleeding, gore, etc. Possible to hurt yourself if the trap is sprung accidentally.

, Glue traps are pads or sheets covered in a very sticky adhesive with a spot for bait in the middle. When the rat tries to get the bait, its legs are caught in the glue. As it struggles to free itself, its mouth gets caught in the glue and it suffocates. While glue traps are considered fairly effective for killing mice, since rats are bigger and stronger, there is some doubt as to their effectiveness at controlling rat populations. Even large, rat-sized glue traps may not always kill a rat, requiring you to euthanize it yourself.Pros: Cheap, disposable. Can also catch bugs, spiders, etc. inadvertently.

Cons: Won't always kill rats quickly. Occasionally won't kill rats at all, requiring you to put the rat out of its misery. Considered inhumane by many animal rights groups, including PETA.Aren't effective forever — glue will eventually start to dry.

, Poison-based rat traps usually come in the form of a pre-packaged poison ""station."" The station is placed in a spot where the rat is likely to come across it, the rat eats it, wanders away, and eventually dies. While poison can be an effective way to kill rats, out of all the trapping methods, poison usually poses the most serious danger to small children, pets, and so on, so it's crucially important to use these sorts of traps responsibly.



Pros: Low maintenance — not necessary to check for dead rats, as the rats will leave the trap and die elsewhere. Can be left out semi-permanently if poison is consistently refilled. These traits make poison traps good choices for outdoor rat control.

Cons: Death can often take hours or days. Not guaranteed that rats will eat the correct dosage. Possible to accidentally poison pets, small children, or non-pest animals if used improperly. In indoor rat infestations, rats may die in inaccessible parts of the residence and begin to rot.

, It definitely bares mentioning that you don't necessarily need to kill a rat to trap it. Live traps, which usually come in the form of small steel cages, can catch rats without harming them in any way. These sorts of traps usually work by enticing a rat to grasp a piece of bait positioned over a pressure-sensitive pad. When the rat steps on the pad, a trap door swings shut, trapping the rat in the cage. If you're using a live trap, be sure to use one small enough to prevent a rat from escaping. As a general rule, if a rat can fit its head between a set of bars, it can easily squeeze through. Some rats can even fit through spaces as narrow as 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters) wide.



Pros: Does not hurt the rat. Considered humane by most animal rights groups, including PETA.Cons: Relatively expensive. Labor intensive — trap must be checked frequently and emptied with each rat caught. Does not by itself guarantee that the same rat will not be a problem in the future.

, When choosing your traps, it's important to consider any people or animals at your residence that could conceivably fall victim to your trap by accident — namely, pets and small children. If you do have pets or small children, you may not necessarily need to avoid lethal traps all together, but you should be ready to take all necessary precautions to ensure that your children and pets won't have access to the traps. This can include keeping a close eye on your child or pet when it is around the traps and, if necessary, creating physical barriers for its own safety with playpen walls, etc.


For especially small pets, like miniature dogs, ferrets, hamsters, and so on, larger snap traps can potentially cause serious injury. Bigger animals and children may still be at risk for broken bones, gashes, and so on if they step on one of the traps.
Glue traps can lead to intense pain and discomfort if a pet or child accidentally steps on one. In rare cases, the glue trap can be life-threatening if it attaches to the area around the mouth and nose. To remove a glue trap, apply baby oil to the spot where it is stuck and pry it off with a spoon.Poison can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe depending on how much is ingested. If you have reason to believe your pet or child has eaten rat poison, contact your local poison control center immediately — the help you get may be life-saving.

, While it's possible to get rid of lots of rats with your own traps, sometimes, it's best to leave the problem to professionals. If you don't feel comfortable trapping rats yourself or you believe your infestation is too large for you to control, call a pest control expert as soon as possible. Most pest control companies offer experienced exterminators trained to use a wide range of solutions, including mechanical traps, kill and seal traps, ultrasonic repellants and rodenticides. Signs of a major infestation include:Rats visible in the open — most rats like to hide as much as possible, so if you see them regularly, it's likely that there are many.
Frequent appearance of small, pellet-like droppings.
Greasy, dirty ""trails"" along walls.
Bite/nibble marks in stored food.
Small gnawed openings in corners of walls and cupboards.
Infestation signs that don't seem to improve as rats are caught.

, Once you've selected and bought your traps, you'll need to bait them (with the exception of poison traps, which use the poison itself as bait.) Apply your bait to the designated spot on the trap according to any instructions provided with it. Typically, for snap traps, the bait will need to go on the flat ""platform"" that sits opposite the swinging arm. Glue traps, on the other hand, often have a peg in the middle that bait can sit on. Live traps usually have a similar platform for the bait in the center. Your bait should be a small, thimble sized amount of a food that's appetizing to rats — don't use too much or it will be easier for the rat to take it without springing the trap. Just a few common examples of rat bait are listed below:


Peanut butter
Bacon or meat
Most fruits and vegetables
Cereals
Commercial rat baits (available at hardware stores and online pest control retailers)

, One of the biggest tell-tale signs of a rat problem is the presence of small, brown, pellet-like droppings. Anywhere you find these droppings is an acceptable place to put a trap — if a rat has been there before, there's a good chance it will be there again.


Take care when handling or cleaning rat droppings — certain illnesses, like Hantavirus, can be caused by accidentally ingesting or inhaling small particles from rat feces.Wear gloves and a face mask when disposing of rat droppings and be sure to wash your hands when you've finished.

, For indoor rat problems, it's usually best to place traps directly next to walls and corners where rats (or rat droppings) have been spotted. Rats hate running out in the open where they can be seen easily, so putting rat traps in the middle of the floor is unlikely to warrant results unless they're in a location where you've specifically noticed rats before.


If using snap traps, place the traps perpendicular to the wall so that the baited end is touching it. This forces the animals to touch the bait platform if they want to continue along the same path as they've been using before.

, Rats can be a little harder to trap outdoors because it's harder to predict their movements. Try placing traps along narrow locations where you've observed rats before, like tree branches, the top edges of fences, gutters, and so on. You may also want to place a few traps under dense foliage, as rats love the safety and cover that thick bushes and shrubs can provide.


If you have time, try spending a few minutes looking for ""rat runs"" — small, narrow paths in grass that rats use to come and go. Placing traps along rat runs is a great way to start catching rats.

, Rats may be wary of new objects that suddenly appear in the path of their established trails, which can make them reluctant to go for traps even when bait is used. In these cases, you may want to consider leaving your traps out ""unset"" for a few days so that the rats have a chance to get to get used to them. Then, set the traps and add bait — the rats should approach them without fear, making it much more likely that you'll successfully catch one.

, Once you've set out traps, make a habit of checking them once a day for successful catches. You do not want to discover a trapped rat several days after it's died, as decaying rat corpses can be accompanied by an unpleasant smell, the presence of bugs and other scavengers, and severely unsanitary microorganisms. See the section below for more information about disposing of rats once you've trapped them.


It's just as important to check live traps as it is to check lethal traps. Leaving a rat in a live trap for a long period of time can be potentially deadly, especially in very hot or cold climates where the rat is vulnerable to exposure.

, While not all rats are carriers of dangerous diseases and parasites, some are, so it's very important to take proper precautions to protect yourself when handling rats (living or dead.) Wear sterile gloves and avoid touching the rat itself, instead grabbing hold of the trap. Remove your gloves and wash your hands when you're done disposing of the rat and never touch your face, eyes, or mouth after touching either a rat or its trap without thoroughly cleaning your hands.

, Unfortunately, lethal traps do not always work perfectly — occasionally, you may find a trapped rat that is maimed and unable to escape, but still living. In this case, the most humane thing to do is often to put the animal out of its misery by quickly and cleanly killing it. Releasing an injured rat into the wild is likely to cause it to die a relatively more painful death from starvation or being eaten.


While many animal rights groups (including PETA) recommend against the use of lethal traps in the first place, among more mainstream pest-control resources, two methods of euthanasia are usually deemed acceptable for rodents: cervical dislocation and asphyxiation. Cervical dislocation involves breaking the rat's spinal cord by pressing on the base of its neck with quick, forceful pressure, while asphyxiation involves putting the rat in a small container and flooding it with an inert gas like carbon dioxide.
See our article on humanely killing a rodent for more information on this topic.

, If you find a dead rat in your trap, disposing of it is usually fairly simple: either carefully place the rat in a plastic bag and set it in your outdoor garbage container or else dig a hole in the ground a few feet deep and bury it. If you dig a hole, make sure it's not any shallower than a foot or so or neighborhood pets may dig up the rat's carcass.


In the case of glue traps, you'll need to throw the entire trap out with the dead rat. Don't re-use glue traps — they won't work as well the second time and it can be very difficult to cleanly un-stick the rat from the trap in the first place.

, If you've caught a rat in a live trap, simply take it outdoors, set the trap on the ground, and carefully open the trap door to let it go. If you're interested in the rat's survival, try to release it within about 100 yards (91.4 m) of where you found it. Releasing rats in unfamiliar territory makes them much more vulnerable to predators and starvation.Note, however, that if you release a rat into the wild alive, there's not necessarily any reason why it won't find its way back into your house. In this case, it's important to ""rodent-proof"" your house to ensure that the root cause for the rat infestation is eliminated. This includes removing any food sources, sealing holes in the outside of your house with caulk or steel wool, tidying up any messes to remove potential nesting places, and more. See our article on rodent-proofing your home for more information.

, When you've disposed of your rat, remove your gloves and give your hands a thorough washing to remove any bacteria particulate matter that may have passed from the rat to you. After this, you may carefully wash your trap to clean it for future use (except in the case of glue traps, which aren't meant to be reused.)

Fill a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol to kill common flies in the kitchen.",How to Get Rid of Flies in the Kitchen2," Heat half a cup of apple cider vinegar and pour it into a wine bottle or jar. With a sheet of paper, form a cone-shaped funnel with tape and stick it to the jar.Although fruit flies do not tend to be clever enough to leave the funnel jar once they’ve entered, adding a drop or two of dish soap can help prevent flies from being able to fly away once they’ve entered the jar.While apple cider vinegar is commonly used as bait for this DIY trap, a piece of ripe banana can also be used and be just as effective., Place several pieces of very ripe, borderline rotting fruit at the bottom of a jar. Cover the opening with plastic wrap, securing it with a rubber band.








With a toothpick, poke holes into the plastic wrap. This will be how fruit flies enter your trap.
To kill the flies that gather there, submerge the jar underneath soapy water for about 10 minutes. Rinse the jar out, refill it with produce, and repeat the trapping effort., Take two cups of water and some sugar and place it into a jar. Take a sheet of paper and fold it into a paper funnel with the wide side up at the top of the jar. Houseflies will be attracted to it and won’t know how to fly back out., After 10 minutes, place the mixture into dishes placed around the house. Add a couple of drops of dish soap to the plates if fruit flies seem to be flying away. Otherwise, landing in the mixture causes them to drown in it.







, Fruit flies will be attracted to the red wine for its fruity quality.








Dispose of the dead flies by dumping the wine out in the sink.
If you feel like the wine hasn’t done the job, fill the bottle with a dash of dish soap and water or place the bottle in the freezer to eliminate the flies and any potential eggs.

, This will kill existing flies, but because it does not remove eggs or organic slime, it is recommended that you follow up with a bacterial drain cleaner.








Pour drain gel into the drain to remove organic slime and drain fly infestations. Repeat this action five consecutive nights to get rid of everything that’s down there.After you’re confident that the infestation has been killed, follow up with a natural method of pouring vinegar or bleach down the drain.

Try adding baking soda to the bag instead of dryer sheets.,
Wash the clothes as normal (or consult the steps on washing elsewhere in this article).",How to Get Cigarette Smell out of Clothes2," Or, just use a large plastic bag that you can tie or tape shut.

,


Some dryer sheets, especially scented ones, may possibly stain clothes if left in contact for a long period. Consider using a large enough bag that you can place the sheet(s) inside without touching the clothes.

, Check for smoke odor daily, and replace the dryer sheet(s) at least every couple of days. The longer you wait, the more odor neutralization will occur.

, Or, use both in combination.Baking soda is known to absorb odors, which is why people put open boxes of it in the freezer.


Use one tablespoon per 1-2 clothing items.
Add it to the clothes inside the bag, then shake the bag to distribute evenly.
Shake the excess baking soda out of the bag (outdoors, ideally) at least every couple of days, and replace.

, Shake off excess baking soda if desired, but it won’t hurt to leave it on the clothes in the wash.

Spray the clothes down.",How to Get Cigarette Smell out of Clothes3," This may seem too simple to even mention, but sometimes the simplest method is all you need. Let fresh air and time do the work for you.


Use a clothesline if you have one, or just hang the items over a deck railing or the back of a chair.
Any dry weather will do, but a sunny, slightly breezy day is usually best.

, If the weather isn’t cooperating, find an isolated indoor space -- the basement or attic, a garage, even a covered porch -- to hang the clothes.


The longer you leave clothes to air out, outdoors or indoors, the better the results.

, Consider adding a generous spritz of an odor eliminator spray for fabrics before airing out the stinky clothes.


Test a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric first to make sure the spray doesn’t stain.
You might also wanted to try sprays marketed specifically for smoke smells. There are numerous options available in stores and online.
Some odor eliminators can do double duty, both as a spray and as a washing machine additive. Check product descriptions.

Consider bagging options.,
Look into other washing solutions.,
Try horse-blanket detergent.,
Rely on a professional cleaner.,
Think carefully about using an ozone generator.",How to Get Cigarette Smell out of Clothes4," Some people prefer using wads of newspaper, coffee grounds in a fabric baggie, activated charcoal, or cedar chips, among others, in the bag-and-seal method. Try different combinations until you find what works best for you.

, You can also try using ammonia and/or Borax in the wash cycle. Follow product instructions, and be careful, especially if you have children around. These contain dangerous chemicals.


If you’re a little more creative, there are claims that adding a capful of mouthwash or a can of your preferred cola beverage to the wash can help remove cigarette smells.

, Yes, there are laundry detergents made specifically for cleaning horse blankets and yes, they are safe for human clothes as well. If they can get out horse and stable smells, they should work for cigarette smells, right?

, If you have dry-clean only clothes and airing them out or bagging them up isn’t cutting it, you’ll have little choice.


A good professional cleaner should have several dry and wet cleaning options for smoky clothes. Shop around to find the best one in your area.

, If you have a lot of smoky clothes -- for instance, if you’ve just acquired a smoker’s wardrobe -- some people will recommend hanging them all in a room with an ozone generator machine, then closing the door for a couple days. (Always follow the instructions for the ozone generator.)


If you choose this method, please be very careful. Ozone is detrimental to your health, and there is scant scientific evidence for most of the cleaning/disinfecting claims made by ozone generator manufacturers. That said, there is some evidence that ozone generators may help eliminate secondhand smoke odors."

Choose a household product to use.,
Start a load of wash.,
Pour a cup of your chosen product into the water.,
Hang the clothes outside to dry.",How to Remove Musty Smell from Clothes1," Clothes with a mild musty smell can often be treated using a common, nontoxic household product. This method is also best for delicate fabrics that can't be bleached. If your clothes have mold spores, they won't stop smelling musty until the spores have been killed. Check around your house to see which of the following mold killing products you have on hand:


White vinegar
Borax
Baking soda;
, Put the musty clothes in your washing machine with the amount of detergent you normally use. Let the washer fill with water as the cycle begins. Allow it to completely fill before continuing.


It's best to use hot water to ensure the mold spores get killed.
If you're washing clothing that can't be washed in hot water, try using cold water instead. You may have to wash the clothes more than once to get rid of the smell.

, Once the washer has filled with water, pour in a cup of vinegar, borax or baking soda. Pour it straight into the water so it will get evenly dispersed. Finish running the wash cycle as usual.


Each of these items has properties that help to kill mold spores and remove bad smells. If the clothes are particularly musty, you can use baking soda and vinegar together.
If you aren't able to pour the product straight into the water, mix it with a cup of hot water and use the liquid detergent dispenser.

, Drying your clothes on a line in the sun will help to kill any remaining spores and freshen the smell of the clothing. Even during the winter, you can dry your clothes outside on a sunny day. Try to place them in an area that gets full sun and wind.


If it's raining outside, you'll need to use your dryer instead. This isn't ideal, since the dryer is an enclosed space that doesn't allow fresh air to flow through your clothes.
If your clothes come out of the dryer still smelling musty, wait for a sunny day to wash them and dry them outside.

Try a no-rinse cleaner.,
Use baking soda.,
Try spraying your garment with vodka.,
Get it dry cleaned.",How to Remove Musty Smell from Clothes2," If you need to get the smell out of a coat or another clothing item that's dry clean only, submerging it in water isn't an option. No rinse cleaner effectively rinses the surface of an item without completely saturating the layers of fabric, so there's less chance of warping. Look in the laundry products section for a ""no-rinse wash."" It's a concentrated solution that comes in bottles, similar to detergent.


In most cases you'll mix a capful of the no-rinse wash with several liters of water. Pour it into a spray bottle.
Spray your musty garment so that all parts of it are slightly damp.
Hang the garment to dry outside in the sun and wind. When it dries, the smell should be gone. If it still smells musty, repeat the process.
Note that this does require wetting the fabric. Don't use this method on items that shouldn't get wet, like leather or suede.

, Instead of washing your clothes with baking soda, you can use dry baking soda on your dry clean only garments. Baking soda will absorb the musty smell. You may have to repeat the process more than once for best results.


Lay the garment on a clean surface. Sprinkle it all over with a fine layer of baking soda. Turn it over and do the same. If you don't wish to put baking soda directly on the item try placing the item in a plastic bag next to an open container of baking soda.
Let the baking soda sit on the garment overnight.
Take it outside and shake it well. Use a soft brush to remove excess baking soda.
Hang it outside for the rest of the day.

, If you don't want to go to the expense of getting a special cleaner, you cause use cheap vodka. Pour some vodka into a spray bottle. Spray the musty item all over, making sure you don't miss a spot. Hang it outside in the sun to dry. This should remove or weaken the musty smell.

, If no at-home methods successfully remove the musty smell, you may need to take the item to a dry cleaner store. Dry cleaners use powerful chemicals to deodorize fabric, and in most cases they can effectively get rid of mustiness. If you're not interested in having your clothing coated with chemicals, look for a ""green"" dry cleaning store that uses liquid carbon dioxide cleaning."
"
Place the clothes in boiling water.,
Use bleach.,
Try ammonia.",How to Remove Musty Smell from Clothes3," If your items are extremely moldy and you don't want to throw them away, you can try putting them in boiling water to kill the mold spores and remove that musty smell. This method should only be used on items like towels, sheets, and other sturdy linens that can stand up to boiling water. If you place delicate fabrics in boiling water, they will probably fall apart. To boil moldy items,


Bring a large pot of water to a boil. You need enough water to thoroughly saturate the garment you're treating.
Place the garment in a separate large pot. Pour the boiling water over it, making sure it gets fully soaked.
Let it sit for five minutes.
Wring out the water. If it's still very hot, you may want to wear rubber gloves.
Wash the garment as usual in the washer. Dry it outside in the sun.

, Bleach is an effective mold killer. It will remove mold and mustiness from items that are safe to bleach, like towels, sheets and socks. Be sure to check an item's tag before bleaching it. If it says ""Do Not Bleach,"" use a different method. Whenever you use bleach, do it in a room with plenty of ventilation, and protect your skin with gloves. To bleach your clothes,


In a large bucket, mix up a solution with half a cup of bleach and a gallon of water.
Place the musty clothes in the bleach solution.
Wash the clothes in your washing machine with detergent, as normal. Dry them outside in the sun.

, Ammonia has a strong smell that is toxic to the lungs, so make sure your laundry room is well ventilated before using. Put your clothes in the washer and start a wash cycle without adding any detergent. Add a cup of ammonia to the water. Let the cycle run, then do a second cycle with detergent only. Hang your clothes in the sun to dry.Never mix bleach with ammonia. It creates a gas that can cause lung damage if breathed.
Handle ammonia with care. You may want to wear clothes to prevent it from getting on your skin. If you breathe in ammonia, leave the area to get fresh air. Call poison control if you feel light-headed."

Wash the towels.,
Soak the towels in the machine.,
Add vinegar and detergent.,
Put the towels into the dryer immediately.",How to Remove Mildew Smell from Towels1," Place your smelly towels in the washing machine and start the wash cycle using the hottest water setting available. Add in about one cup of white vinegar and one cup of baking soda.For now, leave out detergent or fabric softener.
You can also try washing your towels with just vinegar or just baking soda if you do not have one of these ingredients.;
, Stop the machine after everything is well mixed. Then, allow the towels to soak in the baking soda and vinegar solution for about one hour. After the hour is up, turn the machine back on and allow the cycle to complete.

, Next, you will need to run the wash cycle again, but this time add a cup of vinegar and your usual laundry detergent. Use the same amount that you would usually use for a load and allow the cycle to run through as usual, except with an extra spin cycle.


You can either select “extra spin cycle” if your machine has this feature or restart the spin cycle after the first one finishes.

, As soon as the second spin cycle finishes, put the towels into the dryer. Turn your dryer on the highest setting and run it until the towels are completely dry. Then, run the towels through the dryer for a second time.

Choose your add-ons.,
Wash whites separately.,
Dry in the sun.",How to Get White Clothes White Again," Soak your dingy white clothes in this solution, making sure that each garment is submerged. Let it soak for about 8 hours.


Baking soda deodorizes while it whitens, so this option has multiple benefits. Moreover, it has also been known to help soften hard water, so your clothes will not be exposed quite as much to hard water with staining mineral deposits if they soak in this solution.;
, Dissolve five 325-mg aspirin tablets in 2 gallons (8 L) of hot water. Soak the white clothing in this solution for 8 hours or so. Make sure that the material stays submerged throughout the process.


To speed the process up, you may want to crush the aspirin before you stir it into the water. Doing so can help make the aspiring dissolve faster by exposing more of its granules directly to the water.
You could also toss a couple of aspirin directly into the washing machine as you wash your clothes, but pre-soaking with aspirin is the recommended option of the two.

, Whisk well until the mixture begins to rise. Soak an old, dingy white garment in this mixture for 3 to 4 hours and rinse with cool water.


For best results, use toothpaste that comes in a paste form rather than a gel form. The toothpaste should also contain baking soda.

, Submerge your white clothes in this solution and let them soak for 2 hours.


Shampoo can be used instead of laundry detergent or dishwasher detergent, but if you use it, try to pick a clear and fragrance-free shampoo. The dye from tinted shampoo could stain a white garment and the fragrance oils could do likewise.

, Bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Turn off the heat, then add your whites, and allow them to soak for an hour in the lemon water.


Make sure that the lemons are cut into slices rather than halves. You want as much of the lemon flesh to be exposed as possible since more of the juice from the inner membranes can seep into the water that way.

, Apply fabric rust remover to the stain, using enough to actually soak into the fabric. Scrub the area with a toothbrush to work the product into the fibers more thoroughly, then let it sit for 5 minutes or less. Rinse out the stain remover with lukewarm water.


This option works especially well on armpit stains. The stains in this area are usually caused by a reaction between sweat and antiperspirant deodorant, and the nasty yellow tint that results is caused by aluminum rather than sweat alone. Rust stain remover takes care of these aluminum-based stains.

, Allow the liquid to sit for another 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing.


Note that you can also do this with distilled white vinegar.
The acids in both vinegar and lemon juice are mild enough to work without damaging fabrics but harsh enough to dissolve soil and residue left by alkaline substances.

, As soon as you spill something dark onto a white garment, rub a little salt into the stain. The salt can absorb the moisture from the stain and lift away some of the dye while it is still in its liquid state.


This treatment only works when the stain is still wet and fresh. It will not help much on dry, set stains.

, There are many different commercial stain treatments nowadays. You can buy one in the store to treat stains, but make sure you choose one that is safe for the type of material you plan to use it with, and always follow the usage instructions on the label.

, Add 1 cup (250 ml) of white vinegar to the washing machine just before it enters its rinse cycle. Do this when you are washing a load of all-white laundry for best results.

, Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of baking soda directly into the washing machine basin with a load of white clothes. Run the cycle as usual.


Do not pour the baking soda into a separate detergent dispenser.
Alternatively, use washing soda instead of baking soda. The two products are similar, but washing soda has a lower pH, making it safer to use on clothes.

, Pour it directly into the basin portion with the clothes and run the cycle as normal.


You should not add the Borax to a separate detergent dispenser.
Borax is similar to baking soda in the way that it whitens and deodorizes.

, If you are only washing white clothes, add a capful of bleach to the load when you plan to wash it. If you are concerned about the powerful effects of standard bleach, try a non-chlorine bleach or a slow-acting bleach, like a 3-percent peroxide solution.If you have hard water with a high iron content, do not use chlorine bleach. Chlorine and iron can actually cause your whites to take on a yellow tint. Use oxygen bleach, instead.

, These products are available in the laundry aisle of many grocery stores. Add them to the wash cycle as instructed on the label.

, Ask yourself which pre-treatments and laundry boosters you want to use. Apply any pre-treatments ahead of time and add any laundry boosters to the washing machine as your prepare to wash your white clothes.

, Launder your white clothes in the hottest water you can use without damaging the material, and only wash white garments with other white items. You should also wash excessively soiled white garments separately from those that are less dirtied.


Water is most effective at removing soil at a minimum temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).
While it is true that warm water can set certain stains, for white clothes that have already been laundered several times and have lost their brightness little by little, any color change has already been set into the fibers. As such, you need to treat the dinginess as soil and use hot water instead of cold.
Use detergent in the washing machine cycle no matter which pre-treatments or laundry boosters you decide to add. A detergent with special enzymes may work best, and you should use the maximum amount recommended on the bottle's label for maximum efficiency.
Note that if you have hard water, you might need to use larger amounts of detergent. You may also need to install a water softener in your house so that the water entering your washing machine is less harsh on your clothes.
If your water is high in iron, you should use an iron-removing product during your washing cycle.

, Sunlight has a natural bleaching effect, so allowing your clothes to hang dry in the sun can dry and whiten them simultaneously.


If you are unable to dry your clothes in the sun due to the weather, where you live, or for any other reason, you can still dry your white clothing in a dryer. You will not receive the bleaching benefits of natural sunlight, but the dryer should not do any real damage to the clothing, either, as long as the fabric is dryer-safe.

You can use hot soapy water or a small spray of mildew cleaner. If you use mildew cleaner, be careful with these chemicals as they can irritate skin.
You can also use a mixture of 50% water and 50% bleach on a rag. Make sure to wipe around it and underneath it.
You might find a lot of debris and slimy residue around the gasket. This is one of the most common sources of mold smell in front loading washing machine.
If the residue under the gasket is persistent and hard to remove with a rag, try using an old toothbrush to scrub it out of hard to reach nooks. If you come across any stray socks or clothing articles, be sure to remove them.;
, These might be able to be removed from your washing machine to make this easier. Soap residue and small amounts of old stagnant water can make your dispensers smell.
Remove the dispensers and give them a thorough cleaning with hot soapy water.
If you can't remove them, you can wipe them out with soapy water.
Use a spray bottle or pipe cleaner to get into the nooks and crannies of the dispenser.

, Use the longest wash with the hottest water setting available. Some washing machines have a tub cleaning cycle.
Pour one of the following directly into the tub of the washing machine: 1 cup bleach, 1 cup of baking soda, 1/2 cup of enzymatic dishwasher detergent, or a a commercial washer cleaner.
Some common brands of washer cleaner are Affresh or Smelly Washer.
Tide also makes a washer cleaner that you can buy in the laundry aisle of your supermarket.
Run your cycle completely. If the smell remains, try another cycle.
If after running the cycle twice the smell persists, try another additive. For example if you used baking soda the first round, try washer cleaner or bleach on the second try.

, Your washer may be under warranty for an issue like this. Check your user manual. If your smell persists you might have a clogged drain or filter. There might also be mold growing behind the washing machine drum.
A qualified repair person will be able to diagnose any further problems and recommend solutions.
If you are familiar with washers, you can try to clean the drain and filter yourself. You can find this usually in the small door at the base of the front of the washer.
Be sure to have a bucket handy to collect any stagnant water.

, Most High Efficiency (HE) machines require HE detergent. Using non-HE detergent will cause too many suds to form. These suds will leave behind a residue that can start to smell.
Don't use too much detergent either. This will also cause residue to form inside your washing machine.
Powdered detergent often is a better alternative to liquid as it tends to produce fewer suds. , Use dryer sheets instead.


Much like liquid detergent, liquid fabric softener can also cause residue to build up inside your machine.
This residue will develop a bad odor over time.
Buy dryer sheets instead. These are inexpensive and can be found in the laundry aisle of any supermarket.

, This will decrease the mold build-up as it allows the tub to dry completely.Leave the door slightly ajar when the machine is not in use.
This will allow fresh air to circulate through the drum of the front loading washing machine and will help dry any remaining moisture after a load.
If you have small children or pets, you should avoid doing this as they can climb into the drum and become accidentally trapped inside., Right after a cycle ends, take the wet clothes out.Set your washer to beep when a cycle is complete, so you don't forget to take the clothes out.
If you can't dry your clothes right away, take them out and put them in a hamper or lay them flat until the dryer is available.
This will prevent excess moisture from building up inside the washing machine drum after each load.

, Do this is a dry towel. Ideally, the gasket, the area underneath it and the inside of the drum should be wiped dry after each cycle.
This can be time consuming and a nuisance, so be sure to do this periodically at the very least.
You can also wipe down the gaskets with hot soapy water regularly and allow them to completely dry. This will keep them clean and free of mildew.

, Use a hot water or cleaning cycle. Pour two cups of white vinegar into the detergent dispenser and run a hot water or cleaning cycle.
You can also use a commercial washing machine cleaner such as Smelly Washer, but vinegar is more cost effective and just as efficient.
When finished, clean the inside of the tub, gasket, detergent dispenser and inside of the door with a mixture of hot water and vinegar and a towel.
Repeat wiping down the inside parts of the washer with hot water only.
Run your washer again with hot water only.
Leave your washer door open to let the inside of the unit dry.

Wear gloves to protect your hands as well.

, Start adding very hot water to the bucket. If the water from your tap is not very hot, then you can add some boiling water to the bucket. Swish the Oxiclean into the water by gentle tilting the bucket back and forth as you add the water. Just be careful not to tip the bucket or slosh the water over the sides.

, After you have filled the bucket about halfway with hot water, start adding your towels to the bucket. Make sure that each of the towels is fully immersed in the water.


Leave the towels in the bucket and let them soak for about 48 hours.

, After you have finished soaking the towels, take them out of the tub and wring them out. Then put them right into the washing machine and run them on the hottest setting with detergent and fabric softener.


You can also add Oxiclean to the washing machine when you wash your towels., After the wash cycle has finished, put the towels into the dryer right away. Dry them on high heat until they are completely dry. Your towels should be like new after this treatment.

Check your washing machine for defects.,
Wash the gasket.,
Clean the detergent dispensers.,
Run a cleaning cycle.,
Seek professional care.,
Take preventative measures.",How to Remove Mildew Smell from Towels3," If your washing machine is not draining all the way after the cycle finishes, then this may be causing the mildew smell. Check your washing machine for defects to see if water is pooling somewhere. If so, then you may need to hire a professional to fix your machine or you may need to replace it.

, If your towels smell like mildew, sometimes the washing machine could be a part of the problem. Since the gasket is the rubber seal inside the washer that prevents water from leaking out when a load is washing, cleaning the gasket is very important to eliminating mildew smells coming from the washer. Wipe down the gasket with a rag dunked in soapy water, or sprayed with a mild mildew cleanser. You could also use a cleaning solution of 50% water 50% bleach.


Consider using an old toothbrush to get hard to reach places of the gasket.
Make sure to get all areas of the gasket. You may need to pull back sections of the gasket to get into small rubber folds., Take out the detergent dispensers from the machine and scrub them with a soapy water mixture consisting of a small amount of dishwashing soap, and water. Leftover soap residue or stagnant water on the detergent dispensers can make this area of your wash machine smell bad too.


If the dispensers cannot be removed from the machine, do your best to clean inside the dispensers with a rag or pipe cleaners., Make sure that your washing machine is empty and then run a wash cycle using the longest, hottest temperature setting. If the mildew smell remains, try running another cycle. It might take a few cycles to remove the mildew smell.Consider adding one of the following straight into the washing basin of the machine:1 cup of bleach.
1 cup of baking soda.
1/2 cup of powdered enzymatic dishwasher detergent
1/2 cup of a commercial washer cleaner
1 cup of vinegar

, If none of these methods help with getting rid of the mildew smell, you may need to call a professional to come look at your washing machine. There may be mold growth behind the drum of the machine, or perhaps a blocked drain or filter.A certified repair professional can assist you with diagnosing what is wrong with your machine, and may be able to dismantle the machine to find the source of the smell if need be.

, Once you figure out if where the mildew smell is coming from, take some preventative measures to ensure that mold doesn't accumulate again. You might want to consider:



Airing out the washing machine. Leave the washing machine door open between washing uses. However, be aware that pets and young children could become trapped in the machine.Using detergent wisely. Use detergents that create a small amount of suds, and are specifically made for highly efficient machines. Powder detergents usually tend to be less sudsy than liquid detergents. Also, don't exceed the recommended amount of detergent. Sometimes, even less detergent works better for cleaning your clothes.Avoiding fabric softener. Fabric softeners that come in liquid form tend to leave a residue that supports mold growth. Instead of using liquid fabric softener, consider using dryer sheets or dryer balls to give your clothes a softer feel.Drying the gasket. Use a rag to wipe everywhere surround the gasket, and inside the grooves of the rubber gasket. Ideally, you should try to wipe the gasket after every washing cycle. If you’re not going to wipe and clean the gasket after every wash, you should try to regularly wipe the gasket every week or so to remove trapped mold.Doing a bleach cycle. Run a hot water and bleach cycle once a month. This is a good opportunity to disinfect your washer, but also to wash heavily soiled items like work cloths and grimy towels."

Make sure that as you are taking off the shirt, you do not touch any other part of the shirt to the stained section. This could spread the stain to other parts of the shirt. , Lay the shirt out on a flat, even surface. If the shirt is stained on the front, roll up the back of the shirt so that the stain does not spread through the front of the shirt onto the back. You can also slip a towel in the shirt between the front and back to prevent spreading.

, Take a clean cloth or paper towel and blot gently at the shirt. Make sure not to rub or scrub the shirt. This could cause the stain to get ingrained into the shirt and make it harder to get out. If the stained area is big, start from the outside, working your way towards the center. This way, you can contain the stain and keep it from spreading., After you have already absorbed all you can with a dry cloth, try dabbing the shirt with a dampened cloth.

Lay out the shirt and pour the white wine over the stain. Then using a clean cloth or napkin dab at the stain and soak it up. This method works best directly after the stain happens. Essentially, the white wine is moistening the area of the stain and preventing the red wine from setting. You want to make sure that you are using a very pale white wine to prevent further staining.
Keep in mind that although many have used this method successfully, there is some controversy about using white wine. Some argue that all white wines have a tint to them, so using them can help and harm at the same time., Right after the stain occurs, pour a generous amount of club soda over the stain. Keep pouring as you see the red stain fading. Keep a paper towel handy and blot at the stain. Just as with the wine, pouring club soda helps to remove the stain by preventing the red wine from setting. Some argue that water is just as effective as club soda. Use water as an alternative if you do not have any club soda or seltzer in your home.

, Make a paste out of baking soda by using a 3-1 ratio of baking soda and water. Make enough paste to cover the stain. Leave the paste on the stain until dry. Then carefully scrape off the paste from the stain.

, If necessary, place the entire shirt into a bowl a milk to make sure that all affected areas are covered. Allow it to sit for at least ten minutes, and up to an hour.Milk is one of the mildest potential cleaning agents you can use, and there is not known fabric that can not be treated in this way.
It may be best to use 2 percent or whole milk. While the water in milk will pick up most types of dyes, the fats in whole and 2 percent milk will absorb others.
This form of treatment is really only effective for the freshest of ink marks. Dried stains will not be affected by soaking in milk.

, Rinse out some of the milk and ink in your kitchen or bathroom sink.








, If there are only minor marks indicating where the spill had been, the milk treatment has worked. If the ink is largely unaffected, you may have to try an alternative method.

Guide the spider out.,
Guide the spider over the threshold.,
Throw the folder out the door if the spider crawls on it.,
Close the door or window.",How to Get Spiders Out of Your House Without Killing Them1," If the spider is non-venomous, there are a number of ways to get it out of your home. If the spider in your house is already close to a window or door, you can find ways to encourage the spider out. You will first want to open the door or window to show the spider the way out of the house. Try to step around the spider and open the door or window slowly. If you scare the spider, it may run and hide somewhere, and you won’t be able to get it outside as easily.;
, Find an object like a notebook, folder, or book that you can move around the spider if it tries to go in a direction that’s not the open door or window. Anything that is tall and flat will work., Take the notebook or folder and gently give the spider a nudge toward the door. The spider will be scared and start moving. If the spider veers away from the door, take the notebook and put it next to the spider to create a wall so that the spider won’t be able to run in that direction anymore. Keep doing this until the spider starts running in the right direction., The spider may hesitate on the threshold as it is running toward the door. If the spider lingers on the threshold, brush it out using your hand or the notebook or folder. You also could flick it with your finger.

, When you are using the folder to guide the spider out of the door, the spider may start crawling on the folder instead of running. If the spider crawls onto the folder, toss the folder out the door, so that both the spider and the folder are outside. The spider will eventually crawl off the folder, and you can go and retrieve the folder later.


You may not feel comfortable throwing the folder out of the door or window, especially if you live in a communal space like an apartment complex. If the spider crawls on the folder, instead of throwing it you can go outside with the folder and either brush the spider off with your hand, or wipe the folder on a bush or the windowsill until the spider falls off.

, Now that the spider’s gone, you don’t want it to come back! Make sure that you close the door or window so the spider or other bugs can’t come in.

Add your shirt to a bucket of cold water.,
Add bleach.,
Let the shirt soak for 5-10 minutes.,
Rinse the shirt in cold water.,
Wring the shirt out and dry.",How to Bleach a White Shirt1," Use laundry bleach. To begin, toss your shirt in a bucket, bowl, or other suitably sturdy container. Cover it with at least a few inches of cold water.


Feel free to soak other whites with your shirt. It is more efficient to bleach a number of items than just one. White underwear, socks, pillowcases, and towels often are good candidates. If you do, add extra water so that the clothes have at least an inch or so of water over them when pushed down.
You want a container big enough to give you room to stir and agitate your clothing while it soaks. Clean construction-grade buckets are great for this. If you can obtain one with a lid, it will help prevent accidents as well as cut down on any fumes if used inside. Other typical possibilities include a large cooking pot, a bathtub, or your washing machine.;
, Your bottle of bleach very likely has directions on how much is recommended for use. Different bleaches have different concentrations. If you are only soaking your shirt, you may only need a few tablespoons or so. However, if you soak a large load of whites, you may need to add up to 1 cup. Generally, about 1








Laundry detergent
Dish detergent
Borax
Washing soda

Note: Never mix bleach and ammonia — this can release toxic chloramine gas., Next, stir the liquid in the bucket to ensure your shirt (and/or any other clothes with it) get a nice, even soaking. Then, set a timer for five to ten minutes and simply wait for the bleach to do its work! You may want to stir every few minutes to ensure the shirt soaks completely.


Do not let your whites to soak for too long. Even fabrics that can safely be bleached, like cotton and linen, will eventually be weakened and damaged if exposed to bleach for long periods of time., Once your shirt has soaked, remove it from the bleach mixture and wash it under cold, clear running water. You want to do this to remove the bleach and other chemicals from the fabric. If allowed to dry, these materials can leave unpleasant residues in the fabric which can smell strongly of chlorine, irritate the skin, and possibly cause yellow stains..








, Once your shirt has been rinsed and any bleach or detergent that was used to clean it has been removed, squeeze or wring any excess water out of it. Then, simply dry it however you normally would. For most, the simplest option will be to simply use a drying machine or put out on the line to dry as usual.









However, you can also let the shirt air-dry out doors. Drying white clothes in the sun is actually known to have a slight ""bleaching"" effect, leading to whiter whites (see section below for more information). It is not as dramatic as using bleach, but sunlight does cause bleaching.

Make a spider spray.",How to Kill Spiders," In North America, the most common types of dangerous house spiders are the black widow and the brown recluse, but learn the types of venomous spiders in your area and how to distinguish them from harmless house spiders.Female black widows have shiny black coloring, with a distinctive red hourglass-shaped pattern on their underside. Males have a mixture of whitish dots on the upper abdomen, are typically about half the size of female spiders, and are not as dangerous as the female.
The brown recluse is a small sandy-brown spider with a violin-shaped body found primarily in the Midwest and South. They typically reside in tight, out-of-the-way spaces.In Australia, the redback spider is a common and dangerous spider that ends up in people's houses. Other spiders to watch out for might include the hobo spider and the wolf spider.;
, Fresh webs, as opposed to old dust-covered cobwebs, are signs of current spider activity. By learning a bit about the webs of the particular kinds of spiders you're looking out for (or the lack thereof) you can prepare your plan of attack for undesirable spiders.









Black widow webs are usually irregularly shaped and somewhat thicker than other spider's webs, and usually located within one foot of the ground. The webs of black widows are typically in dry corners and other safe areas, not out in the open and easy to find, and usually look somewhat erratic, with a tunneling feature where the spider hides during the day.
Brown recluse webs are loose and sticky, with an off-white color. You won't see them strung between tree branches or in the corner of the house, but in ""reclusive"" spots like under boxes, in woodpiles, or other unused out of the way areas.
Large and intricate webs are the hallmark of the harmless orb-weaver spider, a helpful bug-catcher. Leave these spiders alone, or gently migrate them elsewhere.

, Black widows are typically nocturnal spiders and the brown recluse rarely comes out of hiding. If you've got a large brownish hairy spider building a conspicuous web in the middle of the day, you probably don't need to worry.









If you're worried you've got a dangerous spider, check the webs in the middle of the day when the spider will be dormant. At this point, you can either lay out liquid or powder insecticide, or you can come back at night to kill them directly if you want to be sure.

, Most spiders you encounter on a daily basis will be harmless. Move them outdoors where they can do more insect-catching good by trapping them in a jar or sweeping them onto a piece of paper and dumping them outside.









Get a large bowl or pan and sweep the spider into it with a broom. Use a magazine or newspaper large enough to cover the bowl to keep the spider from escaping prematurely, and then release it outside, far from your house if you wish.
If you want to kill the spider without smashing it, you can fill your bowl or pan with insecticide, killing the spider as you capture it. You could also spray the spider at this point with insecticide or hairspray. Only do this if the spider is harmful.

, Available in dry dusting and liquid spot varieties, you can lay this out when you find the webs during the day. This is an effective method that doesn't require you to actively run around squashing spiders with a flashlight.









Dust applications like Drione Dust and Delta Dust are best for out of the way areas where only spiders will go, like under staircases or in attic spaces. Apply these insecticides with hand brushes in wall voids near the webs to make the locations uninhabitable for the spiders.
Liquid spot treatments like Demon WP and Cynoff EC can be used to spray under beds and in dark corners. These are usually sold in powder form, with specific instructions to mix with water and form the spray.
For a natural alternative, try diatomaceous earth, which consists of the powdered fossilized remains of diatoms. It is harmless to people and other pets, and is even used in some foods and cat litters, but dehydrates the exoskeletons of insects and arachnids.After you've eradicated your spiders, it's not a bad idea to treat the areas with insecticide as a preventative measure. Spiders tend to pick the same areas to colonize, so you might cut them off at the pass by spraying or laying some insecticide down.

, A good vacuum with a hose attachment means you can get rid of your spiders without ever having to get too close to them. Even if the spider is hiding in its tunnel, you can use the vacuum to suck out all the webbing and the spiders within it.









This is also an effective method for vacuuming up lots of house spider hatchlings that would be difficult to kill or migrate otherwise.
Once you've vacuumed spiders, remove the vacuum bag and seal it in a plastic garbage bag, and put it outside in the garbage.

, Sometimes you've just got to go old-school and use your shoe. If the spider is in its web, use a broom or stick to sweep the spider out into the open and use a shoe, rolled up newspaper, or book to smash the spider. It may be inelegant, but at least you'll be sure you've got it.









Black widows might have a tendency to head toward you if you miss, so be quick and keep your distance from dangerous spiders.
Be careful to inspect the spider before squashing it, as a pregnant one may release its hatch-lings upon being smashed

, Since spiders like dark and undisturbed areas to build their webs, keeping a clean house is the best way to avoid infestation. Regularly sweep and mop your home, as well as vacuuming out small cracks and wall gaps. From the outside, power wash your windows to keep critters from congregating.









In the attic, basement, or anywhere you have lots of stuff and boxes stored, regularly move things around and vacuum to avoid creating spider habitats. Remove unnecessary clutter and stay tidy to eliminate the kinds of habitats spiders love. Consider spreading insecticide in those areas if you're worried about cultivating habitats.
Outside, trim back shrubs and other foliage around your house, especially that nearest entrances. If you have firewood stacked anywhere near the house, consider moving it elsewhere. These are places spiders tend to congregate, and if they have easy access to the house, they'll be able to make the jump quickly.

, Plug any gaps with weather stripping to make sure you've got a secure home and aren't letting unwanted pests easy access to your house.









Consider spreading some insecticide into any cracks before you seal them. Use stick-on weather stripping or caulk to create the seal.

, Natural spider repellants are easy to make, use, and will ensure that your home stays spider free, so you won't have to worry about killing them or moving them elsewhere.








Add 3-5 drops of an essential oil like tea tree, peppermint, or lemon to a quart of water to clean your house with. These are harmless to people and pets, but create an undesirable scent for insects and spiders.
Plant eucalyptus and spread horse chestnuts. Many people believe that eucalyptus is a natural spider replant, and some studies have shown that saponin--a naturally-occuring chemical found in horse chestnuts--repels spiders.

, Make a spider spray for spraying on the outside of windows and doors, and along fences and mailboxes. Mix and pour the following in a spray bottle:









1 cup vinegar
1 cup pepper
1 teaspoon oil
1 teaspoon liquid soap.

Quickly, take a small cup and place it directly over the spider, so that the spider is trapped inside.Preferably the cup should be clear so that when you trap the spider, you can see it inside the cup. However, you can use any cup that you have in your house.
Make sure to aim correctly so that the spider is unharmed. You don’t want to crush the spider or any of its legs with the rim of the cup.

, Take a sheet of paper and slide it underneath the cup. Make sure that the piece of paper is under the entire cup. This will make sure that the spider won’t be able to escape when you lift up the cup.The paper should be just one sheet, as opposed to a book or notebook. A stiff piece of paper like a notecard or index card works best.
If the spider is dangling from a web, you will want to place the cup under the spider, and then either cut the web using scissors or use the piece of paper to break the web. The web and spider will stick to the piece of paper, and you will be able to bring the cup up to the paper and trap the spider.

, You want to lift up the piece of paper and the cup so that the spider is still trapped inside. Make sure that as you are lifting, the rim of the cup and the paper are always against each other so that the spider does not escape. One way to lift the cup and paper is to hold the edge of the piece of paper with your left hand, with your right over the bottom of the cup.
Lift the edge of the piece of paper, still holding the cup over the paper. Slip the fingers of your left hand under the piece of paper so that your hand is on the part of the piece of paper underneath the cup.
Now with your hand underneath the paper and cup, you can lift up the trap and carry it to your door.

, Carry the spider over to the door. Open the door and step outside. Place the trap on the ground, and take the cup off the spider. The spider should run away. If the spider is not moving, try gently blowing on the spider. You can also brush the spider off with your hand if you’re feeling brave! "

Sweep the spider onto the dustpan.,
Gently tap the underside of the dustpan.,
Release the spider outside.,
Use a vacuum.",How to Get Spiders Out of Your House Without Killing Them3," If the spider is on the floor, sweep the spider onto the dustpan. You can also do this if the spider is on a wall, but be careful not to sweep the spider on you!, With the spider on the dustpan, head to the door. As you are walking, tap the underside of the dustpan with the sweeper or with your fingernails. The noise and the vibrations of the tapping will scare the spider so that it stays still and doesn’t run off the dustpan., When you get outside, place the dustpan on the ground. The spider should run off. If it doesn’t, you can leave the dustpan there until the spider leaves it, or you can use the sweeper to sweep the spider off the dustpan.

, If using a dustpan is too up close and personal with the spider for you, use a vacuum instead. On the lowest setting, vacuum up the spider. Then empty out the filter outside of your home.


You can use a regular vacuum cleaner, but be warned that this may possibly kill the spider. A dust buster is a slightly better option.You can also buy vacuums made especially for bugs and insects. You can purchase these on Amazon.

Get a plastic bag.,
Put your hand inside the bag.,
Grab the spider.,
Turn the bag inside out.,
Release the spider.",How to Get Spiders Out of Your House Without Killing Them4," Use a plastic bag that is easy to turn inside out, like a plastic shopping bag. You also want to be sure that the bag is big enough so that your hand will fit inside it. Make sure that the bag doesn't have any rips or holes. , Make sure that you are able to move your fingers inside the bag. You are going to grab the spider with the bag, so you want to make sure that the bag is flexible enough to do this. Walk over to the spider with the bag on your hand., With the hand that is inside the bag, grab the spider. Try to be gentle and not to squeeze, or else you could kill the spider. Try to grab the spider so that it is surrounded by the bag and is not being squeezed between your fingers.

, Quickly, before the spider can escape, turn the bag inside out. This way the spider will be trapped inside the bag. Pinch the top of the bag so that the spider can't escape out the top. , Take the spider outside and shake out the bag. The spider should come out. You also can leave the bag outside and come back for it later, but be sure to remember, you don't want to litter!

Remove any staining substances immediately.,
Pre-treat stains with detergent.,
Load the washing machine and add bleach.,
Run the washer at the highest allowable heat.,
Dry and repeat as needed.",How to Bleach a White Shirt2," The method above isn't the only way to bleach a white shirt — you can also use bleach during a normal cycle of your washing machine to whiten your clothing with minimal extra effort. To begin, if your shirt has any stains on it, use a paper towel, a spoon, or any other tool you have handy to remove any excess spilled material from the shirt. The earlier you can remove the sources of your stains, the better the shirt will look in the long run.









For ground-in stains, try making a paste of baking soda and water and brushing it into the stain. The baking soda should gradually absorb some of the staining materials, after which it it can be brushed away.

, Next, pour a tiny spot of liquid laundry detergent directly onto any stain remaining on your shirt. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush (one you don't intend to use for your teeth again) to scrub the stain clean. Leave the scrubbed-in detergent in the shirt before you wash it — allowing it to set helps loosen up the stain, leaving you with a whiter shirt in the long run.









If you don't have liquid laundry detergent, you can mix a small spoonful of powdered detergent with water and use it in precisely the same way.

, Next, put your pre-treated white shirt (and any other whites you're washing) into your washing machine. At this point, you can add your bleach. The precise way you'll do this will vary based on the type of washing machine you have — directions for the most common types are below:








Machines with bleach dispenser: Pour bleach into the bleach dispenser tray, filling it to the indicated line. The washing machine will automatically release the bleach into the load at the appropriate time.
Machines without bleach dispenser: Start the wash cycle, then add detergent and 1/2 cup of bleach to the water, then, finally, add your clothing.
Very large machines: Use bleach dispenser as above if available. If the machine has no bleach dispenser, add 1 cup of bleach to the water after the wash cycle has begun.

, You're all ready to start your washing machine! For the greatest cleaning and whitening power, use the hottest temperature setting allowable for the fabric of the garments in the wash. Consult your garment's care label if you are unsure of how hot it can safely be washed — in general, tough fabrics like cotton, denim, and so on can take hot wash temperatures, while many more fragile or manmade fibers can only withstand warm heats., When your washing machine is done, remove your white shirt and any other whites you washed with it. Dry as you please — for most, this will usually mean using a dryer, though you can also save energy by air-drying if it's sunny outside.









For particularly stained or soiled white shirts, you may need to repeat this cycle several times to restore them to their original brilliant white. For the very best results, try pairing this normal washing technique with one of the others described in this article.

"
"
Wash as normal.,
Hang clothes outside in warm weather.,
Wait for the clothes to dry.,
Don't let clothes lay in the sun for days on end.",How to Bleach a White Shirt3," For this method, you'll use the natural bleaching power of the sun's rays to get your shirt looking as white as possible. Before bleach was commercially available, this was the primary way that people kept their whites bright and shining. To begin, wash your white shirt as you normally would. You can use one of the methods described above or simply use whatever washing technique you're used to.








, Next, if the sun is shining and there's no chance of rain, take your wet clothes outside. Hang the shirt over a horizontal wire or a wooden drying rack. If you don't have either of these things handy, you can try laying it on a clean, flat surface, like the floor of a deck or patio, or hanging it over a railing. Try to position the shirt somewhere will it will get plenty of sun — the more, the better.

, Now, all you've got to do is wait! Over time, the sun will do its work, naturally evaporating the moisture trapped in the fabric. As it does this, the sun will also gently bleach the fabric itself, resulting in noticeably whiter whites without the aid of commercial bleach. This method is great for cloth diapers and other sorts of frequently-soiled white fabrics.


The bleaching power of the sun comes from the ultraviolet radiation in its rays. This radiation can actually break up the chemical bonds that produce the colors in stains at a molecular level, causing them to ""fade"" or lighten in color., While sun-bleaching offers an easy, convenient alternative to commercial bleach, it has its drawbacks as well. Over time, the sun's rays can actually weaken clothing fabric, making it much more susceptible to damage and wear. For this reason, you'll want to avoid leaving clothes out in the sun longer than they need to be. Once your whites have dried, to avoid unnecessary wear, bring them in, rather than letting them sit out.

"
"
Use bleach only for whites.,
Test for colorfastness on an inside seam.,
Don't use bleach for wool, mohair, leather, silk, or spandex.,
Don't mix bleach and ammonia.",How to Bleach a White Shirt4," In general, bleach should only be used for white pieces of clothing. Though it's great for brightening your whites, bleach can lead to laundry disasters when used with certain types of colored clothing. Bleach can strip the dye straight out of colored clothing, leaving you with pale, faded results. Worse still, if undiluted bleach is spilled directly onto colored clothing, it can result in splotchy, uneven faded patches in the spots where the bleach hits the shirt. For these reasons, you'll want to keep most colored clothing far away from bleach.


To be clear, there are actually two different kinds of bleach that are commonly available: chlorine bleach, which is suitable only for whites for the reasons listed above, and oxygen bleach, which is usually marketed as a cleaning product with ""Oxi"" in the name (e.g., Oxiclean, etc.). In some situations, you can use oxygen bleach for treating stains on colored clothing.However, since chlorine bleach is usually what most people think of when they hear the word ""bleach"", we've focused on this in the safety disclaimer above.

, While chlorine bleach usually isn't recommended for cleaning colored clothing, oxygen bleach can usually be safely used in small quantities for ""colorfast"" clothing — that is, clothes with colors that won't run. Sometimes, this information will be contained on the garment's care label. If it isn't, you can test a garment's colorfastness by using the quick test below:









Mix 1 tablespoon of oxygen bleach in 1 cup of water. Dip a cotton ball or swab in the mixture and transfer just a drop or so to one of the garment's inside seams (or some other part of the garment that isn't likely to be seen). Wait for about 10 minutes, then check to see if the colors have faded. If they have, don't use the bleach to clean the garment.

, Bleach is a powerful cleaning tool — though it can get your whites looking brand-new, it can damage weaker fabrics. In general, you won't want to use bleach on any sort of garment made from the materials listed above for this reason. Bleach can sometimes ruin or seriously discolor garments made from these fabrics. If you're washing white versions of these fabrics (i.e., white wool, white mohair, and so on), you'll usually be directed to use hydrogen peroxide or another mild bleaching agent rather than bleach.When in doubt, consult a garment's care label. The list above isn't exhaustive, so, if you're ever not 100% sure whether or not you should use bleach to wash a garment, give the label a quick check.

, As noted above, you'll never, ever, ever want to mix bleach and ammonia for any cleaning job. These two common cleaning materials can be very harmful when combined, forming dangerous chloramine gases that can injure (or, if you're continuously exposed to them, even kill you). Chloramine gases are not something you want in your home, so keep ammonia far away from your bleach. Below are just some of the effects of exposure to chloramine gas:Coughing
Chest pain
Pneumonia
Mouth, eye, and throat irritation
Nausea
Shortness of breath

Use long, sweeping strokes, being careful to avoid spreading dirt to clean areas. Shake the pants out thoroughly when you’re done.Brush down the pants outdoors to keep from making a mess inside your home.
It’s important to treat stains as soon as possible so that they’ll have less time to set up on the fabric.;
, Mix together roughly two parts hydrogen peroxide and one part liquid dish soap and shake to combine. Both of these ingredients contain active stain-fighting agents and will be instrumental in lifting the worst of the stains prior to laundering.Keep a bottle of hydrogen peroxide solution mixed up so that you’ll have a ready supply on hand to treat a dirty uniform after each game., Mist the pants liberally on both sides, focusing on areas where dirt and discoloration is the heaviest. Then, use your brush to work the solution further into the fibers of the garment where they can continue working on the stains.Reapply fresh solution after chipping away at the stains with the brush.
If the stains are very pronounced, turn the pants inside out and spray and brush the opposite side of the fabric as well., Give the solution time to take effect before moving on to other deep-cleaning methods. You might be surprised how well the initial treatment can work on ground-in dirt, grass and blood stains.Leave the pants on a flat, dry surface as they sit, like a countertop or the ironing board.
The longer you let the stain-fighting solution work, the better the end result will be.

, Run enough water to completely submerge the pants. It’s important to use warm or hot water as opposed to cold, as it will be more effective for loosening the most troublesome stains.You can also soak the pants in a bathtub if you’re short on sink space.
If necessary, use a small, heavy object to weigh down the pants and keep them underwater., Add about one cup of bleach-based cleaner like OxiClean or Clorox Oxy Magic to the sink. Whisk the water and cleaner together until they’re evenly distributed. These products are designed to cut tough messes using a mild natural bleaching action, so there’s no need to do a lot of scrubbing.For best results, look for products that are specially formulated for use on white clothing.
It’s a good idea to wear cleaning gloves when working with products containing bleach and other harsh chemicals., Place the pants in the sink with the warm water and bleach cleaner. Ideally, the pants should remain in the solution for a minimum of 2-3 hours. If possible, soak them overnight to ensure that the cleaner has had ample time to work.If you’re short on time, use a slightly higher concentration of cleaner and plunge the pants gently in the water by hand.
Soaking is an indispensable step in removing stains from white fabrics.

, Remove the pants from the sink and wring out the excess cleaning solution. Drain the sink and run a stream of fresh warm water over the pants. This will help flush away dislodged debris and dirty water.Squeeze all water out of the pants again after rinsing.
You should follow up with a regular cycle in the washing machine, even if the stains have mostly disappeared from the pants., After a good soak, it’s important to wash the pants right away before they have time to dry. Be sure to only wash your uniform pants with other white fabrics. If the rest of your uniform needs to be washed, you can throw them in together.Once loose stains dry a second time, they can be even harder to get out.If you wash your uniform with bright colors that have a tendency to run, you could find yourself dealing with a whole new set of difficult stains.

, Add the laundry detergent straight to the clothes, rather than to a separate dispenser. You’ll have the most luck with stain-dissolving detergents made specifically for whites.Use a whole capful of detergent to provide the maximum amount of cleaning muscle.

, Set the washing machine to a normal wash cycle. Use warm water. Whatever stains are leftover from the first two phases of cleaning should be totally erased following a thorough machine washing.Add a cup of distilled white vinegar during the rinse cycle. Vinegar can brighten and soften light fabrics, making it a great way to provide the finishing touches to hard-wearing garments.Especially dingy pants may need to be laundered on a heavier soil setting.

, The intense heat of the dryer may shrink cotton and blended pants. To prevent this, hang the pants vertically in a well-ventilated area overnight. Afterwards, they’ll be clean and ready to go so you can look your best at the big game!Pants made from polyester and other synthetic fabrics are typically dryer safe.
If the pants are wrinkled after they dry, give them a few passes with an iron on a low heat setting."

Adding it to your load of white laundry is a quick and effective solution to your dingy whites problem.Be very careful not to get bleach on anything that is not white. It will quickly ruin colored fabrics.


In addition to colored fabrics, you should avoid using bleach on wool, silk, mohair, leather, and spandex. Most other white fabrics can be bleached.The correct amount of bleach will depend upon your washing machine and the size of your load. If your washing machine has a bleach dispenser, only use as much as it will hold. If it does not, follow the recommendations on the container of bleach for the proper amount.
If your washing machine has a bleach dispenser, simply add the bleach when you start your cycle. If it does not, allow your washer to fill half-way, add the bleach, and then allow it to fill the rest of the way before adding your clothes.
Use the presoak setting on your washing machine for extra whitening power. If your washing machine doesn't have this setting, simply pause the cycle after you add your clothes and let them sit for at least 20 minutes before turning the washing machine back on.
For the best results, use the setting on your washing for whites. If you don't have this setting, set it to wash with hot water.
Bleach is not the most eco-friendly option. It is extremely toxic and may cause skin irritation.;
, There are many different kinds of stain removers available in the laundry aisle of most stores. You may have to try a few different kinds to find the one that works best for you.


Some products are meant to be applied directly to stains to help them come out in the wash. These typically come in liquids or gels.
Other products are meant to be added to the laundry with your detergent. These can help brighten both whites and colors.It's a good idea to apply a small amount of stain cleaner to a hidden area of the fabric to make sure it does not discolor it before you treat the stain.

, Borax fights stains and deodorizes, and it helps increase the effectiveness of your regular laundry detergent. You can use it either during your regular laundry cycle or as a pre-treatment.Borax is very gentle. You can even use it to clean garments that need to be hand-washed.To use borax during the laundry cycle, add 1/2 cup to your washing machine at the beginning of the wash cycle.
To pre-treat with borax, add 1/2 cup and a little bit of detergent to water and soak your garments.

, Bluing liquid, also known as Prussian blue or ferric ferrocyanide actually adds a slightly blue tint to your whites, which help them look whiter if they have become dull and yellowed. You can add it to your washing machine to help reinvigorate those whites.


Bluing liquid is very gentle and can be used on any washable fabrics. You should not use it in conjunction with bleach or fabric softener.Always dilute bluing liquid with cold water before adding it to your wash. If you don't dilute it, it may stain your clothing.
Use 1/4 teaspoon if adding during the wash cycle or up to 1/8 teaspoon if adding during the rinse cycle.

, If your garments are yellowed, enzyme presoaks may be what you've been looking for. Simply add them during the wash cycle to help your detergent do a better job of cleaning.Enzyme products should never be used on wool or silk. They may break these fabrics down. Enzyme presoaks break up proteins, which make them especially effective on stains from bodily fluids or vegetables., Hydrogen peroxide is a wonderful alternative to chlorine bleach that can be used in the laundry. You can even use it on your colored clothes to keep them looking nice and bright.Hydrogen peroxide is safe for all washable fabrics.Add 1/2 cup to your next load of white laundry to brighten it up.
You can purchase liquid non-chlorine bleach, which is a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water."

Approach the spiders in question.,
Remove the spiders and their webs.,
Throw the rag away.",How to Get Rid of Spiders1," Take a stick-shaped object, such as a broom or mop handle, and tie or duct-tape a rag or towel on one end. When you're finished, you should have a padded end that is shaped like a ball.


Make sure the rag ball is secured tightly to the stick. You don't want it falling on the ground when it's covered in spiders.
If you wish, you can spray the rag with an insecticide; this would kill any live spiders that you pick up. However, if you'd prefer not to use a chemical, you can skip this; the spiders will get wrapped in their own web anyway.;
, Look in the corners where your walls meet the ceiling, under old furniture, and anywhere else you have spiders in your house. You'll find most spiders hanging out on their webs.

, Use the stick to dispatch spiders and remove their webs. Be thorough, since spiders may have laid eggs in their webs that will hatch sooner or later.


Pin spiders against the wall and press down with the stick.
Use a spinning motion to wrap the webs around the rag, leaving no shreds hanging.

, When the job is done, place the rag in a plastic bag, unwrap the tape, and slip it off. Tie the bag and throw it away. Repeat the whole process about every two months, or as often as necessary.

Try adding it to your washing machine to boost the whitening power of your regular laundry detergent or using it to pre-treat your clothes.Lemon juice can bleach colors, so only use it with white loads. Avoid using lemon juice on delicate fabrics, such as silk.If using in the wash, add one cup of lemon juice to your washing machine water.
To pre-treat your laundry, simply add a sliced up lemon to a large pot water and bring to a boil. Then turn the heat off, add your clothes to the pot, and let them sit for one hour. After you remove them, wash them regularly., Baking soda can help whiten and deodorize you clothing naturally, and it can be used in the laundry or as a spot treatment.Baking soda should not be used on silk, but it is safe for most other fabrics.
To use in the laundry, add 1/2 cup of baking soda to your regular detergent.
To spot treat stains, add water to baking soda to create a paste and apply directly to the stain.

, Distilled white vinegar is a great natural whitener. The smell will go away after washing, so don't worry about using it on your clothes. Vinegar can be used either in the washing machine or as a pre-treatment. Vinegar can be used with colors as well. It will brighten without bleaching. Vinegar can break down polyurethane fibers, so don't use it with polyurethane diapers. Vinegar can also weaken some other fabrics, such as cotton, acetate, rayon, and silk. Using a smaller amount of vinegar (always diluted) can help prevent damage to these fabrics.Add 1/2 cup of vinegar to your washing machine with your regular detergent to increase its whitening power.
You can also use vinegar as a pre-treatment for stains. Simply spray it on the affected area and let sit for a while before washing. It's especially effective on sweat stains.

Clear out clutter.,
Use proper storage techniques.,
Keep your house clean.,
Place glue traps in areas where you tend to see spiders.,
Consider pesticide.",How to Get Rid of Spiders2," Spiders are attracted to dark, quiet places, which is why they're commonly found in basement corners. If you have a lot of clutter in your home, you're creating more comfortable places for spiders to inhabit.


Remove old furniture. If you have chairs, couches, and other old, dusty furniture that never gets used, consider letting it air out and taking to a donation center. Little-used furniture makes a good home for spiders.
Don't use the space under your bed as a storage area. Forgotten clothes and shoes, stacks of papers, and other items you might have under the bed might be attracting spiders.






Throw out recycling promptly. Storing old bottles, cans, and newspapers is a sure way to attract creatures, including spiders, to your home. Recycle these items promptly after using them.







, Spiders tend to crawl into the comfortable spaces provided by boxes, bags and other storage items. Since items are usually stored in rooms and closets that don't get daily use, making sure to store things properly is especially important.


Don't store boxes on the floor. Placing them on a shelving unit makes them less accessible to spiders.
Don't use cardboard boxes. Using plastic boxes with tight-fitting lids stored on shelves deters spiders from moving in.







, Spiders prey on insects, and insects are attracted to crumbs, sugar, and other human food items. Keep your kitchen clean and your food sealed in airtight containers to prevent insect infestation from happening.


Vacuum your house once a week. Cleaning the carpet sucks away insect eggs and removes tiny bits of food that might attract bugs.
Use a cleaner to scrub your windowsills, baseboards, and other areas every few weeks.

, Different spiders are attracted to different sorts of traps, so choose the type that will work for the spiders that live in your area. Spiders will walk across the traps and get stuck, and you can dispose of the traps later.

, If you have a lot of spiders in your home, spraying a pesticide around entryways might be the right option for you. Pesticides are generally effective, but because they are poisonous, they should not be used if you have children or pets.

Seal your home.,
Trim back foliage around the house.,
Don't stack wood against your home.",How to Get Rid of Spiders3," Make sure it's not easy for spiders to wander into your home. Keep the windows and doors closed and take the following measures to keep unwanted creatures out:

Use caulk to seal up cracks and holes inside and outside your home.






Make sure your windows are screened, and check the screens occasionally to be sure they don't have holes.
Screen other points of entry such as vents, the chimney, and gutters.







, Some species of spiders build their webs in tall grasses and other plants, so if you have a spider problem, you might want to remove landscaping that's close to your house. Cut the grass often, and compost yard clippings in the back of your yard.

, Many types of spiders like to live in wood piles, so having one stacked against your home is almost guaranteed to draw spiders inside. Store your wood in a shed located away from your home.

Install insect screens.,
Remove or change your outdoor lighting.",How to Get Rid of Wolf Spiders1," Clear away piles of grass clippings, leaves, firewood, mulch, or compost.


Dark places attract wolf spiders, which hide in these areas during the day. By exposing as much of your yard as possible to sunlight, you make the area relatively unappealing to wolf spiders.
Clear away as much debris and clutter from your yard as possible. Even objects like empty planters, stones, and grills can provide a dark hiding place that will attract wolf spiders.;
, Move shrubs and other heavy, ground-covering plants away from the building.


Wolf spiders love to hide in dark places, and low vegetation is among the wolf spider's favorite hiding spots.
If possible, remove all heavy ground-covering plants from the yard. If this is not possible, you should at least move these plants away from the perimeter and to the outer perimeter of your yard to draw the spiders away from your home.

,


Use caulk to fill in gaps, holes, and cracks in the side of the foundation or along the exterior wall.
Add weather stripping to doors and windows to minimize the risk of allowing a wolf spider to sneak in beneath.
Patch up broken window screens or replace the screens completely.

, Tightly fix a fine-mesh screen over all vents that lead to the outside.


Pay special attention to foundation vents. While wolf spiders can get into your home through attic vents and chimneys, they are primarily ground-dwelling hunters and are most likely to enter in through vents and crawl spaces along the foundation of the building.

, Lights on the outside of your house attract flies, moths, and other insects at night, providing an appealing food source for wolf spiders.


Keep your lights turned off as much as possible to limit the number of insects drawn to your home.
Draw your blinds or shades closed to keep indoor lighting from flooding out.
Switch to sodium vapor lights instead of standard outdoor lights. These lights have a soft yellow hue which is less likely to attract bugs.
This is an especially effective control method against wolf spiders. Wolf spiders hunt at night, so the less food available to the at night, the less likely they are to hang around.

Also apply caulk around wires, cables, faucets, and electrical components, since all of these must run to the outside.
Replace or fix torn window screens. Spiders can easily find their way in through even the smallest holes.
Cover your vents and chimney with fine mesh insect screens.;
, While outdoor lights will not attract spiders, they will attract other pests that can serve as appetizing food sources for spiders.


On a similar note, block indoor lights from shining through your windows by using opaque blinds or shades.
Consider switching to yellow sodium vapor lights. These are less appealing to insects and less likely to draw in a food source for your spiders., If you have a serious spider problem, consider transplanting shrubs, trees, ivy, and other plants from the perimeter of your house to the opposite side of the yard.


Vegetation attracts spiders because it serves as an ample hiding spot. When spiders need to seek out warmth or new food sources, they crawl from the vegetation toward your home, getting in through cracks.
You should also remove mulch, stones, leaves, or other debris near your home.

, Clean homes give spiders fewer places to hide out in, making them less likely to stay even if they do slip inside.


Do not leave leftover food lying around. Food crumbs will attract other pests like ants, which, in turn, will attract spiders.
Regularly sweep and vacuum your floors. Wipe down your counters and tables, and avoid letting your dirty dishes sit out for more than a few hours.
Pick up as much clutter as possible. Old newspapers and piles of dirty clothes make the ideal hiding place for spider species that thrive in darkness.
Use plastic storage containers. Airtight plastic containers are difficult for spiders to crawl into, but cardboard boxes are fairly easy.

, One of the simplest methods for getting rid of spiders is vacuuming up egg sacs and webs as you run across them.


This method works best when trying to get rid of a few spiders. It may not be very efficient if you have a large spider population living in your home, however.
You can also use a broom to sweep away webs.
Rather than killing spiders, you should transport them outside if possible. Spiders are a species that is very beneficial to humans, and they're rather noble once you understand them.
Web-building spiders that spend most of their time along the ceiling are not likely to fall victim to the glue trap, but these are very effective against ground-dwelling spiders like jumping spiders and house spiders.
Keep the trap flat to prevent it from curling up into itself.
Discard the trap as soon as you collect a few spiders on it.
Note that this is ineffective against spider eggs and webs, so you will likely need to use this method in conjunction with other techniques.

,


Carefully follow the instructions marked on the label to prevent the accidental poisoning of yourself, a family member, or a pet.
Remember that only 2 species of thousands in North America can harm you in any significant way (The Black Widow and Brown Recluse). The others can bite, but will not do so unless threatened, and their bites are neither poisonous nor very painful.
Spiders are about the best ""pest"" one could hope for in their house, as they kill tons of other pests that can cause harm to humans or spread disease. If you have a lot of them though, that's a serious indicator of a major pest control breach, as the spiders wouldn't be entering if there wasn't a lot of food to be had.
Pyrethroids are chemicals made, in large part, from pyrethrum plants. These plants are in the chrysanthemum family. Most household insecticides contain pyrethroids, and a few common pyrethroids include bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, permethrin, and tetramethrin.
Total release foggers are not generally effective against spiders.
Understand the limit of residual insecticides. These poisons only work if spiders drag themselves through the chemical after it is sprayed. If a spider manages to avoid the spray, the insecticide will have no effect on it.

, If you have a large spider infestation and measures you take yourself are unable to control the problem, a professional might be able to apply a stronger chemical pesticide.


Be aware that some professional pesticides are so strong that you will need to vacate the premises for several days while the effect dies down.
In general, the repellents or transporting a spider are better options for everyone than squishing the little bugger. If you can handle it, picking up a spider and moving it to your porch with a paper towel or jar will save you from meeting a few bugs.

,


Chestnuts, walnuts, and the fruit of the Osage orange tree are thought to have the same effect.
Little is known about why this treatment repels spiders, and there is no scientific evidence or explanation backing the solution.
Some speculate that horse chestnuts have some form of noxious chemical that repels spiders based on scent. To this end, consider poking holes in the chestnut or splitting it in half to release the odor.

, Fill a standard spray bottle with water and mix in 15 to 20 drops of peppermint oil. Spray down all the cracks and corners of your house.The idea is that spiders cannot tolerate the smell of peppermint oil and will run away in the opposite direction when they detect it. As a result, it is most effective when applied to possible entrances to the home.
For a more potent effect, you can dab undiluted peppermint oil onto a cotton ball and stuff the cotton ball into cracks or other possible hiding places.
Try eucalyptus oil or tea tree oil if you have a thing against peppermint. They reportedly have the same effect as peppermint oil and can be used in the same way.

, Spread it anywhere and everywhere you expect a spider to be.


This powder is made from naturally-formed fossils of a water creature known as the diatom. It is safe for both people and pets.
When a spider crosses over the diatomaceous earth, its exterior gets cut up, causing bodily fluids to leak out. The spider eventually dries out and dies as a result.
You can also protect your home and prevent spiders from crawling in by spreading diatomaceous earth around the perimeter of your house.

, Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Apply it to any area in which spiders gather and spray it directly on any spider you see.


Vinegar contains acetic acid, which is thought to burn and kill spiders upon contact.
You can also place small dishes of vinegar in dark corners to ward away spiders. The odor alone may be enough to repel them.

Use light traps to catch larger flies.,
Use fly tape to catch flies.,
Use vinegar or wine traps to catch fruit flies.,
Swat flies with an electronic paddle swatter.",How to Get Rid of Flies in the House1," UV light traps are ideal for catching houseflies and other relatively large species of flies and pest insects. Flies are lured in by the light, and then trapped on a glue board or killed by an electric shock.Place your light traps approximately 4-6 feet (1.2-1.8 meters) above the floor.
Position light traps so that they are not be visible from outside your house, so that the light does not lure new flies into your home.
Make sure that you use a light trap that is designed for indoor use, as high-voltage outdoor bug zappers can create an unsanitary mess.;
, Fly tape, or fly paper, is a simple and effective tool for catching large numbers of adult flies. Purchase one or more rolls of fly tape (like TAT or Black Flag) and hang them up in areas where flies tend to congregate.Do not hang fly tape directly above areas where you will be preparing or eating food. Flies or fly carcasses may become detached and drop off the tape.

, Fruit flies are extremely attracted to fermented fruit products, like red wine and apple cider vinegar. You can create a variety of simple traps using wine or vinegar as a bait to lure in and kill adult fruit flies:Put some apple cider vinegar in a bottle or jar and cover the opening with plastic wrap. Use a rubber band to hold the plastic wrap in place. Create a small hole in the plastic wrap so that fruit flies can smell the vinegar and crawl in. The flies will be unable to escape, and will drown in the vinegar.
Put some vinegar in a bowl and mix in a few drops of dish soap. The dish soap will disrupt the surface tension of the vinegar, causing the flies to drown if they try to land on the surface of the liquid.
Set out an open red wine bottle with a tiny amount of red wine left in it. The flies will be able to enter the bottle easily, but will have a difficult time getting out again.
You can also buy ready-made traps, like Aunt Fannie’s FlyPunch! or Terro fruit fly traps.

, Electronic swatters are a more sanitary alternative to traditional fly swatters. They kill flies and other insects instantly on contact, eliminating the need to crush the fly with the swatter and create a mess.Electronic swatters are fairly safe, but they can still deliver an uncomfortable shock. Keep them away from pets and children.

Figure out why the flies are in your house.,
If you want the flies to leave, you will have to get rid of things that attract them.,
Another option is to kill them by sheer force.,
Vacuum them up.",How to Get Rid of Flesh Flies," Flesh flies get their name because they lay their eggs inside of dead animals and, in rare occasions, even human corpses. Flesh flies also love garbage. Despite their name, these flies are harmless and don't bite.;
, Keep garbage cans at the curb, even if it isn't trash day. Search corners of your house for dead animals (like rats, mice, bird, etc). Keep doors that lead outside closed as often as possible. Sometimes these flies will enter from outside after feeding on something that died outside.

, Use traditional flyswatters, rolled up newspaper, or bug killer spray. Usually these flies will die within a few days of entering your home.

Using bleach and water in equal parts spray works very well also., Keep your vacuum cleaner handy, and when faced with a lot of flies at one time, just suck them in. They get mixed in with all the dust in the bag, and die pretty quickly. After you've decimated the population, replace the bag. This is not recommended with a bagless type vacuum, unless you want to watch the little buggers suffer and die.

Gather your supplies.,
Mix the supplies together in a bowl.,
Place into a jar with a lid.,
Remove the lid from the jar.,
Make enough.",How to Deter Flies Using Potpourri," You'll need dried orange peel, dried lemon peel, and cloves. The quantities are dependent on the amount you wish to make.;
, Sprinkle a little orris root over them as a fixative.

, Seal and leave to absorb the odors for 1 to 2 weeks. Shake every few days.

, Leave the jar to sit, lid off, where flies enter the home or tend to congregate. Flies detest the odor of citrus and will be encouraged to stay away.

, It's recommended to keep more than one jar of citrus potpourri in your home. Have two in the kitchen (one near the window), one at the front door, one at the back door, and one in the bathroom/toilet.

"
Vacuum your home regularly.,
Get rid of cardboard boxes.,
Fill in the gaps.,
Cut down on clutter.",How to Get Rid of Wolf Spiders2," Use a broom or vacuum cleaner to regularly clean inside.


Sweeping and vacuuming the floor removes crumbs that may attract insects. Since insects are a food source for wolf spiders, having fewer insects will mean less food for wolf spiders, which will deter the spiders from lingering in the area.
Pay close attention to any area where you see spider webs. Removing webs discourages spiders from resettling in the same area.

, Ditch boxes made from cardboard in favor of airtight containers made from plastic.


It is especially important to rid basements, attics, closets, crawl spaces, and other dark areas of cardboard boxes. Wolf spiders are drawn to dark areas, making them more likely to find their way to a cardboard box if it is placed in the dark.
Airtight plastic containers are difficult for wolf spiders to sneak into, but a cardboard box is far easier for a wolf spider to squeeze inside.

, Apply caulk around tiny cracks and cables that lead to the outside.


Even if you filled in the gaps outside, it is still wise to do so inside, as well. There are some gaps that may not have been visible from the outside that you might be able to spot more easily inside.
Start from the bottom of your home and work your way up. Wolf spiders are most likely to hang around basements and crawl spaces, so spider-proofing these areas is most important. Gradually work your way up, finishing with the attic.

, Wolf spiders are drawn to dark spaces, so cleaning up piles of magazines, dirty clothes, books, and boxes is one of the best methods you can use to prevent yourself from getting surprised by a wolf spider later on.

"
"
Use chemicals specifically labeled for spider control.,
Look for an insecticide containing pyrethroids.These usually include residual insecticides that are sprayed or sprinkled.,
Scatter boric acid.,
Spray outdoor pesticides around the perimeter of the home.",How to Get Rid of Wolf Spiders3," Since spiders are not insects, many generic insecticides may not have a strong effect against wolf spiders.A pesticide specifically labeled for wolf spiders is even better, but most chemical products designed to work against spiders will work effectively.
Chemicals designed to kill spiders immediately will only exterminate spiders already in the home. These measures should be used in conjunction with measures designed to prevent wolf spiders from sneaking in for maximum effectiveness.
Residual chemicals provide more long-term effectiveness and may be more helpful if you have difficulty preventing spiders from getting into the building.
Residual pesticides sprinkled on the ground work better against wolf spiders than many other spider varieties. Many spiders travel along webs and walls, and as a result, they rarely cross over barriers made with residual pesticides. Wolf spiders hunt on the ground, however, so they are more likely to step into a residual pesticide.

,


Pyrethroids are a family of chemicals made from pyrethrum flowers. Insecticides made with pyrethroids are common and usually the most effective against spiders of all varieties.
Common pyrethroids used in household insecticides include bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, permethrin, and tetramethrin.
Aside from pyrethroid insecticides, insecticides containing deltamethrin, cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, or bifenthrin are also generally effective against wolf spiders.

, Sprinkle a small amount of boric acid in dark corners, cracks, and under floorboards and furniture.


Boric acid, also called hydrogen borate, is a white powder used for insecticidal, industrial, and other purposes. It is relatively non-toxic for adult humans, but it may pose a threat to children and pets.
The chemical is abrasive, cutting into the exterior of the wolf spider and causing it to leak bodily fluids. It also acts as a stomach poison. The spider gets it on its legs and ingests the poison as it grooms itself.

, Using pesticides around the foundation will create a barrier, preventing wolf spiders from crossing through.


Do not spray firewood piles. If you do, throw the firewood away afterward. It is unsafe to burn firewood treated with pesticides.

"
"
Place sticky traps around the house.,
Use an organic pesticide.,
Hunt wolf spiders down.If you plan on killing the spiders one-by-one, the best way to do so it to track them down by shining a flashlight in the darkest corners of your home at night.,
Trap wolf spiders in a container.,
Kill the spider with a broom.,
Wash spiders away.Use a strong jet stream from a garden hose to scare wolf spiders away outside.",How to Get Rid of Wolf Spiders4," Lay out a sticky trap in any area you suspect wolf spiders to be lurking in, paying close attention to dark, hidden corners.


These traps consist of little more than heavy cardboard with extremely sticky glue pasted on them. Wolf spiders and other pests get stuck on the glue as they step onto the trap. They become unable to move and die of starvation.
Place glue traps in the corners of basements and garages. The traps should also be placed beneath and behind furniture, as well as on both sides of any door that leads to the outside.
Keep these traps out of reach of small children and pets. Kids and pets could get stuck in these traps, and removing these traps can be a difficult process.

, Plant-based pesticides made with hexa-hydroxyl are generally effective against wolf spiders.These insecticides come as a dust or powder that can be sprinkled beneath furniture, in dark basement corners, and other dimly-lit areas.
Hexa-hydroxyl is also pet-safe and people-safe.

,


You can also track the spiders down outside by shining a flashlight into overgrowth, patches of woods, and dense shrubs.
Wolf spiders have discs located in the back of their eyes. These discs are reflective, enabling them to see at night. It will also reflect the light from your flashlight, making these spiders easy to track in the dark.

, When spotted, place a plastic container or cup over the spider and slide a heavy, firm piece of board beneath the cup, moving carefully to prevent the spider from being able to crawl out.


Release the spider outside as soon as possible. Make sure that you release it far away from the perimeter of your home so that it does not crawl back inside as soon as it is free.
Use a glove when trapping and picking up wolf spiders to reduce the risk of being bitten. While wolf spider venom is not usually toxic to humans, getting bitten can still sting considerably. It is also possible to have an allergic reaction to the venom, and wearing gloves will prevent a possible reaction from occurring.

, When you see a wolf spider, strike it with a standard broom to kill it.


You can also use a shoe or other solid object to squish the spider. Similarly, you can use a vacuum cleaner to suck the wolf spider up.
Since wolf spiders are rather large, you can usually kill the adults with a broom. Smaller spiders are more likely to slip through the bristles of the broom, making brooms less effective as a weapon.

,


Water will not kill a wolf spider, but a strong blast of it will be enough to scare it away and may deter the spider from coming back.
In addition to blasting any wolf spider you see with water, you should also spray beneath roof eaves, window ledges, patio and porch roofs, and decks.

Fragrance your house with spider repelling-scents.",How to Get Rid of Black Widow Spiders," Black widow spiders are found across the U.S and Canada, and in other temperate regions around the world. They are the most venomous spiders in North America. The female is the easiest to recognize -- and the most dangerous. She is coal-black, with a spherical abdomen and a red hourglass-shaped mark on her belly. Her body is approximately half an inch long, but she has a total length of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) with her legs extended.


The male is about half the size of the female and is brown or grey. He usually has several red dots on his abdomen and may have a yellow or red band across his back. Male black widow spiders are not venomous.
Young black widows, known as spiderlings, are white or yellow-white when they first hatch. They become darker as they grow. They may have yellow or red patches across their backs, resembling the adult male. It is impossible to tell male and female spiderlings apart. At this stage, both are harmless to humans.;
, The black widow spider is timid and reclusive, preferring to make its home in dark, protected areas, such as in boxes, among firewood and under ledges. It is nocturnal, actively hunting at night.


The black widow spider's web is usually located within a foot of the ground. It is slightly erratic in appearance and made with stronger silk than most other spider webs. The web is used to catch prey and to hang the female's cocoon of eggs.
Black widows are usually found in dark corners of the house or around the edges of a yard or garage where their webs will have a lesser chance of being disturbed. They may also be found under vehicles, even those that are being driven periodically. Check for webs near the tires, or under/around the engine.
Black Widows are territorial, so their webs are often spaced about a foot apart.

, Female Black Widow spiders have very powerful venom -- in fact, it is said to be15 times stronger than that of a rattlesnake. The venom is a neurotoxin. Symptoms include muscle aches, abdominal pain, breathing difficulties and nausea. The majority of Black Widow bites are easily treated. However, if medical treatment can not be administered on time, a Black Widow bite can lead to convulsions and death.


Black Widow spiders are not aggressive and will only bite as a defense mechanism. Most bites occur when the spider is accidentally disturbed or injured, and feels threatened.
Small children, the elderly and the infirm are much more susceptible to adverse reactions when bitten by a Black Widow. Medical treatment should be sought immediately.

, Another venomous spider which is slightly more common than the Black Widow is the Brown Recluse spider. These are harder to identify because they look like many other spider species, ranging in color from dark cream to brown. They are similar in size to the black widow and have a dark violin shaped mark on their back.


The venom of the Brown Recluse spider is not as strong as the Black Widow's, but their bite can lead to death.
The methods for getting rid of Brown Recluse spiders are the same as for the Black Widow, so you can target both species at once.

, Black Widow spiders are nocturnal, so they are inactive during the day. Daytime is the best time to locate all existing webs, so you can come back and kill the spiders once darkness falls. Look for the webs in dark, sheltered areas that are usually left undisturbed.


Indoors, look for webs in dark corners of closets, under the bed and in cluttered areas of the basement and attic. Outdoors, look for the webs under window ledges and door frames, in piles of firewood or stacked lumber and in close-growing vegetation.
Black Widow webs are disorganized and erratic looking. They are slightly funnel-shaped, giving the female Black widow a convenient place to hide during the day. Never intentionally disturb a web without protective clothing and a method of killing the spider.
Make a note of the location of each web, so you will be able to return to it later.

, Once you know the locations of the webs, there are a couple of things you can try to eliminate the spiders without actively killing them. Get your hands on a dust or liquid insecticide which you can spray or sprinkle on the webs and surrounding areas. These will kill the existing spiders upon contact, while also preventing new spiders from moving in.


Dust applications are best for out-of-the-way places where the dust won't be disturbed by anyone but the spiders. This includes attics, basements and crawl spaces. It can also be applied to wall voids, using a hand duster. Products such as Drione Dust and Delta Dust Insecticide are recommended.
Liquid spot treatments are usually purchased in powder form, which is then mixed with water to form a residual spray. This works best under and behind furniture, under beds, in storage spaces and any dark corners. Products such as Demon WP Insecticide and Cynoff EC are recommended.
Even though these products are very effective, they are not guaranteed to kill all of the spiders, so they are best used in combination with more active methods of elimination and to prevent new spiders from coming back.

, The most surefire way to kill the Black Widow spiders is to return to their webs at night -- armed with your weapon of choice -- and eliminate them yourself. It doesn't have to be the middle of the night, once the sun sets the spiders will be active and easy to find. Make sure to bring a powerful flashlight and to wear protective clothing, such as thick gloves and boots, as the spiders can be very quick when under threat and you want to expose as little skin as possible. Here are the best methods of killing the spiders:



Kill the spiders with insecticide. Using a non-residual spray insecticide is one of the quickest and easiest ways of killing Black Widow spiders. The spray must come in direct contact with the live spider, at which point it will quickly stun and kill it. These sprays are safe to use and will not leave harmful residues behind.

Squash the spiders. A more hands-on method of killing the spider is just to squash it. It may not be elegant but it's certainly effective. Just make sure to use a stick or shoe to avoid coming in too close contact with the spider, in case you miss. Black Widows may run toward you rather than away from you when under attack.

Vacuum the spiders. A vacuum with a hose attachments can be used to quickly suck up the spiders without the need to get too close. This method is obviously best for indoor webs and can be very effective for catching spiders in hard-to-reach places, as the suction will pull them out. Once you have vacuumed the spiders, take the vacuum bag out immediately, place it in a securely tied garbage bag and place it in the trash outside.

, In addition to killing the spiders, you will also need to eliminate the small, cylindrical egg sacs which can contain hundreds of baby Black Widows. You will find these attached to the web made by the female Black Widow. They are usually whitish-grey in color, as they are made from the same silk as the web.


The best bet for dealing with egg sacs is to spray them liberally with insecticide or to vacuum them up. Trying to crush or squash the egg sacs may release a flurry of tiny little baby spiders, which you will probably be unable to catch in time. If this happens, your spider infestation is likely to continue.

, If you are not careful enough in your exterminations, or simply unfortunate, and you are bitten by a Black Widow, do not panic. The bite will probably not be painful initially, but symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, muscle aches, dry mouth, increased body temperature, difficulty breathing and eyelid swelling may soon develop. The appropriate first aid response to a bite from a Black Widow is as follows:


Clean the area around the bite and immediately apply an ice pack to the area. If the bite is on the arm or leg, try to elevate it until it is level with the heart. These measures will slow down the spreading of the venom.
Seek medical treatment immediately. Black Widow bites can be relatively harmless, but only if adequate treatment is administered. Victims usually respond to an intravenous injection calcium gluconate or calcium salts. In more severe cases, a specialized antivenom may be administered.
If possible, try to collect the spider that bit you (alive or dead) in a small plastic bag or glass jar and bring it with you when seeking treatment. The species of the spider can then be confirmed by a spider expert, which may help medical professionals to decide on the best treatment.
You can call a Poison Center for more information.

, If you have found a large number of Black Widow spiders in your house or yard, it may be wise to call a professional exterminator who can effectively and efficiently eliminate the entire Black Widows population. This is particularly recommended if you have small children, elderly people or pets living with you, as these groups are more likely to be seriously affected by a bite.


If the spider infestation is large, or the spiders are nesting in hard to reach places, an exterminator will have the specialized equipment necessary to deal with this. They are also licensed to used stronger chemicals and insecticides than those available for residential use.
If you decide to go the exterminator route, try calling several pest control agencies first to ensure that they are adequately equipped to deal with Black Widow infestations. They should also be able to quote you a price based on the size of the infestation and the area of the space to be treated.

, Black Widow spiders like to be left undisturbed, which is why they often choose dark, neglected corners to hide out in. You can make your home much more unattractive to spiders by regularly giving your house a thorough clean, making sure that you get into every nook and cranny with a broom or vacuum cleaner. Keep secluded spaces dry and free from mold, as Black Widows love moisture.


Black Widows are often found under window ledges and around door frames. A good way to deal with this is by washing the outside of your house with a power hose. This will flush out any nasty creepy crawlies, especially from hard-to reach places like upper level windows.

, Built-up clutter provides a safe haven for spiders, which is why people are most frequently bitten when tackling long-overdue clean-ups, such as clearing boxes in storage areas or cleaning out closets. Leave spiders as few hiding places as possible by keeping all of your belongings well organized. Indoors, make sure to get rid of any old shoes, clothes or newspapers -- anything a spider might find refuge in. Outdoors:


Move firewood or other debris away from the foundation of the house. Spiders love making their homes in stacked up firewood, where it's dark and sheltered. However, when firewood is stacked against the house it makes it very easy for the spider to make a dash indoors, if it feels the urge. Remove this possibility by keeping firewood (or any other materials) stacked as far from your house as possible. Also, remember to wear thick gloves when carrying firewood indoors, to avoid being bitten.
Cut back vines, shrubs and other vegetation from the side of the building. Spiders often make their homes in close-growing vegetation, and vines or bushes growing on or near exterior walls are ideal. Unfortunately, vines also give these spiders easy access to windows and roof spaces, so they may be facilitating the spider's entrance to your home. Cut back any ivy, or bushes near the foundation of your house, and avoid letting garden grass grow too long.

, Despite the fact that Black Widows are relatively large spiders, they can still manage to squeeze through very small cracks. Make your home as spider-proof as possible by filling in as many holes and closing up as many spaces as you can find.


Before you seal up any exterior cracks, make sure to sprinkle some residual insecticide into the space. This will prevent any spiders from entering if the cracks open again in future.
Use a caulking gun and a tube of sealant to fill in and seal any cracks you find around the perimeter of your house. Pay special attention to areas around wires and cables, faucets and electrical outlets.
Make sure window and door screens are in good repair, and close up any holes or tears. Make sure the screens on any air vents are tightly fitted.
Attach weather stripping to the bottoms of all doors and windows and install door sweeps to all exterior facing doors.

, Incandescent light bulbs used in doorways attract all manner of flying insects and creepy crawlies, providing plenty of food for the Black Widow to catch in her web. You should consider changing your outdoor light bulbs from incandescent to yellow or sodium vapor varieties, as these are less attractive to insects, and therefore reduce the Black Widow's food source.


Another method of reducing the Black Widow's food supply is to place sticky traps for catching small insects and flies around your house, or use pesticides targeted at other insects. The scarcer the food, the less likely the Black Widow will be to make her home in your home.
However, it is advisable to leave other spider species (excluding the Brown Recluse) alone. This is because other spiders compete for food, and Black Widows prefer to settle in spaces where they are the only predator.

, Some people are averse to using chemicals around their home, especially if they have pets or small children around. Luckily, there are a couple of natural methods you can use to discourage Black Widows from coming too close:


Encourage wrens to live in your garden. Wrens are natural predators of bugs and spiders, including the Black Widow. You can encourage them to live in your garden by installing nest boxes and filling them with items such as bread crumbs, peanut butter and apple slices.
Scatter horse chestnuts. Some people believe that scattering horse chestnuts around your home, on windowsill and in tight corners is an effective way of keeping spiders out of your home. Chemical contained in horse chestnuts, known as saponin, repels spiders and keeps them away. This has not been scientifically proven, but many people swear by it.

, Another way to deter spiders is by using certain fragrances around your home, which Black Widows and other spiders are supposedly averse to. Again, this has not been scientifically proven, but it may be worth a shot!


Use lemon oil or lemon water. Black Widows are rumored to dislike the scent of lemon. Use a store-bought lemon cleaning product or make a more natural alternative by mixing a few drops of lemon essential oil with some water. Spray either of these around your house, particularly into dark corners and around window sills.
Peppermint or spearmint oil. Another scent that repels spiders is mint -- peppermint or spearmint. Place sprigs of mint around your home or place a few drops of mint essential oils in a diffuser.
Keep eucalyptus around your home. Plant a eucalyptus shrub in your garden and break off small sprigs to place around your home. The scent wards off Black Widows.

Watch for webs during your daily cleaning.,
Remove webs using a vacuum.,
Use a soft duster with a handle for hard-to-reach places.,
Use duct tape and a paint roller on speckled ceilings.,
Spray down windows and window screens.,
Double check hard-to-reach spots of your home for webs and egg sacs.",How to Get Rid of Spider Webs1," Spider webs should be removed as you see them. This can help spiders from infesting your home. As you move through your day-to-day cleaning, be on the lookout for webs. Make a note of any webs you see to clean later on.;
, The best means to remove spider webs is by simply using a vacuum. A handheld vacuum would be easiest to maneuver. However, if you don't have a handheld vacuum you can also use a vacuum with an extension nozzle.









Simply use the nozzle or handheld vacuum to suck up any webs you see. If webs are stuck in, you may have to go over the area quite a few times.If you notice any cobwebs on furniture or curtains, vacuum over them. Then, use a lint roller to remove any leftover bits of web.Be sure to check under furniture. Some types of spiders may make webs in dark areas. Once a week, flip over your couches, chairs, tables, and other items of furniture to check for webs. If you notice any webs, vacuum them up.

, Some places may be difficult to reach with a vacuum cleaner. Any nooks or crannies you cannot reach with a vacuum can be cleaned using a soft duster with a handle. If you don't have one, use a rubber band to secure an old sock to the end of a yard stick or ruler. You can then use this tool to remove webs.







, Speckled ceilings, also known as popcorn ceilings, can be difficult to clean. Spider webs on these kinds of ceilings can be frustrating to remove. Using duct tape can be a good trick. Take a regular paint roller and wrap duct tape around it, with the sticky side of the tape facing outward. Then, roll this over your speckled ceiling in order to remove cobwebs. It may take a few rolls to get the webs out completely.







, Spiders often make webs in the corners of windows, settling between the screen and window. If you want to remove spider webs from these places, follow guidelines often used for cleaning older windows. Spray down the window and screen with water. You can use either a hose or a spray bottle.









If you're spraying from outside, a garden hose with a spray nozzle attached can be sprayed onto the window. You can spray into the screen, aiming at the unwanted spider webs. If you're spraying inside, just use a standard spray bottle.Remove the screen and use a smaller spray bottle to dislodge any remaining spider webs. From there, clean the windows with your chosen cleaning supplies. You can use window sprays you would buy at a local department store or simply use soap and water. Clean the window thoroughly, making sure to remove any remaining residue from the spider webs.To prevent reoccurrence, replace screens that have cracks and tears in them. This will stop spiders from getting into your home to begin with.

, Go over the nooks and crannies in your home. Double check for spider webs or infestations in these places. If you live in an area where poisonous spiders are a hazard, you want to make sure your home is free of webs. The best way of preventing spider infestations is catching them before they start."

Treat doorways with pyrethrin spray.,
Kill flies directly with pyrethrin spray.,
Use insecticide fly bait.",How to Get Rid of Flies in the House2," Pyrethrin is a relatively safe natural insecticide derived from chrysanthemum flowers. There are also synthetic forms made from the same chemicals as the naturally-occurring substance, called pyrethroids.Spraying doorways can help deter flies from entering your home., In addition to treating doorways, you can also spray pyrethrin directly on flies to kill them quickly. However, take care not to use pyrethrin products around food or in food-preparation areas. Although pyrethrin is relatively safe, it can still be harmful to humans and pets if ingested or inhaled in large quantities.Follow manufacturer safety instructions carefully., A variety of commercial fly baits are available on the market. Flies eat the baits and are poisoned by the insecticidal ingredients. Baits can be purchased in the form of pre-baited traps, pellets, or liquid solutions that can be applied to areas where flies like to gather.A popular form of fly bait is the Ortho Home Defense Fly Killer Window Decal. These decals are affixed to glass windows. Flies eat the pesticide coating on the decal and die, typically on or near the windowsill.
Fly baits can be dangerous to pets and children, so be sure to follow manufacturer safety instructions and use them in places that your kids and pets can’t easily reach.

Make sure they don’t have access to food, garbage, or compost in your house.Store human and pet food in the fridge or in tightly sealed containers.
Wash dishes immediately after use.
Clean up any spilled food as soon as you notice it.
Dispose of food waste in a covered garbage can or a sink disposal.

, Keep garbage and compost in well-sealed containers, and take out the garbage frequently. Check for signs of pupae or maggots underneath garbage container lids and liners. Occasionally wash your garbage and compost containers with hot, soapy water., If you have cats, change the kitty litter frequently. Diaper bins can also be a major attraction for flies. Take out any garbage containing human or animal waste as quickly as possible., Clean under and around your fridge and other kitchen appliances, especially in areas where condensation gathers, with warm, soapy water.After cleaning up these areas, thoroughly rinse and wring out any mops, sponges, or cleaning rags that you used, and hang up mops and rags to dry. Flies can also breed in wet and dirty mops and rags.

, Built up organic material in drains can attract certain species of flies. Use a plunger or drain cleaning tool to clear organic material out of clogged or slow drains, then clean the drain with a stiff brush.Chlorine bleach and commercial drain cleaners like Drano are not typically effective for eliminating fly infestations in drains.
If scrubbing is not enough, try an antibacterial drain cleaner like Bio-Clean. Make sure you select a product that is compatible with your septic system. These products typically need to be re-applied several times over a period of a few weeks in order to be effective.

Prepare a mixture of bleach and water.,
Survey your home for webs.,
Put on protective gear.,
Spray the webs.,
Store leftover bleach safely.,
Spray bleach inside.",How to Get Rid of Spider Webs2," You can also use a combination of bleach and water to address spider webs. This is best used for live webs rather than cobwebs. This will get rid of spider eggs and kill any spiders still living in them.









You can buy bleach at a local department store or online. Make sure to read any instructions provided before use. Always dilute bleach with water to the levels recommended on the container. For most homes, one gallon of bleach is all you'll need.If you're spraying bleach outside, you'll need to purchase some kind of bleach sprayer. You can do so online or at a local department store. You also may need a garden hose or adjustable spray nozzle.If you're bleaching in your home, a big sprayer might have too much force. You can simply mix bleach and water in a small handheld spray bottle. Make sure to wear protective gloves when handling bleach. It can be corrosive to skin.Always mix bleach with hot water, not lukewarm or cold water. Never mix bleach with other household chemicals., Before you begin the process, survey your home for webs. This will help you determine where you need to spray or wash.


When spraying outside, you should spray in 10 to 15 square foot sections. Look for areas that contain spider webs and decide how to break your home into sections.Watch out for things like exterior light fixtures or electronic components of your house. You should make sure you don't damage such areas of your home with bleach. You can try to manually remove spiders with a cleaning brush if you notice webs in such areas., As bleach can be harmful to skin and eyes, you'll need to put on protective gear before you begin spraying. You should have protective clothing, goggles, and gloves., Pump the sprayer towards areas infected by spider webs. Your sprayer's settings should allow you to spray bleach somewhere between a solid stream and a gentle mist. You might want to test the sprayer on sidewalk or cement before using it on your home.








Apply a generous amount of bleach water to any areas you notice that contain eggs or webs. As you notice the webs and sacks loosening, spray another layer of bleach and water.If webs are stuck on hard, use a cleaning brush to manually remove them., Once you've sprayed down any webs you found in your home, store the leftover bleach safely. Keep it in a secure container away from children and animals. Manufacturer's instructions should provide details on how to store or dispose of bleach safely.







, When cleaning with bleach in your home, make sure to let the bleach sit for a minute after spraying it on a web or infested area. Then, wipe the web or egg sacs away with a towel and spray on another layer of bleach. It's best to let the bleach air dry after applying it rather than recontaminating the area with a towel.








Keep children and pets away from areas in your home that you bleached recently.
If you feel dizzy, open the windows to provide ventilation.

Try sprays.,
Use essential oils.,
Look into insecticides.,
Try out an electronic repellant.,
Get professional help, if necessary.",How to Get Rid of Spider Webs3," If you have a spider infestation in your home, basic spider killer sprays can be purchased to treat the infection. These are usually used outside the home. You spray the perimeters of your home, as well as any cracks or crevices spiders may use to enter your house.Choose a spray at a local department store. You should know the basic build of your home before going in so you know what sprays are safe for your house.
Go around the perimeter of your home. Spray around the house's foundation. Also, look for potential entryways for spiders. Pay special attention to cracks in windowsills and garage entryways.Specifics regarding safe use depend on the type of spray you're using. The bottle or package should provide safety instructions. Always read these carefully before using any spider sprays.

, If you're wary about using chemicals around your home, essential oils can help. Try creating a mixture using essential oils and see if you notice a difference.









Spiders tend to dislike the taste of essential oils. You can purchase essential oils online or at a local health store. For best effect, use neem oil and tea tree oil.Mix about two tablespoons of dish soap into warm water. Then, add 5 drops of tea tree oil and an ounce of neem oil.Sprinkle this mixture around your home in areas where you've noticed spiders.Be careful, however. Make sure you do not leave the spray close to children or pets. Tea tree oil can be harmful if swallowed.

, There are a variety of insecticides you can use to ward off spiders. Stop by your local hardware store and review your options.









Dust insecticides are best used if you're treating cracks and crevices. They can be easily applied to hard-to-reach places in your home.Powder insecticides work best for spot treatment. If you've only seen spiders in a few spots in your home, consider a powder insecticide.If you're trying to create a boundary around your home, look into a liquid insecticide. They are usually mixed with water and then used to cover large areas around the home.As always, make sure to carefully review safety instructions of any products you buy prior to use.

, Many people feel more comfortable with electronic repellants as they don't involve spraying your home. Electronic repellents generate electromagnetic waves that repel spiders and other pests. You can find them online or at a hardware store. Read product reviews carefully before making a purchase, however, to make sure the repellent works for most people.







, If you have a serious spider infestation, you may not be able to treat it on your own. In this case, you should hire a professional exterminator. You should be especially proactive about this if you live in an area where poisonous spiders are common.

Grab an empty soda bottle.,
Cut the top off from the bottle.,
Flip the cut piece over.,
Join the two cut edges of the bottle parts together.,
Create a melted sugar mixture.,
Spoon the liquid into the funneled end of the bottle.,
Use another type of bait.,
Add in vinegar.,
Put the bottle in a sunny spot.,
Repeatedly breathe into the bottle.,
Throw the bottle away.",How to Make a Fly Trap1," This can be one that is used, or simply pour out the soda. Make sure that all the soda has been removed and that it has been washed out with warm water., Use a pair of scissors. Poke a hole through the bottle using one of the blades on the scissors. Do this right where the funnel of the soda bottle ends, and where the large shaft begins (near the middle of the bottle).After you have poked the hole in the bottle, insert your scissors and cut around the bottle. Cut off the entire top funnel, so that what you have left are two separated pieces: funnel (top) and shaft (bottom).
Try to cut as close to the edge of the funnel as possible, otherwise when you flip the funnel upside-down it won't stay in place.
You can also use a sharp knife to cut the top funnel off, but make sure not to cut yourself. If you are doing this project with your kids, it is better to use a safe pair of scissors.

, Stick it into the bottom half of the bottle. If you cut close enough to the edge of the funnel, it should stick inside as you slide it in.

, The simplest and most effective way is to staple the edges together. Simply staple three or four times around the bottle, equidistant from one another.If this project is done with children, an adult should staple the two parts together. If you do not have a stapler, the following two options work fine as well.
Tape is another good option, but make sure that the tape is water resistant. Apply three or four pieces of tape around the funnel.
If you wish to use superglue, or regular glue, that will also have to be water resistant. Before you add the funnel, apply a thin layer of glue around the top inside of the base. Then insert the funnel upside-down. Use your fingers and press the funnel with the base. Hold the two pieces into place until it is dry.

, Pour five tablespoons of sugar into a pot. Place the pot on a stovetop. Flatten sugar so that it lies evenly across the bottom of the pot.Pour in enough water to cover the top of the sugar. Slowly heat the mixture on medium-high heat until it boils.
Stir the mixture well. Dissolving sugar in hot/warm tap water makes sweet water but boiling makes ""syrup"", a more concentrated attractant. Let the liquid sit until it goes from hot to warm.

, Try and drip it down the edges of the funnel so that when the flies come towards the funnel, they will stick right from the start.

, You can slice up some apple chunks, and push them through the bottom of the funnel. A piece of raw meat will work as well, as does a few tablespoons of old wine. You can also simply add in water mixed with either sugar or honey.

, If your bait of choice is a liquid, add in a few teaspoons of vinegar, preferably white vinegar. This will help keep bees and other unwanted insects away from the trap., This will help the fruit/meat to rot and thereby increase the likelihood of flies smelling the bait. It will also cause liquid mixtures to evaporate, thereby creating a pheromone, drawing the flies towards the trap. Marvel at your new fly trap as it catches flies.

, This will improve your results because insects are attracted to heat and carbon dioxide. You can also rub the bottle in between your two hands to create more heat.

, After you see that flies begin to accumulate, throw the bottle away, and create another one. Eventually the effects of your bait will be used up, and you will have to start again. If you try to empty the bottle, it will be hard because flies/bait will get stuck to the inside of the funnel. You also do not want to have to handle dead flies with your hands.

Make a trap from a plastic bottle.,
Make a trap using a glass jar and plastic wrap.,
Use flypaper.,
Make your own flypaper.",How to Catch Flies1," One of the most effective homemade fly traps is made using a simple plastic water bottle.


Unscrew and remove the cap, then use scissors to pierce the plastic and cut off the top quarter of the bottle.
Fill the bottom part of the bottle with a quarter cup (60 mL) of sugar, a quarter cup (60 mL) of water, and a couple of drops of blue food colouring. The blue colour helps to attract flies, but most colours or no colours will attract flies as long as it isn't yellow. Yellow is found to be the only repellent colour for flies. . Alternatively, a little water mixed with dish soap and a few drops of apple cider vinegar will also attract flies.
Take the top quarter of the bottle, turn it upside down and rest it on top of the other part of the bottle to form a funnel. The flies will be able to crawl into the bottle, but will find it much harder to find their way out.
Place the fly trap in a sunny spot that is frequented by flies and wait for them to collect inside the bottle.;
, If you don't have any plastic bottles lying around, you can make another homemade fly trap using a simple glass jar (or even a drinking glass) and some plastic wrap.


Take your glass jar and fill it almost to the top with sugar water or a solution of sugar dissolved in apple cider vinegar with a squirt of dish soap.
Take a square of plastic wrap and use it to cover the opening of the glass jar. Use a rubber band to secure it if it feels loose.
Use a pen or scissors to poke a small hole into the center of the plastic wrap. This will allow the fly to enter the jar, but once it gets inside, it will drown in the liquid.Place your trap in a sunny spot, outside, or a place where you have seen many flies.

, Flypaper is a type of sticky paper which you can hang around your home to catch flies with minimal effort.


The paper is coated in a sweet, sticky (and sometimes toxic) substance which attracts flies and causes them to stick. Flypaper may look unsightly in the home, but it is a very effective method of catching flies.

, Although you can buy your own flypaper at most home supple stores, you can make your own non-toxic version using a brown bag, maple syrup and sugar:


Cut the brown paper bag into one-inch wide strips.
Use a pen to poke a hole at the top of each strip and thread a little string or twine through to form a loop.
In a wide pan or bowl, mix half a cup (120 mL) of maple syrup, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) white sugar, and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of brown sugar.
Place the strips of paper into the mixture (dangling the string over the edge) and leave them to soak for several hours or overnight.
Remove the strips from the mixture and hold them above a sink until they stop dripping. Then hang them indoors or outdoors, or wherever you have a problem with flies."

Cup your hand.,
Wait for the fly to land.,
Wave your cupped hand over the fly.",How to Catch Flies2," The first step in catching a fly is to take your dominant hand and bend it into a cup shape.


Practice quickly shutting your fingertips against the heel of your hand.
Make sure to leave a hollow space inside, as this is where you will trap the fly.
Be careful. If you shut your hand too tightly, or make a fist, you will simply crush the fly. If you don't mind that the fly dies, then this won't be a problem.

, When catching a fly with your bare hands, it's best to wait until the fly lands on a flat surface, such as a table or counter top.


Move slowly towards the fly. Any sudden movements can set the fly off and you will have to wait for it to land again.
Waiting until the fly lands on a stable surface makes it easier to predict the fly's movements.
Make sure the surface is clutter-free, as you don't want to knock anything over in your fly-catching attempts.

, Once the fly lands, take your cupped hand and wave it a couple of inches above the fly, closing it, just like you practiced, as you wave your hand.


As the fly senses your hand movement, it will get spooked and fly straight upwards and directly into your cupped hand.As soon as it enters your hand, close your hand quickly to trap the fly inside. Now you are free to release the fly outdoors, place it into a jar for your inspection, or feed it to a pet.

Wait for the fly to land.,
Place the cup over the fly.,
Slide the paper beneath the cup.",How to Catch Flies3," To catch a fly using this method you will need a cup, preferably a clear plastic one which you can see inside of and which will not break, and a sheet of paper or large index card.


The cup will trap the fly while the card helps to keep the cup closed and the fly from escaping.

, It will be much easier to catch the fly once it has landed on a stable surface, such as a table top, kitchen counter or window pane.


Move slowly towards the fly. Any sudden movements can set the fly off and you will have to wait for it to land again.

, Once the fly lands, quickly and stealthily place the cup over it, trapping it inside. If you miss, follow it around until it lands again.

, Once the fly is in the cup, you are faced with the dilemma of how to lift the cup from the flat surface without letting the fly escape. Your sheet of paper or large index card can solve this problem.


Be sure to keep the cup close to the table when you're sliding your paper beneath the cup. Too big if a gap and your fly could escape.

Set a trap with dish soap.,
Mix a natural fly repellent in a spray bottle.,
Plant herbs to repel flies.,
Outsmart flies with plastic bags full of water.",How to Get Rid of Flies1," Pour 1 inch (2.54 cm) of liquid dish soap into a jar and add 1 inch (2.54 cm) of water. The flies will be attracted to the soap and drown in the water.


Use fruit flavored dish soap for best results. An apple scented soap or lemon soap may provide better results, for example.
Add a drop or two of apple cider vinegar if you do not seem to be catching many flies. The vinegar will attract flies to the jar.;
, Flies will stay away from the scent of cayenne pepper. Mix a little in a spray bottle with water.


Spray the cayenne mixture in doorways, window sills and other cracks and corners where flies might try to come in. The smell of the cayenne will keep them out.

, They do not like scents such as lavender, basil and mint. Set up an herb garden in your kitchen or window sills to keep flies out.


Use marigolds if you prefer flowers to herbs. Marigolds are offensive to flies.

, The way the bags and water reflect light will resemble a spider's web, and flies always try to avoid those.


Fill clear plastic bags halfway with water. Seal the bags and hang them near doors and windows.
Hang old CDs and DVDs to achieve the same light effect.

Purchase flypaper.,
Consider a fly light.",How to Get Rid of Flies2," This can be found at hardware stores, department stores and home improvement retailers. Flies will stick to the paper and be unable to fly away.


Remove the flypaper and discard it when too many flies begin to accumulate. Not only will it cease to be useful, a crowded strip of flypaper often looks unattractive.

, You can buy a special light that keeps flies away from your kitchen or home. Many restaurants use this type of device.

Keep all of your trash sealed.,
Throw out fruits and vegetables before they get too old to eat.,
Clean your floors, countertops and other surfaces thoroughly.,
Check your sealing and insulation.",How to Get Rid of Flies3," Flies are attracted to garbage, especially any decaying food.

, Whenever possible, keep them in the refrigerator instead of out in the kitchen.

, Be sure not to leave crumbs or spills.

, Doors and windows should be closed and sealed to prevent flies and other insects from coming in.

Choose the type of trap you will use.,
Put your trap in the right place.,
Use a lethal trap instead.,
Choose the right bait.,
Pick the right sugary foods.,
Bait the raccoon trap.,
Entice the raccoon to the trap.,
Check the trap.,
Remove the raccoon.,
Prevent the raccoon from coming back.",How to Trap Raccoons," The most common traps used to bait raccoons are 1-door traps or 2-door traps. The bait is positioned differently for each. Set the trap in a stable area.This trap entices the animal into the cage with food. There is a trip pan that will trigger the door shut when the animal steps on it.Place the bait behind the trigger plate in a 1-door trap. You don’t want the bait to be close to the trap walls or the raccoon might swipe the bait from outside the trap. Professionals like 1-door traps because it’s easier for large animals to enter them.In a 2-door trap, place the bait right behind the trigger or bury it under the trigger. Or you could hang it from the top of the trap. The trap should be at least 32-inches long.;
, You want to put your trap in an area where a raccoon has already caused damage or, if you know where the raccoon lives, near its living spot.


You are most likely to find raccoons in covered areas. They like to nestle in places like attics, porches, woodpiles, tree hollows, and underneath structures.
Secure the trap. The raccoon might try to knock the trap over. You can prevent this by securing your trap. To do this, put a brick or weight on the top of the trap.

, Hopefully, you won't need to kill the animal. A live cage trap is the most common approach. However there are some states that won’t let you trap and release a raccoon.Paw hold traps will clamp down on the animal’s paw by holding it. They have a small snapping clamp device. Once caught, the animal is usually killed by shooting it.
Again, though, check your local laws. You could always hire a wildlife expert to find the most lawful, humane way to get rid of your raccoon nuisance.

, Raccoons will eat many things. They are known as eaters who choose food based on opportunity. There are a few things they like most, though.


Raccoons are drawn by foods that are high in fat or sugar. The best: sugary foods. Raccoons love them.
The caution is that these foods could attracted other wildlife, so use such foods within a live raccoon trap.

, Some foods that raccoons like are marshmallows, watermelon, sweet corn, and bacon.


In fact, some trappers say marshmallows draw raccoons the best of all! Raccoons also are drawn to wet cat food, fish in a can, bacon, and cooked fatty meat, like chicken legs., Once you’ve chosen the bait, you have to place it correctly in the trap itself. Change bait every two days for the best results. You could also set multiple traps.


You want to make sure the raccoon enters the trap completely, including its full body and tail. So place the bait far enough back to entice the raccoon to do this.
You want to place the bait so the raccoon will step on the trigger. In a trap, this means the raccoon will step on the metal plate.

, Drop a trail of bait that leads right up to your trap to increase the chances the raccoon will enter your trap.


Make sure you wear gloves when you apply the bait because raccoons can sense human scent.
In fact, it’s a good idea to use the gloves whenever you handle the trap, including once you catch the raccoon.

, You need to check your raccoon trap on a regular basis. It’s wrong to leave any animal trapped for a long time.


You might catch a raccoon in a few minutes. Or it could take a couple of days.
The trapped animal is going to be scared and frightened. It’s more humane to not leave it for days on end in a trap.

, Now you’ve caught the raccoon. What do you do next? The humane approach is to relocate the animal. But this could be illegal in your state. Check with your local government.


Speak softly to the raccoon as you approach. Be gentle. This will calm the animal. Drape a cloth over the trap to instill further calm.
Hold the cage away from your body. Wear heavy gloves. When relocating the raccoon, take it at least 5 miles away from your property, and release it. Be cautious. Raccoons can be dangerous. Consult an animal professional if you’re at all unsure.

, You will want to rid your property of the lures that attracted the raccoon in the first place.


Raccoons are drawn to garbage, so remove it frequently. Wash your garbage cans. Eliminate all food and water sources for a raccoon. Put tight-fitting lids on your garbage cans.
Fix broken vents and screens. Close windows. Close gates and eliminate gaps in fences. Raccoons sometimes enter homes through fireplaces.

Choose a tall jar, wine bottle, old soda bottle or vase to serve as the base of the trap.,
Add fruit fly bait.,
Roll a piece of paper to create a funnel and put it on the container.,
Set the trap in a fruit fly-infested area.,
Kill the trapped fruit flies.,
Repeat until the trap remains empty.",How to Get Rid of Fruit Flies1," Almost any jar will work in a pinch.


This method is probably the most effective, efficient way to trap a larger number of fruit flies. ;
, Fruit flies feed on anything sugary, so you have a lot of options at your disposal. Any type of fruit, juice, soda, or other sweet item will provide a great incentive for fruit flies to fly into your trap.Try one of these bait ideas ranked from most to least effective:


Chopped up pieces of over ripe or rotting fruit. For example, a few slices of bruised banana, a soft strawberry or squishy peach will work great.
Honey, maple syrup or corn syrup.
Any flavor of fruit juice or soda. Make sure to use the regular kind; diet soda won't work.
Apple cider vinegar or soy sauce.
The dregs from a wine or beer bottle can work in a pinch. Fruit flies are attracted to the sugars in alcoholic beverages.

, A funnel with a small hole will allow the flies to enter the jar, but they won't be smart enough to fly back out. Tape the funnel so that it keeps its shape. Rest the funnel inside the mouth of the container so that the narrow side is pointing down. The tip of the funnel should not touch the bait.


Any piece of scrap paper or a page ripped from a magazine can easily be made into a paper funnel.
You can also make a funnel by using a toothpick to poke a hole in the bottom of a coffee filter.

, Put it near the kitchen sink, the garbage can, or the fruit bowl. If you're dealing with fruit flies in multiple parts of the kitchen, you might want to make more traps to set out.


Leave the traps out overnight. By the next day, you should see fruit flies happily eating the bait.If you didn't trap any flies, try new bait and make sure the hole is big enough to let the flies into the trap.

, Pour a mixture of warm water and dish soap into the container. The soap works to reduce the surface tension of the water and cause the flies to drown. Wait a minute or two, then discard the contents of the jar.


If the trap is still buzzing with fruit flies, take the trap outside before removing the funnel.
Rinse the jar thoroughly with hot water when you're finished. You can reuse it to make a new trap.

, Fruit flies tend to multiply quickly. Their life cycle can be as short as eight days.It's likely that you'll have to repeat the trapping process several times to fully rid your kitchen of adult fruit flies.


Fruit fly eggs hatch eight to ten days after they are laid, so you may need to use the trapping process every day for a week or two.You can stop when you no longer see flies in your trap after leaving it out for several hours.
To fully rid your kitchen of fruit flies as fast as possible, take measures to get rid of the eggs, too.

Buy a large steel cage.,
Place the trap in the area the possum frequents.,
Bait the trap.,
Check the trap frequently.",How to Trap a Possum1," Because possums can grow to be the size of a large cat, i.e., two to three feet long and four to 15 pounds, you will need to buy a large, steel cage trap. These traps are also known as raccoon traps. Buy a cage that is about 30 to 40 inches (.762 to 1 meter) in length and 12 inches (.305 meters) in height. Visit your local hardware store to purchase a trap cage.Most traps come in one or two-door models. It is recommended that you buy a one-door model. One-door models offer better bait protection and are better at catching larger animals.;
, The best location for the trap is near the possum’s den. However, if you don’t know where the possum’s den is, then place the trap in the area where you have noticed the most activity or damage, like near garbage cans. Because possums are nocturnal marsupials, place the trap in the designated area just before nightfall.If the possum is living in your attic or garage, place the trap in the center of the space.






If the possum lives underneath your house, or in a crawlspace or in a tree’s hollow, place the trap three to five feet outside of the entrance.






Remember to place the trap on an even surface. Place a brick on top of the trap to keep it steady and to prevent the possum from flipping it over.







, Because possums are omnivores, almost any type of bait will work. However, try to choose bait that will only attract possums and not other animals, like cats. Apples, aniseed oil on bread, marshmallows, and other sweet breads are good examples of bait that will only attract possums.Using a small amount of food, create a trail that will lead to the trap.






Make sure to position the food in a way that will force the possum to step on the trigger plate, which will close the trap door. For example, make sure the possum has to step on the trigger plate to get to the food.






If the food gets stuck between the trigger plate and the bottom of the cage, the trap door will not close.







, Check the trap every morning after you set it. You do not want the possum to be stuck in the trap for more than a day. This can cause the possum to become hungry and thirsty, and thus, anxious and aggressive. They are also more vulnerable to predators if they are trapped for long periods of time.If your trap is still empty in the morning, close the trap to avoid catching day time animals, like cats and squirrels.

Identify the problem areas.,
Dry all the drain areas before going to bed.,
Place a strip of clear tape over each drain.,
Check the tape in the morning or after a few days.,
Clean the hair catcher, if applicable.,
Moisten the drain, if necessary.,
Use a metal pipe brush.Work a metal pipe brush into the drain, extending it as far down into the drain as possible.,
Fish out other grime with a plumbing snake.,
Pour a gel drain cleaner into the drain.,
Finish up with a plunger.After the drain cleaner has sat in the sink for several hours, flush it through with plenty of water.,
Use a fly swatter to kill adult flies.,
Apply a space spray.,
Keep the drains clean.,
Apply insect growth regulator.",How to Get Rid of Drain Flies," Examine all the drains in your home and any area inside or outside the home that has standing water. Any area with multiple drain flies is likely a problem.


Luckily, drain flies do not stray far from the place they have chosen to make their home, so it is rare for a drain fly infestation to spread to all areas of the house. This is especially true if you catch the problem early.;
, This is the first thing you must do to verify that the problem is coming from the drain itself.


You might actually be infested by another type of fly drawn in by rotting fruit or other food sources. As a result, you should verify that you actually have drain flies in your drain before taking measures to remove them.

, Stick the tape over the center of each drain with the sticky side facing down.Do not completely cover the drain with tape. A covered drain will prevent flies from flying up, leaving you with no evidence.

, If you spot flies on the tape after removing it from the drain, drain flies are the most likely culprit.


Even if you do not find any drain flies on the tape after the first night, you should repeat this process for at least four nights to account for discrepancies in the breeding cycle.

, Remove the hair catcher or filter from an affected shower drain and clean it out thoroughly, removing all the hair tangled inside it.


The key in destroying the drain fly's breeding ground is removing all hair, grime, and debris that the flies might lay their eggs in.

, Pour 1 to 2 gallons (4 to 8 liters) of warm water into the drain to moisten it slightly.


Note that this is only needed if the drain is not used on a regular basis. Drains used on a daily basis are moist enough without taking additional measurements.

,


Twist the brush while slowly moving it up and down to remove grime from the sides of the pipe.

, Insert a plumbing snake into the drain and twist it through the pipes to pull out clumps of grime that lie further down.

, Apply roughly 4 oz (125 ml) of the cleaner around the edge of the drain.


Applying the cleaner to the edge of the drain allows it to coat the sides of the drain and pipe as it glides down.
Gel cleaners are formulated to remove organic matter. You could also use enzyme or bacterial drain cleaners to remove organic material.Vinegar, boiling water, and bleach are traditional remedies for getting rid of drain flies, but many experts insist that these methods are not effective.
Baking soda and vinegar poured down the drain may kill the flies; it will clean the drain at least.
You may need to repeat the same dosage of drain cleaner once a day for five to seven days total.

, Use a plunger to remove any remaining organic matter trapped in the sink.

, Go to the drain area and squash as many of the drain flies as possible with a standard fly swatter.


While destroying the breeding grounds will prevent the flies from laying more eggs, you'll still have to deal with adult drain flies up to 20 days after you clean the drains. As such, you may want to take extra measures to get rid of as many as possible.

, If a fly swatter is inefficient, treat the infested area with an insect spray that works in confined spaces.


Close all the doors and windows in the space.
Spray the insect poison upward for 5 to 8 seconds per 1000 cubic feet (305 cubic meters).
Leave the treated area and keep it closed for 15 minutes or more.
Open all windows and doors after returning to the area. Run an electric fan, if possible, to help disperse any remaining spray.
Reapply as often as once every week.

, You should clean the drains in your house at least once every month, but if you've already had problems with drain flies, you may want to increase this to once every one or two weeks.


A thorough cleaning is not necessary. Simply pour 4 oz (125 ml) of gel drain cleaner into the drain and let sit to maintain a continual state of cleanliness.
For drains that are rarely used, such as in a garage or basement, pour a little mineral oil down the drain. This will prevent further infestations until water is run down the drain.

, Spray an aerosol IGR directly inside the drain and along the drain lines.


IGR prevents drain flies from breaking out of the larvae stage. Since flies only breed once they enter the adult stage, this greatly reduces the number of flies breeding, thereby cutting down on future infestations.

Start by getting a large or medium bowl.,
Add sweet bait to the bottom of a medium or large bowl.,
Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.,
Poke numerous small holes in the plastic with a fork or another implement.,
Set the trap in a fruit fly-infested area and leave the trap out overnight.,
Dispose of the trapped fruit flies.",How to Get Rid of Fruit Flies2," Although not quite as effective as the paper funnel method, this method utilizes the same approach: lure the fruit flies into the trap with a small opening and make it hard for them to exit.

, The type of bait doesn't matter as much as the quantity; you probably want at least an inch of sweet liquid covering the bottom of the bowl. Here are some suggestions for sweet concoctions that work well as bait:


Put a piece of old, skinless fruit, such as an orange or a banana, along with some balsamic vinegar in a bowl.
Experiment with a mix of white wine and coriander seeds. This mixture seems to work well. Add a bit of white wine vinegar to make the concoction even more pungent.
A mix of honey, sugar, and balsamic vinegar also works in a pinch.

, Use a large sheet of plastic wrap to completely cover the bowl. Try to get the plastic wrap as taught as possible.

, Try to keep the holes as small as possible; large holes can let the flies escape back out again. The point is to lure the fruit flies into the bowl and make it extremely hard to get back out.


If using a fork makes the holes in the plastic wrap too big, try switching to a sharp toothpick in order to prick small holes in the plastic wrap.

, Come the next day, you should see fruit flies caught inside the plastic wrap, happily feasting on the bait. If you haven't managed to trap any flies, check to make sure the holes in your plastic wrap aren't too big.

, It's probably best to take the trap outside before killing the fruit flies so that any escapees don't reinfest your kitchen. Take off the plastic wrap and kill the fruit flies inside by pouring a mixture of warm water and dish soap into the container. The soap works to reduce the surface tension of the water and cause the flies to drown. Wait a minute or two, then discard the contents of the jar.


When you're finished flushing the fruit flies, rinse the jar with hot water and reuse it to make a new trap.

"
Make fruit fly spray.,
Use pyrethrin spray.,
Treat your drain with gel.,
Try a professional-grade treatment.",How to Get Rid of Fruit Flies3," Fill a fine misting spray bottle with 70% rubbing alcohol. Spray it on the hovering fruit flies. They'll fall to the floor and you can sweep them up and dispose of them. You can also spray 91% rubbing alcohol in the air and to saturate any eggs. This stronger alcohol kills them immediately and serves as a very effective disinfectant. The stronger alcohol option can cost as much as .50-$1.00 more per container. It is much more powerful than traditional 70% rubbing alcohol . One should take precautionary measures such as ventilating the area and wearing gloves. 91% rubbing alcohol is far less poisonous, caustic, or dangerous than an insecticide or pesticide. Windex is another instant killer of most small bugs. If you find a patch of fruit flies in an area you are willing to get wet, give them a few quick sprays of Windex and watch them suffer.
Another spray method is to use Clorox cleaning spray. Wipe down surfaces and dead flies afterwards. However, you'll need to ventilate the room you're spraying because the smell can be somewhat overwhelming; not recommended if you're worried about toxic indoor air or you're spraying near food preparation surfaces.
You can even use a fine mist bottle to spray mobs of flies with plain water; they will drop to the surface below. Because their wings are damp, they will be momentarily unable to fly, so you can easily squash them and clean them up.

, Pyrethrin is an insecticide that effectively kills adult fruit flies, but not their eggs. Be sure to use it according to the instructions. Avoid directly spraying it over fruit or in food preparation areas.This product comes in an aerosol can that can be used to spray fruit flies as you see them. It kills them on contact.
You can buy an automatic pyrethrin dispenser to deal with high volumes of fruit flies in one area.

, There are several drain gels on the market that are formulated to fruit flies and eggs infesting kitchen drains. If boiling water and soap don't do the trick, consider trying a gel. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for treating your drain. You may have to repeat more than once to completely get rid of the flies., If you have a fruit fly infestation that you can't get under control, you can have your home treated with a residual insecticide that you spray where fruit flies tend to land and congregate. If you properly store produce and keep your kitchen clean, this measure is not usually necessary. Call a pest control company for further information if you want to have your home sprayed for fruit flies.

"
Figure out where they're breeding.,
Store your produce carefully.,
Wash your waste receptacles.,
Clean your drain.,
Throw out other potential breeding sources.,
Wipe down the surfaces in your kitchen.",How to Get Rid of Fruit Flies4," Fruit flies lay their eggs places that provide food and moisture, such as rotting fruit and dank sinks or garbage cans. To get rid of the eggs, you'll need to figure out where the flies' food sources are in your kitchen.Bowls or bags of aging fruit are an obvious culprit. Even if your fruit is brand new, the container you're storing it in might have residue from old produce that's still attracting fruit flies.
If you keep compost in your kitchen, that may be a food source for fruit flies.
An open bag of recyclables can be attractive to fruit flies, especially if it contains un-rinsed beer or soda cans.
When did you last wash your garbage can? Even if you take out the trash frequently, the receptacle itself could be the source of the problem.
Kitchen sink drains often harbor fruit flies, since food bits can get trapped in there and start to rot.
Damp sponges and mops can also be breeding grounds for fruit flies.

, When you have a fruit fly problem, don't leave fruit exposed at room temperature in your kitchen. Store it in a closed brown bag or keep it in the refrigerator until you've taken care of the fruit flies. One piece of overripe fruit can perpetuate the infestation by providing a great place for fruit flies to breed.Don't throw fruit scraps in the trash. Unless you take your trash out daily, avoid throwing peach pits, apple cores and other fruit scraps in the trash in your kitchen, since they'll end up as breeding grounds for fruit flies. Take scraps directly outside to a compost pile or outdoor bin.

, Your trash can, recycling bin, and compost bin could be harboring fruit fly eggs. Any waste receptacle you keep indoors should be cleaned with hot, soapy water as soon as you notice the infestation. Take out your trash, recycling or compost often to prevent the problem from recurring.


Continue washing the containers every week or so, especially during the late summer months when fruit fly populations are high.
Rinse bottles and other containers with hot water before you throw them in the bin. Residue from these items can spill on your trash receptacles and make the fruit fly problem worse.
You should also make sure all of your waste receptacles have tight-fitting lids.

, You can check to see if your drain is a fruit fly breeding ground by covering it with a piece of plastic wrap spread with a thin layer of honey. Place it over the drain honey-side down, then come back in an hour or so. If you see fruit flies stuck to the honey, your drain is part of the problem.


Make sure your drain is operating properly. If it's backed up, or if your garbage disposal isn't working, you might have bits of rotting fruit attracting flies down there.
To kill eggs, pour a pot of boiling soapy water down the drain. Use a brush to scrub around the sides of the drain.
Don't pour bleach down your drain. It doesn't work, and it's harmful to the environment.

, Old sponges, damp mops, old rags, and any other items you use to wipe your counters and floors might contain fruit fly eggs.Throw them away or wash them using the hot cycle on your washing machine.

, Use hot, soapy water to clean your countertops. Make sure you get all the cracks and crevices where fruit flies might like to congregate. Clean your cabinets, pantry, and any other places where you've stored fruit, juices, or other sugary items.


Check the floor, too. If a drink got spilled under the refrigerator, for instance, that might be part of the problem. Clean any areas that feel sticky.
Keep kitchen surfaces clean every day. Make sure everything is wiped down as part of your cleanup after each meal.
Wash all dishes after use. Avoid leaving dishes just sitting around dirty (if you have a dishwasher, pop them in there and shut the door to await a wash).

Put on heavy gloves.,
Place a blanket over the cage.,
Place the trap on a newspaper.,
Relocate the possum.,
Open the cage and step away.,
Contact your local animal control agency.",How to Trap a Possum2," Once you have caught the possum, you will need to remove the cage with the possum in it. When handling the cage, make sure you wear heavy gloves. Buy gloves that are specifically made for handling animals, for example Kevlar gloves., Before lifting the cage, place a blanket over it. Placing a blanket over the cage will calm the possum. It will also prevent the possum from reaching out to grab your hands, legs, or shoes. When lifting the cage, make sure to lift it by the handle.Do not put your fingers in the trap.






When carrying the trap, carry it away from your legs and feet.







, Place the trap on top of newspaper or in a cardboard box in your car or in the back of your truck. This will prevent any feces from getting on your car while transporting the possum., Contact your local wildlife management agency to find safe and humane relocation areas. Because possums have a great sense of smell and direction, you should relocate the possum to an area that is at least 25 miles from your home.Examples of safe and humane relocation areas are wildlife preserves, forests, and areas that are similar to a possum’s natural habitat.

, When you find a suitable relocation area, safely set the trap down on the ground. Point the opening of the trap away from you, and in the direction of the area where you intend to relocate the animal, i.e., facing the forest. Push down on the safety bar and springs, and pull the trap door all the way up. This will allow the possum to exit the trap safely.Always stand behind the trap cage when you are releasing the possum.






If the possum turns to look at you while it is exiting the cage, put your arms up in the air and make loud predator noises as if you are a bear. This should scare the possum and cause it to turn away and leave.






If the possum does not leave immediately, step away from the cage and go inside your car. Wait 10 minutes before checking the cage again.







, If you are uncomfortable relocating the possum yourself, then contact your local animal control or wildlife management agency. Let them know that you captured a possum and need help relocating it. They will send someone to your home to relocate the possum for you.

Eliminate sources of food.,
Close off access to shelter.,
Trim the trees around your house.",How to Trap a Possum3," A great way to deter possums from your home is to eliminate their food sources. Eliminate their food sources by securing garbage cans with tight-fitting lids. Also, clean up fallen nuts, fruit, berries, and birdseed around your house.You should also remove any uneaten pet food that is placed outside your home.

, By preventing access to sheltered areas, like the underside of your house, you can make your house inhospitable for possums. To do this, place or repair screens that close off openings to your garage, porch (underneath your porch, too), sheds, poultry houses, and other small places that possums can hide in.Make sure to repair any broken vents, screens, roofing and siding to prevent possums from making a home out of your home.

, To keep possums from making a home out of your attic, trim tree branches that hang over your roof. It is recommended that you trim all tree branches within 10 feet of your roof to prevent possums from entering your attic."
"
Inspect fruit that you bring into your kitchen.,
Keep a maintenance trap near your fruit bowl.,
Use screens to cover your doors and windows.,
Deal with outdoor fruit fly attractants.,
Deter fruit flies with essential oils.",How to Get Rid of Fruit Flies5," Pick through berries, cherries, and other fruits that you bring inside. Any damaged fruit should be discarded outdoors, since you could bring fruit fly eggs in from the grocery store or farmer's market. Wash your fresh fruit carefully with water and dry it completely before storing.

, Any small container with a teaspoon of cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons of water, and a drop of two of dish soap will attract and drown fruit flies. This will help keep the population down. Rinse out the bowl and fill it with fresh mixture every day during fruit fly season.

, Fruit flies enjoy outdoor food sources as well. Covering entrances to your home with screens will help prevent them from coming into your kitchen. This is especially important if you have fruit trees in your yard.

, If you have fruit trees, pick fruit when it's ready rather than leaving it to rot on the branch or beneath the tree. Pick up or rake away a glut of fruit that has fallen to the ground beneath the tree, to discourage fruit fly infestation.


You can also slip an exclusion bag over the branches of the tree that are fruiting. The bag should allow light to continue to reach the fruit and air to circulate without allowing the fruit flies access to the fruit. Such bags can usually be obtained from places that supply organic growers.
Purchase organic fruit fly sprays from a garden center or organic growing supplier. Such sprays will need to be reapplied regularly, due to their organic nature but this is the best non-toxic approach to growing healthy fruit.

, Fruit flies are deterred by the smell of certain essential oils that are pleasing to humans. The oils won't kill the flies, but they will keep flies from accumulating. Fill a spray bottle with a cup of water and five to ten drops of lemongrass, eucalyptus or peppermint essential oil. Spritz areas of the kitchen that tend to attract fruit flies, like near the sink and trash can."

Depending on your needs, and your ability to handle the mice either dead or alive, you can choose a trap that best suits your situation. Some traps do not kill the mice, while others kill them as swiftly as possible.Snap mouse traps are a spring-loaded devices that have a spring-release bar that snaps and kills the rodent when triggered.
Electronic mouse traps lure the mouse into the trap and then will electrocute it, thus killing the rodent.
Glue mouse traps use glue trays with scented substances that attract rodents. Once the rodent has stepped into the trap, it tries to free itself, thus sinking further into the trap until it is dead.
Multiple catch traps are designed to trap and hold more than one rodent. They can only be released through human intervention. Many individuals use these types of traps to catch and release the rodents.;
, Once you have decided on what kind of trap to use, visit a home improvement store such as Lowe’s or Home Depot to purchase your traps. You can also purchase them online to potentially find a better deal or save money. You can search for traps on Amazon or other ecommerce websites to find a great deal on the trap(s) you wish to purchase.

, While you are shopping for traps, you may also want to purchase bait to place inside the traps. You could also simply use whatever you have in your home, such as chips or crackers you may already have sitting in your cupboards. Items such as peanut butter, chips, or candy are great for luring mice.

, When placing traps, you will want to target the areas where the mice are spending most of their time. Look for areas that have mouse droppings or urine. This will indicate where the mice are spending their time and feeding. Most mice will travel along walls, potentially leaving smear marks from the grease on their fur. Use these clues to locate the best area to place the traps. Mice tend to hide in attics, basements, closets, inside the walls, in storage boxes, and wood piles.

, You will want to avoid accidentally triggering the trap while you are setting it. For spring-loaded trap, place the food in the bait station. Try tying the item down with dental floss to make sure that it stays in place.To bait an electronic mouse trap, open the lid and set the bait in the bait station. The bait station is usually in the back of the trap in order to get the mouse to completely enter the trap.Bait a catch-and-release-trap by placing an enticing treat inside the trap, usually far away from the entrance.

, A mouse will not be inclined to go in or near your trap if there is nothing to entice it to do so. A treat with a strong scent will have a greater chance of luring the mice. Examples of enticing bait are peanut butter, fried bacon, or candy., This works best for the spring loaded traps since they will easily fit inside the trap. If the trap is triggered and a mouse is killed, it will save you from having to clean up the bloody mess and/or seeing much of the carcass., Aim to place them along “high traffic” areas and the pathways to and from their nesting areas. The pathways generally include baseboards, countertops, and inside cupboards. Use caution when placing traps as you do not want yourself or others to reach into a cupboard and accidentally trigger one of the traps. Let all family members and roommates know where the traps are so that they don’t get grabbed or stepped on.
Use multiple traps. This will increase your chances of actually catching one.

, Once you have set the traps, be sure to check on them at least every couple of days or so. You will want to promptly clean up any mice if one gets caught in your trap. Waiting too long to look at your traps could result in missed opportunities to catch more mice and could also give off bad smells if the mice are left to decompose.

, Invert a plastic bag and use it to pick up the mouse. Turn the bag back out and dispose of the mess. Some traps, such as electronic traps, allow you to flip open the top and dump out the mouse without having to touch it at all. Be careful not to let any young children touch or handle dead mice, as they can be carriers of germs and disease.

, If you have been successful in catching a mouse, clean up the mess and clean the trap. Clean up any blood or mess on the trap or in the area. If it’s a humane trap, take the mice to a field at least five miles away from your house and release them. You can usually reuse your traps.


If you feel queasy at the thought of cleaning up a dead mouse in a trap, place the baited trap into a paper bag. Let others know that there is a mousetrap in the bag and that it belongs in that area. This way you can easily clean up the mess by simply throwing away the bag.

, You may have another mouse; keep setting traps until you are confident there are no more to be caught. This may take a while, as there could be numerous mice that you are unaware of. Continue to look for signs of mouse activity and keep setting traps until the problem is resolved.


If it is a persistent or difficult infestation, consider contacting a professional exterminator to help you eliminate the mouse problem. Mice are tricky and are known for outsmarting traps.

Let a cat spend time on your property.,
Employ mouse repellant.,
Set traps near the outside of your home.,
Lure mice outside.",How to Prevent Mice from Entering Your Home1," Cats are mice's natural predators, and their presence will go a long way toward keeping the mice population on your property under control. Both indoor and outdoor cats are excellent mouse deterrents.;
, Certain substances are known to repel mice. Place one of these items in the corners of your basement, closets, doors, and other place you suspect mice may be entering:


Mint. Mint plants planted around your windows and doors will repel mice. You could also sprinkle peppermint or spearmint essential oil around your house.
Bay leaves. Tuck them into the corners of your pantry and cabinets, or crush them up and sprinkle them in your windowsills.
Mothballs. These will keep mice away, but they're poisonous to humans and pets. If you use mothballs, make sure your children, dogs and cats can't get near them.

, Place them in areas where you think mice are entering or have entered your home.


Try live traps. Mice are lured inside by peanut butter or cheese, and when the door closes behind them they can't get back out. Release live mice in an area away from your home.
Spring or glue traps are also effective, but you risk catching wild animals with them if you place them outside.

, Purchase bait boxes at a home improvement store. They typically feature a box and poison bait, or you can purchase bait stations which are already baited. Think twice about using these if you have children or pets who may be attracted to them.


Place poisonous bait stations around the outside of your home, targeting areas where you suspect mice are entering your home.
If you find a mouse that has died from the poison, dispose of it right away. If another animal eats the mouse, it will also be poisoned.

Determine where the mice are in your house.,
Check the possibility of immediate outdoor locations and attics.,
Place traps near walls or baseboards.",How to Set a Mousetrap1," Before you set traps, one of the keys to getting rid of mice is identifying the ""rodent zones,"" or the areas between the nest and the food source.If you've found droppings or signs of chewing (or have seen mice) in a particular area of your home, start there and narrow in on the following popular locations:


Secluded corners
Under cabinets
Between furniture
Ceiling and wall voids, especially near heat sources
Top of the basement
Crawl space
Cluttered office or desk drawers
Garages;
, You may not be dealing with a nest in your home, but rather immediately outside it. You'll want to also be aware of:


Dead fruit trees
Wall and floor voids on upper or attic floors
Beneath low-lying shrubbery
Within the wall voids of a brick foundation
Along utility lines
Beneath slab walkways or porches

, Mice typically don't run through the middle of rooms, but stick close to the walls. Placing the traps in these paths will increase the likelihood of their working.


Keep the traps out of your way to avoid accidents.

Remove your home's clutter.,
Wash the floors and vacuum the carpets.",How to Prevent Mice from Entering Your Home2," Mice are attracted to the forgotten corners of basements, closets, and storage rooms. Remove the following types of clutter to make your home less inviting to mice looking for a place to build a nest:


Boxes of old cookware. Plates, glasses, pots and pans you've been meaning to sell at the next yard sale might be attracting mice to your basement or storage room.
Piles of clothing. You might notice little bite marks in your clothes if you leave them on the floor for too long. Clothing stored in bags is also susceptible to being used as a mouse nest. Store clothes you don't wear often in a wooden chest or plastic bins to keep mice out.
Piles of magazines, newspapers, or other papers. These provide materials for mice to make into nests.
Cardboard boxes. Mice can chew right through boxes, so don't store them on the floor.
Cans, bottles or other old food storage containers. Mice may be attracted to the smell of the food residue.
Old furniture. Now might be the time to get rid of that old loveseat gathering dust in the basement. Anything made of cloth, especially if it isn't often used, could make a cozy home for a mouse.

, Old spills, crumbs, and every day dirt and debris can attract mice. Make your home less enticing to mice by disinfecting your floors and running a vacuum over the carpet a few times a week.


Pay attention to the corners of rooms where balls of dust and hair collect. Mice use these materials to make nests.
Don't forget the garage. Make sure the floor of your garage is swept clean of dirt, sand, gravel and other materials that may have accumulated.

"
"
Mouse-proof your kitchen and pantry.,
Don't leave cat or dog food sitting out all day.,
Remove food sources outdoors.",How to Prevent Mice from Entering Your Home3," The most likely source of food for mice that enter your house is in the kitchen. Take the following measures to make sure you aren't providing meals for mice:


Use a trashcan that has a lid, since the smell of trash can attract mice. Take out the trash frequently rather than letting it sit in your kitchen for too long.
Don't store boxes of food on the floor. Make sure everything is kept on shelves or in cabinets.
Use tightly-sealed food storage containers. Store grains, pastas, nuts and other dry goods in glass or plastic containers with tight lids. Rather than putting a half-used box of cereal or another item back on the shelf, pour its contents into a food storage container and recycle the box.
Clean up spills right away. Don't let orange juice or a spilled box of oatmeal sit on your floor for too long. Sweep and mop your kitchen floor often to remove traces of food.

, Cat food and dog food are appetizing to mice, too, and stray pieces will attract them if they're left to sit out all the time. When your pets are finished eating, put their food away. Keep the pet food in a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid.

, Mice might be attracted to your property because they're finding good things to eat outside. Remove the following sources of food:


Nuts and berries that have dropped from trees. Rake these up and compost or discard them.
Birdseed that has scattered around the feeder. Clean up stray birdseed frequently, or move the feeder to a corner of your yard a that's a good distance from the house.
Spilled garbage. Prevent mice from getting into your garbage by using a can with a tight-fitting lid. If possible, store your garbage cans in a shed that's not right next to your house.

Find a box that is big enough for the nest and a little bit of movement.,
Cut a hole the size of a mother mouse with babies hanging on to it (tennis ball size is good).,
Have a handful of food ready.,
Plan out where the family will be relocated to.,
Research how to take care of baby mice in case your operation is a failure.

,
Gather your supplies (heavy gloves, prepared box, food) and head out of the mice home.

,
Open the flaps of the box and place it where you can access it.

,
Move anything in the path of the nest so you can easily grab it.

,
Get the nest so you don't touch it with your hands.,
Place the nest (mice or no mice) in the box close to the entrance.

,
Close the box flaps and move the box to the relocation point.

,
Place a trail of food leading from their old location to the new location and just inside of the box to help the mice find it again.

,
Wait a day and come out and check in the morning to see if the food is gone but don't disturb the mice or they might not come back because it is a new location and then they will perish somewhere in the cold harsh world because you scared them out of their warm safe home.

,
If the food is still there and nothing has changed, wait until midday and then check inside the box.,
If there is a baby mouse, you will have to kill it or take care of it and then release it.,
But there is an extremely low chance that will happen so if the food is gone you're successful!",How to Move a Family of Mice," The box must have flaps at the top that you can close.;
, The hole should be at the end of the box with no flaps and close to the edge so the mice can get in from the ground.

, Good foods include cheese, foie gras, truffles and almonds etc.

, Make sure it's somewhere close to their old home so they can find it. Try to make sure that they have a little bit of cover too, shrubs, small plants etc.

,,,,, If the mice get away that is ok, but it is better if you cover the entrance while you're moving them.

,,,,, If there is still no sign of life careful tap the top of the nest. If nothing comes out peer inside the nest to insure that no young have been left to die.

, If you leave it it will die a long, cold, lonely, painful death of starvation, cold, and dehydration.

, Good luck with your family of mice!

Select a live trap in your price range.,
Set the trap in the area you've selected.,
Bait the trap.,
Check on the trap regularly.,
Release the mice in a secluded location.",How to Set a Mousetrap2," A wide variety of ""humane traps"" are on the market, which will enclose mice without killing them, but all work with the same basic principle. Generally, these traps involve a wire cage or a plastic tube with a door on each end. After entering the cage or tube in search of the food you've placed there, the trap will close, trapping the mouse safely inside.

, Open one or both of the openings of the trap, activating the mechanism (usually a small lever) that keeps the doors open.

, Popular baits include apples, peanut butter, and cheese.

, If you're hoping to catch the mice alive, you'll want to make sure to keep up with them.


Mice trapped together have a tendency to eat each other.

,


Don't release them in the backyard or near other houses the mice might take up residence in.
Find a wooded area or a park to release the mice.

Select reusable or disposable snap traps.,
Set the trap in the area you've selected.,
First, bait the spring plate with a tiny amount of peanut butter or cheese.,
Point the pin at the end away from the spring.

,
Pull the metal snapper back towards the pin.,
Hold the metal piece that catches the mouse down with one hand and lay the pin over it with the other hand.,
Put the pin in the hole on the metal plate at the other end.,
Carefully hold the metal plate up and let go of the snapping mechanism.

",How to Set a Mousetrap3," If you're ok with repeatedly handling and reusing a trap with dead mouse on it, high quality reusable options are available. These are reliable, but involve a little more face-to-face time with the mouse.


Cheap wooden disposable snap traps often come in packages of three or five and are an economical bet if you've got a serious mouse problem.

, Remember: the more traps you use in the targeted rodent zones, the more effective the traps will be at getting rid of the mice.

, Baiting the trap first is important, because you'll want to fiddle with it as little as possible after setting it.

,, Use a firm grip so the trap doesn't snap your finger.

, Keep holding the snapper firmly until you've got it set.

, This will hold the snapper in place, but it's very sensitive. Use caution.

Try making one yourself and setting a bucket trap.,
Drill holes at the top of the bucket, on 2 opposite sides.,
Drill holes in the middle of each flat side of the can.,
Insert the dowel through the can and fix it in place on the bucket.,
Smear some peanut butter on the can and add a ramp for the mice to get up.",How to Set a Mousetrap4," For this you'll need:


Five gallon plastic bucket
Wooden or metal dowel rod
Tin or aluminum can
Peanut butter or desired bait
Small wooden plank long enough to ramp from the ground to the top of the bucket

, Make sure the holes are big enough for the dowel to fit through., Be careful of any jagged edges created by drilling the hole.

, Make sure the dowel fits securely and won't come loose with some jostling. The mouse will probably try to crawl along the dowel to get to the bait.

, If you'd like to kill the mice, fill the bottom few inches with water or leave it empty for a live release option.

Check on your snares.",How to Make a Squirrel Snare," It may not be legal where you live to use snares on animals because of the risk to wildlife, pets and people. If this is the case, you should only use a snare in a survival situation. Always be careful, and make intelligent decisions when considering whether to trap any animal.


Check your state or country's wildlife, environmental or hunting and trapping department for trapping regulations. You can also ask at your local humane society or animal control department.;
, Check for trees where you regularly see squirrels or, even better, a squirrel nest. If you don’t actually see squirrels, check for signs of squirrel activity on the ground, such as pine cone shreds or nut shells.

, Keep an eye out for an area to set up your trap with ample materials for you to use. You need branches and a small tree if you are going to make a trigger spring snare. You will want to use the natural layout of the area to drive the squirrel through your trap rather than around it. They will usually follow the path that they think requires less energy to get through.

, All snares require a noose. Ideally, you will want .22 or .24 gauge wire of about 1-2' length but you can use many types of material. It should be flexible, strong and thin enough so that when it is looped into a noose it can tighten easily when pulled.


If you need to, you can use stripped wire from inside electronics, power cords, vehicle electrical systems, picture hanging or craft wire, spiral notebooks, springs or underwire bras.If you can’t find any wire, consider using string or cord strong enough to hold up to an 8lb animal. Test its strength by jerking the cord between your fists. Try parachute cord, shoe strings, dental floss or fishing line. In a pinch, you can use natural plant or tree bark fibers, such as milkweed, dogbane, stinging nettle, inner tree bark, palm or cattail. You will probably need to wrap or braid the fibers to create a strong enough cord., You might choose the squirrel noose, which is basically a portable, reusable trap made of a wooden pole with some wire. You could also choose to make a trigger spring snare, which is a little more complex than the squirrel noose alone. It consists of the noose, a wooden trigger with two parts, a leader line and an object to serve as an engine, such as a bent sapling.

, A noose can be a very effective snare when the tag end is secured to a branch, stake or tree. It often does not need a trigger mechanism to catch an animal. Be aware that while these snares can catch a squirrel, they may not kill it.


Use at least one foot of wire. Make a loop smaller than 3"" in diameter. Pinch the tag end of the wire together with some needle nose pliers. Use your free hand to twist the loop clockwise.
Get some more wire of about the same length and cut it with pliers. Repeat the loop twist again until this loop is small enough to fit through the other loop.
Fit the smaller loop through the bigger one. Make a fist and slide the loop over your hand until it fits snugly on your fist.

, A rough, natural-looking branch with the bark still on works best. A fork at the end that allows the pole to stay in place when you stick it in the ground or pin it against a tree is especially helpful.


Ideally, your pole should be 4-6' and about as thick as your arm.

, Zig -zag the wire between the pole and noose, twisting the loops around the pole. You can create more loops to attach—up to about a dozen—on the pole’s top and sides to enhance your chances of snaring a squirrel.

, Secure it against the tree. Turn the natural branches and forks on the pole so they form a sort of funnel to encourage the squirrel to go through instead of around the loop.

, If you want, you can create a slight modification of the squirrel noose. This adds a bit more spring to the wire when it is triggered.


Twist a 1/4"" size loop in the wire into a figure 8. Now you will have 2 loops about 1/8"" in size.
Run the other end of the wire through the 1/8"" loops. Put an indentation or bump in the wire to hold the loop at about 2-3 fingers in diameter or the size of the squirrels you want to catch. It will snap back to the 1/8"" diameter when the squirrel’s head goes through the loop., At first, the squirrels may be cautious and not go near your trap. After a while, they will get used to it. Check the trap every day or more often from afar with binoculars. You don’t want to be around too often and spook your prey.

, Use your 2' long wire or cord to create a noose with a tag end that can be tied to a trigger. To do this, you will want to create a hook and loop. The wire needs to be able to tighten when an animal is caught in it.


Make a small, pencil width sized loop in the end of your wire or cord. It should be about ¼"" long. Twist the wire onto itself or if you’re using cord, tie a knot, to secure the loop. Do this several times before running the other end through the loop.

, You will need a hook (top stick) and base (bottom stick) to create the trigger. The leader line (the cord that connects the engine to the hook) can be tied to the top of the hook and the noose tied to the lower part of the hook. The hook is then secured under the snare base, while the object serving as the engine will provide tension. When an animal pulls on the noose, the hook and leader line will disengage.


You can create a trigger from 2 sticks that are branched or that you carve the way you want and then stake into the ground.
You can also secure the hook onto a nail in a nearby log or tree.
Consider baiting your trigger with something like a raisin. To do this, you will need to stick the raisin near the hook so the animal has to go through the noose to get to the bait. Once the bait is moved, the hook disengages.
Remember, you can improvise based on what you have available.

, It needs to be strong enough to suspend the squirrel in the air. This way the squirrel is killed quickly and is protected from predators. Usually, this will be a young, flexible sapling but there are other options as well.


If you aren’t near any small trees, bring a sapling or branch from somewhere else and stake it into the ground to set up your trap. You can also use a weight like a rock added to your leader line to add tension to the trigger.
you can test to see if your snare will work with a rock or log that is about the same weight as a squirrel.

, You can try different snare types, depending on what you have available. Put them in various places near high traffic game areas. The more you lay out to catch squirrels, the greater your chances are of success.

, Try to check your snares every 6-8 hours. These snares likely kill, so you don’t want a dead squirrel out in the elements too long or attracting other predators.

Obtain a long cardboard tube with one end closed.,
Flatten the tube along one edge.,
Bait the tube.Place a piece of cheese, candy, or bread in the far end of the tube.,
Place the tube on the edge of a countertop or second story landing.,
Place a trash can beneath the tube.,
Check the trap frequently.",How to Make a Cheap Homemade Mouse Trap1," The tube might be from a paper towel roll or poster. It should be at least 12 inches long, 2-5 inches in diameter at its mouth, and have one end stopped with tape or with a cap. Place something soft in the closed end such as cotton balls or a wad of soft fabric.;
, In order to make the the tube sit on a flat surface without it rolling about, you’ll need to create a flat edge on the tube. Press a long crease in the tube along its length, then press another crease in the tube approximately 40 degrees around from the first crease. Stick a ruler in the tube to further flatten the space between the shortest distance from one crease to the other.

, Ensure it is of sufficient mass to attract a mouse but not so heavy that it will significantly alter the weight of the tube. Do not choose foods which are sticky or gummy; they can be hard to get all the way down the tube.


If you do want to use, say, peanut butter, you could apply them to the bait end of the tube before applying the cap.

, Place the tube in such a way so that about 40% of it, including the baited end, hangs over the edge of the landing.If necessary, affix the tube with a small piece of tape, but take care not to tape it so firmly that it would not give way and tip over the edge of the landing or countertop when the baited end was subjected to slight force.


If you’re in a single story home, obtain a cardboard box approximately one foot high and craft a cardboard ramp up to the top of the box. Place one end of the tube at the end of the box.

, The can should be wide enough to accommodate the falling tube. Place a small pillow, soft cloth, or pad on the bottom of the can to cushion the tube and mouse who will soon be trapped within.


Do not use a trash can which is too wide. If you do, it’s possible the tube will come to rest on an angle, rather than straight up and down. If that happens, the mouse will be able to climb out of the tube easily.

, When you see the tube sticking upright out of the trash can, it means the trap has been sprung. Look down the tube to ensure the mouse is within. Remove the tube and, keeping it upright with the open end up, take it at least five to ten miles from your house, preferably in an area free of housing.Dump the mouse out of the tube gently in a field or meadow.


This type of trap is extremely effective, and ideal for mice living on or with access to a second story.
If you don’t think it’s appropriate to drop the tube into a garbage pail several feet below the upper-story landing, you could affix the whole tube with a piece of string to the landing itself. That way, instead of dropping down into the garbage pail when the mouse triggered the trap, the tube would drop away and dangle harmlessly off the ledge until you recovered it.

Close your doors.,
Seal your windows.,
Inspect the foundation.,
Seal off cable and drain outlets, vents and chimneys.",How to Prevent Mice from Entering Your Home4," If you have a habit of leaving your front door or garage door open, mice may be taking the opportunity to dart inside when you aren't looking. Keep your doors closed to discourage mice from entering.


Mice are most active at night, so it's best not to leave doors open overnight.
If you like to have your doors open during the summer to let the breeze inside, install screen doors, so mice won't be able to come in.

, Mice are good climbers, and they'll have no trouble getting in through a window, especially if it's on the first floor. Keep your windows closed or screened at all times.


If it has been awhile since you've looked at your screens, go around your house and inspect them. Screens break down over time, and a rusty hole or a tear in fabric screens could be providing an entrance for mice.
If you have a window that won't close all the way, or has a gap between the window and the frame, seal it with steel wool or hardware cloth.

, Another likely place for mice to enter your home is through cracks in your walls, especially near windows and entryways. Walk around the outside of your house to inspect it for cracks or holes mice could use to enter your home.


Seal any holes you find that are bigger than 1/4 inch (6.4mm). It's best to use sturdy repair materials such as sheet metal, hardware cloth or concrete mortar. Mice may be able to quickly chew through weaker materials and regain access to your house.
Check the wall that separates your garage from the rest of your house. Sometimes mice get in through garage doors, since they're harder to seal than smaller doors, and then find a way into the main house.

, Mice can easily follow cables into your home if the hole is large enough for them to fit into. They can also come in around access holes created for running pipes and drains or scurry into vents and chimneys.


Stuff stainless steel pads into small holes around pipes and cables, and then seal the holes with caulk. The steel pad creates an abrasive barrier to keep mice out, and it can easily be cut up with scissors to fit into smaller areas.
Prevent mice from getting inside pipes, vents and chimneys by installing screens.

Obtain a one liter plastic water bottle.,
Cut around the bottle’s circumference one inch from the place where it starts to taper toward the cap.,
Lay the bottle on its side with the hinge on the table.,
Insert skewers into the bottle.,
Affix a string to the bottle.,
Place rubber bands around the skewers.,
Place the trap in an enticing position.,
Take the mouse a distance from your home and release it.",How to Make a Cheap Homemade Mouse Trap2," A similar bottle would work as well, but one liter water bottles are ideal because they are long and narrow, and often have flat sides which allow them to sit undisturbed. You could substitute a two liter bottle as well. Whatever type of bottle you choose, ensure it is transparent and composed of thin, pliable plastic.

, If the bottle were standing up, you’d be cutting in a long horizontal line around its circumference. Do not cut the top completely off; rather, cut approximately 90% of the way around the bottle with a scalpel or extendable blade.


When finished, the bottle should be flexible at the “hinge” (the 10% of the top and body of the bottle you did not cut).

, With a black marker, mark two points on the side of the bottle approximately one centimeter from the place where it has been cut, one on the left side of the cut and one on the right side of the cut. The marks should be located half a centimeter from the top edge of the bottle. Rotate the bottle 180 degrees along its horizontal axis and place symmetrical marks on the other side.


If you’re using a round bottle rather than a bottle with roughly rectangular sides, it is more difficult to gauge where to place the marks. Try to place the marks about 90 degrees apart from each other around the circumference of the bottle, two on one side of the cut and two on the other.

, Take two five-inch wooden skewers of the kind used to grill shish kebab or construct various arts and crafts projects. They should be only a millimeter or so in diameter. Press the two skewers through the bottle from one set of points to the other using the marks you made.


The skewers should pass through it in two parallel lines which run perpendicular to the normal orientation of the bottle if it were to stand on its base.
Insert a third skewer, half as long as the first two, into the end of the bottle (the base the bottle would stand on in a standard vertical orientation). Stick a piece of cheese on the end of the skewer which is inside the bottle.

, With your bottle oriented so that the hinge is on the surface of the table, you should now have a bottle with two skewers through its upper part (one just to the left and one just to the right of the place you made the cut). Turn the bottle over so that the hinge is on the top. Unscrew the cap and place a string as long as the bottle approximately one inch down through the mouth. Screw the cap back on tightly with the string still partway inside. Give the string a slight pull to ensure it is snugly in place beneath the bottle cap.

, Rubber bands about one centimeter in diameter  are ideal. If you have trouble finding a band that small, try using some elastic hair ties. With the hinge on the upper side of the bottle, loop one band around the two skewers on the left side of the bottle and another band around the skewers on the right side of the bottle.


When you pull up on the cap of the bottle while it’s laying on its side with the hinge oriented above the skewers, the bands should pull back with slight resistance.
Tie the other end of the string in a loop around the skewer sticking out the far end.

, Place it in areas like along a wall or a high-traffic area near a mouse hole. When the mouse enters the bottle to eat the cheese, pull back on the string looped around the skewer sticking out of the bottle’s bottom. The bottle will snap closed on the mouse, trapping it within.


If you have a skittish mouse, you may need to modify the closing mechanism so that rather than pulling the looped string up from the skewer in the bottle’s end by hand, you pull from a distance away with another length of string. Doing so could increase the trap's effectiveness, but will require more patience on your part.

, Wear sanitary gloves and carry the bottle in an upright position at least five to ten miles away from any human habitation.Open the trap in a meadow or forest, allowing the mouse to go free. Dispose of the sanitary gloves and bottle trap.


This type of trap is perfect for a brave or arrogant mouse who thinks he has the run of the house. If mice have become accustomed to human activity and brazenly scurry about even in the presence of many people, you’ll be able to snap this trap closed on them with little trouble.

Obtain a large coffee can.,
Wrap a piece of construction paper over the top of the can.,
Place the can on the floor in an area where the mouse resides.,
Place a piece of food on the construction paper.,
Wait for the mouse to fall in.",How to Make a Cheap Homemade Mouse Trap3," The can should have a mouth approximately five to six inches across and a height of about seven to eight inches. The coffee can should have smooth sides which cannot be easily scaled by rodents. If using economy size coffee cans which are ten inches deep or more, place a small pad or bunched cloth at the bottom to prevent injury to the mouse you’ll catch.


You can use plastic or metal coffee cans. If using metal, though, ensure they aren’t ribbed with concentric rings which the mouse might use like a ladder to escape.

, Hold the paper in place using a rubber band wrapped around the rim of the can. Take an extendable blade and cut an “X” in the top of the construction paper, stopping about one inch from the edge of the can at each of the four lines.Tissue paper might also work in place of construction paper.
It is important to maintain the appearance that the papered-over coffee can is capable of supporting the mouse when it walks across it. Instead of cutting a solid “X”, you could try poking small, closely-spaced holes in an “X” shape across the surface of the paper.

, Lay a long ruler or paint stirring stick from the floor to the mouth of the coffee can. If necessary, affix the ruler or stick to the can with tape.Mice come in different sizes. If you find that your mice are unable to scamper up the thin ruler, consider placing two next to each other and taping them together to ensure easy access to the trap.

, Place the food -- cheese, a piece of candy, or bread -- along the edge of the coffee can directly opposite the point at which the ruler, paint stirring stick, or other ramp-like object you’ve affixed to the coffee can meets the can’s mouth.Do not select a bait food which is too heavy or gives lie to the illusion that the papered-over surface of the coffee can is stable.
Do not place the coffee can near a countertop or step stool from which the bait could be eaten from the far side of the ramp without passing over the construction paper.

, The mouse will run up the ruler to reach the food on the opposite side of the coffee can, then fall into the can when the apparently solid surface gives way beneath it. You’ll know the trap has been sprung if you see the bait you laid is no longer there, or if the construction paper has been partially torn. Check the can for the mouse.


Remove the ruler or makeshift ramp from the can and take the can to a location about five to ten miles from human habitation.Place the can on the ground and turn it sideways, allowing the mouse to exit.

Mix a 1/4 pound (113 g) of plaster of Paris with 1/4 pound (113 g) of cornmeal in a large bowl.,
Add 1–2 cups (0.2 L to 0.47 L) of milk.,
Use your hands to knead the mixture into dough.

,
Break off 1–2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 cm) chunks of the dough and roll into balls.

,
Place the balls behind the fridge, inside cupboards, under the stove, or anywhere else the rats might be hiding.

,
Wait a few days and check the balls to see if they've been chewed by the rats.",How to Make Rat Poison1,"


Plaster of Paris can be bought at most craft stores and hardware stores. It is a dry powder made of gypsum that, when mixed with a liquid, thickens and eventually hardens.;
,


You can add more milk if clumps of the cornmeal or plaster of Paris are still dry.

,,,,


If they have not been touched, you will need to make another batch of the poison and place the balls elsewhere. The plaster of Paris will have hardened to an inedible degree by this time.

Go for the snap trap.,
Consider the live cage trap.,
Stray away from the glue trap.,
Add bait to your trap.",How to Trap a Rat1," If choosing a lethal trap, this is the most humane choice. It works to deliver a powerful snap that will kill a rat instantly. There are many types and brands to choose from, including the original wooden standby that still holds up as the most popular choice. The wooden traps are so popular because you can adjust the pan tension. If you find a smaller rat who cautiously nibbles the bait, you can set the trap to a very light setting.The wooden bottom can sit soundly on insulation if you use them in the attic.Other brands usually have a single high-tension setting with uneven plastic bottoms.;
, While this can be a trickier way to catch a rat, it allows you to get rid of unwanted rodents without killing them. However, these can become tricky because you may need several to help catch the rat, and you may not have the space to place them all out. Also, they can be more expensive than other traps.Once you do catch a rat, you will have to drive to a wooded area at least 2 1⁄2 miles (4.0 km) away to release it.With this trap, you need to check it several times a day. If a rat stays in a live cage trap for too long, it will die of stress exhaustion., These types of traps tend to cause problems and are considered the most inhumane way to catch a rat. It works by gluing the feet and legs of the rat to the trap, and then it holds the rat there until it suffocates or starves to death. Sometimes, the rat will escape, leaving behind chunks of fur or a leg. If you do find a trapped rat there, you will have to deal with discarding a possibly living rat., Bait is not necessary to catch a rat. The main factors in a successful trapping are the location and type of placement you use. However, if you want to use bait, try peanut butter. Technically, you could use anything, but peanut butter is the best thing to use because it stays fresh for long periods, and it won't be easily removed by sneaky rats."
"
Gather a empty pop or soup can.,
Make a small hole in the top and bottom of the can.,
Put a small straight stick or round piece of wood through the holes.,
Spread peanut butter on the can.,
Set it all on top of a five-gallon bucket.,
Sit and wait.,
If you made a live trap, release the mouse 5-10 miles away from habitation.",How to Make a Mouse Trap with a Can and Bucket," Wash it out so the flavor is all gone. Remember you want the mice to come to the trap, not move away.
, The holes should be large enough to put a small stick or round piece of wood through., The stick or piece of wood should be small enough to let the can roll loosely. It should also be long enough to sit on top of a bucket., Try to spread it near the middle so the mouse has to climb on top of the can to get to it. Make sure you spread enough to attract the mouse., For a trap that will be fatal, fill the bucket with water. If you want to make a live trap, use a taller bucket., You might have to wait a few days before you catch anything. Check the trap 3-4 times a day., Make sure to wear disposable gloves and to avoid touching the mouse with your skin."

Mix 1 cup (128 g) of flour, 1 cup (201 g) of sugar and 1 cup (128 g) of baking soda in a large bowl.

,Place the dry mixture into shallow containers such as a plastic cup make sure the rodent can reach it

,
Wait a day and check the cans.",How to Make Rat Poison2,",,


The bicarbonate of the baking soda reacts with the rat's stomach acids to produce a carbon dioxide gas. Rats are unable to pass gas. The gas will build up in the rat's system and eventually cause internal blockage or rupture.

Set the trap on the path you have seen a rat or have found evidence.,
Be careful of the trap.,
Leave the trap overnight.,
Discard your rat.,
Prevent rats from entering.",How to Trap a Rat2," Rats usually travel the same routes and areas. If you place you trap in a spot that is in the middle of nowhere, or where a rat has no reason to travel, you won't catch it. If you are not sure where to place the trap, here are some common places to consider:Near your food pantry or garbage.
Any obvious paths, nests, or holes in attic insulationSpots marked with urine, droppings, garbage or footprints., If you do set the trap in an area where people walk through, or animals may roam, practice caution. Use a gate to block off part of the room so that family members or pets can't accidentally set off the trap and get hurt. Just be sure that you don't block the rat off from accessing the trap.

, Rats are nocturnal, which means they will not go in the trap until nighttime. If you don't find any signs of a rat the next morning, give it more time.


If you have not caught a rat after a few nights, try placing the trap in another area.

, When you do find a rat in your trap, be sure to discard it properly. If the rat is dead, put it in a bag, and place it outside in the garbage. You can either use a shovel to scoop it up, or put on gloves to pick it up. Do not touch a rat with your bare hands as they carry many diseases.


If you used a live trap, you will have to drive to a wooded area at least 2 1⁄2 miles (4.0 km) away, and release it., Rats come into a house through small holes and entries that you may not think they could fit through. Be sure to block off even the smallest slits along your trim, holes in the walls, or gaps around your house.Seal all food by putting it in jars or containers. Rats will not want to stay around if there is no food to eat.

"
"
Clean the crawl space.,
Look around the inside and outside of your crawl space.,
Check the outside of the house very thoroughly.,
Check the attic to see if you have any activity up there.,
Trim back any trees with branches near the roof to slow down roof jumping.

,
If you only had a minor infestation, set a few traps.,
If you have a bad infestation and they are in the walls, leave a few exit points so they can get out and don't die inside the house.,
Clean the garage, and the back bedroom.,
When you're done and you think you have fixed your rodent problem, replace the failed insulation and vapor barrier in the crawl space.,
Look for problems with your garage door.",How to Keep Your Home Free of Rodents," If you've got rodents, you'll see the insulation hanging down (they like to nest in it) and droppings on the vapor barrier. If it is bad, get rid of both. Once the area is clean, you can see what needs to be done. Rodents can carry some nasty diseases (Hantavirus for one, but it is rare) so you may want to wear high-quality respiratory protection.;
, Thoroughly examine for any opening 1/4"" or larger. Close off any crawl space doors with an actual door instead of a casual closure such as a piece of wood pulled over an opening. You can stuff small openings with steel wool. Medium openings can be bridged with 1/4"" hardware cloth (mesh) stapled over the opening. Make sure to check where plumbing, electric and heating enter and exit your house.

, Fill or bridge gaps where the house meets the ground to prevent entry. You should safely get up on the roof prepared to fill holes where vents exit the roof and where two roof lines intersect. Bring along hardware cloth and fillers as used in the crawl space. This is important because arboreal rats have no problem jumping on to the house, moving in, and finding their way to your generous supplies of food, water, heat, and shelter.

, Put some traps up, check for openings to fill, and remember to reset your traps frequently until you have no activity.

,, This should do it. Put down plenty, first, baited, but without setting them. This is called prebaiting, and they get the idea that the bait on the little wooden platform is safe. Peanut butter makes a good bait. After prebaiting, set the traps. Make sure to check them.

, After they're all gone, seal up the holes.

, Rats think your clutter is a lovely, undisturbed place to live. Garage doors are hard to exclude because of small openings around the outside of the door, and the fact that you need to open the door. Call the goodwill, St. Vincent's or 1800 Got Junk to clear out the stuff.

, Watch for freezing pipes if you pull insulation in the wintertime.

, A garage door weather seal is used to seal the gap between the perimeter of a garage door and the door frame. The material used is made of a flexible rubber,which is vulnerable to chewing by mice and other rodents. Rodents chew through the lower corners to gain access to their new home. A flexible metal strip can be secured to the garage door weather seal where the seal meets the ground. The garage/ home will then be better protected against pesky rodents sneaking inside.

Spray with commercial squirrel repellent.Apply a thorough coat of repellent to all sides of the pumpkin according to label instructions.,
Place the pumpkin on a blanket of dog hair.,
Use hot pepper or hot sauce.,
Surround the pumpkin with vinegar.Pour a little white distilled vinegar around your pumpkin.,
Try eucalyptus oil.",How to Keep Squirrels from Eating Pumpkins1,"


You may need to reapply the repellent every few days, especially after the rain.
Many repellents are non-toxic since they are formulated to drive squirrels away rather than kill them.
Most deer repellents will also be effective since squirrels and deers are driven off by many of the same scents.
Look specifically for a repellent with large amounts of ""putrescent whole egg solids."" This is, essentially, rotten eggs. Squirrels typically hate the smell of rotten eggs.
Be aware that many repellents can have a strong odor, especially immediately after application. The smell tends to dissipate as the spray dries, but in the meantime, you may need to place the pumpkin away from the house.;
, The animosity between squirrel and dog is mutual, and many squirrels will stay away from an area if they smell a dog.


Dog hair is also effective at repelling deer.
Cat hair may have a similar effect on squirrels, since larger cats can pose a threat to squirrels.
It is best to use pet hair rather than pet waste. Cat waste is especially dangerous to use since it is a source of toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that can cause serious health concerns for pregnant women and people with immune deficiencies.

, Applying a coat of liquefied hot pepper, hot sauce, or powdered cayenne pepper can give the squirrels in your neighborhood a shock once they take a sniff or nibble.


Blend the hottest peppers you can find with enough water to form a liquid. Add a drop of dish soap and a drop of vegetable oil to help the solution stick and pour it into a spray bottle. Coat the pumpkin every few days with this solution to drive squirrels away.
Rub a coat of commercial hot sauce over all sides of the pumpkin. You may need to reapply the sauce after a few days or after the rain, but the hot oils have a way of penetrating the skin and soaking into the flesh of the pumpkin.
Create a scent barrier around your pumpkin by sprinkling powdered cayenne pepper around it. You can also sprinkle the pepper on top of the pumpkin for added effect.
Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling hot peppers. Otherwise, you may irritate your skin or eyes.

,


The potent smell of vinegar can be over-powering to squirrels since these critters have more sensitive noses than humans.
Vinegar is also effective at repelling ants and other insects.
You can also wipe the surface of the pumpkin down with a vinegar-soaked rag, but it is best to avoid letting large amounts of vinegar sit on the pumpkin's surface. The acidic properties of vinegar can end up damaging your pumpkin when used in large quantities.

, Dab the eucalyptus oil onto the pumpkin's surface with a cotton ball or spray diluted eucalyptus oil onto the pumpkin with a spray bottle.


In a spray bottle, combine ten parts water with one part eucalyptus oil. Add a drop of cooking oil and a drop of liquid dish soap to help the solution stick before spraying it over all sides of the pumpkin.
Note that eucalyptus oil will need to be reapplied every few days.
Peppermint oil can also be effective. Both essential oils have potent odors that might be enough to deter squirrels from approaching.

Read up on the method.,
Before you start, prepare your materials.,
Prepare the CO2 chamber.,
Prepare the euthanasia chamber.,
Connect the two with the hose.,
Slowly pour the vinegar over the baking soda.",How to Humanely Kill a Rodent1," Asphyxiation by CO2 is the only method approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association which uses common household materials.These guidelines are meant for vets not ordinary people, so think about whether you are qualified to carry this out without causing undue pain and suffering for the rodent.It is not easy or straight-forward, but when done well it is the most humane.
As a rule, it is best to take the rodent to your vet.;
, This method involves mixing baking soda with white vinegar to create the gas that will asphyxiate the rodent. As well as the vinegar and baking soda, you will need to prepare a sealable plastic container, a sealable plastic bag, a hose to connect the two, and a separate container to mix the vinegar and baking soda, such as a glass or jug.


Fasteners, ties and clothes will be needed to secure the different containers.
The plastic container is the euthanasia chamber for the rodent
The plastic bag is the CO2 chamber where the gas is produced.

, Put the baking soda into the bottom of the bag, and then place the separate container with the vinegar into the bag, without spilling it. When you combine the baking soda and vinegar later, the reaction produces the gas carbon dioxide (CO2), which the rodent can't breathe.


The ratio of vinegar to baking soda will vary by the size of the container you are using.Getting the correct concentration of CO2 is key to its humaneness. You want to create a 30%-40% concentration of CO2 in the euthanasia container to cause the rodent to lose consciousness., Taking care when you handle the rodent, place it into the airtight plastic container. Tupperware containers work well. Adding some nesting material can make it a little more comfortable and perhaps put the rodent somewhat more at ease.

, Affix the hose to the top of the bag, and secure it with a rubber band or tie and then put the other end in the plastic container with the rodent. Use a cloth or towel to block of the area around where the hose enters the container to make it airtight.

, Once it is all secured you should begin carefully pouring the white vinegar over the baking soda, to create the CO2 which will then travel through the short hose to the plastic container. Pour around half of the vinegar, and then observe the rodent. The rodent should quickly pass out and die. Once it becomes unresponsive, pour the rest of vinegar over.


Carbon dioxide exposure that uses a gradual fill method like this is less likely to cause pain."

Cover the pumpkin with petroleum jelly.Apply a heavy coat of petroleum jelly over all areas of the pumpkin, focusing on spots with exposed flesh.,
Apply lacquer spray.,
Spray the pumpkin with hair spray.",How to Keep Squirrels from Eating Pumpkins2,"


A thick coat is better than a thin coat. As the theory goes, squirrels do not like the sticky texture of petroleum jelly, so the stickier you make the surface, the better.
You could also use a medicinal, petroleum jelly based vapor rub. These rubs usually have a potent odor, which can serve as a further deterrent for squirrels and other critters.
Petroleum jelly will usually stick to the pumpkin even after the rain, and it may even last for the duration of the season. Check the pumpkin periodically, however, just to make sure that it is not in need of another coat.

, Coat all sides of your pumpkin with lacquer spray. Let dry until hard.


The spray will create a crunchy texture on the surface of the pumpkin. This might be unpleasant for some squirrels, but not for all.
In order to work at all, the spray needs to be applied to all parts of the pumpkin, especially any exposed portions. If the squirrels sense any soft areas, they will still chew the pumpkin up.
A lacquer spray with a potent odor may be more effective than one that dries odorless.

, Thoroughly coat all sides of the pumpkin with hair spray, focusing on areas of exposed flesh.


A thicker coat is better than a thin coat because it will be stickier. The sticky texture of the hair spray is what turns away many squirrels.
Note that you will need to reapply hair spray every day or two, especially after the rain. It can get worn off easily, and once it wears away, there will be nothing left to protect your pumpkin from furry menaces.

Place an owl statue nearby.Fix an owl statue next to or behind the pumpkin.,
Frighten them off with motion-activated devices.,
Lure them away with something more appetizing.",How to Keep Squirrels from Eating Pumpkins3,"


Owl statues can also be placed along the perimeter of your yard or along fences and railings to keep squirrels away in general.
You could also try another statue made to look like another predator, such as a dog or fox. Just make sure that it is a natural predator a squirrel might recognize.

, Place a motion-activated sprinkler or air blaster next to the pumpkin.


A motion-activated sprinkler will shoot a quick spurt of water at the squirrel when it crosses the path of the sensor.
A motion-activated air blaster will shoot a quick blast of air at the squirrel after the critter steps near the sensor.
Neither mechanism has enough force behind it seriously injure the squirrel, but it should startle most of them away.

, If all else fails, compromise with the enemy by placing a more delectable food source on the other side of the yard, away from the pumpkin.


You could scoop out the pumpkin “guts” or cut up a small sugar pumpkin.
You could also spread out birdseed or nuts on the far side of the yard. Peanut butter smeared onto bread crusts, soda crackers, or apple slices can also work.

Follow the trail of ants to find out where they are entering the building.,
Caulk the crack or space they are entering.,
Sweep or vacuum up all the ants you find to remove them from the house, and keep an eye out for additional infestations.",How to Stop an Ant Invasion1," While instinct may tell you to kill the ants as fast as you see them, following their trail may be easier if you let the infesting bunch roam for a while so you can find where they are coming from.;
, If you don't have any caulk on hand, spread some petroleum jelly on the area to prevent the ants from entering.

, If ants are still getting through you can try a natural repellent.

Remove squirrel food.,
Squirrel-proof your bird feeders.,
Protect your garden with a fence.,
Use squirrel repellent.,
Feed the squirrels.,
Try motion-activated sprinklers.",How to Get Rid of Squirrels1," Sure, you don't think of it as squirrel food, but if squirrels are overrunning your property it's because they're finding a lot of things they like to eat.


Rake up nuts, berries, and acorns from trees in your yard that drop them. These are squirrels' main sources of food.
Buy sealable outdoor trashcans. If your trashcan is easy for squirrels to get into, replace it with one that has a tight-sealing lid. Make sure you keep it closed at all times.;
, Squirrels are unbelievably crafty when it comes to eating from feeders. Use these methods to keep them from eating the birdseed before the birds have the chance to find it:









Buy squirrel guard to attach to your feeder that prevents squirrels from being able to get a grip on them.
Don't place feeders close to trees or your home. Squirrels will be able to bypass the guard by leaping from the branches or your home's eaves to the bird feeder.
Keep the area under the bird feeder clean. It may be a pain, but picking up stray seeds that have been dropped by birds will keep squirrels from hanging out near your feeder.
Fill your bird feeder with safflower seeds. Birds are happy to eat these seeds, but squirrels find them bitter.

, Squirrels will dig up bulbs and tear off vegetables if you don't take measures to protect the garden. Use a wire fence and make sure it is buried about a foot into the ground, so the squirrels can't dig under it.








, Several products are available at hardware and home and garden stores. They're typically made with natural ingredients that cause squirrels to stay away.


Some repellents are made with cayenne or black pepper, which repels squirrels but doesn't bother birds. These repellents can be added directly to the bird feeder.
Some repellents are made with the urine of squirrels' predators. These are meant to be sprayed around gardens to keep squirrels away.

, Instead of trying to drive the squirrels away, consider feeding them to keep them out of your bird feeder and garden. Scatter squirrel feed around your yard, or buy a feeder and place it well away from your bird feeder and garden.








, These will spray squirrels when they get too close, with the added benefit of watering your lawn.

Know your goal.,
Know what not to do.,
If you proceed, ensure that the rodent cannot move.",How to Humanely Kill a Rodent2," The aim of this method is to destroy the rodent's brain with one swift, powerful blow to the head from a hammer or other blunt striking object. This can be very daunting and/or emotionally taxing. If you doubt whether you can kill the rodent in one blow, seriously consider other options. There is risk of causing much more pain and distress if you carry this out badly., Some colloquial methods, like putting the rodent in a bag and smashing it against a wall or stomping it haphazardly are not humane. They can result in a painful and protracted death for the rodent.

, You also want to be sure you have a clear shot when you strike. One useful method is to confine the rodent in one corner of a sturdy sack or bag before striking.


The humaneness of this technique depends on force and accuracy."

Get some sturdy and re-usable spring traps.,
Set-up a traditional spring trap.,
Check it regularly.",How to Humanely Kill a Rodent3," Spring (or snap) traps are still considered to be the more humane of the various traps you can get. Much more so than a glue trap, for example. Spring traps still cause pain to rodents caught in them, but they should kill the rodent very quickly. When designed and set-up when these traps make a quick death more likely., To set-up a trap like this, place bait within the specified area, ensuring that the rest of the trap is clean. Doing this will make it more likely that, when tripped, the trap will close fully and the rodent will be killed rather than injured. Then, place the trap at right angles to a wall with the bait nearest the wall.The rodent should have a clear path to the trap.
The bait should be changed regularly.

, You should check the traps every morning, and be prepared to dispose of any dead rodents straight-away. Carefully remove them from the trap, place in a plastic bag, and then place that bag in a second bag, and throw it away into a secured bin. Always use gloves when you are doing this, and you can use a household disinfectant to clean the trap.If you find a rodent, injured but alive, you should kill it as quickly and humanely as possible."

Use a small-calibre, low power gun or air rifle.,
Be sure you have a clean sight of the rodent.,
Ensure the shooting environment is safe.,
Shoot the rodent in the head.,
Observe all firearm safety measures.",How to Humanely Kill a Rodent4," More powerful guns carry the risk of ricocheting or shooting through the rodent. They may also spread biological material further than smaller guns, causing a bigger mess and a greater health hazard. Low power air guns (12fpe), that are .177 calibre are considered the most appropriate., A rodent running free is very difficult to catch, but they are easier to corner. If they cornered, sitting still in a crevice, shooting it with an air-powered BB gun can be an effective and quick way to kill the rodent.This is only envisaged in an emergency situation. Most of the time setting traps in the normal way is preferable to shooting a rodent., If you do decide that shooting the rodent is a good option, ensure that the environment is safe. If the projectile passes through the rodent's head, it may hit people or objects in its path. Make sure the area is free of obstructions before firing.

, A shot to the head should kill the rodent instantly. If you miss the head, quickly reload and shoot the rodent in the head to end its suffering. You should only do this if you are confident that you can kill it quickly, otherwise it is far from humane.


Even a clean shot will be bloody and distressing.

, When mishandled, guns can be deadly. This is true for air guns too. An air rifle or pistol should never be aimed at another person.If you are unsure how to safely operate a gun, use another method to humanely kill the rodent.


You should familiarise yourself with local laws before thinking about shooting a rodent.

"
"
Place the rodent on a solid surface (e.g.,
Press firmly down just behind the head with your fingers.",How to Humanely Kill a Rodent5," on the floor, on the ground).

If the rodent is wet (as when caught by a cat in the early morning hours), better avoid seizing its tail through a plastic bag or gloves, or dry it first (e.g. with a paper towel), to make sure you have a secure grip on its tail.

, You should be able to sense the spine to the back of the skull. Give a sharp jerk on the tail with the other hand.

This will break the rodent's neck and cause its death very shortly, although convulsions are likely to occur.
Try to make sure you do it in one go. It does not take much force, just enough resolve.

Crush egg shells and put them around the windowsills, doors or other areas where ants can enter the house.",How to Stop an Ant Invasion2," This erases of the scent trail that the ants leave for others to follow.

, You can add a little lemon juice to the vinegar if you want to lighten up the scent some.

, Be sure to cover the floor, baseboard, backsplash or any other areas in the direct infestation path.

, Use chopped garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, mint or catnip.

, The shells will act as a natural repellent, and if the ants can't find a way around them you can stop an ant invasion.

, Squirrels can jump directly from the branches to your roof.








, If squirrels and other critters often enter your home, consider placing an animal guard on your chimney. These are often made of stainless steel mesh, so you don't have to remove them when you use your fireplace.

, If a squire does become trapped in your chimney or attic, make sure it has a way to get out. Hang a rope down through your chimney so it can climb back up to the roof. Open a window in the attic and lure it out with squirrel food.








, Home and garden stores sell traps made specifically to capture squirrels without harming them. Set it up in your attic, and when the squirrel is caught, take it outside and release it.

, You may not want to deal with loose squirrels in your attic and chimney on your own. Call animal control to come over and trap the squirrel for you.

, If your roof is nearing the end of its life cycle, it may allow just enough space for a squirrel to fit through. Squirrels in the house pose an electrical risk, because they often chew through wiring.

, Make sure that they are 6 feet (1.8 m) away from your house, roof and garage. For larger trees with big heavy branches, you may need to call a professional tree trimming service. Most squirrels prefer trees for their homes, rather than outbuildings. , Nuts and seeds are a squirrel’s favorite food, so they will be very persistent in trying to get the food. Invest in squirrel-proof bird feeders and suspend them away from a roof or tree.


If you don’t want to give up your bird feeders, you can try buying a safflower seed mix. Many squirrels don’t like this feed. Other alternatives include white proso millet seed and nyjer thistle., Cover the hole in the building with newspaper. If you return the next day to find it's been removed, something is living inside. If a squirrel has nested, try calling animal control or a local pest control business. Give preference to businesses that trap squirrels and let them go in the wild.






Make sure that a trapped squirrel is released at least 3 miles (4.8 km) away, preferably with a body of water between your property and their new home.







, Purchase sheet metal and attach it with metal springs. The collar should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) high to deter enterprising climbers. Smaller trees can be protected with a collar of hardware cloth.






If you find that squirrels are chewing on tree bark, wrap the trunk with hardware cloth.






Ensure you cover each tree in your back yard and power line poles with collars. The squirrels should move on to another house that is easier to climb around.







, Squirrels may be able to outwit dogs, but they will choose an environment without a predator animal over a yard with a dog. Most dogs have an instinct to chase and kill the squirrels.

A dog can keep the squirrels in the trees, rather than near your house or garden.






If you combine this method with tree trimming and tree collars, the squirrels are even more likely to keep away from your property. , If you can’t find buckets to serve this purpose, then you can cover the ground with a very thick layer of leaves. The squirrels can still dig through the leaves, but many sources suggest that they prefer not to.

Do your research about the types of bulbs that attract squirrels and those that don’t. Try planting squirrel-resistant plants.






Squirrels favor crocuses, colchicum, tulips and gladiolus in bulb form. They love to eat corn from the garden.






They prefer not to eat alliums, narcissus, daffodils, amaryllis, Spanish bluebells and hyacinth. , Buy plastic pipe that is 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) in diameter and slit it vertically down the side. The pipe will roll when squirrels attempt to walk along the wire between trees and buildings. , or .30 l) with 1 gallon (3.8 l) of water. Spread the mix on tree bark or other areas where squirrels chew.


Animal experts suggest this only as a last resort. It can be harmful to humans and pets, and it is also less humane than simply making your home less hospitable.

, Unless they are very sensitive, you can apply the capsaicin treatment to the plants themselves to deter squirrels from taking them for food. , This may deter squirrels from eating the mix, but it won’t hurt the birds. "

Make your yard less attractive to woodchucks to discourage them from settling down.,
Keep the woodchucks away from your garden by planting a food source just for them in a separate area away from your plants.",How to Get Rid of Woodchucks1,"


Remove old stumps, wood and brush piles. Woodchucks' teeth are constantly growing, and they need to gnaw on wood to keep their teeth filed down.
Remove or fence off all sources of water. Because woodchucks are good climbers, chewers, and diggers, fences should be at least 3 feet (0.9 m) high (1 m), made of heavy-grade chicken wire, and buried 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) below ground.;
, Alfalfa and clover are a couple of their favorites.

Clean your car thoroughly.,
De-junk the trunk.,
Check under the hood.,
Clean your parking area.,
Exterminate mice with extreme prejudice.",How to Keep Mice Out of Your Vehicle," You have to start thinking like your enemy – and all they want is food and a warm dry place to hang out. When you drop just one French fry between the seat and the console, you have basically sent an engraved invitation to the nearest rodent population. Clean up that nasty car. Vacuum the carpet and use warm water with a mild detergent to scrub it, after testing a small area for colorfastness. Then use a wet/dry vacuum to extract the water. If you don’t have one, rub with dry towels and let it air dry. Clean the seats as well, but be careful – they may not hold up to the same abuse as the carpet.;
, De-junk may not be a real word, but it’s still a must. Your trunk needs to be empty and clean. If it’s July, you don’t need a heavy winter coat in there. If you are hauling some of the kids' toys off to Goodwill – do it – and get them out of there. And for heaven’s sake don’t leave any type of “nesting” material in there: cardboard, newspaper, coats, hay. (Why do you even have hay in your trunk?)

, This is important and easier than you might think. Mice love the engine bay, especially the air filter, cold air intake, air vents, and hood. This is also where most of your delicious wiring that they will be chewing up is located. You want to make sure the air filter and hoses are free of things mice may have stored up (food and nesting material). Get a flashlight and look in the hard-to-access areas around the motor as well for any signs of infestation. If you park inside, leave the hood popped up occasionally so mice don’t make their home in there. It would be even better to go ahead and clean the engine or have it professionally steam-cleaned to ensure all mouse “evidence” is removed.

, In this step you are basically widening your clean-zone from the vehicle outward. This is really where your problems come from. Many people park in home storage areas, which is the mouse equivalent of Utopia. Get rid of all the clutter. Don’t leave anything soft, warm, or that can be used as insulation (cardboard and paper) exposed. Use rubber tubs to store things, especially pet foods. If you park next to an old shed or barn, either move to a new location or bulldoze that rat’s nest to the ground. Less clutter means less rodent hotel space, and less stuff means less free furnishings. It basically makes the neighbor’s house more appealing.

, Now is not the time to get soft. You are probably making mortgage payments, car payments, paying insurance, and so on. While you pay out the nose, those mice trash your stuff and laugh at you. Take the battle to them. Skip all the poisons, live traps, glue boards (which are probably the most inhumane kind of trap ever invented) and go with the trusty old spring-loaded mousetraps. They are cheap, effective, disposable, and practically guarantee instant death. This is much better than poisoning a mouse and having it haunt you with its rotting stench for the next six months. Set them in and around you parking area, out of the reach of children and pets (don’t worry, your mice can get to them). Bait them with peanut butter. If you have a serious infestation, you can even set traps on newspaper in your trunk and on the floorboards of your vehicle – just don’t forget about them!

Protect yourself.,
Assess any available non-lethal options.,
Be conscious of the rodent's condition.,
Attempt to stress the rodent as little as possible.",How to Humanely Kill a Rodent6," Rodents, however small, are wild animals. They may bite if threatened. Additionally, they can transmit a variety of diseases. Wear tough gloves and long sleeves if you must touch them, but you should try to avoid this as much as is possible by using a sealable bag to contain the rodent.

, Live traps are popular among people who don't want to kill rodents as they offer a chance to release the animal into the wild. Also consider removing the cause for the infestation - the presence of rodents can be a symptom of a dirty, food-rich environment for the rodents to live in.


If you use a live trap, you should know that the survival rate for relocated rats is very low, so releasing them to a new location will often result in them dying.Removing the causes for an infestation is the only way to remain rat-free long-term., If the animal is wounded, releasing it into the wild can cause a more painful, drawn-out death than if it were quickly euthanized. It might be unpleasant, but it can be more humane to kill it, if you can do this.

, Agitating the rodent can cause it struggle, flee, or fight. Minimize unnecessary stimulation - handle the rodent gently, don't shine bright lights at it, and don't make loud noises.

Inspect wood that's suspected to be damaged.,
Look for other evidence of termite infestation.,
Listen for clues.,
Learn to distinguish termites from other household pests.",How to Spot Termite Damage1," If you suspect termite infestation, cut away a piece of wood at the site, if possible. Different types of termites leave distinctly different patterns of damage in wood.


Subterranean termites devour soft wood and eat along the grain. This produces a distinct honeycomb pattern in the wood. It is crucial to stop subterranean termites as soon as the infestation is discovered. One type, the Formosan termite, is especially voracious, due largely to its massive numbers. Formosan termite colonies can number in the millions. Left unchecked, these pests can inflict considerable damage on homes, fences and utility poles.
Drywood termites excavate large sections of wood by chewing along and against the wood grain. Their appearance is serious, but less so than most subterranean types. Drywood colonies usually number only a few thousand members and usually take several years to reach that number. Even when they reach such numbers, the entire colony eats only about 1/2 pound of wood per year.;
, If you look carefully, you may be able to find clues of termite infestations, even if you're unable to see the insect itself. Visual signs of a termite colony can include floors that buckle or sag, loose tiles, pinpoint holes in drywall, damaged wood crumbles easily, or wood that sounds hollow when tapped. Shelter tubes running from the soil to above-ground wood. When subterranean termites exhaust their natural sources of wood, they will move to structures. They do this by building small, enclosed passageways, or tubes, to ensure safe access to the building. The tubes are made from soil, saliva, fecal matter and other material. The tubes indicate that termites are active.
Drywood termites live inside wooden constructions, including structural timber, furniture and hardwood floors. Because they live inside the areas they feed on, they're almost never seen outside the colony. But they do leave signs of their presence. Drywood termites push fecal pellets, called frass, outside their tunnels and chambers. These wood-colored mounds accumulate on flooring under infested sections of wood. , When conducting a periodic inspection of your home, tap sections of wood with a large screwdriver. If the wood sounds hollow, it might have been damaged by a wood-boring pest. Inside your home, hold a stethoscope or other device against different walls. You won't be able to hear termites, but carpenter ants make soft, rustling sounds as they rummage around in their chambers., Termites are just one of several types of wood-boring insects that damage homes. Carpenter ants and certain beetles also devour wood. It's important to determine which pest has infiltrated your home in order to chart the proper course of action against the colony. The easiest way to figure out if your home is threatened by termites or another pest is to closely examine the insect. Termites have certain characteristics different from ants and beetles.Worker termites often are pale yellow in color and have soft bodies. Carpenter ants and beetles are usually much darker in color and have hard exoskeletons.
Termites have straight antennae, very different from the elbowed antennae of carpenter ants.
Because termites usually are hidden from view, it's easiest to determine the type of infestation by examining the winged version of the insect. When a termite colony gets large enough, winged reproductive termites will emerge to create a new colony. Termites have 2 sets of wings of the same size. In carpenter ants, the front wings are much longer than the rear set. Beetles have a set of hard wings that protect the delicate wings used for flight. The hard wings are part of the insect's exoskeleton and fold out from the body during flight.
Termites have no discernible waist along their segmented bodies. Carpenter ants have a very distinct pedicle that joins the thorax to the abdomen.

Apply repellents to plants groundhogs like to eat.,
Fumigate woodchucks in their burrows.,
Spray a pest repellent on your flowers and plants.",How to Get Rid of Woodchucks2," Try hot pepper spray, dried blood or talcum powder. Urine from one of their natural predators (fox, dog or raccoon) may also deter woodchucks.








, You can buy gas cartridges that produce carbon monoxide and other lethal gasses.









Locate all of a burrow's entrances. Block off all but the main one using a rock or a chunk of sod.
Light the cartridge, following manufacturer's instructions, and throw it into the burrow's main entrance. Block off the main entrance to the burrow to prevent the groundhogs from escaping.

,









The repellent will give the plants a bitter taste that woodchucks dislike.
Continue to spray the plants as they grow and after it rains.

Identify the presence of woodworm.,
Determine the extent of the damage.,
Try to dry out the wood.",How to Treat Woodworm1," Woodworm refers to the damage caused by wood-destroying insects that start out as eggs on the surface of the wood, and spend most of their lives as larvae under the surface.Identify woodworm by scanning the surface of the wood for a series of tiny holes on the surface, resembling pinpricks; these occur when the insect matures and exits the wood. Small heaps of powdery sawdust are also a sign;make sure to inspect the entire surface since the condition may only affect one small section of the wood.


Look up pictures of woodworm to be sure that you are diagnosing the problem correctly.;
, In many cases, woodworm damage is found along the upper layer of the wood, while the heart and surrounding layers remain untouched. When this is the case, the wood item will still be strong and salvageable. If the wood crumbles or breaks off with ease when handled, this is a sign that there is not much hope of saving the item, even after a treatment.

, Before attempting any other treatments, try to dry out the affected wood; moisture is required to sustain the life of woodworm larvae, so drying the wood may solve the problem on its own.Place small pieces of furniture on a radiator or in the oven, and place larger items in a closet or small room with a space heater. Aim to heat to 140 degrees F and keep at this temperature for 24 hours to kill eggs, larvae and fully grown insects.Monitor items carefully while heating to avoid overheating wood or upholstery.

Look for dead termites, termite wings, or termite droppings.,
Examine wood in your house for small holes or sawdust-like matter.,
Look for paint that has bubbled or cracked.,
Knock on non-hollowed walls to see if they’ve been hollowed by the termites.,
Look at places that have moisture or cellulose material.",How to Protect Your Home from Termites1," These signs are a dead giveaway that you have a termite infestation.Termites are similar in appearance to winged ants. Unlike ants however, termites often shed their wings.Termites will leave worm-like mud tunnels that are visible on the surface of walls within your house. These tunnels are used to protect worker termites.To determine if it’s an ant or a termite, look at its antennae. If they are bent, this is a sign you have flying ants. If they are straight then they are termites.;
, Termites like to live in dark, damp places and will often bore into wet wood to find a home.Look for sawdust like material around any holes or cracks around your house.


The sawdust like matter is known as frass, which is a form of termite excrement.Probe the small holes with a pin or other thin object to see if you can locate an exit hole for the termites., Termite tunnels that run too close to the paint on the surface of a wall will leave blisters and cracks.This is a sign that termites have created colonies in the walls of your house.


Common places to look include your door, window frames, trim, perimeter, walls, and baseboards, especially if your house is constructed of wood.Check any place in your house that contains wood if you suspect there are termites.

, Termites are capable of breaking down cellulose in wood which creates a digestible food source for them.Sometimes this can include entire walls.


Solid walls should make a thud noise and sound like there is something behind it.
If your walls make a hollow or echoey sound when you knock on them, there’s a good chance your walls are hollow and you have termites., Termites are attracted to wet wood, whether it be a part of your house or a wood pile next to your property. These are the most likely places you’ll find termites, so examine these areas of your property carefully.


Leaking pipes over wood flooring make a perfect breeding ground for termites.
Recycle leftover wood after you landscape to prevent your property from attracting termites.

Use a commercial aerosol.,
Make a natural peppermint spray.Peppermint oil kills flying ants via suffocation.,
Spray the ants with dish soap.,
Lay out some diatomaceous earth.,
Invest in a bug zapper.,
Trap ants with tape.,
Track down the nest.In order to get rid of the flying ants for good, you will need to follow them back to the nest responsible for sending them out.,
Use a commercial pesticide.,
Create a trap of borax and sugar.,
Use boiling water.,
Set a trap using baking soda and powdered sugar.,
Kill the ants with artificial sweetener.",How to Kill Flying Ants," There are a variety of commercial bug poisons you can use against ants of all varieties, and any ant spray should be effective against flying ants. To get to the ants mid-flight, choose an aerosol variety with an easy-to-direct spout.


Always follow the label instructions to prevent accidental and potentially hazardous misuse.
Never direct aerosol poisons at any other person or animal in your household.
Make sure that the poison you use is safe to use indoors if you plan on killing flying ants indoors.
You also need to verify that the aerosol you plan to use is legal in your area.;
, You can mix peppermint oil with water and soap in a spray bottle to create your own natural aerosol insecticide.


Combine one part liquid soap and with two parts water in a spray bottle, then add several drops of peppermint essential oil. Mix well to combine. Spray this solution on any flying ants you see, either at rest or in flight.

, Dish soap alone is effective against flying ants since it sticks to the ants' bodies and dehydrates them to death. To make a solution that you can easily use to attack flying ants, dilute the dish soap with water inside a standard spray bottle.


Fill a bottle with water and add a few squirts of liquid dish soap. Mix well so that the soap is evenly distributed throughout the water. Spray winged ants in flight or at rest when you see them.

, Diatomaceous earth works against ants by dehydrating them to death. Lay a perimeter around potential food sources. If the ant steps into it, its body will be pierced by the small, jagged granules. The ant will eventually die from these wounds.


Use food grade diatomaceous earth so that it is safer to use around kids and pets.
Sprinkle the DE in any area you expect to find ants. The closer it is to a food source, the better, since flying ants are more likely to land at a spot directly next to the food rather than a spot further away.
Do not wet the DE. It should be kept dry so that the sharp granules work as effectively as possible.
Since the ants have to cross into the DE directly, there is no guarantee that it will be effective against flying ants, since flying ants might find a way to access the food source without crawling over the DE surrounding it. As a powerful ant killer, though, you may still find DE worth trying.

, An electric bug zapper works well against many different types of flying insects, and flying ants are no exception. Hang the bug zapper in an area you typically catch flying ants in and wait for the device to take care of the problem for you.When hanging bug zappers, place them in open areas that insects can fly into easily. It is also important to place them out of the reach of pets or children. While the electricity produced by the bug zapper is not usually enough to cause any severe harm to larger pets, like dogs and cats, or to most children, the shock produced can still be painful.
The bug zapper itself should lure the flying ants toward it.
Follow the instructions carefully to avoid misusing the bug zapper in a potentially hazardous way.

, Lay a perimeter of tape around potential food sources. When the ants land on the tape, they will get stuck and will be unable to fly away.In order for this to be effective, you need to place the sticky side of the tape up and position it as close to the food source as possible. Flying ants are less likely to land on the tape if it is not directly next to the food source.
Since flying ants travel by flying instead of crawling, this treatment is not always the most effective. After all, you cannot guarantee that the flying ants will land on the tape since, technically, there is some chance that they can fly around it. Nonetheless, as a non-toxic, inexpensive option, it may still be worth a chance.

, Killing the colony of ants will provide you with a more permanent solution.


Understand that flying ants are only the sexually active forms of other species of ants. In other words, they are not a separate species of ant at all. When you find the colony flying ants belong to, it will consist of mostly wingless ants. If you want to kill the flying ants, though, you need to kill the wingless colony those ants come from.
Try to follow ants back to the colony by observing them. If you can find the anthill they come from, you can attack the hill directly. If you are unable to find the actual nest, though, you can still attack flying ants at the source by spreading poisons that flying ants and wingless ants can take back to the colony.

, Ant bait and other commercial poisons are effective against flying ants as long as they are labeled for use against ants in general. Look for pesticides that the ants will carry back to the nest since these will do the most damage.


Ant baits are among the most effective ant killers, especially when you are dealing with flying ants. The ants take the bait back to the colony, where the queen consumes it and dies. After the queen dies, the rest of the colony soon follows.
Ant baits come in the form of gels, granules, and stations.Most are safe for use around pets and children, but nonetheless, you should keep them out of reach when possible.
Note that these baits can be sugar-based or protein-based, and different bases will attract different species of ants. If one does not work, try the other.
Always follow the instructions carefully to avoid misusing the poison in a potentially dangerous way.

, Borax is highly toxic to ants, but if you mix it with something sweet, the ants will not detect the poisonous scent and will carry the sweet-smelling food back to the colony. When the queen and the rest of the colony eat the borax, the ants will die off.


Combine equal parts borax and sugar. Slowly add water to the combination, mixing continually, until a paste develops. Spread this paste onto a piece of cardboard and place the cardboard in an area that flying ants are known to linger in. The ants should be drawn to the paste, and if it works correctly, they should take some back to the rest of the colony.
Note that borax pastes like this tend to dry out in a few days, so you might need to make more if the first batch does not take care of the probably right away.
Be careful when using borax around pets and small children, since it is poisonous to them, as well.

, After you find the ant colony, pour boiling water over the anthill. Ants faced directly with the boiling water can be scalded, and the rest will likely move away from the area in response to the new threat and the damage you just inflicted.


The water should be more than just a little hot; it needs to be boiling. Boil as much water as you can in a kettle. As soon as the water is ready, remove it from the heat and take it directly to the anthill. Douse the anthill with the water while it is still as hot as possible.
Consider placing a flowerpot upside down over the anthill before you boil the ants out. Pour the water onto the anthill through the drain hole at the bottom of the flowerpot. Doing this traps the ants while protecting you against bites and stings issued by any escapees.

, Baking soda is another material that can kill ants. By mixing it with powdered sugar, you mask the odor and cause flying ants to take it back to the queen and to the nest. The ants that eat it will die.


The baking soda reacts with an acidic substance ants naturally carry around inside for the sake of protection. When the baking soda mixes with this acid, a violent reaction develops and kills the ants as a result.

, Certain types of artificial sweetener are extremely toxic to ants, yet the sweet scent is often enough to lure them in. The artificial sweetener gets carried back to the queen and to the nest, and all the ants that consume it die off.


Aspartame, in particular, is known for acting as a neurotoxin to ants.
Mix a little artificial sweetener with some apple juice, adding just enough apple juice to form a paste. The ants will eat some of this paste and carry some back to the rest of the colony. Once consumed there, the ant population will dwindle.

Figure out where the ants are entering your house.,
Place bait near the entry point to poison the ants.,
Make sure windows and doors are sealed tightly.,
Clean the floor after each meal.,
Wash the dishes after every meal.,
Empty the garbage daily.",How to Kill Sugar Ants1," Before you address your ant problem, you will need to find out how the ants are getting into your house. Common points of entry include windows and doors. Cracks or holes in the walls and floors are also common places where ants can enter a house.;
, Once you figure out where the ants are entering your home, you will need to place ant bait near the entry point. The ants will then carry the bait back to their nest. This will likely result in the death of the ant colony., Ants can enter your home through doors and windows, so it is important to keep them sealed as tightly as possible. Seal any holes or cracks as soon as you discover them. Taking care of these issues can help you prevent an infestation of sugar ants in your home. It can also keep your house free of ants after you kill them with ant bait.

, Keeping your floors clear of food debris can help prevent sugar ant infestations. Sweep or vacuum food and crumbs from the floor after eating. Then mop the area to eliminate sticky residues., It is important that you keep the kitchen sink and surrounding areas clean. Dirty dishes and food debris will attract sugar ants. Try to clean the dishes and countertops after each meal. If you must leave dirty dishes out, make sure you rinse them thoroughly., Taking the trash out every day will eliminate possible sources of food for sugar ants. Make sure you take out the garbage at least once a day. You can also use a trash can with a tightly sealed lid to help deter ants."

Get rid of dead trees and stumps around your yard.,
Use treated wood to build structures.,
Inspect common termite entry points.,
Avoid spreading mulch too close to your home.,
Install termite shields.,
Decide how badly the wood is damaged.,
Use a wood filler or hardener.,
Replace the wood completely.",How to Spot Termite Damage2," Decaying wood is top food source for termites and can attract a colony of hungry termites. If you keep a lot of firewood or spare construction materials on hand, keep them as far away from your house as possible. If you bring this wood into your house, make sure to look for signs of termite presence like holes in the wood or hollowed feeling or sound.

, The chemicals in treated wood can act as a deterrent to termites. If you build something outside like a gazebo, deck, or anything above ground, treated wood can help make it less appealing to a wandering colony of termites.

, The most common way they get into your house is through wood to ground contact, such as a door frame, deck posts, or wood support beams. Address these spots by examining them for signs of termites regularly, get rid of any standing water in the area, and treat the wood with termite prevention like soil treatments that repel termites. , You can have mulch in your home but you'll want to avoid putting it anywhere that it may touch your siding or foundation. Mulch creates moisture in the soil and prevents woods from growing, both conditions termites seek. This also includes your plants. Woody shrubs that touch the wood foundation or siding of your house can help attract termites and also help hide their presence.

, This can be especially helpful if you are currently constructing a home. These are metal shields put along the foundation of your home to deter termites. These should be made of a non-corroding metal with no gaps. This can prevent termites from getting access to the wood foundations or structures of your home. , If the wood is completely hollowed out, or completely rotted, you will not be able to repair it and will need to replace the wood.


Remove the damaged wood. Once you see there are parts of the wood that are damaged or completely rotten, you will want to use a chisel to remove these parts.

, You can fill in damaged parts of wood using a wood filler or hardener. Use a putty knife to spread the filler or hardener in parts of the wood that were damaged or ate away at by the termites. Allow it to dry over night. Make sure to get any bubbles out of the filler or hardener so that you do not leave any gaps in the wood. Wood filler is best for long hallowed out groovers and hardener is good for larger gaps.

, If it is a structure like a deck, your best bet will be simply removing the affected pieces of wood and replacing them with new pieces.


You can do this yourself or call a contractor, depending on how handy you are.

Harass the woodchucks to get rid of them.,
Fill the woodchuck's hole with poly tree netting.",How to Get Rid of Woodchucks3," For harassment to be an effective means of wildlife control, it must be continuous and concentrated.









Fill burrow holes and block any spots that give woodchucks access to their holes. You may have to refill the holes several times before woodchucks give up and move on.
Spread thick molasses or another sticky substance around burrow entrances. Woodchucks will go to great lengths to avoid getting sticky things on their bodies. Reapply the substance after every rain.
Set up motion-activated sprinklers that blast the groundhogs with water. Move the sprinklers around periodically so they do not learn how to avoid them.

, This is the same netting you'd use to keep birds off a berry tree. Leave some extra sticking up out of the ground.









Add a heavy rock on top of the hole to hold the netting and fill the entrance. Groundhogs will come back again and again because they smell previous groundhog urine in the area. They will try to repeatedly try to open the hole up.
If you fill the hole up by adding the netting, they'll get it tangled in their feet when they try to re-dig the hole.This does not hurt the animal because they will chew off anything that gets wrapped around their paw. It does get them aggravated to the point where they will leave and not come back.

Purchase boron powder to make a treatment solution.,
Take precautions before using the treatment.,
Prepare the treatment solution.,
Coat the surface of the damaged wood.",How to Treat Woodworm2," Visit a hardware store to purchase a boron chemical powder; boron-based treatments are one of the safer options for an amateur to use.Ask the salesperson there for tips on applying the solution, and purchase other items you might need for the treatment:


Garden sprayer
Face mask
Protective goggles
Safety gloves

, Chemical compounds can produce fumes that cause adverse reactions if touched or inhaled. If possible, bring the infected item outside for treatment; before working with the solution, take the time to put on a face mask along with a pair of safety goggles and gloves. This will minimize exposure to the skin and eyes and prevent inhalation of the gases released during the treatment phase. Make sure to cover the ground underneath the item as well.

, Boron powder is quite concentrated, so follow the instructions for mixing it with water very carefully. Respect the ratio of water to solution; the exact ratio will be indicated on the packaging and should be adhered to perfectly. When making a certain amount of the solution, factor in the size of the wooden item being treated and how many coats you will want to use.Pour the prepared treatment solution into a garden sprayer, making sure the unit is sealed tight to avoid accidentally spilling any of the solution.


Be sure to keep the chemicals away from children and pets.

, Apply an even coat of the treatment solution to the wood surface. Allow the coat to dry before attempting to move the wood; leave the item at least an hour before going back to check on it.This drying time will allow the solution to permeate the wood surface and help expedite the woodworm eradication.


The solution can also be applied with a large paintbrush to get at small or hard to reach areas.

Prepare for extermination treatments.",How to Treat Woodworm3," If the woodworm infestation is too extensive, or if the woodworms have penetrated too deeply into the wood, you will need to turn to professional exterminators for help. Do-it-yourself chemical treatments only penetrate the surface layers of the wood and will be ineffective if the infestation is too severe. Signs that your woodworm infestation is severe enough to hire an exterminator include:


Crumbling woodWeak and damaged floorboardsVisible eggs, larvae or adult insects (beetles), Look online for reviews and recommendations of exterminators in your area. Ask friends or colleagues if they have dealt with similar issues, or if they have recommendations for local extermination companies. Call different companies for quotes and assessments before booking an appointment.

, Once you know what plan of action the exterminator will be taking to treat your woodworm problem, plan ahead. If fumigation is needed, find a place to stay while that occurs. Other methods employed by exterminators might include:

Call in a professional to remove the termites.",How to Protect Your Home from Termites2," A termiticide treatment will not only kill termites in the ground, but will protect your house from any termites trying to burrow into it.Create a trench around your house, then spray termiticide in a perimeter around your house, in the trench, which will create a natural barrier.


This treatment is a lot easier to perform when you are building a new house.
Trenching may be necessary if your house is already built., Termite bait is a poison that slowly acts to kill termites. It also spreads the poison around the colony to eradicate the infestation.Place the baits in a perimeter around your house, each bait being 10-12 feet apart. Add additional baits in areas where there is high termite activity.


Termite baits are made of cardboard, paper, or other cellulose material, with a lethal poison for termites.You can use either above or below ground baits.

, Nematodes are roundworms that can kill termites.Expose the termite colonies to nematodes by releasing them in areas where there is high termite activity.


This is not always the most effective method of extermination. Nematodes have varying mortality rates depending on their environment.
The Steinernema carpocapsae is one of the most effective types of nematode to eradicate termites and other wood borers., While do-it-yourself methods may seem appealing, your best solution is to hire a professional to remove the termites. Look online for exterminators who specialize in removal of termites and their colonies. Make sure to read user reviews and choose an exterminator who has a good reputation.


Calling in a professional may cost more money initially, but will save you money on repairing structural damage around your house.
Talk about future prevention methods with the exterminator as well.

Get termite inspections done annually by a professional.,
Remove cellulose based debris from around your house.,
Eliminate wood to ground contact in your house.,
Have your house pre-treated for termites.,
Remove termite access by filling cracks in your house.",How to Protect Your Home from Termites3," A professional exterminator will typically have the knowledge to spot a termite infestation before it’s too late. The earlier you catch termites, the easier it is to deal with them.


If you live in a densely wooded area, you may be more prone to termites.
Make sure the service is part of the National Pest Control Association or your local or state pest control association.Ensure that the company offers a guarantee with their service.

, If you have any sort of organic material made of wood around your house, make sure you’re disposing of it. The longer it’s allowed to stay out and gain moisture, the more likely it will attract termites to your location.


You can make compost out of your landscaping trimmings.Breaking it down will prevent termites from infesting the wood.
Another alternative is to contact your local municipality and ask about wood recycling in your area.

, Termites can enter your house easily if there is wood making contact with the ground. Some examples of this include a wood lattice, wood siding, and door or window frames that make contact with the ground. Anything made of wood should be at least six inches above ground level, to prevent termites from getting into your house.You may have to put a concrete base on some wooded items on your house.
Cutting off the base of wood lattice work that touches the ground will help you keep termites out of your house.

, If you're building a new home make sure to consider getting your house pre-treated for termite prevention. It’s much easier to set a termite barrier with termiticide before you begin construction, by creating the barrier on the land where the house will be.


If you live in the southwest of the US, you should highly consider this option, as this is where most termites are found., After locating where you think the termites may be coming from, make sure to fill the holes and treat the surrounding area with termiticide to prevent further termite infestations. Laying down termite poison around entry points will kill them before they can begin boring new tunnels.

Poison ants with boric acid and honey.,
Try killing ants with borax and sugar.,
Spray the ants with white vinegar.,
Spray lemon juice on visible ants.",How to Kill Sugar Ants2," Mix equal parts honey and boric acid in a bowl. Stir the honey and boric acid together to form a paste. Place the paste on cardboard and place the cardboard in the area where ants are entering your home. Make a new trap every two days until the ants are gone., Mix 1.5 tablespoons of Borax with 1.5 cups of water and 0.5 cup of sugar. Dip multiple cotton balls in the solution until they are saturated. Place the cotton balls on jar lids where you see the ants traveling., Add equal parts white vinegar and distilled water to a spray bottle. Spray the solution directly on the ants. Then spray the vinegar solution on the places where ants are entering your home, and on the trails they take. This will help kill the ants’ pheromone trails and can discourage them from returning., Like vinegar, the acid in lemon juice can kill ants and eliminate pheromone trails. Add four tablespoons of lemon juice to an eight-ounce spray bottle. Spray the solution directly on the ants to kill them, and on entry-points and trails to discourage re-entry."

Select an ant bait labeled for ants.,
Follow directions carefully.,
Understand aerosol sprays have little impact on the ant nest.",How to Kill Sugar Ants3," If you decide to kill sugar ants with commercial bait, make sure the package is clearly labeled for ants. Common household baits include abamectin, fipronil, sulfluramid, propoxur, and orthoboric acid., Make sure you carefully read all the directions on the package of the commercial ant bait. If the product label advises you to take precautions, like wearing gloves while handling the bait, make sure you follow these directions.

, Using ant bait, either commercial or natural, is the best way to eliminate sugar ants. Aerosol sprays can kill ants on contact, but will not impact the remaining ant population. If you choose an aerosol insecticide like permethrin, bifenthrin, or cyfluthrin, make sugar it is labeled for indoor use."

Identify the queen.,
Find the nest.,
Disrupt the nest to look for the queen.",How to Kill the Queen Ant1," Depending on the species of ant, the queen may be easy or hard to identify. In some species, the queen is much larger than the other ants. However, the easiest way to spot the queen ant is to look for the ant with wings. Queen ants in most species will have wings at some point in their life.Because they have wings, after they lose them you can see where the wings were attached.
Queens have a larger thorax (the middle section of the body) than other ants.;
, You may need to find the nest so you can kill the queen. The location of the nest depends on the type of ant. Some ants set up nests in the wood or flooring of your home. Others will be in garden sheds, potting soil, or gardens. Some ants will be in hills around your yard.Don’t kill the ants if you don’t know where the nest is. Follow the ant trail to the nest.

, Sometimes, you may come across the queen ant around the nest. To try and urge the queen ant out, knock over the ant hill or disrupt it somehow. If you see the queen ant, kill her.Be careful when doing this so you don’t get bitten. Never use this method with fire ants.

Live traps are the most environmentally friendly and humane, because they don’t kill the rats. Instead, they trap living rats so you can relocate them.Glue traps are extremely inhumane. Animals caught in them often cause themselves severe injuries trying to escape, and they usually die of starvation or dehydration.Snap traps are a less inhumane trap for dealing with rats when you intend to kill the animal. They are spring-loaded and designed to kill the rat quickly. Use a metal or quality plastic one that can be reused.
Electrical traps are also less inhumane than glue traps, but are also designed to kill the animal.;
, Trap placement is very important when you're trying to get rid of rats. Once they’ve established themselves in a building, rats will tend to follow the same paths over and over again, so if you don’t get the traps in these locations, you may not catch them.Place your traps:


Close to where you’ve found any droppings.Along the base of walls, at a 90-degree angle to the walls, and with the baited end closest to the wall.Out of the way of people, children, pets, and other wildlife.Two or three in a row, especially with spring traps, to stop the rat from just jumping over it.

, If you have pets or children in the home, you should take extra precautions to prevent them from getting hurt with a trap. Instead of leaving the traps out and exposed, place them inside a lidded cardboard box. Cut a square or round hole (about three to four inches) in either side of the box, and then place the box where you would normally put the trap., When you bait a snap trap, be sure the food is securely attached to the mechanism that trips the spring,and use the least bait possible to prevent the rat from just running off with it.There are many different foods you can use to bait a trap to catch a rat, but some of their favorites include:


Peanut butter (either mix it with oats or spread it over a cotton ball)Pumpkin seedsApples, bananas, or other fruit
Meat, and especially baconVegetables, and especially corn, Some traps, like a live or electric trap, you can set right away. But with snap traps, you may have to bait the trap once or twice before actually setting it. Rats can be quite cautious of new things in their environment, so if they set off a trap that’s baited and set without being caught, they won’t go near another one in the future. You can get them used to the trap by baiting it a few times without setting it, and allowing them to eat the bait.Once you’ve baited the trap a couple times and the rat has eaten the food, set the trap.
For some snap traps, you'll just have to pull the lever back to set them,but with others you have to pull back the bar attached to the spring, then wedge the pin into the metal trigger., Never touch a wild rat without the protection of gloves, even if the animal is dead. With live traps, take the entire trap to a nearby field or forest, open the trap and let the animal escape.


To deal with a dead rat, wrap the body in two plastic bags, sealing each separately. You can then dispose of the body according to local by-laws, such as by burying it or throwing it in the garbage.If you happen to find a live rat caught it a glue trap, you can free the animal by massaging cooking oil or mineral oil around the glue where the animal is stuck. Eventually the oil will remove the glue’s stickiness, and the animal can then be freed and transferred to a shoe box for relocation., If you have a large infestation of rats that have already taken up residence in your home or on your property, there are green ways that you can get rid of them. Pet cats are one such way, as cats instinctively prey on mice, rats, and other rodents, and have been used for a very long time in agrarian societies to keep pests away from grain and food stores.


If you don’t have a cat, consider visiting your local shelter to see if they have any cats available for adoption. Inquire about whether any of them are known mousers., Like cats, some dog breeds-—particularly terriers—can be excellent rodent hunters. If you're more of a dog person and are able to take on the full responsibility of being a pet guardian, visit your local shelter and see what kinds of terriers they have available for adoption.


Not only will the dog be able to hunt any rats that are already on the property, but they will deter new ones from moving in., Barn owls are found all over the world, and they love eating mice, rats, and other rodents. While you can't keep one as a pet to deal with your rodent problem, you can encourage a barn owl to take up residence near your property, and it will hunt and consume rodents in large numbers.Barn owl boxes are simple to make as a DIY project, or you can purchase them online.

, Peppermint and plants in the mint family may act as natural repellents for rodents, and there are a few ways you can use them around your house to deter rats:Plant mint around your house, especially in any areas that you know rats frequent.
Soak cotton balls with peppermint oil and place them around access points, such as doors and windows.
Fill a spray bottle with one cup (240 ml) water and add in 25 drops of peppermint oil. Shake well, and spray this solution around the outside of your home, on doors, windows, and outbuildings.

, Rataway is a specially blended and concentrated fragrance that’s designed to remove the odors left behind by rodents and other animals. While it may not get rid of a rat that’s already in your house, it will prevent others from being attracted by the smells left behind by rodents that have already been there.Rataway gets mixed with water in a spray bottle and sprayed on areas where rats have been, marked territory, urinated, or left other odors.

, Second-generation rodenticides are poisons that will kill an animal with one dose, meaning other animals—such as pets—are just as likely to die from eating them as the rats are. Moreover, these toxins tend to stay in the body, meaning they can also poison scavengers and birds of prey.Avoid rat poisons that contain ingredients like:Difenacoum
Difethialone
Brodifacoum
Bromadiolone

, If you have a rat infestation and are looking for a quick fix, there are poisons out there you can use that will kill the rats without endangering other creatures. First-generation baits are highly toxic to the animals that consume them, but are much less likely to poison other animals as well. These poisons require several feedings before a lethal dose is delivered. Look for active ingredients such as:Chlorophacinone
Diphacinone
Warfarin or warfarin sodium salt
Sodium salt, The best way to get rid of rats from around your property and to prevent them from coming back is to remove anything that might attract them, and this includes food, shelter, nest material, and even openings into your home. Rats will eat most anything, so avoid storing food outside. If you're going to store food in a garage, basement, or shed, store it in rodent-proof containers.This includes:Pet food
Birdseed
Organic fertilizer
Fallen fruit and vegetables from the garden
Pet droppings
Water sources (fix leaky faucets and cover pools and drains)
Garbage
Compost (turn it frequently and use a pest-proof composter)

, Rats aren't as picky as humans when it comes to where they live, so where you might see a pile of trash, a rat will see a perfectly good home. Pick up, remove, or cut down anything from around your property that a rat might use to make a nest, such as:


Yard waste
Construction materials
Wood piles
Garbage and junk
Furniture and old carsOvergrown grass, weeds, and bushes, Holes, vents, openings, and other access points into your home might as well be a welcome sign for rats and other creatures. On top of removing attractants from outside, it’s also a good idea to cover any access points that rats could use to enter your house. When doing this, be sure to use materials that rats can't eat through, such as wire mesh, concrete, or mortar.Plug all holes in walls and floors that are more than a half inch (1.25 cm) in diameter.Cover vents, crawl spaces, and access points.
Fill in gaps where pipes or lines enter the home.
Fix gaps in doors, windows, and siding.
Repair foundation cracks.Cover openings in the chimney, as rats can drop down onto the roof from tree branches."

Take note that ants adore sweet things.,
Do not leave bags or other containers that hold sweet things open to ants.,
Clear things away.,
Make sure to thoroughly clean out any appliances that you keep out on the counter, such as stand-up mixers.,
Remove all crumbs.,
Dump the crumbs out of your toaster regularly.,
Line the borders of your cupboards with ground black pepper as an extra precaution.,
Remove the ant and its trail.,
Use traps.",How to Prevent Ants in the Kitchen," For the ant, sugar is a high-energy food source and allows the ant to work less for the same amount of energy.Therefore, the ant is attracted to anything sugary. This means that it is important to make sure that ants cannot find sugar in your kitchen.


If you spill sugar or something containing sugar, like fruit juice, wipe it up thoroughly and immediately.
For sticky messes like juice, a cleaning spray is useful to help lift the mess away and prevent any residue from sticking to kitchen surfaces.
A spray made from natural products is ideal because it is safe to use around food.;
, Put your sugar and other sweet products into containers that can be tightly sealed, such as plastic containers with airtight lids. This will also help keep your sugar fresh and prevent it hardening!

, After you finish having a meal, do not leave dirty dishes in the sink. The food residue on such items provides an easy meal for ants and is similar to leaving bait out for them. If you must leave dirty dishes around, rinse any leftover food off of the plates.

, Any traces of food will draw ants to your kitchen.

, Another thing that ants love is crumbs, because they are easy to carry around and take back to the queen. Regularly cleaning your counter tops will remove crumbs. Vacuuming out your pantry and cupboards from time to time will also take care of any bits of food that have escaped their containers.


A hose on your vacuum is useful for hard-to-reach places. This step is especially important if you keep kitchen appliances under the counter, where crumbs can fall out and be easily picked up by ants on the floor.

, Otherwise, they accumulate and provide a pile of food for ants.

, Ants hate black pepper and will not cross lines of it,which protects your food and appliances. You should also find any cracks in your kitchen, such as around windows, and block them off with pepper.

, If you see an ant around, kill it immediately (or try to remove it without killing it, if you prefer) and wipe up the place where you found it. Ants leave invisible trails that other ants can follow.

, As a last resort, if you notice ants invading despite your efforts, you can place ant traps in your cupboards and around your counter. Always be wary of using any kind of poisonous trap around your food, and read labels carefully.

"
"
First find the site of the infestation.,
Stop eating food around the spot of infestation, and if they are just there for a visit, make sure it isn't an enjoyable visit.

,
Now, you are going to use the ingredients.,
Get a few segments of your lint roller/remover tape strips, and put some of the cracker bait onto it.,
Lay the traps around carefully, and set a timer to an hour and a half.

,
Boil some water 5 minutes before the timer rings.

,
Check the trap when the timer rings, there should be ants in the trap.,
Cover the ant filled trap with paper and tape it together.,
Go home and take your double sided tape and put it a the wall, along with your cracker mix(stick it onto the tape before putting it on the wall).",How to Make an Ant Trap Using Cracker Bait," If you find the site of infestation, you've hit the jackpot.;
,, First, get some crackers, 10 of them should be saltine, and 2 should be unsalted. Crumble the crackers together in a sandwich. And tons of salt(3 teaspoons) to the crumbled crackers in the bag, also some cornmeal.

, Be careful not to spill any.

,,, Also the cornmeal and the salt should have killed them.

, Now for the pesky ants that just won't die, uncover the trap outdoors, and pour the boiled water onto the ant trap.

, Any leftovers will go to the wall and try to get the crackers. Those ants should die, and pour more boiled water on them.

Use hot water.,
Try borax.,
Try cornstarch.",How to Kill the Queen Ant2," One natural way you can try to kill the queen ant is to use water to flush the colony. Start with about two to three gallons of boiling water. Pour it directly onto the ant hill. This should kill any ant it touches, including the queen ant.Don’t do this to fire ants. If you accidentally get any on you, you can get injured.

, Making a solution of borax or boric acid and a sugary substance can help kill ants, including the queen. Mix ¾ of microwave heated maple syrup or honey with ¼ cup of borax. Stir until smooth and combined. This creates a liquid bait for the adult ants. To make a solid bait that will kill larva, use the same ratio of powdered sugar to borax, mixing until it is combined.Place large drops of the baits in the middle of a trail of ants, including any walls, railings, or sidewalks. Place the liquid and solid mixtures along the trail as you near the nest. If there are multiple trails, do it on each trail.
Don’t place borax in the garden or on soil. If you have ants in your garden, place the solution on something to protect the soil and your plants.
You can buy borax at the supermarket or home improvement stores.
Borax is toxic. Make sure to prevent pets and children from getting into this solution.

, Cornstarch is another natural method you can try to kill the queen ant. Place a line of cornstarch around the nest or ant hill. The ants will take the cornstarch into the colony to be used as food. The fiber content in the starch will make the ants swell and die, including the queen if she eats the cornstarch.This may take a while to work, but may be more effective and long-lasting.

Use insect killer.,
Try cleaning supplies.,
Use ant bait.,
Hire a professional.",How to Kill the Queen Ant3," If you know where the nest is, use spray insect or ant killer to kill the ants and the queen. Read the label to look for specific ingredients, like bifenthrin, permethrin, or deltamethrin. Make sure to follow the instructions exactly since ant killer is toxic.Make sure to use caution with any pesticides in your home. Make sure to protect pets and children from getting into the ant killer.

, If plain boiling water doesn’t help, cover the ant hill with cleaning supplies. Use what you have you in your kitchen. Try dish detergent mixed with hot water. Pour it on top of the hill.If you want to try something stronger, try pouring a cleanser or bleach mixture.
Don’t use things like cleansers or bleach mixtures in areas where your pets or children may come across it.

, Ant bait is a type of pest killer that is poisonous to ants. The ant bait has a sweet substance mixed with the poisonous substance. It attracts ants, and the ants mistake it for food, so they carry it back to the nest.The poison in ant bait is carried back to the nest and ingested by ants. If an ant dies and other ants eat it, they will ingest the poison that killed the ant. The ants will spread the poisonous food to the colony, including the queen.
This can take up to three weeks.

, If you fail to kill the queen ant and cannot get rid of the ants, call an exterminator. They can use methods to kill the ants and prevent infestations. Exterminators can be expensive, so you may want to try these other methods before calling someone to help.

Clean your home.,
Disrupt the trail.,
Repel the ants naturally.",How to Kill the Queen Ant4," Ants are attracted to sugary, sweet things. If you have a messy home with lots of food particles, especially sweet crumbs, this could lead to an infestation of ants. Ants may also be drawn to water, especially in dry climates. Cleaning your home can help remove the reason for the ants, including the queen, to be in your home in the first place.Take your time to do a thorough cleaning. Look under and behind furniture. Take special care with the kitchen, dining room, and children’s bedrooms. Look under the fridge, in drawers, and in pantries for any open or spilled sugary foods or beverages that may attract ants.

, Ants leave scented trails for others in their colony to follow. Wiping the trail away or even mopping won’t eliminate it. Instead, try using vinegar to wash away the scent trail the ants follow to find food or their nest., If you want to help keep ants away, try natural solutions. Line any windowsills or doorways with coffee grounds. You may also want to put cinnamon, crushed eucalyptus, crushed chilis, cayenne pepper, diatomaceous earth, or camphor oil around common entry points in your home to keep ants away.Placing garlic in cabinets and pantries may keep ants away.
You can also place natural plants in your home that repel ants. Mint and lavender will help ants avoid your home. Using plants helps reduce any chemical dangers and puts nice plants in your house.

Use wooden snap traps.,
Bait the traps.,
Use ten or more traps at a time.,
Place the traps in a secure location.,
Position traps so that rats must crawl over them.,
Check the traps often.",How to Get Rid of Rats in Apartment Buildings1," You will need to make sure that your traps are big enough for a rat. You can buy larger traps or make the trigger of a small trap bigger by attaching a 2-inch (5 centimeters) piece of cardboard to it. The cardboard will trigger the trap if a rat steps on it.

You can also try a wooden snap box trap, which is better for outside. It is similar to a snap trap but has built up walls around it. These traps prevent other larger animals from getting killed by the trap.;
, Great bait options include peanut butter, raisin bread, bacon, and candy. Secure the food to the trigger so that it’s hard to remove without triggering the trap. Some rats will be smart enough to pull off the treat without hitting the trigger, so make it as hard as possible to remove the food.Check the traps frequently to keep them baited.

, You need to use as many traps at one time as you can. Since one trap will likely only kill one rat at best, you need to use multiple traps if you want to eradicate your rat problem.Rats are smart, so the longer the rats have to observe how the traps work, the harder it will be to kill them.

, Keep pets and small children safe by placing traps in out-of-the-way locations, such as behind walls, inside holes created by the rats, and under appliances. Avoid placing them in hallways, inside apartments where pets or children live, or in the walking areas of basements.

Try a box trap to avoid trapping larger pets, like cats or dogs.Notify residents that you will be setting rat traps. Tell them where they will be located so that they can monitor their children and pets.

, Look for spots that are a tight squeeze, such as between the wall and an appliance. Rats prefer to travel the same paths over and over, so look for their rat droppings or signs of a trail.

Look for rat nests and feces. Place traps near these areas because the rats will frequent them.
If you want to set a trap in the ceiling, it’s okay to set them on top of panels. If there are no panels, you’ll have to go into the attic.Listen for scurrying and scratching, then place the traps nearby.
Most traps should be near a wall or the side of a large appliance. Rats do not often run in open spaces., Set a schedule for yourself to periodically check the traps. You should plan to do so a few times each day while you’re trying to take control of the problem. Clear away dead rats and reset the trigger.

If you leave dead rats in the traps for long, other rats will become cautious around the traps."

Secure trash can lids.,
Clean out your trash cans.,
Don't put out the trash at night.,
Double bag food scraps.",How to Get Rid of Raccoons1," Use a rope, chain or bungee cord to tie the lid into a secure position. Alternatively, you could weigh down the lids with weights, bricks, or other heavy objects. Aim for about 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of weight to prevent the strongest adult raccoons from getting in.You could also purchase trash cans with latches or locks if they're within your budget.;
, Wash them out with the hose every week or so. Sprinkle the inside with baking soda to remove any lingering food odors.Tip them upside down so they don't store water for mosquitoes or for raccoons to drink.








, Raccoons are active at night, and trash cans are among their favorite “hunting grounds.” To prevent them from breaking into your trash, store your cans in the garage or other indoor location. Take them out to the curb the morning of your scheduled pickup.







, Raccoons have a very keen sense of smell that allow them to detect food sources from far away. Double bagging will help to contain food odors. This is especially helpful if you absolutely must keep your trash outside the night before the next garbage pickup.

Use glue boards.,
Consult an exterminator.,
Use poison-laced bait as a last resort.",How to Get Rid of Mice Fast," Mice can eat through cardboard, certain plastics, and other forms of containers to get at food. In order to cut down the mice's food supply, make sure that you don't leave any food out, or if you do, to put it in something that mice cannot get at.


Don't leave out pet food. Remove any food that your pet hasn't eaten immediately after its meal.
Mice are terrific climbers; even the top of your refrigerator is not a safe place for food storage.;
, The less food there is to eat, the fewer mice you'll have, even if your trash can is outside. For indoor trash cans, make sure they have an adjustable, sealable lid that is closed if not being used. Mice will eat food that is thrown away by humans.








, Don't leave your dirty dishes out overnight, and take care to wipe off all your regularly-used counters with household cleaner and disinfectant.








, Entry points should be sealed off so that mice cannot get into your place of residence to begin with. Make sure you:









Seal off cracks, holes or crevices with something sturdy, like steel or concrete. Check your place of residence fastidiously for anything the mice could get into.
Seal off pipes, gas lines, and drier vents. Mice can use these entry points as highways to get into your house.

Consider putting steel wool inside the pipe or vent before you seal it off. Steel wool pads will prevent mice from using the hole to get back into your house. It will add an extra element of protection if your mice are persistent and resilient.


Seal off anything else that could possibly invite mice into your place of residence. Mice can enter breaks or holes as small as a pencil eraser, meaning that total coverage of any breaks is necessary to create an effective seal.

, By far the most natural way to let your mice population know they are not welcome is to get a cat. Cats love to catch mice. Cats love to eat mice. Mice don't like to be eaten by cats. A good mouser will clean out your mouse population in no time and discourage any new mice from moving in.









If you choose to get a cat, remove all traps, baits, and poisons from your home and keep them locked away - they can make your cat very sick or seriously injure them.

, The mice will have a quick end, and you can throw the trap away with the mouse, since they are so cheap. Although they seem cruel, they kill the mouse quickly and without a doubt are safer than poison if you have small children or pets. An additional benefit is that the dying mouse can not crawl into your walls and die, causing a horrible smell that can last for weeks.


Snap traps do present some small danger to humans and pets, however. They can also leave unsightly messes when they trap and kill the mice.

, Try soaking a cotton ball in the strong scent of peppermint oil and placing the cotton balls in strategic areas in your place of residence. Mice are reported to hate the smell of peppermint oil. Peppermint oil is not a poison; it is a repellent. Mice will try to avoid it.








, This sounds bizarre, but it actually works. Mice are naturally afraid of both cats and snakes, and so it's only natural that their feces sends the fear of God into their tiny little hearts.









Place litter boxes in strategic areas of your home. Encourage your cat(s) to actually use it; a litter box without urine isn't much use.
Visit a pet store and ask the owner for some snake scat. S/he may not have any available, but if you ask politely, you may be able to set up a partnership for future retrieval. The owner should be more than happy to let you take feces off their hands.

, Ultrasonic mice repellents use small beeps to annoy and scare off mice, and are safe to use with other pets, such as cats and dogs. There is some controversy about their effectiveness, however.Some experts contend that mice get used to the beep after a short while, making them effective only for a short time.








, Electric traps works by luring the mice over to the trap and then zapping them with a powerful electrical shock. The downside of these traps is that they are expensive (costing up to $40) and will use up energy very quickly (batteries are not inexpensive either).








, Glue boards will catch mice effectively, but they are less popular than other methods because they cause the mouse to die of stress or starvation and also may catch other pets or animals.








, An exterminator will be able to deploy a range of natural and chemical methods to get rid of a mouse colony. Especially if your mouse problem is an infestation (not a couple stragglers bothering you occasionally), exterminators will probably be more effective than home measures.

, Mice have to eat; this means that you can buy poison-laced mouse- and rat bait at most hardware stores. Once they've eaten, they become very thirsty and will go out side for looking for water.


Prior to 1990, strychnine was used. However, since 1990, zinc phosphide Zn3P2 has been used. The odor of the bait attracts rats and mice but generally repels other animals.
Most dosages will kill the rodent in a single serving, although surviving mice may develop an aversion to the bait.

Note: The downside to poison-laced bait is that it is toxic to humans (but will induce a vomiting response). You'll also have to deal with dead mice trapped in inaccessible places, which may attract other unwanted rodents.

Use mouse repellent.",How to Get Rid of Mice," Mice are clever creatures that aren't easily spotted during daytime hours while people are around. You might notice a slight movement out of the corner of your eye and not even realize that what you noticed was a mouse. Next time you see a movement, take it as a sign that you should investigate further.;
, It's easier to hear mice at night when the house or apartment is quiet. You may hear a light tapping or scratching that sounds like it's coming from the walls.


If you hear sounds of mice running along the walls, that's a sign that you've got more than one creature to take care of.
If you hear squeaks, you may have a mouse nest full of babies on your hands.

, Mouse droppings are small, dark and seed-shaped. New droppings are wet and black, and older ones will have dried out to a lighter gray color.


Note which room you see the droppings in. The presence of droppings in a room should indicate that something in the room is attractive to mice.
The presence of droppings can also indicate that there's a crack or hole in the room through which mice can enter.

, If you can determine the pathways the mice often use, you will be able to catch and track the mice more easily. Mice often establish runs and use the same pathways time after time. Usually the runs are not directly visible so the mouse is only visible as it traverses a few feet of open floor or counter top., Of course, it will be along the runs if you have been able to identify them. And you will probably find the nest near where you saw a concentration of droppings. Nests are usually built in the corners of cabinets or closets. Look in out-of-the-way places that don't often get disturbed.


Mice chew through cardboard boxes and items of clothing to use as materials for their nests. Look for tiny holes in the pile of clothes you've left sitting in the back of your closet.
A musty smell might also indicate the presence of a mouse nest.

,

Mice are lured into these traps by the scent of bait placed inside it, usually peanut butter or cheese. They enter a small hole and get trapped in with the bait. Once a mouse has been caught, you can take the trap to a field or the woods and set the mouse free.

Make sure to always use surgical (or other) gloves when baiting or handling traps. Mice have an extremely good sense of smell and will not enter a trap that has been handled by humans or that smells ""off,"" perhaps because of chemical smells or soap residue. Be aware of your handling from the time you start to unwrap the trap after your purchase and strive to not touch the trap directly with your skin, ever. This will assure best chances of trapping your target(s).
Set live traps in the room where you found mouse droppings or a nest. Live traps are more expensive than other types of traps, so you might want to start by buying just one or two.
If you have a bigger infestation of mice, it might not be practical to catch them with live traps, since you'll likely have to make a lot of trips to the woods to set them free.

, These types of traps look like little cardboard houses. The bottom is lined with a sticky substance that attracts mice, then traps their little feet so they can't run away. Be aware that this often results in a still-living animal stuck on the trap.


Buy several sticky traps and place them around the room where you saw mouse droppings or a nest. Don't forget to put some in the cabinets and closets.
Bigger sticky traps can trap more than one mouse at a time.
Mice don't die right away in sticky traps, and unfortunately you may hear pained squeaks coming from the traps. You may need to humanely euthanize any living mouse that you have caught on it. Keep this in mind when you're deciding which trap to buy.

, Snap traps are baited with a bit of peanut butter or cheese. When the mouse steps on the trap to eat the bait, its weight causes a wire to snap down on the mouse.


Snap traps are cheap, so you can buy a lot of them and place them wherever you think mice might be present. Place a piece of newspaper under each trap for easier cleanup.
Since snap traps kill mice instantly, they're actually more humane than sticky traps. However, they can be less pleasant to deal with. Make sure to throw out snap traps as soon as mice are caught, and sanitize the area afterward.

, Cats are natural predators of mice, and they are as good at catching mice as any trap. Let your house cat spend time in the room where mice are present. It shouldn't take long for your cat to take care of the problem.


Some people borrow a friend's cat for this purpose.
Having a cat stroll around your property is a good mouse deterrent and may prevent them from coming inside in the first place.

, Scrub every nook and cranny to get rid of mouse nests and materials that mice might want to make into nests. Throw out old boxes, bags, books, magazines and any other paper or cloth materials you might have lying around.


Sanitize any areas where you found droppings, a nest, or trapped a mouse.
Don't store your possessions in cardboard boxes sitting on the floor, since mice can chew through cardboard easily. They can even chew through plastic or wood and will do so if they have a reason. For example, they smell food or think they might be able to create a secure hiding place.
Clear out general clutter, especially in corners of your house or apartment that aren't frequently used.

, You might not think of it as mouse food, but mice are attracted to all types of edible substances they can find on the ground, on counters and in cabinets.


If your trees drop edible nuts and berries, make sure you rake them up frequently.
Clean up spilled birdseed from under the feeder a few times a week.
Make sure your outdoor garbage can has a tight lid, and always keep it covered.
Don't let cat or dog food sit out all day; clean it up after your pet has eaten.

, Make sure all grains, nuts, and other dry goods are stored in tightly sealed plastic, glass or metal containers.


Half-used boxes or bags of food are attractive to mice, be it human food or pet food. Store the remaining food in an airtight container and recycle the box or bag.
Don't leave bread or fruit sitting out on the counter for more than a day or two. If food items you leave on the counter or on top of the refrigerator become a problem, tighten up. Use a metal bread box and work out a storage method for fruits and vegetables that you do not like to refrigerate.
Clean your pantry and cabinets often. Make sure crumbs, dried juice, and other stray bits of food don't sit on your kitchen floor. Remain vigilant and observe any signs of pantry raiding by the pesky critter, then provision to eliminate the opportunity for the mouse family to dine.

, Make sure the gap under your door isn't providing a convenient entrance for mice. You can buy materials to seal the gap at a hardware or home and garden store.


Keep your windows closed or screened.
Seal any cracks or holes you find in your walls, especially exterior walls. Steel wool is a cheap material you can stuff into crevices to deter mice.

, Place a substance known to repel mice in the corners of your home and around doors, cracks, and other places mice may enter.


Peppermint and other strong oils contained in ""strewing herbs"" repel mice. Cut a sponge into 1"" (3cm) squares and saturate each with peppermint or eucalyptus essential oil, then place these strategically around your house and kitchen.
You could plant some mint around your windows and doors and use the herb in teas and in sachets to freshen your cabinets and closets.
Bay leaves also repel mice. Crush them up and sprinkle them around your house, or tuck whole leaves in the corners of your pantry and cabinets.
Mothballs are an effective repellent, but these are toxicand can cause problems for children and pets. Naphthalene is a pesticide and sublimates readily so you should think thrice before employing this method. Additionally, moth balls are more expensive, require replacing often when the balls sublimate, and are not as eco-friendly as herbs or herb-based essential oils. Make sure children and pets are kept away and closely monitor them for signs of a reaction to the mothballs should you decide to use them.
If there are mice in your walls you can usually get rid of them by using a syringe and squirting ammonia into the wall. The fumes and smell will chase them out. This is especially effective in manufactured and mobile homes where there is often a space at the bottom of the wall for easy access.

Choose your poison.,
Make sure that your poison is labeled.,
Place the poison in rat-friendly places.,
Protect children and pets from accidentally ingesting the poison.,
Replace the poison daily for six to ten days.,
Dispose of extra poison.,
Skip a month between treatments.",How to Get Rid of Rats in Apartment Buildings2," You can find several commercially available rat poisons. Rat poisons prevent their blood from clotting, so the rats bleed to death.Follow the specific instructions on your poison.
Keep poison away from children and pets.
If you want to use poison outside, it must be labeled for outdoor use., While your poison should be positioned in out-of-the-way locations, some humans may encounter it. For example, poison in the basement may be found by a person trying to store a box. Protect them by clearly labeling your poison so that it’s less likely that they will mess with it., Look for secure, hidden spots where rats are likely to hide. Similar to when you set a trap, you should look for locations that have rat trails, nests, or feces. Set your bait near these areas so that the rats are likely to come across it.Place the poison behind or under appliances, walls, or pipes.
If you’ve noticed a rat hole, place the poison inside of it.

, Use bait boxes or bait stations rather than bait trays. You can find commercial products that already come set up as a box with chambers to hold the poison, making it safer for children and pets.

Look for tamper-resistant bait.Notify residents about the poison and where you’re placing it.

, You must continuously feed the rats the poison for at least six days in order for it to be fully effective. Keep in mind that rats can become tolerant to poisons, so don’t stop the poison early. You may also want to try different poisons if you do more than one treatment.Rats will not eat spoiled bait., If you have any remaining poison once your rat problem is under control, follow the directions on the packaging for disposal. Don’t just throw the poison away, as this can harm other people, pets, or animals if they accidentally come in contact with it., Rats can build a tolerance to the poison, so if you have a serious rat problem, treat for about a month at a time. Take a break between treatment cycles to ensure that the rats don’t become immune to the poison.You can try other treatment methods between poisonings.

Repair cracks and holes.,
Block the area around pipes and vent openings.,
Cover all windows with a wire screen.,
Add door sweeps.,
Encourage tenants to carefully inspect deliveries.,
Remove any debris from around the building.",How to Get Rid of Rats in Apartment Buildings3," Make sure that your trash is not a rat buffet. Rats have trouble chewing through metal or thick plastic bins, but they can easily enter a container with an open lid. If they make a home in the trash, they’re more likely to come inside the building as well., If you or your tenants improperly store food, then rats are more attracted to your building. Food should not be stored in dark, closed areas where rats can be easily active. Additionally, food shouldn’t be left sitting out.

Don’t store food in the basement.
This includes pet food. Encourage good pet food habits amongst your tenants. Food should not be left out., Leaky pipes offer a water source, and damaged systems offer a place for rats to hide. Keep them out by doing regular maintenance and fixing any issues immediately., Stop rats from entering the building in the first place by keeping your building and foundation secure. Rats can squeeze through the tiniest of cracks, so even a hole as small as a dime needs to be repaired. Carefully inspect and repair your walls, roof, and foundation.Check close to the ground for freshly dug holes. Rats sometimes dig near the foundation so that they can crawl through to the inside of the building.

, If your walls or basements have vent openings, the rats can enter through the slats or holes. While you can’t block the opening, you can apply wire mesh over the open slats so that the rats cannot enter.You can use steel wool to fill in gaps around vents or pipes.

, Windows provide rats with an open opportunity to enter a building, but it’s unreasonable to expect people to leave their windows shut at all times. Instead, make sure that every window has an undamaged screen.Ask tenants to regularly inspect their screens for holes and slits. Offer to replace screens at no cost to them.

, Rats can squeeze under gaps at the bottom of the door. If your apartment building has doors that leave a gap between the door and the jam, then install a door sweep. The door sweep will attach to the bottom of the door, providing a seal against outside intruders., Rat can hitchhike in large deliveries, especially if food is involved., Rats love to hide in wood piles, garbage, discarded items, and tall grass."

Clean up all food debris from your yard.,
Pay attention to pet food.,
Keep bird feeders out of their reach.,
Protect your fish pond.",How to Get Rid of Raccoons2," Sweep up berries that fell from trees. Make sure that any picnic tables and chairs (or anything else outside) are completely free of food scraps and crumbs. Clean the area completely. Double check the area after you finish., Raccoons are omnivores, so they won't pass up any dog- or cat food scraps left outdoors. You can avoid this problem entirely by feeding your companion animals indoors. If you must feed Fido or Tiger outside, clean up every last scrap of wet or dry food when meal time is over. If you have a doggie door or cat flap, keep food bowls far away from these access points., Even a bird feeder with sunflower seeds might be tempting to a raccoon. Hang your bird feeder on a pole about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter. Raccoons can't climb such skinny poles. Secure the pole firmly so that it can't be knocked over. Store any bird seed in metal trash cans or an indoor locations that raccoons can't access.If this isn't an option, lock up your bird feeder in the garage or tool shed just before sundown.

, As omnivores, raccoons love to fish. Place cinder blocks, ceramic pipes, and wire baskets in the pond. These will provide hiding places for your fish.You can also install metal leaf netting over your fish pond. Buy the strongest material available to support the raccoon's weight.

Identify points of entry.,
Identify nesting areas.,
Repel raccoons from entry points and nesting areas.,
Identify the main entry point.,
Close off most points of entry.,
Use newspaper on the main entry point.,
Seal off your yard.",How to Get Rid of Raccoons3," Inspect your house, garage, and fence. Look for holes 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter or bigger. Check downspouts for scratches and body oil stains where racoons might have been climbing. If they're in your attic, look under nooks, dormers, or broken vents. If you hear them in your crawl space, look for broken vents or borrows. It might also help to check for footprints, especially if recent rains have created muddy conditions.







, Raccoons don't use nesting materials like birds do. The only way to identify a nest is by the fecal matter they leave. Look for brown cylindrical objects with digested berries. Raccoon feces look similar to those left by small dogs. When in doubt, contact your local extension office.







, Boil one cup of cayenne pepper and 3-5 chopped habanero chilis with water in a pot and let it cool. Transfer it into a spray bottle. Spray the entry points you've identified. Because raccoons follow their noses, this spray will make their nesting area unbearable.Use goggles and a respirator before spraying in enclosed areas. Although hot peppers are technically non-toxic, they can irritate mucous membranes in your eyes and mouth., Check around your roof, foundation, or siding. Look for telltale signs like freshly dug holes, nesting materials, dirt stains, or hair stuck to the entry point. If the point of entry is in or near your foundation, you can also check for paw prints in the soil.







, Make sure the raccoons have left the area before you seal off any openings. You're most likely to find an empty space if you start working between 8:00 and 11:00pm, when most raccoons are out scavenging.Cover the entry points with 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of wire meshing. Then, seal the mesh with a foam or caulking gun.







, Wait until between 8:00 and 11:00pm. Stuff the newspaper lightly into the opening. Check the newspaper in the morning. If it's been moved, the raccoons might have left. Put it back in place. Continue to monitor the area for 48 hours. If the newspaper is still in place, you can permanently seal the hole.









If it has been moved, the raccoon(s) might be back. Check if you're dealing with a mother and her young. If this is the case, let the young grow up so that the mother can move them on her own. If you find abandoned young, call your local wildlife rehabilitation center for assistance.If no young are on site, hire a professional to install a one-way door that will allow raccoons to exit but not re-enter.Don't permanently block any vents with newspaper.

, Raccoons can easily scale wood or metal fences. They also use nearby tree limbs or shrubs to help them over fences. Run electrified wires at the top and bottom of your fence to deter intrusions. Prune tree limbs near fences.


If you decide to replace your fence, make sure the mesh is no wider than 3 inches (7.6 cm). This will prevent young raccoons from entering your yard."

Get a cat.,
Identify the rats' feeding and nesting places.,
Leave rat poison or traditional snapping rattraps in rat infested areas.,
Use glue boards to get rid of rats.",How to Get Rid of Rats1," They are great hunters and natural rat predators. You will still be killing the rats indirectly but it won’t cause them great pain. This is just a way of initiating the natural cycle. A good cat will clean up your rat infestation in just a few weeks. Just remember a cat will not be able to catch a rat that is in the attic or behind a wall. , You will know where they have been by rat droppings you notice or by the holes chewed in walls, food boxes, insulation and other places in your home. This is where you’ll want to leave the traps

, You can purchase these from hardware stores and other retailers if you decide you want to kill the rats. Be aware that rat poison does not kill a rat instantly, it can take up to a week to kill the rat. The rat will be in immense pain during this week, so keep that in mind.


Read the instructions and cautions carefully. Most rat poisons include warfarin, which causes internal bleeding and other drugs that kill rats, but can also be harmful to pets and people.
Check the traps regularly. A rat corpse will give off an unpleasant odor if you do not remove it immediately. Traditional snapping traps are much more humane than rat poison as it should kill the rat immediately. However, in some cases it can only severely injure the rat in which case you should put it out of its misery.

, These are flat, sticky pieces of wood that trap rats until you can remove them. Once again, make sure that you only set glue boards if you intend to kill the rats. These rats are not going to survive, there’s no way to get them off the glue board. Some rats will chew off their feet or legs in order to escape from the trap and others will get their head trapped in the glue and suffocate. It is not the most humane way to get rid of rats but it will work. If you find a rat in a glue trap that has not been killed you'll have to stomp on it with a boot to kill it. It's either that or hitting it on the head with something hard like bat. Do whatever you can stomach and then toss the rat in an outdoor trash can.

Purchase a live animal trap.,
Place a bucket half-filled with water outside.,
Put out mousetraps to get rid of chipmunks.,
Set out mothballs.,
Put out items that chipmunks hate to smell.,
Let your pets roam outdoors.,
Spray pepper spray or hot sauce on the surfaces of your plants.,
Open your doors and windows to the outside to give the chipmunk an opportunity to run out.,
Prop a board or other flat item against the sills of your open windows.,
Grab a blanket and use it to herd the chipmunk toward the door.,
Call a professional to get rid of dead chipmunks.",How to Get Rid of Chipmunks," Scatter sunflower seeds or peanuts around the trap to entice the chipmunks into the trap. Then remove the chipmunks from the trap according to your municipality's animal control ordinances.;
, Lean a wooden plank against the side of the bucket.


Scatter sunflower seeds on the plank, in the water and on the grass around the bucket. The chipmunks will walk on the plank to eat the seeds, fall into the bucket and drown.
If you only want to get rid of chipmunks and keep squirrels alive, be sure to squirrel-proof your homemade trap or put it in a place that squirrels don't normally go. Curious squirrels might end up finding the traps, eating the bait, and drown.
Check with your town or city animal control agency to find out how to dispose of the dead chipmunks. Always wear gloves when handling dead animals, and always wash your hands afterward. Many times, they are infested with fleas, mites and other unpleasant critters.

, Slather a mix of peanut butter and oatmeal on the trap. While this will kill the chipmunks, the method is quick and spares them pain. Again, dispose of the animals according to the rules of your town or city.Be sure to keep checking on the mousetraps throughout the day; squirrels might try to eat the bait and/or carry them away.

, Place mothballs around the foundation of your house, near your plantings and around chipmunk holes. Mothballs won't eliminate chipmunks, but they will push the critters back to the perimeter of your yard and away from your landscaping. Be careful as they are toxic.

, Try sprinkling blood meal around the roots of your plants. You can also place un-chewed sticks of fragrant gum near chipmunk holes., Having your dog or cat in the yard will often frighten chipmunks away.

, Alternatively, you can sprinkle cayenne pepper on your plants. Doing this will keep the chipmunks from chomping on your landscaping.


Note that capsaicin, the active chemical in cayenne is toxic to bees and other beneficial pollinators, so if your garden depends on these pollinators use something other than hot pepper spray., At the same time, close any doors or entrances to your interior rooms so that the chipmunk has nowhere to go but out.

, A board will give the chipmunks something to climb so that they can run out of the window.

, If the chipmunk climbs the blanket, don't panic. Just gently roll up the blanket, take it outside and dump the chipmunk out.

, If a chipmunk has gotten into your attic or in the walls of your house and has died, let a professional deal with the problem.

Keep all trash sealed and take it out anytime you throw food away.,
Seal up all the food in your house and keep everything in closed containers.,
Remove any ability for rats to enter your home by sealing all holes in your walls, doors and screens.,
Stuff the area surrounding any pipes or small holes that lead into your house using bronze or steel wool.,
Do not bother using products that are marketed as ""rat repellents.""",How to Get Rid of Rats2," Avoid giving rats a reason to hang around your house. Make sure that you use a garbage can, don’t just leave your trash hanging out in a garbage bag. When you throw the garbage bag out put it in a dumpster or a closed garbage bin for disposal. If it is just hanging out around your house it’s easy access for rats. , If the food is left hanging out in the open it could attract rats or other pests. Try to keep your house generally clean and definitely pay close attention to where you leave your food. If you live in an area that is prone to rat problems like a city then be extra careful. , Check your garage doors, chimneys, dryer and air conditioning vents, and crawl spaces to ensure that they are properly sealed to the outdoors. If a rat can find its way in your house then they can set up shop and start breeding. The best thing you can do is prevent that.

, This will stop the rats from entering in through easy access holes. You can also close off the entrance completely if the pipe or entrance serves no purpose. , These are often not useful and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued warnings against fraudulent sound machines that claim to repel rats and rodents.

Identify the rat's feeding and nesting areas.,
Use a nonlethal wire cage to trap and release rats if you want to avoid killing them.,
Release the rats far away from your home.",How to Get Rid of Rats3," Remember to identify these areas by paying attention to where you notice rat droppings or areas that have been chewed. If the rats were in the area before, they probably will be in the area again. If they are living in your attic try to find the entrances they are using and set the traps there.

, Experts consider this the most humane way to get rid of rats. Set a cage with a little bit of food inside of it. The spring release door will trap the rat as soon as it is inside the cage. You will then have to pick up the cage and release the rat somewhere.

, Bring them out into the woods somewhere a good distance from your house. You don’t want to worry about them finding their way back to your home and returning. They’ll find a new home somewhere, hopefully not where a person is already living.

Ask about guarantees and warranties.",How to Get Rid of Rats4," You can find a reputable company online, in your local phone book or by asking friends and neighbors for referrals.

, He will propose a removal method that might include poisoning the rats or setting traps for them. Make sure you explain the extent of your rat problem so that you get an accurate quote.

, Some of them can be harmful to pets and people living in your home, particularly small children. If a child or a pet comes across rat poison and it it they will be seriously ill and may die.

, They can cause terrible odors in your home if they are left in walls or attics. Most exterminators will do this for no extra charge but if you are uncomfortable with seeing the dead bodies of rats then it is best to ask and make sure. Hopefully the exterminator will handle the whole process from start to finish.

, Choose the one you are comfortable with. Price quotes can vary wildly between companies so try to find a good deal and an exterminator that you feel comfortable with. This will make the process much easier.

, You do not want to have to call an exterminator again in a month or two if the rats return, or if turns out not all of the rats were removed from your property. Try to choose a company that offers a satisfaction guarantee so that you can get your money back if the rats are not fully taken care of. At the very least, the exterminator should come back and finish the job for no extra charge.

Determine if a mother has nested her babies in your house.,
Allow young squirrels to mature before evicting.,
Provide an avenue of escape.,
Close off hiding spots while keeping your distance.,
Remove all food sources.,
Create some incentive to leave.,
Create loud noises for squirrels in difficult spaces.,
Use a humane trap.,
Leave the room and seal it off if necessary.,
Stay away from the house for one or two hours.,
Verify the squirrel is gone and clean the area.,
Seal off squirrel entrances.,
Repeat the process, if necessary.",How to Get Rid of a Squirrel in Your House," A squirrel, much like most wild animals, is just as scared of you as you may be of it. As much as you want the squirrel out of your home, the squirrel's primary goal is also to get out of your house and back to a familiar environment.


Animals have a similar anxiety response to humans and respond aggressively to perceived threats to safety. By staying calm, you will prevent the trapped squirrel from having a severe aggressive response.
The squirrel is likely to be erratic since it is unsure what to do in the foreign environment of your home.
Additionally, a squirrel, on very rare occasions, can be rabid, so don't get bitten by one.;
, You’ll want to keep your pets as far away from the squirrel as possible so no fleas, ticks, or diseases are transmitted between them. Move all of your pets outside, into a holding pen/crate/cage, or put them into a separate room immediately.


Pets can catch diseases the squirrels carry.
Pets can catch illnesses from parasites squirrels have, like fleas and ticks.
Disease can be transmitted through a squirrel bite, or potentially a significant scratch.
Pets can become serious ill from consuming or biting a diseased squirrel. An example of this is squirrel pox, which grey squirrels are immune to but carry., Even if you evict a mother squirrel from your home, if her babies are still trapped or nested inside, she will expend every effort to get back to her young. Beyond this, a mother squirrel that fears for her young will be more likely to attack. To check for young squirrels you should:


Search 20 feet (6 m) around where you’ve found the squirrel.
Avoid invading the space around a potential nest. The mother may attack if she thinks you are a threat to her young.
Make some noises and then be silent. You should hear noises from the young squirrels in response.
The main squirrel breeding times are February through May and August through October. During these times of the year, it’s highly likely babies will be present., Relocating a squirrel family can be taxing on the health of its members, and young might not survive for long outside of the safety of the nest. If you are certain there are baby squirrels in your home, you’ll want to call a professional, or you could wait a few weeks before ejecting the squirrels from your house.


Baby squirrels only take a few weeks to grow large enough to survive without a mother. Waiting may be the most humane way of getting rid of squirrel young., Close off all other routes and leave a single exit to your house open, like a wide open window. If getting to a window in the same room the squirrel is in puts you too close to the squirrel for your own comfort, you might:


Open the window in the room next to the one the squirrel is in, leave the door open to that room, and close off all other routes., Drawers, cupboards, and other nooks and crannies comfort the squirrel, as these may remind it of its natural habitat or its nest in the knothole of a tree. By closing these off you can prevent the intruding squirrel from hiding out in a safe place as opposed to hightailing it out of your home., Especially in inhospitable weather, like in winter or during a drought, a squirrel may be especially hard to remove if it has a food source available. Squirrels, like other rodents, have sharp teeth that can gnaw through even thick bags. Remove even closed food sources., Squirrels, much like many animals, are sensitive to certain scents and other kinds of stimulus. In particular, squirrels have a dislike for the smell of cider vinegar, so you might want to soak some rags in the stuff and put them in the room in which your squirrel resides.


You might also leave a radio playing constantly in the room the squirrel is in to drive it out.
A bright light left on throughout the day and night can also make your house less appealing to squirrels.
Predator urine can be bought from farm supply stores, sporting good centers, and online retailers. Soaking rags in predator urine, like that of a fox, could lead to your squirrel invader beating a hasty retreat., Squirrels in your attic or other narrow spaces, like a wall or crawlspace, can be difficult to get at without coming into too close of contact. In this case, you should bang on the rafters and walls.


Even entering your attic and speaking in a loud voice may be enough to chase your squirrels out of your home.
These loud noises will often provoke a squirrel’s flight response, making it flee through the escape path you’ve provided., There are many different kinds of humane traps available. These are specially designed to help remove squirrels from your home. You can buy a humane trap at most hardware stores or from a general online retailer.


A one-way door is a kind of trap that lures squirrels in but does not let them out. When using this kind of trap, you should take the squirrel at least 3 miles (4.8 km) away before releasing it.
Depending on the kind of trap you buy, setup and squirrel removal may have different procedures. Always be sure to follow the directions that come with your trap for best results., If the room does not have a door, close all other doors that lead to that room and put up a make-shift barrier if possible. You’ll want something the squirrel won’t able get around or hop over, like a door sized piece of particle board or plywood.If you do not have particle board, plywood, or another door barrier available, you could always remove a door from another room and use it to block off the room the squirrel is in.
When using a door from another room, you should anchor the door into place by putting something heavy, like a stack of books, boxes, a bag of salt, or a bag concrete at its base.

, You should take your pet(s) with you, if at all possible. This will prevent any accidental interaction between your pet(s) and the squirrel. As soon as the squirrel realizes that no one else is in the house, it should leave through the escape route you’ve left open.Some dogs have been bred to hunt woodland creatures and may work extra hard to get at the squirrel in your home. Leaving this kind of pet unsupervised could result in it escaping its pen/cage/room to hunt the squirrel., Once you’ve returned, thoroughly check the room in which the squirrel resided to be sure it is gone. Then you should check the surrounding rooms and the rest of your house, just in case the squirrel got around your barrier or found some other route to travel deeper into your house.


Squirrels, like many rodents, tend to spread around their urine and feces. You should thoroughly clean the area the squirrel has inhabited with a strong cleaner, gloves, and a mask., To prevent more squirrels from making your house their home, you’ll want to close off any entrances the squirrels might use to get back inside. This will require some investigation on your part. In some cases, you may need to replace rotten wood caused by a leaky roof.


In many cases, squirrels will chew through soft, rotten wood to gain access to your attic. Patching holes in your roof and eaves could stop your squirrel infestation from happening again., Some more stubborn squirrels may require you to use a combination of techniques, like playing a radio non-stop and introducing predator urine, before your home is inhospitable enough to drive it away. If after two or three attempts the squirrel remains, it may be time to call a pest control expert.

Track down the mouse.,
Set a humane mouse trap.,
Try a homemade trap.,
Release the mouse.,
Try shooing it out of your house.",How to Get a Mouse Out of the House1," If you saw a mouse running by out of the corner of your eye, see if you can figure out where it went. Mice are pretty fast, and chasing them around the house usually isn’t the best way to catch them and remove them. Instead, track the mouse to its nest so you can catch it using a trap.


If you didn’t see where the mouse went, look for the nest. A mouse’s nest is usually composed of scraps of cloth, paper, hair, and other odds and ends. It will have a musty smell. Look in the back corners of closets, under the sink, behind the refrigerator, in cracks in the wall and in any other dark, hidden places.
You may also be able to track down the mouse by looking for droppings. Mouse droppings look like pieces of black rice. If you see some droppings, the nest is probably nearby.;
, Humane mouse traps let you trap a mouse without killing it. You can then take the trap to a nearby park or forest and release the mouse into the wild. Humane traps work by using bait to lure the mouse into a maze-like tunnel. When the mouse is inside, the trap closes behind it, making it impossible for the mouse to escape.









Humane mouse traps tend to be a little more expensive than the snap traps, but like snap traps they’re reusable, so it’s worth the investment.
Bait the trap according to the instructions using peanut butter or cheese.
Set the trap near the mouse’s nest and wait for the mouse to come take the bait.
Check the trap every day to see if a mouse is inside.

, If the mouse is running around in plain sight, you might not want to wait to trap it. Close the doors to the room you’re in and stuff towels underneath them so the mouse can’t go anywhere. Grab a sturdy box, bowl or crate and wait patiently for the right moment to cover the mouse with it.









Once you successfully trap the mouse, slide a thin piece of cardboard under the trap. Fold the edges of the cardboard up and tape them to the side of the trap with duct tape. Turn the trap upside down so that the mice is at the bottom of the box or bowl and can’t scramble out.
If you don't want to run around chasing it, try a homemade bucket trap. Get a bucket and balance its rim on a piece of wood, pencil, pen or similar object. Tie a piece of string around the handle. Place peanut butter or any of the mouse's favorite food types under the bucket. When the mouse comes out to eat the food, pull the string trapping him. Then slide a magazine under the box and carefully turn over.

, Don’t just take the mouse into your backyard to release it. Walk, bike or drive your trap at least a mile from your house, since you don’t want it to come right back inside. Release the mouse in a park or a patch of woods. When you’re ready to release the mouse, just open the trap and let it hop out.








, There’s one final humane way you can try to get a mouse out of your house: just shoo it outside! Sometimes a mouse will wander in and run around, confused and wanting to leave just as much as you want it to. Help it along by using a broom to scoot it toward an open door. This may require chasing the mouse around a bit before you’re able to get it outside. However, when all’s said and done, it’s faster than trying to trap and release it.









Of course, if you use this method, the mouse might decide to come right back in, especially if it got inside through a gap in the door or a hole in your foundation. If your house isn’t sealed against mice, take measures to seal it up and use repellents so mice won’t wander in.

Know your enemy.",How to Control Mice," The classic snap-trap works by releasing a compressed bar at high speed, which snaps the spine of the mouse and kills it instantly.


Place some food, such as peanut butter or a piece of cheese, on the lever that operates it. When the mouse comes to get the food, it will trip the lever and be killed by the bar.;
, Sticky traps trap a mouse in a sticky substance, preventing them from moving further.


These are less useful, because the mouse does not die from the trap, but is merely immobilized. Some mice will gnaw off their own legs to escape, making these rather inhumane to use. You will also most likely have to kill the mice yourself once you have discovered the trap.

,


Be careful not to touch your skin to the catcher, as mice have very keen senses of smell and will refuse to enter a trap that has been handled by humans. If possible, use latex lab or surgical gloves while handling it.
Understand that this might not be the best option, especially if you have a large infestation. You will need to release the mice far away from your home for the traps to be effective in keeping them out, which could result in a lot of trips out of town for you.

, Cats are natural predators of mice, and are highly effective - and highly motivated - in tracking them down and killing them.


Cats may perform better if they are a little underfed. Obviously, do not starve your cat, but give them the incentive to hunt mice instead of hunt kibble by limiting their meals.
Cats also love to bring their owners dead things. Whatever the reason for this, know that if you depend on your cat to control the mice, you may have find one or more lying at your feet in the future.
Cats are long-term commitments, however, so if you buy one be prepared to keep it for up to 20 years. If you just want a cat for pest control, there are certainly better and shorter-term options to consider, such as borrowing a friend's cat.

, Exterminators companies like Orkin or Terminix are still allowed to use commercial poisons, and are actually trained in their use.


This is a good option for people who do not want to kill the mice, for in addition to killing the animals, they also offer more innovative solutions, such as one-way escape routes that allow intruding animals to leave, but not reenter.
However, it is a bad option because it also may be quite expensive. Really, use this only as a last resort.

, These often come in the form of loose bait or pellets, placed around areas where the mice might hide. Poisons such as brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone and difenacoum work by acting as second-order anti-coagulants, causing the mice to bleed out by preventing the blood from coagulating.


However, these have severe downsides and should almost certainly be avoided. The above-mentioned poisons have been banned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for homeowners, as their improper use of these poisons has directly caused the deaths of thousands of wild animals. Plus, leaving loose poison around is a terrible idea, especially if you have pets or small children; the poisons are equally effective on humans and pets, as well as mice.

, You've eliminated your mouse infestation, and you need to make sure that things stay that way. Mice don't just spontaneously show up in a home, and there are several factors that come into play as to why one house has a mouse infestation, and another does not.


Holes in the walls, shingles, or insulation allow for mice to enter through the walls, gaps between windows and windowsills allows them to enter through windows, and the space between the door and the doorjamb allow them to get underneath your doors.
Sources of food, whether open containers of dry ingredients or bags of garbage, are rich sources of food for scavengers like mice. If you habitually leave your food and food waste out in the open, you could be providing meals fit for kings for a population of mice.

, There are multiple ways to deal with this, some smarter than others. You could use poisons, call a professional exterminator, lay traps, or try to eliminate the reasons for why mice have entered your home. Only you can know which method will work best for your specific infestation, so take a look below and read each method carefully before you decide on which one you should take.


Consider the environmental implications. Some forms of extermination are more environmentally friendly, or less environmentally damaging. Poisons may not be the best option if you are eco-conscious, but snap traps are generally made out of more sustainable resources like hardwood and steel.
Weigh your options against your moral commitments. Maybe you are uncomfortable with actually killing the mice in your house. Luckily for you, it isn't necessary to actually exterminate your pests. You can also trap them and let them loose, or make it impossible for them to continue living in your home.
Even if you don't plan on employing a professional exterminator or pest controller, talking with one might be helpful. They are professionals at what they do, and will know all the ways - effective or not - for eliminating pests.
None of these methods are mutually exclusive. If you find that one method is only partially effective, you can combine it with others. Boarding up your walls works well in conjunction with laying traps, for example.

, As previously mentioned, mice get into your home because you have, in some way, allowed them in. Find all the holes, gaps, and potential entry points into your home and have them sealed.


For inside walls, depending on the size of the hole or crack, there are multiple useful methods for fixing it. If your wall is made out of drywall, there are more specific ways for fixing that as well.
For outside walls, you might want to fill in the area with concrete, or patch it up with steel.
For kitchen floor, you may have to retile or regrout the floor, depending on the extent of any damage.
If you have an attic, or even if you don't, check your roof for any holes or gaps in the shingles where mice might be able to enter
Find and fix any gaps in your windows or your doors.

, Mice thrive in messy areas, which are often neglected and full of useful material with which to make their nests. Once you've eliminated your mouse infestation, be sure to keep your house as spotless as possible


Keep all inaccessible areas, such as corners, broom closets, or the attic, clean and free of debris.
Don't leave useful items, such as cardboard, old books, garments, or cloth lying around. Mice can use these to make their nests.

, Mice are in your home because it is easier to be there than it is to be outside. Eliminate that consideration and you will go a long way to preventing any future recurrence of mouse infestation.


Place food that is on the ground or low to the ground on higher shelves, or in sealed cabinets
Store food in sealed containers, especially food stored in soft cardboard boxes such as cereal, or in paper bags such as flour.
Make sure garbage is removed outside, with the bin lid tightly closed, as soon as the bag is full.
Ensure your refrigerator door is not opening unbidden, and so is sealed to any potential mouse interlopers.

, Mice are wild animals, after all, and they do have natural diets. A mouse in the wild will eat fruits, nuts, and grains, and so any source of these on your property is a potential attractant for mice.


If you have fruit trees or berry bushes, do yourself a favor and pick the fruit. This will simultaneously eliminate a source of food for mice, as well as give you something delicious to eat at the end. Make sure to pick up and throw away anything that has fallen on the ground as well.
If you have grasses or grains and you do not plan to harvest them, take some time to mow your lawn and to throw away the debris in your yard waste bin. In general, the less places there are to hide, the less mice will be able to live on your property.

, There are many substances known to repel mice, and so it doesn't hurt to place some of them around your house to deter them from entering. Some of these substances include:


Mint leaf
Bay leaf
Strong oils such as tea tree or peppermint
Snake or cat feces.

, Even after you've fixed all the problems with your home and eliminated your mouse infestation, that doesn't prevent you from having the same problem again.

, Mice squeak, scratch, and make all sorts of noises in the walls. This may be your first indication that you have a mouse problem, so if you hear any strange noises or bumps in the night - the time that mice are most active - then start looking around your house for other signs that mischief is afoot.

, Mice eat a lot, and so they eliminate a lot of waste. Look for their droppings along walls, near suspected nests, and around your food and garbage. Mice also urinate a lot, and may develop ""urine pillars,"" piles of grease, dust, and urine, which they leave around the house.

, You will generally find these on sources of food, such as boxes of cereal or bags of flour, as well as around your garbage bin. You may also find them on furniture. You can distinguish new bite marks on wooden furniture by the color of the mark: lighter colors mean newer, darker colors mean older. However, if you have a pet, make sure this isn't their work instead.

, Mice have a lot of oil and other filth in their fur coats, and will leave some of it behind when they squeeze under doors and window frames. Generally, mice leave a smaller amount of residue, but if you find a large amount, you may be dealing with a rat rather than a mouse problem.

, Mice like to sleep in comfort, just like we do. You may find their nests in out-of-the-way areas of the house, such as the corners of walls, in the attic, or in a rarely used broom closet. You may also find them embedded in the walls, if you are able to search there.

, Other animals, especially prey animals, will get your dogs and cats very excited. If you suspect an infestation of mice and you notice Fido is a little more jumpy as of late, investigate and see where he gets excited. He may have done your legwork in finding their nesting areas.

, Mice are a diverse bunch, and when you are dealing with a mouse infestation, it is always best to know which species is to blame. Once you know the species, you have access to information on their feeding, sleeping, and mating habits, which will in turn help you eliminate the problem infestation. Here is some general information that may help you discover which species is at the root of your pest dilemma.


There are hundreds of different species of mice, categorized broadly into Old World and New World subfamilies. The most common species to consider are the deer mouse, house mouse, field mouse, wood mouse, dormouse, spiny mouse and zebra mouse.
Mice range in size, from a low of one inch to a high of seven inches. This measurement does not include tail length, which may be as much as twice the length of the mouse's body.
Mice vary in color, from light brown bodies with lighter-colored underbellies, to dark brown, to grey. Keep a lookout for all different types, especially if you don't know which species you are dealing with.
You can tell a rat from a mouse based on size, speed, and coloring. Rats are larger, darker, and slower than mice, which are generally smaller and nimbler than their cousins.

Determine what types of rodents are in your home.,
Determine which type of rat you’re up against.,
Choose bait based on which type of rodent is in your home.,
Recognize behavioral differences between rodents.",How to Catch a Rodent in Your House1," Determine rodent type based on the rodent dropping you find. Mice droppings are a ¼ inch long with pointy ends, and rat droppings are ½-¾ inch with relatively rectangular or sausage like shapes.Squirrel droppings are roughly 3/8 inch with rounded edges, and can be recognized by the fact that they lighten in color over time., There are two common types of rats. Brown rats (Norway rats) are particularly common. Their bodies are 7-10 inches long, they have gray-brown fur, and a tail that is shorter than their body. Indoors, they live in basements and lower portions of buildings.Black rats (roof rats) are smaller, with 6-8 inch bodies, darker gray or black fur, and have tails that are longer than their bodies. Indoors, they lives in attics, voids in ceilings, and the upper portions of buildings., Peanut butter is a great option, as it appeals to all types of rodents. Certain types of bait will also work better during certain times of the year.


For brown rats, use hot dog, bacon, beef stick, or peanut butter.For black rats, use buts, peanut butter, dried fruit, or berries.For mice, use peanut butter, chocolate, oats, or nesting materials such as string.During the fall and winter seasons, female mice will actively gather materials to build nests. During these times, load some traps with string, cotton, and similar items.For squirrels, use peanut butter, nuts, grains, seeds, and tender fruits and vegetables., Aside from favoring certain types of bait, rats and mice have very different temperaments that lead to important behavioral differences. Rats are naturally cautious, while mice tend to be curious.Be aware of seasonal behaviors too. Trap squirrels in late spring and early winter in particular, as this can prevent breeding."

Set snap traps.,
Set glue traps.,
Try a homemade water trap.,
Check the traps often.,
Dispose of the dead mouse promptly.,
Let a cat do the job.",How to Get a Mouse Out of the House2," This is widely considered to be the most effective method for getting rid of a mouse. Snap traps are baited with peanut butter or cheese. When the weight of the mouse presses against the trap, a wire springs down and kills it instantly. Using snap traps isn’t the most pleasant way to kill a mouse, but it does get the job done.


Set traps in places where you’ve noticed signs of a mouse, like droppings or a nest.
Bait the traps with a little cheese or peanut butter. One effective trick you can try is to cut the toe off a pair of pantyhose, tie the bait inside, and secure the pantyhose to the place on the trap where you’re supposed to put the bait. The mouse’s teeth will get caught on the pantyhose, causing the trap to spring.

, These look like little cardboard houses. The floor of the traps are lined with a very sticky glue that keeps mice in place as soon as they run inside. Once mice are caught, they eventually die of starvation. Place the traps in areas where you’ve seen signs of a mouse, like near closets or behind the refrigerator.

, Get a pail or garbage can, preferably with two opposing handles. Fill it one-quarter full of water. Poke a hole in the bottom of a used can or bottle. Get a string or piece of thin rope or wire and string it through the can, then tie it onto both handles Smear a bit of peanut butter on the can to serve as bait. Use a piece of plywood propped against the bucket to provide some kind of access for the mouse to reach one handle of the pail. The mouse will climb up the ramp to get to the bait, but once it steps onto the can, it will slip off into the bucket.


Leave overnight and there will be a drowned mouse in the pail to dispose of the next day. On a larger scale this can also work for a rat.

, Once you set a mousetrap of any kind, don’t forget to check it every day. You may need to replace the bait if a smart mouse figured out how to steal it. And if you caught a mouse, leaving it to sit for several days is unsanitary. The dead mouse could draw bugs and start to smell, so don’t forget to check your traps.








, When you see you’ve caught a mouse, place glue traps into a trash bag and seal it tightly. You can throw the bag out with the regular trash pickup. Glue traps aren't reusable, so don’t attempt to take the mouse out of the trap. If you are using a snap trap then simply deposit the dead mouse into a trashcan and reset the trap to catch another mouse.


You might want to wear a pair of thick gloves to protect your hands when you throw out the trap.
Bear in mind that if you used a glue trap, the mouse may still be alive when you throw it away. You can euthanize the mouse by applying massive force to the head with a heavy object (such as a brick). This is to ensure not only the animal doesn't suffer for long, but to ensure the animal does not manage to escape.

, Cats are natural predators of mice, and having one around is a great way to keep the population down. If you don’t already own a cat, see if a friend who’s a cat owner would mind if you had the cat come stay with you for a few days. Not all cats like to catch mice, so this isn’t guaranteed to work, but it’s often just as effective as setting a trap.

Seal your doors.,
Keep your trash contained.,
Clean up messes.,
Use repellents to keep mice away.",How to Get a Mouse Out of the House3," If you have a crack between the bottom of your door and the floor, a mouse can walk right in. Mice can squeeze through very slim cracks, so don’t look at a crack and assume nothing could get through. Go to the hardware store and buy a door seal that you attach to the bottom of your door to close the gap.









Look around the vicinity of your door to see if there are any other places mice could be getting in. You might have holes in your foundation that need to be caulked. You can also stuff them with steel wool.
Check your screen doors to make sure they don’t have holes, too.

, Mice are attracted to food smells, so it’s important to keep your trash well contained within your house and your yard. Use trash cans with tight-fitting lids both inside and outdoors. Make sure trash gets removed from the premises promptly on trash collection day.


Mice may also be attracted to recycling containers, since the bottles, cans and boxes they contain could still have traces of food on them. Keep recycling in a container with a lid as well.
If you have a compost pile, make sure it’s located well away from your home, since it may be attracting mice.

, Both inside your house and in your yard, clean up messes that could provide food and shelter for mice. When you leave food out, neglect to pick up crumbs, or even have a pile of brush in your yard, mice might start to move in. Keep your home neat and tidy to make it less hospitable to mice.








, There are several effective natural substances you can use to keep mice out of your house. When they smell a repellant, they won’t want to come in. Many mice repellents smell great to humans, so don’t hesitate to sprinkle them around your house. Put your repellant of choice in the cracks, crevices and dark spaces where mice tend to dwell. Here are some to choose from:









Peppermint oil, which is great for sprinkling on countertops and other kitchen spaces
Cedar chips or cedar oil
Predator urine, available for purchase from places that sell any type of pest repellent

Visit a local hunting- and fishing-supply store, look online for ""squirrel traps,"" or hire a professional trapper.If you're up for a project, consider building a squirrel trap from things you might have lying around your home.;
, You can buy various models, but most are metal cages with a trip-lever in the back. The squirrel walks in, drawn by the alluring smell of bait, and trips the lever to shut the door of the cage. This way, you can take the animal alive, without having to kill it or dispose of the remains. Mount this trap on the hole through which the squirrels are entering and exiting.


Make sure that the cage is large enough to hold a squirrel. In general, it should be at least 16 inches long, five inches wide, and five inches high.Consider the ethical as well as the practical benefits of using a live trap. Not only do you avoid a messy cleanup, but you avoid killing an unwitting creature.

, This is best suited to indoor squirrel infestations.Figure out where your squirrel has been getting in, and set the trap at this opening. The idea of the one-way trap is that the squirrel can get into the hole, but not out of it.


You should be able to find the entrance by looking for light or feeling for an airflow. Check vents in the walls and ""valleys"" in your roof. The holes may be smaller than you expect.If you just want to keep the squirrel out of your attic, you can set up a one-way door trap leading outside. This way, the squirrel will be able to get out, but it won't be able to get back in. Be aware, however, that mother squirrels often hide out in attics when they are raising their young – so you might wind up with a bunch of dead baby squirrels unless you are able to root them out., Try using peanut butter: it's nutty, and it isn't something that squirrels come across often. Grains like bread are a great supplement to the nutty flavor – so consider simply spreading peanut butter onto a piece of bread. You can also use various other nuts, nut butters, seeds, trail mix, or fresh fruit.In a pinch, almost any easy-to-lift morsel of human food should serve to entice the squirrel. Don't use meat or dairy products.

, Leave small morsels of your bait out in the open, with no trap or a disabled trap, so that they get used to the taste. Do this for a couple of days before you try to catch a squirrel. This serves a few purposes: you will be able to make sure that the squirrels like your chosen bait, and you will ""train"" the population to seek out these easy, tasty meals., If you've seen a lot of squirrels in your backyard, eating the birdseed – place the trap near the birdseed, so that the squirrels will encounter it on their way. If there is a squirrel in your attic, put the trap in the attic. Make sure that the opening of the box is enticing and easily accessible. If you're outdoors, check for signs of squirrel activity on the ground: nut shells and pine cone shreds are usually telltale signs.


Squirrels like to be out and about in the mid-morning, so this is a good time to execute your plans., If you plan on catching and releasing the squirrel, you'll need to make sure that it survives from the time it is caught until the time you check the trap. Again: a piece of bread spread thick with peanut butter should do the trick. Consider leaving a small bowl of water in the trap, too.

, Change out the bait every 3-4 days. If you plan to humanely catch and release the squirrel, try to find it and free it before it dies. On a practical level: even if you don't care about the squirrel's survival, it will quickly start to smell if it dies and begins to decompose in an enclosed space.Try not to spook the squirrels. Check the trap from afar, if possible. If the trap is outside, look out your window instead of coming close. However, if the trap is in your attic or another indoor space, you might not be able to avoid creating a disturbance.
Don't take the trap for granted. If you don't catch a squirrel within a week, you might reconsider the type of bait and the location of the trap.

, If you have set the intention of killing the squirrel, and you plan to, say, stuff it, then you probably won't want to keep it alive for release. Otherwise, however, consider that you don't need to kill the squirrel to get rid of it. You can catch the squirrel humanely and release it back into the wild. This way, you can rest with both an easy conscience and a squirrel-free property.

, Bring the captured animal at least a mile from where you caught it. On average, the home range of the male eastern gray squirrel is around 3.41 hectares, and you'll want to take it even further to reduce its chance of returning.It helps if you've trapped the creature in an easy-to-transport box, cage, or bucket.


Consider bringing the squirrel across a river from your property. Squirrels can swim, but a large river should provide enough of a deterrent to keep them from coming back. Make sure that the squirrel won't be able to cross the river on a ""bridge"" of tree canopies.If you have caught multiple squirrels, feel free to release them all at once. You may need a car to carry all of the cages.

, Bring the trap into a wooded area – preferably a park or a forest, rather than someone else's property. Make sure that you're at least thirty feet from the nearest road. Set the trap on the ground and wait for the animal to calm down. Then, when you're ready, carefully prop open the door of the trap. Let the squirrel run free.


Be patient. You may need to wait a minute or two for the squirrel to feel comfortable making a dash. Try walking away from the trap for a minute, then coming back once the squirrel has escaped.

Consider kill traps.,
Do not use poison.,
Use the right amount of bait.,
Use lots and lots of traps.,
Place traps along walls.,
Check your traps frequently.,
Take care with pets and children.",How to Catch a Rodent in Your House2," Electronic kill traps are widely considered to be the most effective method of removing mice and rats from your home. They are also safer for non-rodents in your home, and easier to dispose of compared to other kill traps. While they are more expensive, they are the quickest way to rid your home of mice and rats, and are the most humane type of kill trap. (Live traps, however, are the most effective way to get squirrels out of your home.)


There are kill trap options for trapping mice that you can use without ever seeing or touching a mouse., Poison can cause rodents to die in your walls or attic, leading to unpleasant and hard-to-remove aromas. They are also dangerous to pets and children. Considering the relative effectiveness and safety of traps, you do not need to use poison to rid your home of rodents.

, Regardless of the type of trap you choose, effective baiting is vital. Depending on the type of trap you’re using and the type of rodent you’re after, different amounts of bait will be ideal.


For rats, leave traps baited with a small amount of food, but not set, for a few days in a high activity area. This allows rats to become comfortable with the presence of the trap.Since mice are more curious, pre-baiting traps is usually unnecessary. Use only a very small amount of bait when trapping mice to ensure the mouse springs the trap.
For squirrels, use plenty of bait, as you want to lure them fully into a live trap.

, This is extremely important. Set more traps than you think you need. The number of rodents is almost certainly higher than you think.This is true for both rats and mice. Rodents breed so quickly that professionals recommend that you set a dozen traps for each rodent you see.Continue to trap as long as you see any evidence of rodent activity., Rodents will continue to use established paths, which will almost always be along the base of walls, counters, or similar vertical structure.Place traps perpendicularly against walls where you know rats and mice are traveling. Place traps wherever else you find evidence of rodent presence as well. On pathways you are certain of, place two traps side by side to catch rodents that may jump over the first trap they encounter.


For squirrels, place traps along the wall in the attic or crawlspace, near the bottom of the trees outside your home, and directly on your roof, especially near trees or power lines that may be routes that squirrels take into your home., Empty your traps, re-bait them, and reset them as quickly as possible. If a certain bait worked, use it again. Nonetheless, vary the bait from time to time. Change the bait you’re using from time to time to increase a trap’s appeal.For instance, switch from one type of food to another, or, with mice, switch from food to nesting material.


Check live traps twice a day. Rodents in traps can quickly die from the stress of being trapped., Keep kids and pets away from traps of all types. This is important to for both your loved ones' safety and for the effectiveness of the traps. Do not touch pets prior to setting trap, as the scent will make rodents avoid the trap."

Do not use glue traps.",How to Catch a Rodent in Your House3," While catch and release is undoubtedly the most humane way to rid your home of mice and rats, they will likely try to re-enter your house. If they do not succeed, they will likely die outside.If you do release a rodent outside, release mice and rats at least a mile from your home.Squirrels should be released at least 4-5 miles from your home., Use live traps for squirrels. The most common type of live trap is a small cage-like structure with some type of trap door. The company Havahart makes several sizes and models of this type of structure.These are widely considered to be the most effective for trapping squirrels, and can work for rats as well.For mice, choose a trap that can hold multiple mice with a rotating trap door. Victor makes several different models that are smaller and designed to catch multiple mice in this way.Since they can catch multiple mice (sometimes as many as a dozen!) without being emptied, they also require less maintenance., An especially cheap trap option involves using a cardboard tube (such as those used to hold paper towel). Try this if you find evidence of mice on your counters. To try it, flatten one side of the tube so you have a half-circle shaped tunnel. To set your homemade trap:


Place the tube so that one end hangs off the edge of the counter.
Place a bucket or garbage can beneath the end of the tube.
Place a treat at the end of the tube that hangs off the edge of the counter. This will lure mice into the tube. The apparatus – and the mouse – will fall into the receptacle you set up below when the mouse reaches the treat., Though glue traps may seem humane since they don’t immediately kill rodents, they are actually the least humane type of trap. Rodents will chew their limbs off when stuck in glue traps, or die slowly."

Wear ear plugs.,
Mask the noise with loud music or other audio.,
Try white noise.,
Meditate or try breathing exercises to calm yourself.",How to Cope With the Sound of Rats at Night1," Cushioned ear plugs are designed to comfortably reduce noise levels. Visit your local pharmacy to find some intended to wear while sleeping. Put them in at night, and you might not be able to hear the sounds of rats., If you are lucky, your rat problem will be manageable, and you will only hear the occasional squeak or scratch. If you play loud, vibrant music, you will have a better chance of covering up the rodents’ sounds so you can ignore them altogether.You can also try loud television, talk radio, or other types of audio.

, You can purchase devices that emit what is known as white noise--a random, low-level sound that is a little like static. You can even find streaming audio channels that will play white noise continuously. White noise is thought to be soothing, and it may also help mask some of the sounds made by rats., There are a variety of meditation and breathing exercises that you can try before bed or any other time at night. These are known to help reduce stress levels and improve your sleep, so they can help you cope with the sounds of rats at night. For a simple exercise:Sit in a comfortable position, such as cross legged or on a chair.
Focus by breathing in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, then slowly exhaling through your mouth.
Try to clear your mind of worries by focusing on a single visual object, repeating a short mantra (like “I am at peace”), or visualizing a place that makes you feel calm and happy.
Do this as long as you like, but at least for a few minutes.

Set up a trap with bait.,
Poison the rodent.,
Hire an exterminator.,
Rely on a pet.",How to Get Rid of Mice and Rats1," There are many different types of traps that vary in terms of if and how they kill what they trap. Choose the trap that you like best, and make sure to place a highly desired piece of food properly in the trap to successfully attract the mouse or rat.


Try a snap trap. These traps are set off by removal of bait. When the rodent attempts to take the snack that is carefully placed in the trap, the mechanism snaps a wire down and kills it nearly instantly by snapping the rodent’s neck.
To catch but not kill, choose a cage trap. When the mouse or rat steps on the pan located inside the trap, the treadle is tripped and the door closes. This traps the rodent without killing it.Avoid a sticky trap. This kind of trap has a special glue on it that sticks permanently to the rodent’s feet. This is one of the least humane options because the trapped mouse or rat starves to death slowly.;
, There are many different types of rodenticide, so pick the right one by assessing the environmental conditions and the severity of the infestation.Poison is often delivered to mice and rats via bait station. These “stations” are pellets packaged in a paper or cellophane material. After gnawing through the packaging and ingesting the pellets, the rodent dies., Contact a professional rodent exterminator if you’ve tried a few different methods and you’re still having problems, or if you aren’t comfortable trapping or killing mice and rats. Ask around for recommendations, call the exterminator, and ask for a quote.


Also, be sure to ask if the professional is licensed by the state, so that you know whether or not their business is legitimate., Cats and sometimes even dogs have a natural “killer instinct” and will hunt and kill rats and mice in their living space. Getting a new pet may take care of decreasing the rodent population in and around your home."

Learn about bees and chimneys.,
Determine how and why the bees are getting in.,
Get rid of the bees, with professional help.,
Avoid the urge to light a fire!,
Prevent bees from returning by changing the air flow.,
Remove the honey.,
Remove the remaining wax.",How to Remove Bees from a Chimney," Understand that bees benefit from airflow and seldom nest in places that have little airflow, so the updraft found in walls and chimneys near your fireplace fits bee preferences perfectly. Understand, also, that a chimney is made up of an inner flue and an outer wall and that there is usually a space or cavity between them that is an ideal home for bees.;
, You will achieve more success if you approach the problem through the bees' main entrance. Depending on your house construction, there are a quite a few possibilities for bee entrances, so observe the bees carefully to find out where the bees are entering.

Firstly, carefully examine the chimney weep holes. The bricks of the outer chimney wall should have weep holes that let out moisture build-up in the chimney cavity. Look for the weep holes about knee high just above the damp course of bricks. Unless the house has weep hole vents or insect barriers, the bees have easy access to the chimney cavity through the weep holes and you will often find that this is the main entrance for the feral bee colony.






Secondly, carefully observe the opening at the top of the chimney to see if there are bees coming and going. If the bees get in this way, it is generally through an imperfect mortar joint between a couple of flue sections about 300mm (1 ft.) down from the top of the chimney.






Thirdly, there is, sometimes, a chimney pot which constricts the chimney exit and, in this case, the bees will usually build their nest across the inside of the main flue, perhaps about 750 to 800mm (2-3 ft.) further down.







, You can't achieve much by trying to extract old combs in the main flue (or cavity) until you get rid of the bees. The sensible way to do this is to get someone with a pesticide license to dust down the flue and cavity with permethrin powder.

For a down-the-flue application, permethrin powder doesn't need to be applied with pressure. Sprinkling a cup full of powder down the flue will do the job.






If, however, bees are entering through the weep holes on the side of the chimney, the same powder must be blasted into the cavity through each weep hole.






It will generally take only four or five minutes for the permethrin powder to be effective and clear the cavity of bees. However, there will be bees hanging around the area for another hour or two.        







, If your chimney houses a metal flue from a slow combustion stove, do not light a fire in the heater. Molten wax running down the chimney can catch fire like a blow torch, and you could lose your house to fire.

In this case, use permethrin dust to exterminate the bees.






Once the bees are completely gone, you will probably have to remove the inner part of the flue to clean it out properly.                                             







, Whatever you do, increase air flow through the area the bees used to live.  This will discourage further infestation, but will not deter scavenging of the honey by other colonies.

If the top of the chimney had been previously capped with, perhaps, a concrete capping, it's best to lift the cap a bit so that bees can sense that the cavity is now repulsive. 






Don't try sealing off the top of the chimney with wire-mesh screen. Bees will always find a way in and will become frantic when trapped.







, Let the natural ""scavenging"" activity by other colonies proceed. It's the easiest way to get honey in the chimney cleaned out. Once the honey is gone, the remnant wax will dry, becoming papery weak.

, After any ""scavenging"" by other colonies, use a long hook or trowel on the end of a long handle to get rid of the rest of the wax. As far as possible, ensure that all remnants of the hive are removed.

Make sure it’s rats that you hear.,
Call for professional help.,
Set rat traps.,
Use lethal poisons to control rat populations.,
Try humane deterrents.",How to Cope With the Sound of Rats at Night2," Lots of animals can get in a house and make noise--birds, racoons, even cats. Rats will be accompanied by high-pitched squeaks. These will intensify when the rats fight. You may also hear various clawing, scratching and chewing sounds. These can be surprisingly loud, and seem like a much larger animal is making them.You may also smell a distinctive, musky scent if rats are present. If you smell an especially foul odor, a rat may have died within the walls, roof, or flooring of your home.
Dark, coffee-bean sized droppings are also a tell-tale sign of rats.

, If you live in an apartment, your building manager may be required to contact a professional exterminator to deal with a rat problem. Get in touch with your management if you think you hear rats. If you are a homeowner, you can take matters into your own hands, but a professional will be more likely to deal with the problem satisfactorily., This classic method for controlling rat problems can be effective as long as they are used properly. Snap traps have a spring-loaded mechanism that pins rats down when they step on it. Glue traps work by trapping rats that walk on their sticky surface.Place several traps in places where rats are (look for their droppings). Set them in narrow places (such as behind boxes or furniture) so that rats are forced to walk on them.
Bait the traps with food rats are likely to enjoy, such as peanut butter, raisin bread, bacon, or candy.
If you find a rat has been trapped and killed, wrap it in newspaper or a plastic bag and throw it away. Wash your hands afterwards.

, If you are taking on the extermination job yourself, make sure to use only approved rat poison or rodent bait, available from home supply stores. Carefully follow the usage directions and precautions advised by the manufacturer.Many forms of bait will come installed in pre-made, secure containers. Place these near the suspected rats. The rodents will enter the container, eat the bait, and die.
Poisons are often not recommended for use in buildings. Rats may eat the bait, then die and decompose in a hard-to-reach space like the interior of a wall.

, Though rats are undesirable and potentially dangerous, you might not want to kill them. There are a number of humane options to drive rats away. For instance:Play loud music or other audio during the day and night.
Shine strobe lights in areas you suspect rats to live.
Soak cotton balls, wads of cloth, or other items in ammonia. Set them in places where you suspect rats are coming in and out (such as a hole in a wall).

Get rid of clutter and waste.,
Cover all potential entryways.,
Get a cat.",How to Cope With the Sound of Rats at Night3," Simply reducing the access that rats have to food supplies and shelter is an excellent way to control the critters. If rats are a known or suspected problem, make sure to do things like:Cover all trash cans with tightly fitting, locking lids.
Avoid leaving food or waste out in the open.
Clean up all crumbs and other debris.
Avoid letting things like newspapers, cardboard boxes, or clothing pile up.
Keep grass and other plant material trimmed, and discard the trimmings.

, It’s not always easy to tell how rats are getting in your home. They can enter walls and roofs through surprisingly small and out-of the way access points. However, covering any obvious access points (like holes in a wall or roof) will at least slow them down.Cover access points with wood, foam sealant, or similarly solid material.
For a thorough job, ask a professional to inspect your home and deal with any potential access points they identify.

, Though they’re not a quick fix, “mousers” can be great at controlling rodent problems. It’s true that many cats are excellent hunters, and will pounce on any rats they find, and discourage others from sticking around. You might consider getting a cat for just this reason if you are bothered by the sounds of rats. Cats are not a perfect solution, however."

Put 20-30 drops of peppermint oil in cotton balls and place them strategically around your home to deter them.Using clove oil with cotton balls in this same way will also work, especially on mice.

, Rats and mice don’t like the smell and taste of these items, and tend to avoid being around them. Place these sheets all around problem areas such as countertops and pantry shelves., Minimize or eliminate food and water sources and landscape your yard frequently.

Use honey or sugar water as bait.,
Poison bees with laundry soap.,
Position your traps near bee access points.,
Check traps every two weeks.",How to Make a Bee Trap1," Remove the cap. Use a utility knife to cut off the top of the bottle slightly below where the neck straightens. To cut an even line, wrap a piece of masking tape around the bottle to mark where you’ll cut., Hold the bottle top so the capless end is facing downward. Insert this into the bottle bottom. Hold the bottle top in place at the top of the bottle bottom with your fingers. Staple the top to the bottom on four opposing sides.


If you don’t have a stapler, tape the seam between the inverted bottle top and the bottle bottom instead.If you want to reuse your traps, fasten the bottle top and bottom with clothespins. You only need to unfasten the clothespins to clean, empty, and refill your 2-liter bottle trap., Drill two holes an inch (2.5 cm) below the top of the trap, with each hole on opposite sides of the bottle. Use a drill bit large enough to allow your cord to pass through. Feed one end apiece of a length of cord into the two holes holes. Knot the ends of the cord and it’s ready to hang., Pour honey or sugar water directly into the bottom of the trap. You don’t need much; a thin layer will be enough to attract bees. Bees will be attracted to the sweetness and won’t be able to escape, eventually dying in the trap.Save the lives of bees by only using honey or sugar water. When you see a bee trapped inside, take it away from your home and carefully release it., To ensure bees that enter your trap don’t make it out alive, add a tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid laundry soap to your bait. Distribute the soap throughout the bait by stirring it with a utensil. The soap will poison and kill all bees that ingest it., Placing your traps too close to bee access points may actually draw more indoors. Prioritize locations in the sun. Sunlight will make the bait more effective and also cause bees to die in the trap faster.


Hanging traps tend to attract bees better than ground traps. Ground traps, however, can be effective guarding window access points., If you’ve fastened your bottle top and bottom with staples, you’ll either need to remove the staples to clean and refill the trap or make a new one. Otherwise, remove the tape or clothespins, dump the contents of the trap, rinse it, and refill it with honey or sugar water.


These traps will attract many kinds of insects, including ants. Use natural methods to prevent and remove ants."

Make sure it's not a bee first.,
Open all the windows and doors in the room.,
Try trapping the wasp with a jar.,
Make a wasp trap from a plastic bottle.,
Swat the wasp if necessary.",How to Kill a Wasp1," Not every yellow-black bug with a stinger is a wasp. There's a big difference between wasps, yellow-jackets, and honeybees, and since there's never any reason to kill a honeybee, it's a good idea to learn to differentiate between them quickly so you don't make a mistake and kill a good pollinator.


Wasps and yellow-jackets are usually skinny and smooth, and build small cone-shaped nests that are quite papery. Wasps aren't pollinators and are quite pesky, so it's usually ok to swat them when they come into your space.
Honeybees are hairy, shorter, and more rounded than wasps. They're usually harmless when left alone and are a critical and endangered part of the ecosystem. Never kill a honeybee.;
, If a wasp has gotten trapped in your house, the easiest way to get rid of it isn't swatting, it's opening up a way for the wasp to get out, where it really wants to be in the first place. Open up the exterior windows and doors, and then close off access to the rest of the house and wait for the wasp to leave. This shouldn't take more than a few minutes.


Make sure you're not opening windows that are right next to a wasp nest outside, before you try to open the windows.
If you're outside and you see a wasp, just leave it alone. Swatting at single wasps can attract other wasps, which can become quite dangerous.

, Use a small lidded jar to trap the wasp and release it outside. Wait for the wasp to land somewhere, then sneak up on it with your open jar and a piece of paper. Trap the jar over the wasp on the wall or the table where it lands, then slide the piece of paper underneath to trap it inside.


Always wait for the wasp to land on some easily accessible surface before you try to trap it. Swinging wildly at a wasp will get you stung more often than it will trap the wasp.
If you're allergic, don't do this by yourself. Get someone else to try to trap the wasp, or just open the windows and steer clear of it. If you must do this, wear some thick gloves and cover all the exposed areas of your body before you try.
Release or freeze the wasp for the easiest and most humane ways of getting rid of it. If you use a piece of paper, just set it down with the paper on top of the jar and the wasp still inside while you back away. The wind will blow the paper off eventually and the wasp can escape.

, Wasp traps are sort of like slippery funnels with soapy water at the bottom that wasps become stuck in. They're often made of glass and sold commercially, but you can make one yourself as well from a used plastic bottle.


Use a razor knife to cut off the tapered top of an empty two liter plastic soda bottle, turning it upside down to seat the nozzle down into the empty bottle. Tape it into place using masking tape. Fill the empty bottle about half-full of water.Squeeze a few drops of soap into the water and shake it to get it sudsy, then coat the neck of the bottle with honey, jam, or some other sweet stickiness to attract the wasps. Ideally, they'll slip down the spout into the water and get their wings soapy, becoming trapped.

, Anything that flies is susceptible to the flyswatter. Cheap, plastic flyswatters are some of the most popular pest-killing devices for a reason. They're easy to use and and quite effective, if you use it properly.


Sit with your swatter raised and wait for the wasp to land somewhere within reach. Wasps tend to buzz around a bit more than flies do, but it'll land eventually and let you strike.
Flick your wrist quickly down on the wasp to snap the swatter. The wasp will often just be stunned, so you can scoop it up and deposit it outside, where it can either recover and fly away, or die anyway. Don't keep swatting and mash it into the table.
If you don't have a flyswatter, a shoe, a hefty book, magazine, or a glove all make effective alternatives for this technique.

Identify the bee first.,
Open the windows and doors.,
Consider whether it's possible to trap the bee.,
Wait for the bee to land and trap it.,
Release the bee.,
Free the bee if you must.",How to Kill a Bee1," For some people, anything with a stinger that flies and is yellow and black might as well be called a ""bee,"" but there's a big difference between wasps, yellow-jackets, and honeybees. There's usually no reason to kill a honeybee, so learn the difference between them to deal with pests responsibly.


Wasps and yellow-jackets are pests with painful stings, usually skinnier, smoother in body and more angular than a honeybee, with small and papery nests. While they help in some ways with insect control, wasps contribute nothing to pollination and–while it may be better to just shoo them out a window–are less important and endangered than honeybees. It's usually ok to swat them occasionally.
Honeybee populations are endangered in many areas and colonies are struggling to survive. Usually rounded, hairy, and somewhat smaller than wasps, and relatively harmless, honeybees are an essential part of the ecosystem, providing important agricultural pollination. There's no reason to kill a honeybee.
Try to get a look at the nest. Honey bees build their nests out of wax, in a honeycomb formation, whereas other stinging insects tend to construct their nests out of wood fiber or mud.;
, If a bee is trapped inside, just open the windows to let them escape . Wait for the bee to pick up the scents and wind currents from outside and find its way back out of your house. If you can, shut the door to the room that the bee is in, trapping it there and go away for an hour or two, giving it plenty of time to find its way out.


The bee doesn't want to stay in your house and terrorize you. Your house is flower-free and useless to the bee to be inside. Wait for it to leave. When coming back into the room, be cautious until you are certain that the bee has gone.

, If you have a small lidded see-through container, use this to try to trap the bee and release it safely outside. It's always preferable to coax a bee away, as opposed to swatting it.


If you're allergic to bees, it is recommended that you get someone else to do this, or leave the area immediately. If you really have no choice, do this with the utmost care and wear protective gloves and have your epipen easily accessible.

, Wait until the bee is sitting on a wall or other solid surface and has a chance to calm down some. It's pretty difficult to snatch a quick bee out of the air with a jar, and you might anger it or accidentally kill it otherwise.


Approach carefully and quickly cup the container over the bee. Wait until the bee flies to the end of the container and quickly snap the lid on, or slide a piece of paper underneath the lip of the container to trap it inside.

, Take the bee outside and set it free. Open the lid, back off quickly and wait for it to fly out. Retrieve the container and you're done.

, If you really need to kill the bee for some reason, place the container in the freezer overnight and let the bee freeze. There's little reason to do this, but it's the most humane method and the simplest.

Get rid of nests early in the year.,
Don some armor.,
Find the hive.,
Spray the nest with pesticide spray.,
Use wasp-repellant dust.,
Use soap and water.,
Use smoke and water.",How to Kill a Wasp2," Nests are designed by queens and built by workers in early spring, and the colonies grow throughout the late spring and early summer until reaching peak size somewhere around August. The end of summer also finds wasps at their most aggressive and protective, making it a dangerous time to try to get rid of them.


Early in the year, the nests are smaller and more manageable. Get in the habit of patrolling the area around your home for wasp nests in the early season, before they've grown to dangerous sizes. If you kill the queen, there will also be no risk of the nest being rebuilt that year.
If it's late in the season, it's probably best to wait it out and let the frost kill off the pests in the next 30-60 days. Then, you can knock the empty nests down to ensure that they won't be repopulated next year.

, Anytime you go hunting around for wasps, you need to keep yourself well protected. You probably don't need a full-on chemical protection suit, but taking a few steps in precaution can keep you from coming home with nasty stings if you get swarmed.


You need to wear thick, long sleeves and pants, heavy gloves, a hood that covers as much of your face as possible, and eye protection. Even if it's super hot outside, don't skimp on the layers and the thickness of the clothing.
If you get swarmed by wasps, it's important to not over-think it: run as quickly as possible away from the wasps. While some people report that swinging articles of clothing or turning abrupt corners can be effective at shaking a swarm, the best way to get away is to run as fast as possible and get inside., If you're having a consistent problem with wasps in your area, it can be quite frustrating. But don't keep swatting them one at a time. Get rid of them at the source and get them away from your home. Find the nest and kill the nest and your problem will solve itself. Yellow-jacket nests are quite small, while wasp nests will be somewhat larger and more bulbous, like a papery football.


Wasps tend to build their nests in loose piles of wood, along rafters, or in garbage cans that are seldom used. Check under porch gaps, and anywhere in your home with a large void or construction gap.
Sometimes, nests can be buried behind walls, making them quite difficult to get to. Use a stethoscope or a water glass to hold up to the wall and listen for the buzzing. It might be necessary to drill into the wall to apply insecticide.

, When you find the nest, it's important to get rid of it as quickly and safely as possible, and the most effective technique is using insecticide spray to kill the wasps at the source.


Some commercial aerosol sprays are available that you can apply from as far as 20 feet away, keeping you a safe distance from the nest. The ECO PCO line of sprays are made of botanical compounds, making them somewhat safer than chemical-based sprays.
Alternatively, residual insecticide sprays like D-Fense SC and Cyper WP can be applied to the area immediately surrounding the nest, killing the wasps indirectly, from a safe distance.
Always defer to the manufacturer directions when applying any kind of pesticide spray.

, Insecticide dust is an effective long-term strategy for dealing with wasps, maintaining its efficacy for up to six months, and making it deter wasps for even longer in some cases. It's easy to use and widely available.


The brands Tempo Dust, Sevin Garden Dust, or Dusters are both effective brands of using on wasp nests.
Apply dust around the nest opening first thing in the morning, applying about a quarter cup loosely in the general area. Don't clog the opening, so the wasps can move freely and spread the dust around independently.One of the dangers of using dust is what makes it effective: it stays dangerous for a long time. If you have pets or small children, applying dust to a nest near your home might be dangerous. Use caution.

, It may be somewhat primitive, but with some good aim, plain soapy water is a somewhat effective way of destroying a nest and killing off the wasps with household supplies.


Mix about a third of a cup of dish soap into a half gallon of water and load it into as powerful a spray applicator as you can find. You want to be able to stand fairly far away from the nest as you spray it with sudsy water.
Shake the sudsy water to get it will integrated, then spray the soapy water liberally around the opening of the nest and get out of dodge. Reapply this soapy water several times over the next few days.

, One effective natural way of eradicating wasps is to combine natural wood smoke and water to get the wasps out of the area. When wasps sense fire in the area, they'll vacate the nest and allow you to destroy it safely.


Use a small grill to build a tiny and contained wood fire safely underneath the nest. Let the smoke rise steadily for an hour or two, while the wasps leave.
Come back to the area with a hose and spray the nest down, knocking it down with a stick if necessary, destroying it.

Remove abandoned nests in winter.,
Seal gaps in your home.,
Eliminate loose piles of wood and refuse in your yard.,
Clean up rotten fruit under fruit trees.,
Keep outdoor garbage tightly sealed.",How to Kill a Wasp3," Wearing thick clothing and heavy rubber gloves, you can safely dig out the remnants of abandoned nests after the wasps have been killed, or during the winter when the frost has killed them off naturally.


If you've sprayed insecticide on the nest, it's important to dispose of it in the garbage, properly. Use a hammer or a board to knock nests down and remove them from the area. Again, if you leave a nest intact, it can be repopulated.
It's still a good idea to wear protective clothing, just to be on the safe side. Even if you're sure most of the wasps are gone, you want to protect yourself from insecticide remnants, as well as the stray wasp.

, Wasps often build nests in small cracks and safe areas that are exposed to the outdoors. Keeping track of these areas as they develop and plugging them up to keep nests from forming will solve your problem before it starts.



Use silicone caulk sealant, applying a small bead of the sealant along the cracks you find, then smoothing them out with a scraper or your finger. Let it dry according to the manufacturer's directions., Wasps will often build nests in piles of firewood, or in piles of outdoor refuse that accumulate. If you've got piles of yard tools, or other odd, assorted materials on your property, try to keep it cleaned up as much as possible, or wasps will take up residence.

, Wasps are more likely to populate areas where there is a lot for them to eat. If you've got fruit trees nearby on your property, it's a good idea to clean up the rotten fruit as much as possible and as quickly as possible, or wasps will become more attracted to the area.


Generally, wasps will be attracted to fruit trees whether you clean up the fruit or not. It's still a good idea to clean it up to keep the wasps under control.

, Rotting food scraps are also attractive to wasps, making it critical that you keep your outdoor garbage cans tightly sealed to avoid letting them take up residence. If necessary, change out your cans regularly, if they attract wasps.

Find the hive.,
Contact a beekeeper in your area.,
Consider using insecticide, if necessary.,
Spray the nest.,
Remove the remnants of the nest.",How to Kill a Bee2," An established honey bee colony will sometimes divide itself, and one or more swarms will leave the hive. The new swarm may cluster for a while on a tree limb or bush near the old hive while scout bees search for a suitable place to establish a new home. Usually scout bees find a hollow tree, but occasionally they will choose the wall voids of a home.


Check under porches with gaps, along areas of new construction in your home, or other places that might house a hive. Anywhere with a large void is a possibility. Bees may nest in the wall or attic some distance from where they enter the wall.

, If honeybees have taken residence in your home or yard and are causing a serious problem, call your local beekeeper's association to see if they will come and collect the bees, since populations are declining. Afterward, you can simply and safely remove the hive and dispose of it without worrying about stings.

, If you've discovered honeybees, call a beekeeper and have the bees relocated. If you've discovered wasps, it's usually best to use insecticide to kill them and get them away from your home.


Once you know the general area of the hive, you can put a water glass on the wall and put your ear to the open end of the glass, and then slowly slide the glass around listening to the buzz behind the wall to locate the precise area occupied by the bee hive.] When the nest is located, a hole may be bored, preferably through the outside wall, so insecticide can be applied onto the nest directly.

, Carbaryl or Sevin 5 percent Dust is an insecticide commonly used to exterminate wasps and other pests from dwellings. If it is not applied properly, persistent efforts may be needed to finally accomplish the job.


Sevin dusted into the entrance to the hive may not reach the nest, which may be some distance from the entrance, so it's important to address the hive itself, not individual wasps and other pests.
It may take multiple attempts before you kill off the nest completely. Wear protective clothing and take care to avoid painful stings.

, Wearing thick clothing and heavy rubber gloves, you can safely dig out the remnants of the nest after the bees have been relocated or the wasps have been killed. If you've sprayed insecticide on the nest, it's important to dispose of it in the garbage, properly. If the bees have been moved, you can dispose of it outdoors without worrying. Take it far from your home and dispose of it.

Find a flyswatter.,
Locate the bee and wait for it to land.,
Swat quickly.",How to Kill a Bee3," If you've got yellow-jackets or wasps that you need to get rid of, the swatting device you usually use for common houseflies is also perfectly usable for wasps and other pests that you might want to stun and get rid of. Cheap plastic flyswatters are perfectly useful in getting rid of wasps.


Again, there's little reason to kill bees. If they're causing a problem, relocate the hive.

, Stand still in the general vicinity of the bee and track it. Wait for it to come close to you, with your swatter poised to strike. Wait until the bee lands before you move.


It's usually a good idea to wait with the swatter raised and poised to swat. If you have to raise the swatter after the bee lands, it's probably going to scare it. Then it's usually too late. Stand as still as possible.

, Flex your wrist to swat the flyswatter forward and stun the bee. If done properly, you may not actually kill the bee, you'll just stun it. Scoop it onto a


Don't swing at bees in the air. Swatting wildly in the air is a good way to anger a wasp and get yourself a nasty sting.

Verify it’s not a honeybee.,
Open the doors and windows if you’re inside.,
Leave any food which they’re interested in.,
Stay calm if the yellow jacket lands on you.,
Avoid antagonizing the wasp.,
Lure and trap the wasp with food.,
Create a more sophisticated, soapy trap.",How to Kill Yellow Jackets1," Difficult in the heat of the moment, with the creature buzzing around your head, but it’s an important distinction. Yellow jackets are wasps, and one of the more aggressive varieties. Unlike several other common wasps, they share the honeybee’s alternating, banded, black-and-yellow color scheme. These wasps have thinner bodies than bees, appearing less round and hairy, and have wings as long as their body.It’s important not to kill honeybees, who fulfill an important role in the ecosystem without exhibiting overly aggressive toward humans. To put their contribution in perspective: it’s been said that bees are responsible for one in every three bites of food that we eat! Bees will die after a single sting, and are not typically aggressors in their interactions with humans. They’re docile and sting only in an effort to defend and warn their hive.Wasps, however, can sting an indefinite number of times and will not hesitate to.;
, The goal here is elimination of the threat. Sometimes that can be accomplished by providing the wasp with an escape route. Herding the yellow jacket is not recommended, however, as your efforts may put you at unnecessary risk of being stung.


You should not, however, open a window or door that sits directly next to a known yellow jacket nest.

, Efforts to reclaim any food and drink will anger the wasp. Leave anything that it’s currently landed on alone. Quickly cover and seal away all other food and drink, then remove it from the yellow jacket’s vicinity., Erratic movements will only increase the likelihood of being stung. If it lands on you, refrain from making any sudden movements. Ideally, you’ll wait for the wasp to fly away of its own accord. If that tactic isn’t working, use slow, gentle efforts to move it along.

, Rolled-up newspapers and flyswatters can kill a yellow jacket, but physical combat can open you up to a world of hurt. Striking and failing to kill the wasp will only invite further stings.Similarly, attempting to spray a single yellow jacket with insecticide of any sort is not recommended. It will make a mess if used indoors, and can be dangerous to anybody in the vicinity.
Killing a wasp (or inciting a sting) can also spark extreme aggression from its compatriots. Wasp venom contains an ""alarm venom,"" which will draw other yellow jackets in and mark you as a target. , Yellow jackets often come into conflict with humans over food. They can be found buzzing around trash cans, and are particularly fond of fruit, meat, and sugary drinks.This can be used to your advantage: if the wasp isn’t already crawling on a piece of food you had out, try using some to coerce it into landing.


Place food inside a sealable jar, or a soda bottle with a screwable cap. Once the yellow jacket has landed, seal the wasp away and dispose of the bottle (or release it once you’re in an appropriate environment).

, Fill a bottle or bucket with soapy water, and suspend a small piece of protein (lunchmeat works well) from string, 1-2 inches above the water. Once the yellow jacket retrieves the protein, they’ll fall into the soapy water and drown. Mesh can be place atop the bucket if there’s concern over other animals eating your protein.

Look for white markings on the head.,
Look for dark, thick hair on the legs.

Look for bees boring holes into wood or flying near holes in trees.,
Examine weathered wood for holes.",How to Identify Carpenter Bees,";
, Carpenter bees are about 3/4 inch to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.54 cm) in length.

, Females have black heads, and males have white markings on their heads.

,, Carpenter bees will seek out wood, and will often fly close to it, examining it for possible nesting. A bee that is boring or coming in and out of a hole is creating the nesting area. Male carpenter bees will often hover, protecting the female while she is working.

, Carpenter bees enjoy a range of soft and hardwoods, and particularly like wood that is weathered. Look for carpenter bees in firewood and lawn furniture. Along your house, carpenter bees will try to bore into the bare wood near the roof, such as in eaves, gables and fascia. If you have had carpenter bees nest in an area of your house before, bees in the same place will likely be carpenter bees, as they like to return to old nesting sites.

This cloth bag should be able to be tied tightly closed and should be big enough to hold the wasp nest. If you do not have a suitable cloth bag, you should pick another method to get rid of the wasps.;
, Stand close to the wasp nest, holding the cloth bag. Be careful not to move suddenly.

, Pull the wasp nest down onto the ground. It should be tied tightly and sealed so that the wasps inside the nest cannot get out.

, Put a rock over the cloth bag to keep it submerged. Eventually the wasps will drown.You can also put at least of a quarter of a cup of dishwashing detergent or soap into the bucket of water to further immobilize the wasps.

Look for a difference in size.,
Look for differences in aggression.,
Notice how long it takes them to become calm after agitation.,
Look for bees that forage for pollen in small groups or alone.,
Observe different swarm patterns in AHB.,
Use DNA testing for certainty.",How to Identify Africanized Honey Bees1," Africanized honey bees look virtually identical to European honey bees (EHB) except for a slight difference in size. AHB are typically about 10% smaller than their counterparts, however, this is subtle and cannot be noticed with the naked eye. The size difference can usually only be noted using professional measuring instruments found in a laboratory. Not even experienced bee keepers can tell the difference simply on sight.AHB are aggressive. You should not approach a hive intending to extract a bee to measure its size. Leave this to professionals.;
, European honey bees and AHB respond differently to provocation. While all bees will respond aggressively to perceived dangers to their hive, AHB much more so. Whereas a EHB may send out as few as 10-20 guard bees to respond to a threat within 20 yards (18.3 m) of the hive, AHB may send several hundred with a range of 120 yards (110 m) from the hive.This is also seen in how many stings you can expect to receive if you encounter the hive. An AHB hive can administer as many as a thousand stings if disturbed whereas 10-20 strings is typical for a disturbed EHB hive.

, A normal EHB hive will calm back down after around 20 minutes, resuming their normal activities and no longer buzzing with aggression. AHB on the other hand can remain aggressive for hours afterward.

, Africanized honey bees are more solitary foragers than European honey bees and are typically considered opportunistic.


AHB also tend to forage at different times than EHB. AHB forage very early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun is disappearing, unlike EHB. They also seem to be less prone to be discouraged by overcast, cold weather and even light rain whereas EHB tend to stick to sunny days and are more sensitive to poor temperatures and rain., Swarming is when a queen leaves a hive and tens of thousands of worker bees follow in order to find and form a new hive. EHB tend to do this about once a year. AHB have smaller nests that they more readily abandon and thus will swarm 6-12 times a year. This is why AHB are typically less sought after by beekeepers. This constant swarming can really reduce the population left behind in their hive and require them to introduce new queens regularly.
Because of their frequency, AHB swarms tend to be much smaller than those of EHB.

, While the common person will not have access to this sort of test, it is virtually the only way to tell with certainty whether an individual bee is a AHB. Scientist use DNA tests to confirm an African bloodline in the specimen."

Hang traps close to active bee holes.",How to Make a Bee Trap3," Remove the flat part of the mason jar from the circular threaded part that fastens it. Measure and mark the center point of the lid. Divide the distance between the middle point and the outer edge in half on both sides. Mark these two points as well.The resulting three marks should form a straight line. The first mark will be the center of the lid, and the other two will be halfway between the center mark and the lid’s outer edge.

, Position your punch on top of one of the marks. Swing a hammer with firm, moderate force and hit the end of the punch to drive its tip through the metal at your mark. Repeat this for the two remaining marks.


Place the lid on a piece of scrap wood or heavy metal to prevent the punch from damaging your work surface., Turn the lid over so the punched side is facing downwards. Drill a hole at the center punch with a ½-in metal drill bit. This will create metal shavings, which can be sharp. Dispose metal shavings in the garbage.Drilling your center hole may have created metal burrs. Prevent cuts from these by removing them with a file.

, Fit the lid into its circular, threaded part. Align the hole in the center of the lid with the hole in the flat bottom of the post. Attach the lid by fastening it to the post with a screw in each of the two remaining punched lid holes., Measure and mark the center point of the angled top of your carpenter bee trap. Drill a screw hole here for your eye hook. Insert the eye hook, screw the glass jar into the attached lid mount, and hang it to trap and kill carpenter bees., Carpenter bees will be attracted to the holes in your trap and crawl inside it to lay eggs. However, the 45° angle of the entry tunnels will confuse the bees, drawing them into the glass jar where they can’t escape.

Ensure you’re not allergic.,
Locate the nest.,
Assess the infestation.,
Time it right.,
Suit up.,
Attack the nest.,
Wait a week to ensure success.,
Dispose of the nest.",How to Kill Yellow Jackets2," It’s wise to rule out an as-of-yet unknown allergy to wasps before you place yourself in a situation where you may, if things go poorly, be stung multiple times. If you can’t definitively say whether or not you’re allergic, contact your medical care provider to schedule an allergy test.


Wasp stings can be life-threatening, depending on the severity of a person’s allergy. The stings can trigger anaphylactic shock within minutes, leading to swelling, fainting, and difficulty breathing., Yellow jackets are cavity-nesting insects.They make their nests in the ground, in eaves of houses, beneath porches, and sometimes inside the voids of walls. How you deal with the nest will depend on its location.


If the whereabouts of the nest are still unknown to you, it might be necessary to lure a yellow jacket in with a sweet treat, then follow its flight path back to the nest. Yellow jackets move fairly directly when entering and exiting their nest, and do not swoop or turn.Any bit of meat, jelly, tuna, wet cat food, or soda can serve as effective bait.

, Smaller nests can be handled by a quick spray-and-escape, but larger nests will require you to take more thorough protective measures. Also, the sites that yellow jackets choose for their nests are often in spaces difficult to reach and treat. If you become uncomfortable, intimidated, or at any point feel unsafe in dealing with the nest, you should call a professional pest control service to take over.


Nests are generally begun by a single female in the Spring, and grow throughout the year before dying. In hotter climates with fewer freezes, e.g. southern U.S. States, nests can survive from year to year and grow to be extremely large and populous.This, however, is fairly rare.
If the nest appears to be large and spiral-shaped, you may actually be dealing with hornets. If it resembles an off-white honeycomb, the nest might belong to paper wasps, less aggressive cousins to yellow jackets., Yellow jackets are far more reluctant to fly when temperatures drop below 50 °F (10 °C). As a result, they are inactive during winter, gain strength in late spring and summer in order to feed their young, and become more active and aggressive around people during fall when food supplies run out. The best time of year to kill a wasp nest is in late spring or early summer when the queen's newborn colony is embedded in the nest.


Yellow jackets are also much more active during the day. Although you’ll have less visibility, dealing with the nest at night will mean fewer active wasps for you to rumble with.
If you don’t live in an area that remains hot year-round, the nest will likely die in the winter. If it’s already late fall, you might be better served by waiting the yellow jackets out—they’re at their most aggressive in fall.

, If you decide to handle the nest yourself, you will want to expose as little of your skin as possible. Wear long sleeves, pants, high socks, and a beanie pulled low over your ears. Dress in layers, and don both boots and gloves. A scarf worn over the mouth and nose can protect the lower face, and safety goggles can be purchased cheaply at any home improvement store to shield your eyes.


Yellow jackets, though they can become a nuisance to humans, are still fulfilling an import role in nature. They pollinate flowers and predate flies, caterpillars, spiders, and flora-destroying pests.Because of this, it’s a good idea to avoid bright colors, which can be mistaken for flowers.
Cover flashlights with red cellophane, or use red bulbs. Yellow jackets can't see in red light, and so won't be alerted by your flashlight if you’re approaching at night (as you should be).If you don't have cellophane, aim your flashlight away from the nest on your nighttime approach.

, Synthetic wasp nest killers work quickly, and can be applied to the colony by spraying directly into the nest—but these killers contain dangerous toxins that require extreme care around food, pets and humans. As an alternative, organic wasp killer chemicals use biodegradable oils and acids which are safer around other life.Both options are available as a spray or as a powder.


Aerosols are often designed to spray up to twenty feet. Use this to your advantage, and spray aerial nests from the ground if able. Ladders will significantly decrease your mobility, and can prove dangerous if attacked by the wasps while climbing.
If the nest is in the ground, cover the nest with soil or dirt immediately after spraying or dusting it.
For exterior nests, spray the aerosol directly into the nest according to package directions. Dust is best administered via a turkey baster.
Spraying the nest with hot, soapy water is also an option, thought not nearly as fast-acting. Thoroughly mix a third of a cup of detergent into half a gallon of water, then apply to the nest through a spray bottle. You’ll need to spray the nest several times a day, for several days.
Have your path back to safety (preferably back inside a house) planned out in advance. After you begin to spray, you should expect to have 10-15 seconds maximum to make your way back inside.

, If you’ve sprayed the nest with any chemicals, you’ll typically need to leave the nest alone for a week. There’s no guarantee that all of the nest’s wasps were inside when you treated it, so you should allow those yellow jackets which were out and about time to come back to their nest, which will expose them to the lethal chemicals you’ve applied.

, It’s important that you properly handle the yellow jacket’s nest after you’ve taken care of its inhabitants. Simply knocking a hanging nest down can lead to dogs or other neighborhood animals becoming exposed to the chemicals you used; if you sprayed the nest, knock the nest loose with a broom or shovel, then bag it up.


If—for whatever reason—you’d prefer to keep the nest in its place, that’s also okay. It’s extremely rare for yellow jackets to re-use old nests. Some like to hold onto wasp nests, captivated by their intricate, natural aesthetic. While yellow jacket nests aren’t as exotic as some, feel free to display the nest. Potential eggs cannot hatch and survive without feeding and care, so if the nest has been inert for the recommended week you’re in the clear. "

, You can use any generic soap, such as Dove, Softsoap, or Dawn. Feel free to put in as much soap as you would like into the hose end sprayer.

, The wasps will have all come home to their nest at night. Therefore you will be able to kill more of them with the soap solution.

, Hold the hose and point it toward the nest. Make sure that you are close enough to spray them powerfully but not so close that you’re likely to be stung.

, Use all of the solution that you have in the garden hose sprayer.The soap will paralyze the wasps, and the water will drown them.

, Wait until the next morning to ensure that all of the wasps have died. Use gloves if you need to handle the nest to put it into a garbage bag.

To make the fake wasp nest, crumple up the paper bag and wrap twine around it so that it holds a vaguely circular shape.
You could also use two paper bags for a bigger nest.
Hang up the fake nest with twine. Put it in the near vicinity of the wasp nest. Hang it up during the night, when the wasps are less active.
Wait for the wasps to notice the fake trap and leave. Wasps are territorial. They will not want their nest to exist near another “wasp nest,” even if that nest is fake.If this fake nest is not enough to make the wasps leave, it will deter future wasps from settling in your home.

, Fill it with water and a sweet lure, like lemonade. Wasps like sweet-smelling foods and foods that are high in protein.


Hang it in a location where you typically see a lot of wasps. The wasps will fly into it for the bait. They will then drown in the water.
Empty and refill the glass trap frequently. This will ensure there is always bait for the wasps.If you refill it very frequently, you might consider getting another glass trap.

, If you eat outside, avoid eating these foods in the presence of the wasps. They are attracted to the following foods especially:


Sweet foods
Foods high in protein
Pet food, Put garbage cans and compost as far away from the house as possible.

, While flowers attract wasps, some plants keep them away. Try mint, eucalyptus, citronella, and/or wormwood., The wasps are attracted to the flowers for the pollination. Put potted plants inside the house or move them far away from the house entirely.Keep flowery scents out of your house. Do not wear flowery perfume or use flowery air fresheners. These smells attract the wasps., A dead wasp produces pheromones that will bring more wasps and ants to the site of the dead wasp.An aggravated wasp is more likely to sting, too.

, Make sure all door, windows, and vents are tightly sealed. Wasps often enter houses through insufficiently sealed areas."

Look where AHB frequently nest.,
Check chimneys or crawlspaces for nests.,
Look for swarms of bees.",How to Identify Africanized Honey Bees2," EHB typically nest in dry, aboveground cavities. If you see an underground cavity brimming with bees, it is likely an AHB hive as they can tolerate the conditions better. Furthermore, EHB rarely nest in exposed areas whereas an AHB nest may be out in the open, such as hanging from an exposed tree branch. AHB usually nest in much smaller places than EHB. For example, a typical EHB hive is a cavity around 10 gallons (38 L) large. For AHB the cavities are 1 to 5 gallons (3.8 to 19 L) in size. This also makes it more difficult to see AHB nests and they are usually only seen once they are provoked.

, AHB will nest in many places regular European honey bees won't. Other possible nesting sites include empty containers, water meters, abandoned vehicles, old tires, lumber piles, outbuildings and sheds. , The best chance of identifying AHB is during their swarming season, which is March through July. Bees swarm as a means to reproduce their colonies. Worker bees will follow the queen from the hive during a swarm.

Prepare your home to be bee-proofed.,
Monitor nearby water sources.,
Never attempt to remove a nest yourself.,
Run away quickly if AHB become aggressive.,
Scrape, don't pull stingers.,
Seek medical attention after being stung.,
Treat minor stings.",How to Identify Africanized Honey Bees3," One way to avoid a run-in with AHB is to make sure they're not in or around your home. Make sure there are no gaps larger than 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) around chimneys or plumbing, as this is a favorite spot for bees.


Install screens fine enough to prevent a bee from fitting through.
Inspect any openings for bees coming and leaving your home regularly.

, If you have drains, tubs, or evaporative water coolers, this can attract bees as a water source. Add a few ounces of pine-scented cleaner in the water, as long as its not a water source. If it is a bird-bath add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of vinegar to deter bees in a way safe to the birds. , With the sheer aggressiveness of AHB, you should never try to remove a nest on your own, especially by hitting it, throwing rocks at it, or burning it.


Look in your local yellow pages for a pest control company to call. You can also call a local beekeeper who may want the bees for their own purposes or have a more humane way to remove the colony without killing the hive.

, Run away as fast as you can. Pull your shirt over your face to protect your head from stings. Do not run toward water as they will likely wait above the water for you. Run toward a well-lit area that may disorient the bees or shelter that can shut them out. Do not swat or flail your arms as you run. This movement will attract the bees further and possibly cause them to become more aggressive.
If you see someone else being attacked, encourage them to run and find shelter but do not physically intervene. This will only increase the risk of you being dangerously hurt and do little to help the person running.

, If you do get stung, do not pull the stinger out as this will release more venom. You should scrape the stingers to the side with a finger nail, dull knife, or credit card. , Since AHB swarm and sting so aggressively, you may not be aware of how many times you were stung. If you begin to feel ill, or know you were stung more than 15 times, seek help immediately.


Other signs of when to seek help: itching, trouble breathing, dizziness, vomiting, and the swelling of your face, tongue or throat. These are all life threatening and you should not wait to see if the symptoms subside before getting help. , If you were only stung a few times and do not require emergency medical care, you can help alleviate the symptoms of the venom. Take an antihistamine immediately and apply hydrocortisone cream to the sting to help reduce swelling and itching.


Use a cool, moist towel or ice to help alleviate sting site symptoms. Do not apply ice directly to the sting and do not use heat.

Determine if the bees need to be removed.,
Call your local bee removal service.,
Make sure the hive is removed completely.,
Prevent future infestations.",How to Get Rid of Killer Bees1," Most beehives do not house ""Africanized honey bees"" and therefore will not be a danger. Bees come in many types and are vital to the food and flora production of the world. If you don’t discover a hive or nest in an area that you frequent, and no one in your home is allergic, they likely don't need to be killed.Africanized honey bees are slightly smaller than their European counterparts. They can be distinguished by their golden-brown color, thin coating of fur on their bodies and bulbous, striped tail sections.Despite the uniformity of their appearance, it usually requires an expert eye to tell the difference between a normal honey bee and a dangerous killer bee.;
, If you can't find a bee removal company in the phone book, try contacting your local county extension agent or fire department. They will be able to refer you to bee removal services in your area, including commercial businesses and your city's animal control department. You may also have a city, county, or state beekeeper association—many beekeepers will remove the hive without charge.Professional bee removal services may be costly, but are the safest way to get rid of an infestation.
Not all commercial pest control services may be equipped to deal with killer bee infestations. Call the company and ask if this is within their capability.

, Work with the bee removal experts to inspect the rest of your property for signs of infestation. If any part of the hive is left behind, it will be a signal to other bees that your home is a good place to build. A good bee removal expert will dispose of the hive first, then kill or capture the remaining bees.While bees can be killed with sprays and other remote means, the hive usually has to be removed manually.

, Pick up any stray buckets, boxes or other containers lying around your property that bees might build a nest in. Most bees prefer to live in cool, dark spaces, so pay particular attention to your garage, basement, work shed, garbage bins and any covered areas around your home. Fill large gaps in brick or concrete walls to keep bees from nesting there.Keep an eye out for where bees are coming from and returning to. By tracking their movements, you can often locate their nest.

Place the cover between the bee and the surface it landed on.After choosing your cover, slip it slowly between the lip of the bowl or glass you trapped the bee under and the wall or hard surface on which the bee was sitting.,
Take the bee outside.",How to Get a Bee out of the House1," A plastic cup or bowl is also preferable, since its lower mass will reduce the risk of damaging your wall or window during the trapping process. You can use any regular cup or bowl you might have around your house. While a bowl allows for a wider margin of error when trapping the bee, the cup is easier to keep covered and move out once the bee has been trapped.;
, Do not wear shorts or T-shirts when trapping a bee in a container.

, When you’re within six to twelve inches of the bee, rapidly bring the container over the bee, trapping it within.


Do not attempt to trap a bee which is on the carpet. The chances it will escape are too great.

, When trapping bees with a bowl, you could use a folded newspaper, a full sheet of thick paper, or a manila envelope. When trapping bees within a cup, you could use a notecard or magazine.


Think about the radius of your cup or bowl’s open end and choose a cover which corresponds appropriately. Whatever you choose, it should be relatively thin.

, Starting at one edge of the container, ease it up by about one or two millimeters. Slip your magazine or notecard beneath the container and continue to push it across the surface the bee was sitting on.


The bee will likely be surprised and fly about after having the container placed over it; this will make the process of easing the cover over your container that much easier.

, With the cover safely over the container you've captured the bee in, move to an open door. Take the bee about ten paces from your home and remove the paper holding the bee in the cup or bowl you've trapped it in. Place the mouth of the cup or bowl on the ground, then slide the cover off. Ensure that it flies or crawls out and run quickly back to your home, closing the door firmly behind you before the bee can find its way back in.Don't take the bee too far away. Its hive is likely nearby and without access to it, it will surely die.

Learn about ground digger wasps.,
Know the signs of ground digger wasps infesting your lawn or garden space.,
Find out the local life cycle.,
It's important to understand that they only sting when attacked.,
While the method suggested here basically kills the wasps in their nests, there is no other (safe- for-nearby-pets) way to eradicate them.,
Get the supplies.,
During the day, when the wasps are up hunting for cicadas in the trees, mark each nest you find with one of the plastic knives pushed into the ground as close to the hole of the nest as possible (without disturbing the hole).,
After 10:30 or 11pm, (later is better), that evening, using a flashlight, seek out the knives you placed and carefully pour about two-to-three cups of ammonia into each of the holes.,
The next day, repeat the process on any new nests that you find in the ground.,
Try this option if you're happy to let nature's creatures follow their natural cycles without freaking.",How to Get Rid of Ground Digger Wasps (Cicada Killers) from Your Lawn," Ground-digger wasps (GDWs) are very large (slightly larger than a green hornet) passive-aggressive wasps that ""build"" their nests in dry, unfertilized earth. They are typically large and black-bodied with yellow stripes on their back-end. When fully grown, they measure about one and a half inches (or more) in length with about a one and a quarter-inch wide wingspan.;
, You'll know you've got ground-digger wasp nests when you see small granular mounds of dirt piled up anywhere from two-to-five inches in height. At the base of the mound of granular dirt will be a finger-sized hole with a ""path"" of dirt leading out from it.


The nests will be sporadically built throughout your lawn or garden, but will typically be in the driest areas and/or under longer grass/weeds or under growing flowers. GDWs do not like, but can live in, moist soil.

, In the Northeast US, the life-cycle of a ground-digger wasp is about one month beginning in mid-July and ending around mid-to-late August (depending on where you live, their life-cycle may start earlier or later). They go from young adults buzzing about play-attacking with each other, to full-size adults in about two-to-three weeks.

, While very menacing looking, they are passive stingers, meaning only if very threatened will they attack and sting. You'd practically have to start digging into their nests while they're flying about for one to come at you and sting you (so, don't do that!). Otherwise, they tend to buzz about to check you out and to scare you away and they probably will the first time you encounter them. Know that they'd rather get on with their business of killing cicadas up in the trees than sting you.

, It is probable that you will still get nests from year-to-year, but only one, maybe two. The trick is to kill all of them while they're in their nests so their babies will not come back to the same place they were born.

, To eradicate an infestation of ground-digger wasps (GDWs), purchase from your local party store and supermarket, the following items: a) a large bag of white plastic knives, and b) up to three or four jug gallons of regular or lemon ammonia.

, Leave enough of the knife sticking out of the ground so you can see it.

, At this time the wasps are probably nesting/sleeping, so you'll be catching them while in the nest. (You can stretch out the amount of ammonia by mixing a one-to-one ratio of water to ammonia. The diluted strength will still be enough to kill them.) Do not remove the knives.

, You'll know the new nests from the old ones because you'll still have the knives in place from the night before. Once you've identified the new nests, remove the old knives.You may have to continually repeat the process depending on the original amount of wasps. Or you could hit the wasps with tennis rackets, knocking them to the ground then step on them.

, First, this is a natural cycle and is part of nature's own way of dealing with a ballooning population of cicadas. Second, you can watch these interesting animals do their thing from the comfort of your own yard; they're raising their families just as every other natural creature tries to do. The way to cope if you leave them alone is very simple:


Do not aggravate them. Do not push or poke them, do not walk on them and do not attack them with anything.
Ignore them for two months. Just let them be as they dig up cicadas to feed their children. After two months, they'll be off.
Don't wander around with bare feet at night. Be sensible about walking in your garden; no yard is completely safe from prickles, stings and unpleasant things, so wear appropriate protection and practice sensible use of your yard.

Seal cracks in your home.,
Cover your garbage cans tightly.,
Don’t leave out sweet-smelling stuff.,
Clean up after picnics right away.",How to Keep Wasps Away1," This can prevent wasps that have nests near your home from actually getting in. Look for cracks near the edges of your siding, where power lines enter your house, or holes in window screens. Then use an appropriate sealant – usually caulk for cracks near the siding or where power lines enter and patches for screens – to seal the holes.If you find a wasps nest in one of the cracks or holes you’re sealing, don’t just seal it in. Some wasps can actually chew through dry wall and get into your house that way! Instead, call a professional pest exterminator to take care of it for you.;
, Wasps tend to show up in yards with a lot of food waste, and if your garbage cans are not closed tightly, wasps might be attracted. Make sure the lid is closed as tightly as possible, and don’t ever leave the lid off your cans., This includes the type of nectar found in some bird feeders. Wasps are attracted to sweet-smelling stuff, so having a lot in your yard increases your chances of having wasps., This can also keep wasps away since they’re attracted to food waste. Throw away trash and seal up containers that still have food in them."
"
Gather the materials for your fake nest.,
Fill your plastic bag with shredded paper.,
Hang your nest.,
Leave the wasp with the window open.",How to Get Rid of Wasps in Your House2," Wasps are very territorial creatures, and they won’t build a nest if they think there is another colony living nearby. Plus, they will leave if they think that another colony has moved into their neighborhood.If the colony moves further from your home, the wasps in your house will go with it.


Plastic bag
Paper bag
Shredded paper
Twine

, This is going to be the innards of your nest. Your plastic bag should be packed tightly with shredded paper because it is the main form of your nest.The plastic bag will help it withstand the elements.Crumple your paper bag. This will give it somewhat of a “nest” look. Once you’ve crumpled it, open it back up and put your filled plastic bag inside.

, Use your twine to hang it near the existing nest. It needs to be close enough that the existing wasps will notice it.

, Close the door to the room that has wasps in it. Leave the window open so that the wasp can get out. They will leave and travel with their colony.

"
"
Be careful.,
Find the things you need.,
Make your solution.,
Spray it on the wasps in your home as they come along.",How to Get Rid of Wasps in Your House3," This requires you to get closer to the wasps than the others, so it’s recommended against if you’re allergic to wasps.

, Rather than normal insecticides which are potentially dangerous for your family, this requires no harmful ingredients. For this method, you will only need an empty spray bottle, water, witch hazel, and peppermint essential oil., Fill it almost to the top with half distilled water and half witch hazel. Add 30-50 drops of peppermint essential oil.

, The peppermint oil will stick to the wasps, making it difficult for them to fly and will lead to their hasty demise."
"
Put food away.,
Seal entry points.,
Avoid swatting.",How to Get Rid of Wasps in Your House4," Like many pests, wasps are attracted to food—especially foods that are high in sugar and meat products. This includes pet food. Make sure that your trash cans are sealed tight, bird feeders are far from the house, and food isn’t left out., Check your house for unsealed vents, torn screens, cracks around windows and door frames, or open dampers. Seal off these problem areas and the wasps no longer have entry ways into your home.

, Swatting wasps is actually counterproductive. When a wasp is squashed, a pheromone is released which attracts nearby wasps. Rather, walk away from any hovering wasps."
"
Make good use of available pesticides.,
Spray the burrows with petrol.,
Spray the bees or their burrows with aerosol carburetor cleaner.,
Make a lot of noise.,
Lay the swat down.,
Get an exterminator.",How to Get Rid of Carpenter Bees1," Powders are the most effective pesticide for active Carpenter bee nests. Products such as Carbaryl dust (Sevin) and boric acid (Borid Turbo Aerosol) are effective.;
, A tried and tested remedy for bees is spraying petrol or diesel into their burrows. It's a homemade pesticide, if you will. It will kill them, but petrol is flammable and can damage the structure you pour it over, so use it carefully.


Take caution not to get petrol on your skin or inhale its fumes. Wear an N-95 respirator, some goggles, and gloves when applying petrol to the burrow.
If using a spray bottle to spread petrol, be sure to label it and set it aside for petrol-only use in the future. You probably don't want to use the spray bottle to spritz your plants with water after using it to gas carpenter bees.

, While it's not the most gentle product to use for carpenter bee extermination, it's certainly effective. Aerosol carburetor cleaner has an extension tube for the can, and can be had cheaply from a discount or auto supply store. Some types will kill them instantly inside their burrow; others will make their prospective home very uninhabitable.


Be very careful to not get this in your face or eyes; wear protection and read the precautions for safety.

, Carpenter bees are notoriously sensitive to noise, which may in fact be a sensitivity to vibrations. Set up a soundbox or boombox next to their prospective dwellings to encourage them to leave. This method is both safe and no-hassle.

, In spring, carpenter bees fly around looking for burrows to lay eggs and deposit pollen as food for the larvae. (They use old burrows too, therefore it is a good idea to plug them.) This means they are very active for two to three weeks. A badminton or tennis racket is very effective to smack them with, especially easy with their habit of stopping and hovering for a moment.


Make sure to give them a good brisk smack! Stepping on them, (with shoes of course), is an obvious extra option after you smack them.

, Professional exterminators know what they are doing, and can rid you of the bees efficiently.

Make sure you’re completely covered.,
Mix up a solution of soap and water.,
Apply the solution to the bees and nest.,
Remove the comb.,
Call an expert to come remove the comb.",How to Get Rid of Killer Bees2," If you decide to tackle your bee problem on your own, you’ll need to cover all exposed parts of your body to protect yourself from stings. Layer thick, long-sleeved clothing with work boots, gloves and eye and face protection to minimize your risk of being stung. Getting stung multiple times can prove fatal, so don’t put yourself at unnecessary risk.Killer bee venom is no stronger than that of common varieties of honey bee, but they tend to swarm in overwhelming numbers and are much more easily provoked.Avoid wearing strong fragrances or causing a commotion when preparing to raid a killer bee nest. Unusual stimuli may draw their attention and incite them to swarm.

, Combine one part liquid dish soap with four parts water and mix thoroughly. Fill a plastic spray bottle with the soap solution. Adding soap will cause a higher concentration of water to stick to the bees and infiltrate their orifices, effectively drowning them.Natural pesticide mixtures like soap and water provide a welcome alternative to using chemical agents that can harm other species and damage the environment.

, Spray the soapy solution liberally onto whatever bees you come across. The soap and water solution may take longer than a chemical pesticide to show signs that it’s working, but its effects should be similar. After you’ve found the nest, flood any openings in its surface with soapy water to drown out bees hiding within.


Using a liquid spraying system in place of a spray bottle might make it easier to reach nests that are built deep inside narrow openings.

, If you’ve managed to locate the nest, the nexus of your bee problem, you’re going to want to remove and destroy the comb. Most Africanized honey bees make their nests in ordinary enclosed spaces, but construct fibrous networks inside known as ""combs,"" where they live, reproduce and manufacture honey. Once most of the bees around the nest have been dealt with, the comb itself can be thrown away, crushed or burnt.When handling a hive or comb, watch out for any bees that might remain inside.
Thoroughly rinse the area where the nest was found with a garden hose after it’s been disposed of to eliminate scents that might attract other bees.

, Even if you can’t afford to retain the services of a professional bee remover, or if the bees pose an immediate threat and time is of the essence, you might still be able to have the nest comb removed without cost after you’ve dealt with the worst of the infestation. Many beekeeping groups and some animal control services will dispatch people to collect hives and combs, for study or disposal. See if this option is available before attempting to remove a killer bee nest yourself."
"
Protect yourself.,
Purchase a can of insecticide.,
Spray the bees around the nest.,
Eliminate the comb.",How to Get Rid of Killer Bees3," Once again, take care to cover your extremities when removing a bee threat manually. You’ll need to get quite close to the bees to dispatch them with pesticide spray. The fewer openings you leave for stings, the less danger you’ll be putting yourself in.

, Run to the store and grab a can (or two) of a high-strength insecticide like Raid. Environmental experts recommend against using spray insecticides because of their effects on the environment, but if you need to kill a bunch of bees in a hurry, they will do the trick. Insecticides work on airborne pests like nerve agents, paralyzing the cells of the insect’s body and shutting down the nervous system.Insecticides contain highly toxic chemicals. Always use them in a well-ventilated area when possible and keep your nose and mouth covered to prevent breathing in the spray yourself.
Insect sprays will be less effective at killing bees in open spaces where the chemicals quickly dissipate.

, Approach cautiously and spray a small amount of insecticide directly onto the thickest cluster of bees. The poison in the insecticide should take effect almost immediately. The bees will slow down and their movement will become clumsy and erratic. Continue spraying in short bursts until you’ve eliminated all the bees around the nest.Don’t be too heavy-handed with the insecticide spray. Use enough to neutralize swarming bees, but remember that the more poison you release, the more you’ll have lingering in the air and on surfaces around your home.
If the bees become agitated and begin to swarm, make a break for it and try again at a later time or call a bee removal service. Better safe than sorry.

, It’s likely that you won’t be able to neutralize every last bee with a household insecticide spray. As long as the comb of the nest remains intact, bees may return and rebuild. Remove the hive or comb and break it apart or burn it.Use a pressure washer to take down a hanging beehive from a safe distance or flood hard-to-reach crevices.
With the nest destroyed, surviving bees will move on and look for another place to build.

Open the windows of your house.,
Open the doors of your home.,
Wait several minutes for the bee to leave.",How to Get a Bee out of the House2," If your windows have screens of storm windows on them, open them as well. If you have to remove the screens, place them somewhere close by the window so they do not get misplaced or mismatched to a different window later. Raise the curtains or blinds so the bee can exit.


If the sun has set and you have a light directly outside the window, you can turn it on and turn off the lights of the room the bee is in. When the bee leaves to hover by the light outside, close the window behind it., If you have an additional screen door which has a spring-loaded latch on it which causes it to close automatically, use the small locking latch near the hinge of the spring mechanism to hold your door open. If you have a security door, you can leave it closed, assuming there is no screen on it. If there is a screen on it, open it as well.


If you have sliding glass doors, remove any curtains concealing them so the bee can see the world outside. When you notice it bump up against the door, carefully open it to let the bee out., With the doors and windows open, the bee will seek a way to return to its hive and explore nearby flowers. While waiting for the bee to make its exit, keep and eye on your doors and windows to ensure birds and other wildlife do not enter. Close your windows and doors as soon as the bee leaves.

Mix some water and sugar.Bees are attracted to sweet flavors like the nectar they obtain from flowers.,
Place a half cup of the sweet mixture in a jar.You can use any size jar, but make sure it has a lid.,
Punch a hole in the lid of the jar.,
Take the jar out of your house when the bee enters.Wait for the bee to enter the jar.,
Set the live bee free.",How to Get a Bee out of the House3," By mixing up some sugar water, you can approximate a nectar-like flavor. Mix about one teaspoon of sugar with three teaspoons of water. You can mix the water and sugar in a blender or mix it by hand in a small cup. You should not need more than a cup of this mixture.


Your bee might like filtered water more than tap water. Try a different quality of water if your bee is not attracted to the first sugar/water mix you concoct.

, Your jar can be of glass or plastic, but the lid must be plastic. Old peanut butter, jam, or pasta sauce jars make good choices. Seal the jar by placing the lid on it.

, The hole should be about the size of the diameter of your pinky finger.It is important to keep the hole small to ensure the bee can crawl in but not out of the jar.

, When the bee enters the jar, it might drown in the sweet mixture. If it drowns, remove the jar from the house, take the lid off, and dump the bee and the sweet mixture into an open, grassy area at least ten paces from your house. Return to your home and wash the container.

, If the bee is alive within the jar, take it from your home and cover the hole on the lid with your thumb or a piece of duct tape. Walk at least ten paces from your home and unscrew the lid. Unscrew the lid, but hold it partially over the opening of the jar. Carefully dump the sugar water out, ensuring the bee doesn’t get coated with the water. When you’ve dumped most of the water out, turn the jar away from you and open the lid completely. When the bee flies out, run back to your home and close the door behind you.

Mix clove, geranium, and lemongrass essential oils.,
Grow wasp-repellent plants.,
Use wasp decoys.",How to Keep Wasps Away2," You should add several drops of each type of oil to a spray bottle filled with water and a few squirts of dish soap. Shake the bottle to stir the elements together. Then spray the areas of your house that seem to attract wasps, including under eaves and on porch roofs.Don’t spray the whole area, as this would require more than one spray bottle of solution and can be very expensive. Focus on spraying where there have been other nests on your home.
You can also buy wasp repellent in home improvement stores if you’d prefer not to mix your own.

, There are some plants that keep wasps away because they don't like the smell. Planting a few of them near where you spend a lot of time - the front porch or your backyard - can help keep wasps away. Mint, thyme, eucalyptus, and citronella will all repel wasps, and they'll also make your yards smell great!, Since wasps are territorial, they won’t build a nest within 20 feet or so of another nest. Hang one decoy on each side of your house to keep wasps away from the whole house."
"
Mix a soap and water solution.,
Use a wasp trap.,
Call a pest control expert.",How to Keep Wasps Away3," Pour two tablespoons (1 oz) of dish soap into a spray bottle of water. Shake the bottle to mix the solution up – it should get a little frothy. Stand as far away from the existing nest as possible and soak the nest with the spray., You can make one on your own by cutting the top off a two-liter pop bottle. Spray the inside of the bottle with a bit of sugar water, and replace the top of the pop bottle by turning it upside down in the bottom of the bottle. Tape the two pieces together and leave it out in your yard. You can also buy wasp traps in the store., This is especially important if you’re allergic to wasp stings. In that case, or if you’ve discovered a big nest, it’s best to call a pest control expert to take care of the nest for you.

Make a baking soda and sugar solution.,
Make traps with petroleum jelly.,
Try essential oils.,
Mix a clove oil insecticide.,
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around your home.,
Make a roach spray.",How to Kill Cockroaches or Ants Without Pesticide1," This natural roach and ant killer is safe to place in your home and can kill these pests. The flour will attract them, and the boric acid will kill them. Wear gloves when mixing this solution. Mix one cup (120 g) of boric acid with one cup (120 g) of flour. Add enough water to make it into a liquid.Pour the solution in small containers, like bowls or jar lids. Place them around your home in places where ants and roaches will likely be, like under the refrigerator and in the back of kitchen cabinets. You can also place them around outside.
You can also soak cotton balls in the solution and set them out instead.Boric acid is toxic, so keep it away from pets and children.;
, Another natural way to kill roaches and ants is to mix borax with powdered sugar. This method works in a similar way to boric acid and flour. Combine two parts borax with one part powdered sugar. Add two to three drops of peppermint essential oil to the recipe.Sprinkle the mixture around the places where you have roaches or ants.
You can also add water to the solution to make it liquid. Soak a cotton ball in the solution and set out around your home., Take an old, clean plastic container and cut a small hole near the rim. Cut multiple holes if the trap is going to be inside, but only cut one if it is going to be outside. In a bowl, mix one cup (120 g) of borax with 1 cup (120 g) of sugar. Add water, honey, or bacon grease to make the mixture moist.


Shape the mixture into balls and place them on the lid of the plastic container. Snap the bowl into place upside down. Set the trap anywhere ants or roaches will find it.

, Another way to kill roaches and ants without pesticide is to use baking soda and sugar. The sugar will attract the bugs, and the baking soda will kill them. Mix one part sugar with one part baking soda. Place the mixture in small bowls or lids. Set the solution out where roaches or ants are likely to find them. You can place a source of water next to this solution since drinking water will cause the baking soda to work faster.Place the mixture under your refrigerator, in cabinets, or near entrances.

, You can make homemade and nontoxic roach and ant traps with petroleum jelly. Place the jelly in a small bowl. Add sugar or flour to the jelly to attract the roaches and ants. Place these bowls wherever the bugs will have access to them.With this method, you will have to go and empty the traps periodically and lay down new petroleum jelly.

, Some essential oils can deter ants from your home. Just choose one of these essential oils, place a few drops on a cotton ball, and wipe down any places where ants can get into your home. Try multiple essential oils if you want to make sure that the ants leave you alone.Try peppermint, tea tree, clove, lemon, or orange oil.

, Clove oil works to kill both ants and roaches. It is a very strong essential oil, so mix it with other substances. Mix ¼ cup (59 mL) with ¼ cup (59 mL) of vodka. Add 15 drops of peppermint essential oil, 15 drops of tea tree oil, and one to three drops of clove oil. Place the mixture into a spray bottle.Spray the oil anywhere that you see ants or roaches. Spray around entrances to your home.
Replace the tea tree oil with 15 drops of peppermint oil if you are going to spray on surfaces where you eat.

, Some people don’t like to use boric acid because it can be toxic to people. Diatomaceous earth is not toxic if ingested. To use DE, sprinkle a thin layer of it around the entryways of your home and anywhere you think ants and roaches will be., Combine one part water with one part rubbing alcohol, one part olive oil, or one part distilled white vinegar. Place it in a spray bottle. Each time you see a roach, spray them with your solution. This will coat their shell, and suffocate and kill them."

Stuff their hole with steel-wool.,
Stain or paint any outdoor wooden surfaces to discourage bee infestation.,
Spray affected areas with a natural non-synthetic citrus and/or tea tree oil spray.,
Stop the cycle of reproduction.,
Seal off burrows or galleries that have been vacated.",How to Get Rid of Carpenter Bees2," Carpenter bees can't dig through steel wool, making it a perfect jail cell. After they have left that nest, use some wood putty or caulk to patch the spot. Match the putty or caulk to your wood or plan on painting.

, Although carpenter bees tend to attack all wood surfaces, they don't do so indiscriminately: Exterminators believe they prefer untreated wood.That means it's high time to apply that stain or paint that deck that you've been meaning to but haven't gotten around to.

, Try to find a citrus-based spray specifically designed for carpenter bees, or be industrious and make one yourself. Cut up the rinds of several different citrus fruits (orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit) and boil them in a shallow pot filled with water. Fill a spray bottle with the citrus-extract water, and fill spray bottle with the juice of citrus fruit.


Spray the burrows of the carpenter bees with citrus-extract water. Carpenter bees, like other insects, have a natural aversion to citrus oil (which is why the skin and rind protect the fruit on the inside — to keep it away from predators).
Almond oil and almond essence is another tried and true option that repels carpenter bees., It's not enough to merely kill the adult bees or the reproducing females; you need to kill the bee larvae in their nests in order to keep them from reproducing and starting the whole menacing cycle over again. Here's what to do to try to kill the carpenter bee larvae:


Apply a dust insecticide in each nesting gallery. Using a dust insecticide is important, as other insecticides can become absorbed into the wood or wear off before the larvae is hatched.Be sure not to seal up the gallery hole when applying the insecticide dust. This forces the carpenter bees to burrow new holes, meaning there's a chance they don't pass through the insecticide.

, As soon as the young carpenter bees leave their nest, it's time to seal everything up again, preferably with something stronger than wood (which the bees will burrow into again). Seal off with steel wool, aluminum, asphalt, or fiberglass and cover with wood filler. Paint or stain the surface to discourage further burrowing.

Cover openings into your home with cream of tartar.,
Place natural repellants near all entrances.,
Plant mint around your home.",How to Kill Cockroaches or Ants Without Pesticide2," Ants enter your home through cracks when they are searching for food. To keep them out of your home, place cream of tartar across any cracks where they can get inside. This will repel them and keep them out of your home., Ants are repelled by many natural household items. Place these items near any entrances to your home to repel ants and keep them from invading your home. Try coffee grounds, garlic cinnamon, chili peppers, paprika, peppermint, or cloves.Lemons can also repel ants. Squeeze the juice along the entrance and place the peeling on each side of the entrance.

, Ants do not like mint, so having mint around your home will help deter ants from entering. Plus, surrounding your home with mint will make it smell nice. Plant mint plants along your house’s foundation to repel ants.You can also put mint plants in pots near entrances to your home.

Set out other natural repellants.",How to Kill Cockroaches or Ants Without Pesticide3," Catnip has been known to repel cockroaches. Place catnip in small bags or sachets and scatter them through your home. Make sure to place sachets up high, like on shelves, in high cabinets, and on high surfaces. Cockroaches congregate in high places., Place catnip in a small amount of water and let it simmer. Then, place this liquid in a spray bottle. Spray this catnip solution on baseboards, in cabinets, under sinks and refrigerators, and anywhere else you have seen roaches.Don’t use this spray if you have cats.

, There are a few substances cockroaches don’t like that help repel them. Bay leaves, cucumbers, and garlic have been found to help deter cockroaches from infesting a home. Place these items around your home to get rid of the cockroaches.Bay leaves and garlic won’t spoil easily, but cucumbers will. Make sure to place cucumbers in a place where you can remember and easily change them.

Beware of ""feral bees."",
Protect the ""good"" bees from the ""bad."",
Don't put this job in the hands of an amateur, whether that's you or an untrained ""professional""!",How to Approach a Bee Infestation1," Careful observation is more likely to make sense of what is happening.;
, When bees swarm, it's so their colony can spread out into new areas. This means they minimize the risk that a single disaster will wipe out their gene pool at one location, and they increase their chances of survival. Nature benefits because this also increases the number of bees for pollination. There are also other reasons, but this is the main one.

, Bees not under human management, so called “feral bees”, cross breed and benefit from more defensive characteristics rather than increased productivity, therefore they tend to become more dangerous. Their poison is often more severe, and they more easily get angry. When they are difficult to handle, they can’t be checked for disease, and they can carry parasites that spread to healthy hives.

, It's really important that we protect the managed bees that we rely on for pollination and honey from bees that can easily bring serious problems, such as parasites or disease. It often means that feral bees need to be removed by someone with proper knowledge to do this safely. If he can't safely check them for disease, its better that they are put down. He may need a licence to use chemicals safely, to do this job. The best chemicals for the job are virtually non toxic to humans, anyway.

, Safe and careful intervention is essential for bee eradication that both prevents infestation and protects healthy bee populations. Further information follows.

Consider how they are controlling the air flow in the space they have chosen, maybe if this was increased, the space would be less appealing? Sealing up their entrance certainly won't.

, When bees locate themselves in a wall cavity, it's because they can control the updraft of the air in there. This helps them keep their brood at an even temperature, by speeding it up or slowing it down. In the right wall, they can sometimes really thrive!


They will usually choose a brick veneer wall on the warm side of a building, because it heats up and cools down differently to how a much denser wall would. The bees calculate this thermal lag, and can take action to benefit their brood. If the sun is concealed by a cloud, they will know that the wall might cool down in a particular time ""lag"", and they can prepare to increase the temperature around their brood.
You can make the cavity less appealing by opening the bottom and the top of the wall so more air rushes through and they can’t control the air flow. This is a non-chemical solution.

, If the bees have been established for some time, they will be reluctant to leave their brood. The pollen and honey they have stored to feed the brood, will attract cockroaches and in Australia, an insect called “Small Hive Beetle” (SHB, or sp. Athena Tumida). Quite often, the SHB will cause the honeycomb to break down into a vile, putrid slime, so its wise to eliminate the bees before SHB gets established.

, This should be done by blowing a professional Permethrin-based powder into the cavity so well that it dusts all surfaces. This chemical is low toxicity and safe for humans. The bees will then find the cavity repellent, and not nest there.


The job should be done by someone with equipment to blow the powder in at high pressure so it circulates thoroughly. This can be done from a safe distance with a long pipe thin enough to fit into the hole that the bees use as an entrance.
Eventually, about three months later when the powder has lost some of its power, a small moth (sp.galleria Mellonella, or Wax Moth) will get in and eat up the remaining wax, leaving the cavity empty as it used to be, without significantly damaging the building. Wax moths are everywhere. The powder will also kill the cockroaches.

, As mentioned, safe and sensible bee eradication requires professional help. You might find such a person by consulting your local Council, Wildlife Rescue Service or Department of Agriculture.

"
Do not use liquids, aerosol sprays, or other chemical types which may create new problems.,
Do not block up the holes that the bees used for access.,
Don't worry about ""saving the bees."",
Don't take risks or skimp on bee removal.",How to Approach a Bee Infestation3," Aerosols will kill some bees, but cause the rest to be confused and spread out in the wall so the problem becomes more extensive.

, If new bees come around, they need to be able to determine that the cavity is repellent, so they give up and go away. If they can't get in to where the powder is, they become more determined and will enter the wall further away, and walk along leaving the scent marker as they go. A new colony might set up just outside the range of the powder.


Also, the wall still needs to be able to ventilate itself so it doesn’t become musty. So many houses are damaged with materials such as foaming resin and silicone that have been used to block bees. This almost always encourages bees to try again.

, Many people blindly assert that feral bees should be “saved."" This is not a very sensible idea. After all, bees only live about 8 weeks,and all their characteristics are fixed at birth. It takes that long for the colony to be rehabilitated with a new queen to produce more useful brood because the old bees have to die off first. It's far better to accept that to control the spread of disease, some bees have to be eliminated to protect the healthy colonies under good management.


One of these well managed colonies can easily be divided and made productive in only a week or so to make up for the loss of a bunch of ferals. It’s the same as having problems with cattle that have serious illness; you just don’t go and put them in with the healthy cows.

, Our lives depend on food crops pollinated by healthy bees. It is much better to call on an experienced person who knows what he or she is doing with bees. Accept that if there is expertise and or chemicals involved, they will need to be paid fairly, as you would pay any professional.

Gather your supplies.,
Pour the sugar and borax into the jar.,
Close the jar and shake it.,
Open the jar and add the water.,
Mix everything with a spoon, fork, or stick.,
Soak cotton balls in the solution.,
Start setting out the soaked cotton balls.,
Consider blocking the ant nest.",How to Kill Ants Using Borax1," You will be making a liquid solution using borax, sugar, and water, and then soaking cotton balls into this solution. Here is what you will need:


½ cup (100 grams) of sugar
1 ½ tablespoons borax
1 ½ cups (350 milliliters) warm water
A jar
Cotton balls
Shallow dishes, small containers, or lids (optional);
, The borax is what will kill the ants, and the sugar is what will attract them to the borax. Ants don't see borax as a food source, so they won't come near it—the sugar will be an effective bait.

, You are doing this to mix the borax and sugar together.

, You can use any temperature water, but warm water will help the sugar and borax dissolve better. The water will turn the borax and sugar into a liquid solution, which will make it easier for you to dip the cotton balls into.

, Keep stirring until all of the sugar and borax are dissolved—or at least most of it.

, How many cotton balls you use will depend on how bad the ant infestation is. If you have any of the solution left over, you can save it simply by putting the lid back on the jar and storing it in a cool, dry place.

, Focus on the ant trails; you want to place the cotton ball right onto the trail itself. If you can find where the ants are coming from, you can set the soaked cotton balls near there. This will help them find the poison even sooner.


If you don't want to get your floors or window ledges dirty and sticky, you can place the soaked cotton ball in a small container first, and then set the container out. You can also use a shallow dish or a jar lid. Whatever container you chose to use, make sure that you don't use it for food purposes again. Borax is very toxic to humans and pets as well.

, If you have located the hole where the ants are coming from, you can seal it with some epoxy putty or sealing paste. This will prevent the ants from coming back. Do this after you have killed all of the ants, and not before."

Buy commercial ant bait.,
Place the bait traps in the affected areas.,
Wait a few days for the traps to work.,
Try spraying with a pesticide.",How to Kill Black Ants1," Using a commercial bait is a very effective way to kill black ants. Ants are attracted to the bait, which is a mixture of poison and a sweet substance. The ants eat some bait and bring some back to the nest, where the rest of the colony is also exposed to the poison. Over the course of one or two life cycles, the ants will be destroyed.


If you decide to use bait, be sure you take the precaution of making sure that there are no children or pets in the area.
Commercial ant bait is available in hardware stores for about $4 per box.;
, Follow the instructions on the packaging to get the bait traps ready, then place them on your countertops, in corners and in any other areas where you frequently see ants gather. If possible, place a trap in front of an ant trail.


Different types of bait traps require different preparation. Some traps require you to place a few drops of bait on pieces of cardboard, then place the cardboard around your house. Other traps simply require peeling back a plastic wrapper and setting out the traps.

, Bait traps take a little longer to work than spraying and other methods of killing ants, but they are ultimately much more effective. Over the course of a few days, the ants will carry the bait back to their nest and poison the rest of the colony. In the meantime, make sure your house is clean of other food sources so that the ants eat the bait, not crumbs or sticky spots in your kitchen.

, If you want to make doubly sure the ants are gone for good, you can spray a pesticide as well. Purchase a store formula, mix up the contents based on the instructions, place the solution in a sprayer and spray the infested rooms. You may also apply the solution to the perimeter of your home to keep ants from coming inside.


Make sure that children and pets stay away from the sprayed areas, since they can become ill if they ingest the chemicals.
You can also purchase an aerosol spray to apply directly on the black ants. These are usually indoor formulas that work well in areas like your kitchen. Apply the spray anywhere you see ants, and any cracks and/or crevices that you see them crawl into.
This method usually leads to immediate death so sweep up any dead ants and dispose of them properly. If you spray in an area that children or pets may be in, be sure to adequately wipe down and clean the area so no one gets sick from the spray.

Gather your ingredients.,
Mix three parts sugar and one part borax.,
Sprinkle the powder across the ant trail.,
Sprinkle the powder across potential entry ways.,
Consider blocking the ant nest.,
Store any unused ant killer properly.",How to Kill Ants Using Borax2," You will need two simple ingredients: borax and sugar. Adult ants won't eat the solid poison, but they will take it back to the colony for the larva to eat., Pour the borax and sugar into a container and stir it with a spoon or fork until everything is combined. How much borax and sugar you use will depend on how bad your ant problem is. Be sure that you use the one part borax and three parts sugar ratio.


Make sure that you won't be using the container or utensil again for cooking or eating.

, If the ants are entering your house through the windows and doors, sprinkle the powder across the doorway and on the window ledge. The ants will pick up the powder and carry it back to the hive for the larva to eat. The borax in the powder will kill the larva.

, While you are trying to manage the ant problem, it might be a good idea to block off any other potential entry ways, such as doors and windows. This will prevent the ants from finding other ways into your home while you are trying to kill them.

, If you can see where the ants are coming from, then you can plug the hole up with some epoxy putty or other sealant. This will prevent the ants from coming back in. Do this after you have killed all of the ants, and not before.

, If you have anything left over, put it in a tightly-sealed container and label it. Make sure that you put it in a place where children and pets won't be able to reach. Borax is very toxic, even to humans and animals.

Use diatomaceous earth.,
Use baking soda to clean carpets.,
Try an essential oil spray.,
Use boric acid.,
Try cinnamon powder.",How to Kill Black Ants2," This substance is completely natural and safe for use around humans and pets, but it kills ants and other crawling critters. It's composed of ground up fossil pieces that cut into insects' exoskeletons when they walk over it. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth in corners, under the sink, in windowsills, and anywhere else you often see ants.


Every week or two, vacuum up the diatomaceous earth and replace it with fresh powder.
This substance doesn't work as well in humid areas, since it loses its sharpness when it becomes wet.

, If you have a lot of black ants on your carpeting, cover it in a fine layer of baking soda, let it sit for a few hours, then vacuum it up. You can also apply cornstarch to a surface and vacuum it up immediately before you try to vacuum up the black ants. The added cornstarch in the vacuum will suffocate the animal.

, Certain natural sprays act as insect repellents. You can easily make your own by adding 10 drops of essential oil to a cup of water, then pouring it into a spray bottle. Spray the mixture all over your house to keep ants away. Here are a few essential oils to try:


Eucalyptus oil (don't use this one if you have a cat)
Tea tree oil
Lavender
Peppermint
Lemon
Windex

, You might already have a box in your laundry room. This household substance doubles as a very effective insecticide. Simply sprinkle boric acid in corner and around room perimeters. Ants and other critters will die after crawling over the powder., If you don't have any other repellent on hand, try sprinkling some cinnamon in the room where the ants are gathering. Ants are repelled by the fine powder and strong smell. While sprinkling cinnamon won't kill the ants, it might keep them from coming back.

"
"
Keep your floors and countertops clean.,
Keep food stored away.,
Seal your doors and windows.",How to Kill Black Ants3," Regularly sweep, mop and vacuum your floors to get rid of all the tiny crumbs that tend to collect there. After each meal, wipe down your table and countertops to remove all remnants of food. Ants are attracted to even the tiniest of spills, so make sure to clean up after yourself regularly to keep them from coming in.

, It's important not to leave food out for more than a little while - otherwise, the ants will sense that it's there and come to get it. If you have an ant problem, you might have to take extra measures to make sure your food is packaged tightly. The following foods should never be left out where the ants can access them:


Maple syrup
Juice
Sugar
Cracker crumbs
Fruit with thin skin, like strawberries

, Is it easy for ants to walk right into your house? You might want to look into sealing your doors and windows so that the ants won't be able to come inside. Use caulk and door seals to take care of the crack under your door and along the sides of your windows. Examine your house from the outside, too, to determine if there are any holes or cracks where they might be coming in.

However, certain traits common to the entire genus are useful to know when attempting to decide whether the ants in your home are carpenter ants or another variety. Some common traits to look for are:Color: Usually red, black, or an intermediate shade
Shape: Segmented with oval abdomen and boxy, thin thorax. The tops of carpenter ant thoraxes typically have a smooth, even curve, rather than an uneven or bumpy one.
Size: Approximately 3/8”-1/2"", depending on caste
Antennae: Yes
Wings: Typical worker ants do not have wings. However, relatively rare male drones may possess them.;
, Carpenter ants can (and will) establish a nest inside or outside of any type of structure, but wooden homes are especially at risk because carpenter ants like to bore tiny tunnels into wood. Unlike termites, carpenter ants don't eat wood - they only tunnel into the structure to create a nest.Because moist wood is easier than dry wood for carpenter ants to tunnel through, the interior locations of carpenter ants will often be near a moisture source, like a leaky sink or bath.


Sometimes, carpenter ants build a network of one or more satellite or parent colonies outside a structure and travel between these colonies and their foothold indoors, entering the structure through small cracks or openings. In these cases, outdoor colonies will often be located in tree stumps, landscape timbers, wood piles or other sources of damp wood. You can often locate carpenter ant trails between colonies in the early morning or early evening when the carpenter ants are foraging. There tracks are like a thin line.
When carpenter ants tunnel, they can leave “frass"", a substance resembling tiny wood shavings or sawdust, behind. Frass often contains dead insects. This can provide clues to their nesting location. If you come across small piles of frass in or around your house, carefully inspect the wood nearby for tunnels - probing the suspected wood with a thin screwdriver can reveal hollow spots.

, Though they usually nest in wood, if a carpenter ant colony is within the wall of your home, you may have a hard time finding it. If you suspect you have carpenter ants, it's a good idea to look for them in easily-accessible places where you are likely to find them. Certain common household sites are more supportive of carpenter ant activities than others - especially if these sites are damp and/or have access to food. Look for ants in the following areas:


Carpets – Check around doors, fireplaces, and other areas with easy access to the outside.
Patios and foundations
Areas with vegetation - Ants like to nest and forage in trails out of sight behind any vegetation, tree stumps, branches which rests against foundations, patios, etc. Pull back the vegetation to look for ants. When you find foraging ants, attempt to follow them back to their colony.

Mulch and leaf litter can harbor numerous types of ants in addition to carpenter ants, such as pavement ants, fire ants, and Argentine ants. Rake mulch back from the ground to check for colonies.


Floors – Potted plants, compost bends, or any other suitable item that has ground contact can contain carpenter ants.

, Though it's unlikely to happen, this warning bears mentioning: don't handle carpenter ants or their nests directly. Carpenter ants are not particularly aggressive and will not usually bite humans. However, when irritated or threatened, they can and will inflict a painful bite. Carpenter ants are also known to spray formic acid into bite wounds, increasing the pain. Though it's not the end of the world to be bitten by carpenter ants, you can avoid unnecessary pain by avoiding touching the ants or their nests unless it's absolutely necessary, in which case you should use long sleeves and gloves.

, The first step to exterminating a carpenter ant colony is to find it. To pinpoint the location of colonies in your home, look for ants, small holes, and piles of frass in the locations discussed in Part One, paying special attention to any areas that appear to contain moist wood. You can also test wood for infestations near the surface by firmly tapping. Wood with extensive burrowing can sound thinner or hollower than unaffected wood. Tapping can also agitate ants, causing them to leave the nest, where you may be able to see them more easily.


Don't forget that mature nests often have smaller satellite nests nearby, which also must be located to ensure the entire ant infestation is exterminated.

, In the case of smaller colonies, or ones that are fairly easy to access, it's sometimes possible to simply get rid of the colony itself. If the colony is outdoors, simply dispose of the affected wood carefully, using impenetrable materials like tarps to protect yourself from the ants as you handle the wood. If the colony has been located indoors, some pest control websites recommend using a vacuum cleaner's hose attachment to disrupt the colony and suck the ants out.If using the vacuum cleaner method, be sure to carefully seal and dispose of the dust bag to keep any ants that survive from escaping.
If you find a colony that has extensively burrowed through the wood in your wall, don't cut the wood out - you risk compromising the structural integrity of your house. Instead, call a professional.

, You may not always be able to find carpenter ant colonies. However, if you can find significant numbers of the ants themselves, placing insecticides in their trails can control and eliminate the colony. A variety of baits, traps, and other ant-killing products are available for sale to the general public - visit your local hardware store to check which options are available to you.


Be very careful when using poison ant bait in houses with small children. Make sure that the child knows not to eat the poison, or, if s/he is too young to understand, keep the child under close supervision.

, If you can't quickly locate and eliminate the colony and you haven't had success with insecticides, it's usually best to contact a professional exterminator. Professionals have access to insecticides and other tools that aren't available to the general public, but, more importantly, their training and experience allows them to locate and assess carpenter ant infestations much more intelligently than the average person.


Keep in mind that certain methods that exterminators use to kill ants may require your family to temporarily vacate your house for a day or two.
Don't delay in contacting a professional - the longer you wait to deal with a carpenter ant infestation, the larger the colony can grow and the more extensive the damage to your wood structure may be.

, Moisture is a big factor in carpenter ant infestations. Often, a patch of wood will become susceptible to infestation after it's been exposed to moisture. By fixing or sealing any leaks that allow water into your house, you can make it much more difficult for carpenter ants to nest. Below are a few suggestions for eliminating the moisture that can contribute to carpenter ant infestations:Check around windows for signs of an improper seal
Check your roof and weather-facing walls for leaks
Keep basements, attics, and crawl spaces well-ventilated
Look for and fix leaky pipes
Clean clogged gutters to eliminate runoff water

, If carpenter ants can no longer get in and out your house, any indoor satellite colonies that are being fed by larger outside colonies will become isolated and may die off. Inspect the outside of your home for cracks, holes, and other small spaces that allow the passage of ants - pay special attention to the areas of exterior walls that are closest to the ground or foundation. Seal any holes you find with caulk or a strong putty.


Also check around the points where water and electrical lines enter your home, as these points are extra vulnerable to ant infestation., Because carpenter ants like to make their nests in wood both inside and outside of buildings, finding and eliminating infested wood outside your wood can keep ants from making their way into your house. Carefully inspect any sources of wood near your home - if infested, move or carefully dispose of these wood sources. Places to look include:Stumps
Firewood piles
Old trees, especially if their branches touch your house.
Piles of yard waste

, If carpenter ants are a recurring problem, you may want to think about installing a small strip of gravel or stones around your home. This ""barrier"" zone is fairly inhospitable to carpenter ants and may discourage them from crawling into your house through holes near the foundation. Consult with a contractor to discuss the practicality and affordability of such a project at your house, or, if you're particularly handy, tackle this home improvement project yourself.

Ant-proof the perimeter of the building.",How to Kill Ants Outside," Ant nests can be in your siding, yard, or pavement. Follow an ant that has recently gathered food to see where it returns to.


If ants swarm around a certain area of your siding, there will probably be a nest there. Look for any holes in the siding that the ants appear to travel through. Usually, these appear in between layers of bricks, in spots with broken mortar. These holes can also show up under lap siding or in cracks found in stucco walls.
Note that a nest can be marked with an anthill or mound, but may also be located under mulch, gravel, stones, landscaping timbers, pavement, or grass. Some varieties even search out wood trim that has been rotted or damaged by moisture.
Track ants by placing small dabs of honey, jelly, or peanut butter on an index card. Place the card as close to the ant nest as you can find, and watch ants as they approach it. After they eat, they will return to the nest, making them easier to follow.;
, Ant nests on walls and pavement should be sprayed with an insecticide containing bifenthrin. Spot-treat specific areas when the problem is small and restricted to easily treated locations.Both liquid and granule ant killers are fine.
Insecticides containing carbaryl or pyrethroid may also work.

, If you have spotted ant hills or heavy ant activity in your lawn, spray a lawn and garden insect killer over the grass. You should also apply it to trees and shrubs.


Use the chemical within one day of mowing.
Do not apply the insecticide on a windy day.
Apply during the early morning or late afternoon. These times of day are when the ants are most active.
For broad-scale insecticides, look for one containing bifenthrin. You could also use insecticides with carbaryl or pyrethroid. Note that these insecticides will also kill other insects. Look on the label to determine which insects are at risk.
Re-treat after six weeks, if necessary.
Soak infested areas with diluted insecticide concentrate. Pour the insecticide directly on the area from a large bucket.

, Baits attract ants in the same way that food attracts them, but the granules contain a poison that kill ants upon being digested. The ants take the bait back to the nest, share it with the rest, and die shortly thereafter.


Use a broadcast spreader to spread the ant bait over your lawn.
You may need to wait a few weeks before seeing notable results.
Ant baits are especially useful against fire ants.
Alternatively, you can sprinkle bait in small piles around outdoor ant mounds, pavement cracks, or other possible nesting and trailing areas.

, Drench an outdoor nest with hot, soapy water to kill a large amount of the colony. The remaining ants will be driven away and forced to find another location.


Combine a few generous squirts of liquid dish soap with boiling water. While the water is still steaming hot, pour it over the nest.
The soap clings to the outside of the ant's body, trapping the water inside and effectively causing the ants to drown.
Similarly, you can get ants out of flowerpots by flooding them with soapy water, as well.

, Sprinkle boric acid around any nest in your yard, on your pavement, or along the outside of the house. Only use the substance in dry areas, though.


Be careful with this remedy. Even though it is technically a ""natural"" fix, boric acid is still toxic to both children and animals.
Alternatively, you can combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) boric acid with 1 cup (250 ml) sugar. Add just enough water to form a paste. Drop pieces of this paste near the anthill or along ant trails. The sugar will attract the ants, and the boric acid will kill them.

, Tobacco water, baby powder, and glue are all decent solutions you can use to clog the hole of the anthill and kill many of the ants inside. Pour the remedy directly into the hole of the anthill, using as much as possible to fill the anthill thoroughly.For tobacco water, begin by soaking a small handful of pipe tobacco in twice as much warm water overnight. Discard the tobacco itself and pour the remaining liquid directly over and into the anthill.
Glue and baby powder should be piped into the anthill through the hole.
You can also use baby powder to dust any common ant trails you see. Baby powder, in particular, cuts and dehydrates ants who cross over it, making it an effective insecticide.

, Essentially, you should apply it anywhere you tend to see ants.


Keep the DE dry. Do not wet it, since the effectiveness will decrease when the DE is wet.
The DE does not work immediately, but does kill most ants within a week or two. The ants cross over the DE, and the tiny granules cut open their protective outer coating. As a result, the ants can no longer retain moisture, and eventually dehydrate to death.

, Combine the peel of one to three oranges with 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water using a blender. Blend into a smooth puree, then pour the puree over and into any known ant hills.This works especially well on ants nests in your garden, on your patio, or along your foundation.
The smell of this solution is pleasant to humans, but unpleasant to most dogs and cats, so your pets are unlikely to be attracted to the area.
The puree will kill ants that receive a direct dose of it, but the majority of the ants will simply be driven away.

, Pour equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray the solution around ant hills and other nests, along with any known, frequented ant trails.


You could also pour undiluted white vinegar directly onto the ant hills in your lawn.
Vinegar may kill a few ants that are directly hit with an undiluted dosage, but for the most part, it simply drives ants away since ants are repelled by the smell of it.

, In particular, you should clean any food or drink spills and only store garbage outdoors in containers with secure, airtight lids.


Do not let pet food remain outdoors and in the open for more than an hour or so. Any food that does remain outdoors for an extended period of time should be placed in a tray of water to discourage ants from approaching it.
Most ants are attracted by a substance called ""honeydew,"" which is produced by aphids and other sap-consuming insects. If you spot these insects in your yard, get rid of them to prevent more ants from coming around.

, Ant populations are usually attracted to conditions that make shelter and travel simpler. Removing sources of shelter in the yard can discourage ants from settling there, and removing sources of travel around your home will help prevent the ant problem from spreading indoors.


The back of any tree, shrub, or plant should be at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) away from the house, roof, or deck.
Keep a space of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.24 cm) free between your foundation and soil. You should also make sure that the soil slopes away from the house.
Do not stack firewood near your house.
Ants like bare spots in your yard, so bare soil should be covered with healthy grass or trim vegetation.
Ants like thatch, so remove any thatch in your lawn by raking it away.

, Even if your ant problem remains outside right now, there is always a risk that the problem may move inside. Treating the perimeter of your home with a good barrier can greatly discourage ants from coming into the house from the outside.


Look for any area inside the home that an ant might enter through, like a window frame, door frame, or a hole in the wall or foundation. Use an indoor insecticide and spray these areas well according to the instructions provided on the label. A product containing bifenthrin, permethrin, or deltamethrin will usually be our best choice, and you should usually spray a 4-inch (10-cm) wide band along these possible points of entry.
Before ants get into the home, you should also caulk or seal any hole you spot.
Along the outer perimeter, spray an outdoor insecticide on the foundation and under your bottom-most layer of siding. Choose a chemical labeled as ""barrier treatment,"" and use a 12-inch (30.5-cm) wide band of insecticide.

"
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around problem areas.Apply a fine layer of DE anywhere you notice ants gathering in, focusing on points of entry, major food sources, and nests.,
Lay out traps made with baking soda and powdered sugar.,
Try cornmeal.,
Spread cream of wheat.,
Spray the ants with vinegar.,
Mix dextrose with apple juice.",How to Kill Ants1,"


Only use food-grade DE. Some DE is used for cleaning swimming pools, but this variety usually contains pesticides and other chemicals that can be toxic to pets and small children if ingested. On the other hand, food-grade DE is non-toxic.
DE is a natural compound made from ground, fossilized shells of diatoms, a type of small marine organism.
The powder is very abrasive and absorbent. Once an ant crosses over it, DE dissolves the waxy, protective coating on the ant's exterior. The ant does not die instantaneously, but it does eventually die from dehydration.;
, Mix equal parts baking soda and powdered sugar. Place small amounts in areas you expect ants to locate, including suspected points of entry or frequented hangouts.


The powdered sugar is used to bait the ants, as many species of ants are attracted to sweet food sources.
The baking soda is what kills the ants. Ants have an acidic substance inside their bodies, and this substance reacts with the baking soda once the ants ingest it.
While this tactic is not instantaneous, it can be highly beneficial. Ants carry the food source back to their nest, where the queen an other ants consume it. As a result, you may succeed in killing off a larger portion of the ants.

, Spread small piles of cornmeal near entryways, nests, and frequented food sources.


Ants must ingest the cornmeal before this technique can prove effective. Usually, the cornmeal itself is appetizing enough to encourage ants to eat it. If the cornmeal remains untouched after several days, though, you could try mixing a little sugar into it.
Cornmeal disrupts the digestive process of the ant. While ants do not die immediately after ingesting the cornmeal, they die a few days later from starvation. Moreover, since the ants take the cornmeal back to their nests, more ants die off in the long run.

, Sprinkle small piles of this common breakfast cereal in areas you expect ants to roam in. This can include points of entry, kitchen counters, or any other gathering place you might notice.


When an ant ingests cream of wheat, the product undergoes a reaction that causes it to expand. Within hours, any ant that has ingested the food will quite literally burst.
Plain, flavorless cream of wheat will usually work, but if the ants do not seem attracted to it, try spreading a flavored version. Cream of wheat flavored with brown sugar or fruit can be especially effective, but stay away from the kind that uses cinnamon since cinnamon repels most species of ants.

, Put some undiluted vinegar in a spray bottle and attack any ants you see roaming around.


White vinegar and apple cider vinegar both have fungicidal and insecticidal properties that can be deadly to ants.You can also spray areas that ants frequently walk across, such as points of entry or major food sources.
If you know where the ant's nest is located, pour 1/2 to 1 qt (1/2 to 1 l) of vinegar directly over and around the nest. This will kill the ants quicker and more effectively.

, Stir 2 to 3 tsp (10 to 15 ml) of an artificial sweetener containing dextrose, aspartame, maltodextrin into 1/2 to 1 cup (125 to 250 ml) apple juice. Mix the solution in a spray bottle and spray it on any ants you see.


This artificial sweetener acts as a neurotoxin.
You can also spray this concoction around areas you expect ants to travel through, including entryways and common gathering spots.

Combine sugar and borax.,
Use dish soap.Combine 1 qt (1 l) water with 1 tsp (5 ml) dish soap and 1 tsp (5 ml) cooking oil in a large spray bottle.,
Use talcum powder.",How to Kill Ants2," Combine equal parts sugar and borax, then slowly mix in a little water until the solution forms a paste. Apply that paste to strips of paper or cardboard an place the traps near points of entry, food sources, and other spots frequented by the ants.


Borax, or sodium borate, is a salt of boric acid. This compound is often used for cleaning purposes and is usually sold in the detergent aisle of a supermarket.
Borax can be toxic if consumed, you should keep these traps away from small children and pets.
Ants are attracted to the sweetness of the paste and take it back to the nest, where the queen consumes it. Eventually, the borax poisons all of the ants that ingested it.

, Shake to combine, and spray any visible ants with the solution.


The oil causes the solution to stick to the ants and the dish soaps dehydrates the ants to death.
You can also spray this solution around areas that ants frequent, but it only remains effective while still wet.

, Use a baby powder or body powder that contains talc.

Sprinkle the powder liberally in areas where you see ants, especially if you can determine where they are entering your home.
Ants are unable to cross through the powder, but will be kept from getting into your home. You will need to kill any ants that remain behind inside your house.

Place ant bait stations indoors.Purchase ant bait and place a station in every room that has an ant problem, focusing on areas where ants gather most often.,
Scatter ant bait granules outdoors and indoors.,
Spray any ant spray.,
Call an exterminator if needed.",How to Kill Ants3," Continue to refresh the bait until the ants stop showing up.


Ant bait works by cutting off the reproductive ability of the queen. Worker ants carry the bait back to the queen, and the poison prevents her from reproducing. As the ants die off naturally, no new ants are there to replace them.
Ant bait is most effective indoors. It can be used outdoors, but should not be placed on wet surfaces or used in temperatures below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius).

, Purchase and apply granular bait inside cracks, crevices, and surfaces frequented by ants. You can also pile the bait around outdoor ant mounds or use it inside.


Unlike ant bait stations, ant bait granules do not have temperature limitations and can be used both indoors and outdoors.
Worker ants take the ant bait granules back to the entire colony to eat. The granules poison the ants after being consumed.

, Purchase a consumer spray pesticide specifically labeled to work against ants. Follow the instructions, spraying visible ants and perimeters in the manner described on the label.


It is absolutely crucial that you follow the instructions on the label. Doing so can prevent the product from working and may even pose a health risk to you and your family.
Make sure to use a pesticide labeled for use with ant problems. Some pesticide and insecticide chemicals are more useful against some insects than they are with others, so an insecticide meant to work on bees, for instance, may not work against ants.
Some sprays kill ants instantaneously. Others coat the ants with a toxic chemical, killing the gradually so that the poison has a chance to get back to the nest first.

, Many ant problems can be solved at home with consumer products or natural solutions, but some severe infestations may require the help of a professional exterminator.


The exterminator will be able to assess the situation and determine which chemical will prove most effective against the ants. Chemicals used by professional exterminators are often more powerful than those available to consumers.
If you have small children, pets, or other sources of concern, make sure to let the exterminator know so that he or she can take any necessary precautions before spraying your house for ants.

Pour boiling water on the ants or the nest.,
Set glue traps.Purchase yellow glue traps and strategically place them in areas where the ants typically gather.,
Smash the ants.",How to Kill Ants4," Boil a kettle or small saucepan of water and immediately use it to saturate any anthills or large gatherings of ants outdoors.


Ants can swim, so warm or cool water will not be enough to wipe the colony out. Boiling water will burn the ants, though, which is an effective means of killing them.

, After a few days, the traps should be coated in ants.


These glue traps are non-toxic, but you should avoid placing them in areas that your pets have access to since pets can unknowingly get caught on the traps. This is especially important if you have a rabbit, rat, ferret, or similar pet that is allowed to roam the house.
You can also make your own glue trap by coating a piece of yellow construction paper with petroleum jelly or a paste made with corn syrup and water.

, When all else fails, you can always squash the ants with a shoe, old magazine, or fly-swatter.


This technique will work against visible ants, but if you have a colony making its home nearby, simply smashing the ants will probably fail to eliminate the problem long-term.

Apply an insecticide to the peonies.,
Dip the peony flowers in water before handling or displaying.,
Prevent the ants from climbing the plant's stem using a homemade ant trap.,
Complement your peony plantings with ant-repellant plants.",How to Keep Ants off Peonies," One of the most effective ways to control an ant problem on peonies is to spray the plants with an insecticide. Before choosing a product to spray, make sure that the manufacturer specifically states that the product is effective against ants. Apply the insecticide according to the manufacturer's directions.


This method will not generally be acceptable if you are committed to gardening organically or do not want to harm the beneficial insects that aid the plants in pollination.;
, If you are only concerned about the presence of ants because you want to cut the flowers and display them indoors, a water bath is a simple and effective method. Cut the peonies with long stems so that you have ample room to handle them, and then dip the flowers into a bowl of water. This will remove nearly all of the ants.


For even more effective removal of the ants, you can add a few drops of dish soap to the water. A mild soapy solution will not harm the flowers.

, If keeping the ants off the peonies at all times is your goal, you can make a simple ant trap using paper and petroleum jelly.


Begin by cutting a circle with about a 6 inch (15 cm) diameter out of a piece of paper. Make a straight cut from the outer edge to the center of the circle, and then cut out a small circle at the center of the paper circle.
Smear one side of the paper circle with petroleum jelly. Then, place the circle around the stem of your peony plant, with the plant's stem at the center of the circle. If the petroleum jelly side is facing up, any ants trying to climb the plant will get stuck in the petroleum jelly.

, Another way you can discourage ants from getting on your peonies is by planting ant-repellant plants nearby. Some common plants that tend to repel ants are geraniums, mint, garlic, and calendula.

Spray your lawn and garden with insecticide after you mow.",How to Kill Ants in Your House," Don’t kill them right away. You want to see whether their trails lead to nests inside or outside the house.;
, A high-resolution photo with a smart phone should work. Email it to your local university extension office.Go to http://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/ to find our local extension office. They are wonderful sources for information about food, gardening, flowers, pests and more.

, If the nests are outside, you may be able to avoid using chemical insecticides inside your home.

, Use a vacuum to pick up crumbs and other food sources. Seal off all food, so that your home isn’t attractive to ants., These small white traps are usually shaped like flowers. The ants eat the bait and bring it back to the nest, killing the majority of the ants in the nest.


Try this before moving on to other methods. It may take care of the problem after a week or two.
Move on to other methods if you have pets and children that are in danger of picking up the traps.
Buy Combat or Terro ant traps, which are rated highly.

, Mix 2 tbsp. of dish soap with one pint of water. Pour it in a spray bottle and spray the ants themselves.


This method is a natural way to get rid of ants, but it requires you to have access to the nest and target it directly.






You can also use it to clean up ant trails around the house. Trails created by scout ants have a scent that will lead other ants to food sources.
You can also use a mixture of one part white vinegar to one part water to cover ant trails.

, After the ant nest is gone, you should seal the area where they made the nest.

, Spread it around the cabinets, walls or other places that are being attacked by ants. It creates a barrier that the ants can’t breach and it kills ants by drying out their bodies., Spray it on potential entryways, such as windowsills, doors and cracks in the foundation

, Ants use plants as a bridge to get from outside nests to inside food sources.

, Follow up by spraying cracks in the foundation so that other ants are killed before they get inside.

Invest in an ant moat.,
Add oily substances outside the feeder.,
Hang the feeder on fishing line.",How to Keep Ants Off Hummingbird Feeders1," An ant moat is a small cup. You place it between the feeder and the tree branch the feeder hangs from. Ants are unable to go through the water and get into the feeder. You can buy a moat and attach it to your feeder, following the instructions. If you don't already have a hummingbird feed, buy one with an ant moat already installed., Take a sticky substance, such as vaseline, and spread it on the outside of the feeder. Ants will be unable to crawl through this substance to get to the nectar., Fishing line tends to be very slippery. Ants have a difficult time moving across fishing wire. Hanging the hummingbird feeder from fishing line will make it harder for ants to get to the feeder."

Look at the color.,
Note size.,
Watch for a round thorax.,
Look at the antenna and waist.",How to Identify Carpenter Ants1," Carpenter ants are usually brown or black. Some are a combination of black and orange. While you need more than color to figure out if you have carpenter ants, noting color is a good place to start., As you observe ants, try estimate their size. Carpenter ants are not very big. Normally, you will see worker ants around your home. They are generally 3/8 to 1/2 an inch.However, in some areas carpenter ants tend to be smaller. In Minnesota, for example, some carpenter ants are only 3/16 of an inch. When noting size, look to other characteristic as well.

, The thorax refers to the segment of an ant just below its head. Carpenter ants have a rounded thorax. The upper surface should be evenly rounded throughout., The midsection of a carpenter ant should be pinched and slim in appearance. Their antennae will be bent slightly.Noting the antennae and waist helps distinguish carpenter ants from termites. Termites have straight antenna and a broad waist.

Check for leaks.,
Clean the feeder.,
Adjust the food you're using.",How to Keep Ants Off Hummingbird Feeders2," Check the feeder carefully on all sides. See if you notice any cracks that are causing leaks. Leaks are one of the easiest ways to attract ants. If you notice any leaks, get a replacement feeder., Each time you add new feed to the hummingbird feeder, wipe down the exterior to remove any built up sugar residue. Ants are attracted to sugar residue, so cleaning the feeder can keep them away.Wipe the feeder down using very hot water, but make sure the water is not hot enough to burn your hands.Keep wiping the feeder until all the sugar residue is gone.

, Homemade hummingbird nectar is generally one parts sugar to four parts water. However, to deter ants, try using slightly less than one part sugar. Hummingbirds will still feed on the nectar but less sugar will draw in less ants."
"
Move the feeder frequently.,
Hang the feeder in the shade.,
Place the feeder over water.",How to Keep Ants Off Hummingbird Feeders3," Ants build habitats around food sources. Periodically moving the feeder will keep a colony of ants from settling near the feeder. Every couple of weeks, move the feeder to a different location in your yard., Ants may be less likely to invade a feeder found in a shaded area. However, a completely shaded area will fail to attract hummingbirds. Look for an area that's partially shaded so hummingbirds can still access the feeder., If you have a fountain or other body of water in your yard, hang the feeder over that. This will prevent ants from crawling towards the feeder as ants will stay out of water."

Look for piles of wood shavings.,
Listen for ants in the walls.,
Check for workers at night or early.",How to Identify Carpenter Ants2," Carpenter ants do not eat wood, but they do burrow in it. They will burrow into wood furniture in your home, such as desks or cabinets. If you have a carpenter ant infestation, you may find piles of wood shavings just below wooden objects like desks., Gently tap against the walls in your home while pressing your ear against the wall. Tapping often disturbs an ant nest. If you have an infestation, you may hear a light rustling sound.While carpenter ants can nest anywhere in your home, they tend to prefer areas near window frames or water sources. It's not uncommon to find carpenter ants in a kitchen or bathroom, for example. Try tapping in these places to find nests.

, If you suspect you have an infestation, look for workers. Carpenter ants tend to come out after dark, so search for them near where you heard rustling in the early morning or late at night. Use a flashlight to scan for carpenter ants in these places."

Look up pictures of woodworm.,
Look for bumps, holes, or undulations.,
Examine wood floors.,
Check the roof, walls, and furniture.,
Look for beetles.,
Identify advanced damage.",How to Identify Woodworm1," If you decide to investigate your home for signs of woodworm, look up pictures of infected wood online to get a sense of what you're searching for; short of seeing adult beetles themselves, damage to wood is they best way to identify woodworm. The Common Furniture Beetle, which attacks the sapwood of hardwoods and softwoods, as well as plywood, is the most likely culprit. Evidence of Common Furniture Beetle woodworm includes exit holes in wood that are 1.5 to 2 mm (1/16 inch) in size, short tunnels than run along the grain of the wood, and lemon shaped pellets present in gritty bore dust.


Note that damage to wood done by the Powder Post Beetle, normally found in hardwood storage areas, can be confused with Furniture Beetle damage; research both.;
, Use a flashlight to examine wood, particularly in dark corners. Do not shine the light directly onto the surface of the wood; instead, lay it flat against the surface so the light shines over, revealing any bumps, holes, or undulations. These marks can often be missed by the naked eye., Small holes caused by woodworm are typically found below the floor's surface. Start your search around the floor's edges and under windows, where adult beetles tend to fly towards light. Regardless of where an infestation has started, evidence will eventually emerge in these places.Note that while woodworm thrives in damp areas, it is capable of surviving in dryer conditions as well.

, Woodworm is often found in ceiling beams in household attics, which can cause serious structural problems over time. Look for woodworm damage to the ceiling joists as well as trimmers around the access hatch. Thoroughly inspect all roof beams that you can access safely, using a step stool or ladder, as well as walls (in particular, near the edges) and wooden furniture., Spotting the Common Furniture Beetle is a good indication that woodworm is present in wood in the surrounding area. Look for insects that are small, dark, and reddish in color, approximately 3mm to 5mm in length. Beetles will typically be spotted between March and September, during flight season when they emerge to mate., Advanced damage caused by woodworm is evident when wood starts crumbling around its corners or edges. Weak and damaged floorboards are also indicative of a serious woodworm infestation that warrants the assistance of an exterminator. Extensive wood damage will compromise the strength of wood and, accordingly, the structural integrity of a home."

Look for swarming near lights.,
Observe piles of wings.,
Look for piles of feces.",How to Identify a Termite Infestation1," This is because light attracts flying termites, especially during the night. Also look for swarming near windows and doors. If you see a large congregation of termites in the air, then the termites are exhibiting swarming behavior. Swarming can occur during the day or night.Swarming generally occurs in the spring months, i.e., March, April, May, and June.
If you happen to see a termite fly out from under your porch, patio, or foundation, then this is a sure sign of an infestation.;
, Termites will shed their wings when they enter the next stage of their development. This usually occurs after the swarming period. In an infested home, you can often find piles of wings that have been shed by flying termites.Shed wings look similar to tiny fish scales.

, Also called frass, termite droppings are ridged and small. They look like small, wood colored pellets. Oftentimes, you can find piles of feces near the openings of tunnels, as well as where they have eaten or nested.Sweep up the feces and dispose of it. Check the spot daily to see if more fecal pellets appear. If they do, then this is a sure sign that you have an infestation.

Treat your wood.,
Using liquid chemicals on wood.,
Create a chemical barrier in the soil.,
Decide on repellent or non-repellent chemicals.,
Use liquid repellent.,
Use liquid non-repellent termiticide.",How to Get Rid of Subterranean Termites1," Simple yet effective wood curers can deter termites by simply increasing the strength of the wood. A small investment here can save you thousands in removal down the road. But be aware that over time as wood ages it will become softer and more vulnerable to termites.;
, You can spray termiticide directly onto the surface of wood to deter subterranean termites from chewing through it. But keep in mind that spot treating wood will only protect against attacks in those specific areas and shouldn’t be considered a complete treatment., By creating a chemical barrier around the outer perimeter of your home you can do a lot to stop subterranean termites from gaining access to your house. This can be achieved by the use liquid insecticide. You have to spray the soil beneath the foundation with the insecticide. This should be done pre-construction and is a requirement in much of the USA.


It is possible to perform a post-construction treatment. To do this requires holes to be drilled through slabs and insecticide to be injected beneath the foundation.There are a wide-range of products available for this, and in most states home owners can legally purchase these products if it's for personal use only.
Online vendors have videos that you can watch so you can understand how to do this project effectively before you buy anything.
If you are uncertain about how to do this, you should seek advice from a professional rather than risk causing damage.

, When you are using chemical insecticides, it is important to know which to use. The two main types of chemicals are liquid repellents, and liquid non-repellents. Each of these have their advantages and disadvantages, so be sure to have a good understanding of how each of these work so you and try to evaluate what will work best for your treatment.

, As the name suggests this is used before the termites strike, as it discourages termites from attacking the foundation of your home. It will create a barrier to stop them from entering your home, and will last for several years. While the termites won’t cross the barrier, they will avoid it, and will move around it. It is extremely difficult to create a prefect barrier with no gaps under a fully constructed house, and termites may discover these spaces and gain access to the building. If some foraging subterranean termites find a gap in the repellent they will return with more termites.

, There are a few non-repellent termiticide treatments available to buy. These don’t stop the termites from attacking, but the chemical is lethal. If termites tunnel into the treatment they will be exposed to the termiticide and they will die.


Foraging termites which have been exposed to the chemicals might pass it on in the colony through grooming and feeding which would kill more of the termites."

Try baited traps.,
Use commercial bug sprays.,
Call in a professional.",How to Identify Carpenter Ants3," A mild carpenter ant infestation can be treated at home with baited traps. You can buy such traps at a hardware store. You can set up traps in areas where you have seen carpenter ants traveling.This usually works best if you have carpenter ants somewhere outside, like your porch. This will prevent the ants from moving indoors.
Make sure to check the labels of any traps you use. You may need to keep them out of reach of children and animals.

, Sprays can be used to keep an infestation from moving in doors. Purchase bug sprays specifically designed to repel or kill carpenter ants at a local hardware store. Sprays are usually applies in a perimeter around your home.Make sure to read the label for safe use. Most sprays should be kept out of reach of children and animals.

, If you have an infestation that does not go away using traps and sprays, call in a professional. Professional exterminators can help locate ant nests and strategically knock out an infestation.While most exterminators use chemicals and pesticides, if you're uncomfortable with sprays you can discuss natural options with an exterminator.

Read reviews online and ask friends or colleagues if they have recommendations for local extermination companies. Call different companies for quotes and assessments before booking an appointment.

, Identifying specific species' of woodworm is incredibly difficult, and can result in misguided treatment attempts that fall through. Ask an exterminator for a professional assessment of your problem. Inquire about pricing and potential treatments before agreeing to any services by the company.Treatments could range from water based treatments for less severe infestations to fogging – a treatment for floors that generally does not require furniture and carpets to be removed., Once an exterminator has identified woodworm in your home, consider having them treat the problem right away. Over time, woodworm can cause significant damage to wood as well as serious structural problems in a building. DIY measures can be ineffective and time-wasting if infested wood has been left untreated for too long, so be proactive about stopping the problem before it gets out of hand."

Spot Ambrosia Beetle woodworm.,
Look for Wood Boring Weevil woodworms.,
Detect Powder Post Beetle woodworm.,
Look for Deathwatch Beetle woodworm.",How to Identify Woodworm3," The Forest Longhorn Beetle and its larvae are only found on trees in the forest. Look for large bore holes that can be up to 10 mm (3/8 inch) across, much larger than most household woodworms. Note that tunnels will be very discreet and run against the grain of the wood., Waney Edge Borer woodworm can be found in wood that has bark on it, and is rarely found in homes. Look for borer dust with bun-shaped pellets around the bark areas from the boring holes. The holes are usually around 2 mm (1/16 inches) in diameter., Ambrosia Beetle woodworm is generally found in the forest; this woodworm can’t survive in treated lumber, and only lives outdoors. Unlike other woodworm species, the adult does the tunneling, going against the grain and deep into the wood. Look for black-colored tunnels that are evident after trees are damaged or wood is cut (in a lumber yard, for example.), Wood Boring Weevil woodworm can be found in wood damaged by fungal decay. You can identify this woodworm by looking for tiny holes with ragged bore holes and coarse dust. Look for tunnels that run against the grain and often break the surface of the damaged wood., Powder post woodworm is generally found in seasoned hardwood, which is usually only found in furniture factories and lumber yards. These woodworms tunnel along the grain of the wood, and don’t attack old wood (wood that is more than 15 years old). Look for tiny entry and exit bore holes no larger than 2 mm (1/16 inch), and loose, flour-like dust., Deathwatch Beetle woodworm can be found in hardwood, (usually oak), that is partially decayed. Look for bore holes that measure up to 3 mm (1/8 inch) across, and boring dust containing large bun-shaped pellets that are visible without any magnification. If possible, inspect the interior of the wood; more extensive damage occurs inside the wood than what is visible externally."

Look for working tunnels.,
Identify exploratory and drop tunnels.,
Break the tunnels open.",How to Identify a Termite Infestation2," In an infested home, you will be able to find mud-like tunnels extending from the ground, up your concrete or stone foundation and to a wooden structure. These tunnels are usually the size of a pen, but they can also be slightly larger or smaller.You may also be able to find tunnels on your floor joists, sill plates, support piers, and slabs, for example.

, Exploratory or migratory tunnels can be found rising up from the soil but do not connect to wooden structures. Additionally, in an infested home, you can find drop tubes extending from a wooden structure back to the soil., When you identify mud tunnels, use a pocketknife to break open the tubes. If the tubes are active, you may be able to see worker termites. Worker termites are small and appear white or translucent. However, the absence of these termites does not mean that you do not have an infestation.If the tunnel is rebuilt after a few days, then this is a sure sign that you have an infestation.

, Tiny holes in wooden structures like walls and furniture are also signs of a termite infestation. Examine the holes. If you can identify pieces of soil around the edges of these holes, then you are dealing with an infestation.Buckling paint and/or cracked wood are also signs of a termite infestation.

, If you hear a dull thud, then your wooden structures have been hollowed out. Pick the surface of the wood with a pocketknife. See if you can find tunnels or pieces of dried soil or mud inside the damaged wood.These are signs of a termite infestation.

, Use a flashlight to examine wood construction in your basement, focusing on the areas where concrete connects with wood. Also examine the wood under your porch, wooden window frames and sills, joists, and supporting piers and posts.Make sure to examine both the interior and exterior parts of your foundation.

, If you have determined that your home is infested with termites, then you need to contact a professional.

Use bait traps to target the entire colony.,
Use bait traps to look for termites outside.,
Check the traps for activity.,
Use bait traps to tackle an infestation inside.",How to Get Rid of Subterranean Termites2," Because of the size of termite colonies, the use of soil termiticide might only have a limited impact on the overall population.Baiting subterranean termites has become an increasingly popular way to tackle an infestation, and can also contribute to longer term deterrence and protection. Baits are slow-acting insecticides which are consumed and then brought back to the colony where the chemicals spreads out across the wider termite population.


Some baits use Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) which are very effective at decreasing and destroying whole colonies.
IGRs have low toxicity to humans and pets, but often the most effective ones are only available to professionals., You can set up a few traps to try to see if you have a colony of subterranean termites nearby. If you place a piece of untreated wood into the plastic bait traps, and push these down into the ground around the outside of your house, at approximately 10 feet intervals, you can flush out any termites close-by. , You should check these traps regularly, every month or few months is good. If you remove the trap from the soil and there are live termites in it you should place some toxic bait into the trap and return it to the soil. Hopefully, the termites which have come for the untreated wood will now take the poisoned bait back to the colony, where the chemicals will spread across the population., The traps you place outside the periphery of your house will not have any impact on subterranean termites that have already dug into your house’s structure. There are some above-ground bait stations that are available. These are designed to work in largely the same way as the one pushed into the soil outside.You can attach these to an area where there is termite activity such as a mud tube, or some damaged woodwork.
Be sure to read the label of whatever you use, as some baiting systems will be designed to work on their own, others with liquid spot-treatment.

Consider fumigating your home.,
Contact an expert.,
Prepare for the fumigation.",How to Get Rid of Subterranean Termites3," If the problem is severe, and immediate attention is necessary, you can look into fumigation options for termite control. Fumigation has the advantage of being able to treat every part of your home and its structure in one go. It is normally only recommended if multiple colonies are found in a single structure., Fumigation is not something that you can carry out yourself. It involves your house being covered over with a giant tent, and fumigators pumping in gas which spreads throughout your home. It is supposed to seep into every crack and crevice in one treatment and kill off the termites that have taken up residence there.


A specialist will need to make specific plans for the particulars of your infestation.

, If your house is going to be fumigated, a pest control company will enter your home, and work for three to five days. Before they arrive you have to take precautions, including ensuring that all food is sealed well or removed from your home. The fumigators will take care of everything else and advise you how to be ready. You won’t be able to access the house until they are finished so you need to be prepared.There are two different types of poisons used to kill termites; one is a stomach poison, and the other a hormone which prevents termites to regrow a cuticle after moulting. The poisons have a two-fold benefit, since termites will eat the remains of their colony members.
Even post tenting and fumigation, a problem may flare up once more with termites; unfortunately, this procedure does not rid your home of termite eggs.

Avoid water accumulation near foundations.,
Identify and fix structural problems in your home.,
Ventilate the hidden spaces in your home.",How to Get Rid of Subterranean Termites4," A good way to prevent future infestations is to make sure that you do not have an accumulation of water near your home’s foundations as this a prime habitat for subterranean termites. You can divert water with effective guttering, and by using devices such as downspouts and splash blocks.This also applies for any mulch or wet garden materials which could be attractive to termites., Certain structural deficiencies can play a major part in heightening the chances of you suffering an infestation. Remedying these can be an effective long-term action which limits the probabilities of subterranean termites appearing. As the termites tend to enter where wood touches soil, you should have a clearance of at least twelve inches between wood at the base of your house and the soil. This also applies for porches or decking areas, where you should not have the wood directly on the soil.

, A warm and humid environment in the dark areas of your house, such as crawl spaces, attics, and basements can be very inviting for termites. For subterranean termites, your basement or cellar will be a particularly popular area. You can make these areas less hospitable for termites by ensuring they are well ventilated to avoid those warm and humid conditions."
"
Learn what they are.,
Identify subterranean termites.,
Look for tell-tale signs in your wood.,
Look for shed wings.,
Look for mud tubes.",How to Get Rid of Subterranean Termites5," Termites are divided into three broad types: drywood; subterranean; and dampwood.They each have different characteristics and it is best to be certain that you know which type of termite is which so you can take the appropriate course of action. Subterranean termites feed off the cellulose in wood. The point where wood comes into contact with soil is the main entry point for subterranean termites., Although they are generally dug in below your house and you may not see the termites themselves, it’s worth knowing a little about their appearance in case you find one and you want to identify it. There are three so-called ‘castes’ in a termite colony, each of which are different.


Alates (more commonly known as swarmers) are dark-brown or black, and are around a quarter to a half inch long, with two pairs of wings of very similar length.
Workers don’t have wings, are generally a quarter inch long, and are cream coloured.
Soldiers are also wingless, but they have large mandibles (jaws). They are the defenders of the colony and are distinctive for their jaws and their creamy torso, and their brownish head., Probably the best way to determine whether or not you have an infestation is to look for the signs and marks that often indicate that a subterranean termite colony has taken up residence. One indicator is wood that appears layered. Subterranean termites only consume the softwood, so the hardwood portion remains, and this could give the wood a layered look. Dark patches or blisters in wood flooring can indicate termites.Wood may not look damaged, but if you tap it and it sounds hollow, this suggest that though the veneer is undamaged, the softer wood beneath has been eaten away., Alates (or swarmer) termites are the ones you are most likely to find. What you think are flying ants, might in fact be swarmers. One difference is that swarmers are smaller and have four wings of about the same size, whereas ants have a pair large wings and one of smaller wings.


Once they have mated, swarmers will shed their wings. They will leave them in a pile, which might look like fish scales.
If you see a pile of wings like this on your windowsill, it could indicate an infestation., These foraging tubes go from the soil to the infested wood, and are brown and muddy in appearance. They are the routes the termites use to go to the wood from the soil, and are generally about pencil-width. Sometimes they are easy to spot, but they can also be hidden behind skirting boards, under floorboards or tucked away out of sight."

Begin by cleaning your space.,
Clean up and seal away all food.,
Place the trap strategically.,
Make a humane trap.,
Remove the mouse from the trash can while wearing gloves.,
Transfer mouse to a container.,
Remove the mouse from your house.,
Clean and disinfect areas of mouse contamination.,
Wait five minutes for bleach mixture to soak into the droppings.,
Deter mice from coming back.",How to Catch a Mouse Without Killing It," Mice are initially attracted to your cozy environment. If you clean out your house and make it less hospitable, mice will be less inclined to stay.


Remove all clutter throughout your house. Don't leave out clothes, papers, or materials that mice could use to create nests.
Don't forget to tidy up storage spaces, especially where paper goods or old clothes are kept.;
, Be incredibly through about this, as mice can make a meal out of almost anything. Wipe up crumbs from behind appliances and in cabinets.


Do not leave food sitting out. This includes pet food. Be in the habit of sealing and storing your pet's food at night. This will make it harder for the mice to get comfortable.
Food stored in a pantry should be completely closed. For example, if you've opened a sack of flour you should transfer it to a sealable container for longer storage.

, Put the trap in the room that you've noticed the most mouse activity. Once you've placed your trap, you'll want to avoid the space for a while so you don't accidentally drive the mouse away from the trap.


If you don't have a counter to use, you can create a ramp by propping up a small board. Place a bit of peanut butter on the end of the ramp.The mouse will still be able to get in the trash can, but won't be able to get out.

, Dab a little peanut butter on the inside of a very tall trash can (at least two feet high) and set the trash can next to a countertop that is taller than the trashcan. Crease an empty paper towel tube to create a flat tunnel and stick a little peanut butter on the inside at the end. Set this tube on the counter so that the end with the peanut butter hangs out over the trash can.


If using a purchased live trap, be certain to follow the packaged instructions.

, Be sure to wear rubber, latex, or vinyl gloves since mice carry communicable diseases.Get your cleaning supplies out, so that you can immediately disinfect the space once the mouse is contained. You'll need a mixture of bleach and water in a spray bottle.

, The mouse shouldn't be able to get out, but must have ventilation to breathe.


Do not put the mouse in cardboard, since it can easily chew through cardboard containers.
Now you can thoroughly disinfect your trashcan and countertops with a mixture of bleach and water after you've removed the mouse. Throw away the cardboard tube.

, Whatever you do, do not release the mouse right outside your home. Mice can find their way back into a warm environment nearby. Instead, drive the mouse at least five miles away and release it.Try to relocate the mouse as soon as you can. The mouse will be contained for a shorter period of time, and you can get on with cleaning and disinfecting your home.
You can increase its chance of survival if you release it near some kind of shelter. Avoid urban areas, where the mouse might simply return to another home, and wide-open spaces, where it can't find shelter from predators.

, Open windows for ventilation and spray any droppings with a mixture of bleach and water. The ratio of bleach should be one part to ten parts water.Do not sweep or vacuum up mouse droppings or nesting materials.These can kick up dust which could carry disease.

, Then, use a paper towel to scoop up the droppings and throw away.


Disinfect floors once you've cleaned the countertops by mopping with a bleach and water mixture.
Remember to wash bedding in hot water and clean any upholstered furniture you think mice might have contaminated.

, In addition to keeping a clean home, check the seals on doors, windows, and access points to the outside. You can use whatever method you like to seal the gap, just be sure to fill all of them.


Do not use caulk or plastic fillers to seal gaps since mice can chew through them.Sprinkle a few drops of peppermint oil on cotton balls and tuck them around your home. Since mice don't like the strong scent, they'll stay away."

Decide what type of trap to use.,
Set the trap in the early spring.,
Find a groundhog hole.,
Wash the trap.,
Anchor the trap.,
Conceal the trap.,
Bait the trap.,
Set the trap to stay open at first.,
Check the trap regularly.,
Cover your trap with a cloth sheet after you have caught your groundhog.,
Transport the animal to its new location.,
Release the groundhog.",How to Trap a Groundhog," There are two types of traps available for groundhogs: traps that kill the groundhogs immediately and traps that keep them alive, so you can take them somewhere and release them. Because the traps that kill groundhogs are dangerous to use and often end up killing house pets and other animals, they are illegal in many places. The safer and more humane option is a live trap, which uses bait to lure the groundhog into a cage that has a door that will lock shut.These traps are available at garden supply stores and can be reused as often as necessary.


If you prefer to use a trap that kills the groundhog and it's legal in your state to do so, call a professional groundhog extermination service to have them set the trap and deal with the groundhog after it's been caught. This is not recommended if you have pets that may wander near the trap.
Relocating groundhogs is also illegal in some areas. If this is the case in your region, you'll need to call animal control to dispose of the groundhog on your property.;
, In the spring, groundhogs are active, but they haven't yet given birth to their young. Trapping them before the babies are born will prevent you from having 4 extra groundhogs to deal with. Another benefit of trapping in spring is that the tunnels are easier to spot, since no foliage is covering them. Finally, groundhogs are extra-hungry this time of year because their favorite foods have yet to sprout. This means they'll be easily enticed by the bait you set out.


Plan to trap groundhogs in early spring, before the flowers and leaves come out in full force.
You can also trap groundhogs in the fall.

, The best place to set the trap is close to the entrance hole to the groundhog's burrow. To find the hole, look for a place where the dirt at the ground's surface is disturbed, and follow it to a small hole or caved-in spot. You'll want to set the trap 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) from the hole to make sure it's within easy reach.


Determine where the groundhog high-traffic area is by looking for footprints, trails or where the most damage has been done to your crops. Select holes in these high-traffic areas for your traps.

, Clean it well with mild or unscented dish soap to remove any human scent on it. The groundhog will be more likely to approach the trap if it doesn't smell like you. From this point forward, handle the trap with rubber gloves on to avoid transferring your scent back to it.

, Weight your trap down so that it does not shake when the animal enters. The shaking may spook the groundhog, and it may not enter far enough to become trapped. You can weight it by placing a heavy rock in the back of the trap or putting rocks on top of the trap.

, Groundhogs won't be likely to walk into a shiny new trap. You'll have a better chance of catching a groundhog if you conceal it by covering it with some vegetation, like branches and leaves. You could also hide the metal with a burlap sack or some pieces of wood to make it look less like a trap.

, Scatter some vegetables like lettuce, carrots and celery inside the trap. Choose foods that specifically grown in your garden or crop area that you know the groundhog likes to eat, because you've seen the evidence. You can also buy a product called ""woodchuck lure"" that attracts groundhogs very well.

, Set it so that it stays open for the first few days, so that the groundhog will get used to it and feel safe going inside to get the bait. After 3 or so days, change the setting so that the door will close behind the groundhog next time it wanders inside.

, If you are using a live trap, it is inhumane to leave the animal in a trap without water and exposed to the elements for long periods of time. Make sure that you remove the animal from your property shortly after it has been caught.

, This will calm the animal down so you can go about the business of transporting it.

, Choose a wooded area far enough away from your property that it won't return - at least 10 miles (16 km).The area should offer plenty of shade and have an easily accessible water source. Speak to local law enforcement or to an area conservation office to find out the best place to release the groundhog. There may be laws dictating where it should be released.

, Set the trap down when you find the appropriate location, remove the sheet and open the door. Make sure you allow yourself enough time for the groundhog to remove itself from the trap on its own accord.


Do not get too close to the groundhog. Groundhogs' teeth are quite sharp, and you could end up with a bad bite if you aren't careful.

Refill traps as needed.",How to Get Rid of Ants Outside1," Baits are the most effective way to kill ants because they take the poison back to their nests., You need both sugary baits and protein/grease baits to draw out different types of ants., Baits draw ants in, so they won't be effective if you place them in an area with a chemical that repels them., You can use stakes or plastic bait containers. Some are one-time use, while others can be refilled. Refillable ones can be useful if you have a continual problem., Choose places near anthills and trails. Keep them away from areas where pets or kids will be, as they are poisonous.Space them about 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m) away from each other., These types of baits take awhile to work, as the ants must carry them throughout their nests., As they get low, add more insecticide to keep the ants well-fed with pesticide."

Ants could enter your home from many different areas, so be sure to check around window cracks, door entryways, lighting fixtures, and other possible entrances.If you see a trail of ants in your home, follow them to see where they are entering from.


If you find specific entry points where ants are coming into your home, focus your repellant and deterrent efforts on these areas.That way, you reduce the chances of the ants reentering you home through these avenues.;
, When you have found areas through which ants are entering your home, barricade and seal these entryways. Consider filling in cracks and crevices with a silicone caulk treatment.You could even put some sort of deterrent (Borax, cinnamon, coffee grounds, bay leaves) in the crack, and then continue to seal the opening with caulk.


Latex and siliconized acrylic caulks are not effective when trying to seal ant entryways, because ants can break down these caulking treatments., Consider creating a barrier around your house or garden to prevent ants from entering. Scatter coffee grounds around the foundation of your house, along the perimeter of your garden, and along any sites where you have noticed ant trails or a lot of ant activity.Consider keeping mint or chili pepper plants around your house or planting them in your garden.These plants are known to keep intrusive ants at bay.
You could also lay down a ring of food grade diatomaceous earth around the perimeter of your house or garden.Sprinkle this powder near from your home’s foundation or garden, and try to sprinkle a ring around known anthills and nests.
Diatomaceous earth breaks down the ants’ exoskeleton and causes them to dehydrate. DE is non-toxic to humans, but try your best not to directly breathe in powder particles.Commercial insecticides can be used on the outside of your home, but bear in mind that insecticides are usually dangerous to humans, pets, and sometimes the environment., Since ants leave scented trails for other ants to follow, when you do find trails in your house, erase the scent with some soapy water. Simply create a solution of dish soap and water, and use a sponge to wipe away the trail as well as some of the surrounding area.That way, the ants will no longer have a scented trail to follow each other into your home.


You could also use vinegar to remove scented trails. Simply spray white vinegar over areas known for a lot of ant activity, and wipe down surfaces where you have seen ants before., Cloves are an extremely effect ant repellant, and can be placed in various areas around your house to help combat pesky ants.Leave whole cloves anywhere you have seen ants crawling around (countertops, baseboards, etc.). Along with cloves, there are a few other herbs and spices that can be left around your home or planted in your garden to repel ants:Cayenne pepper
Bay leavesPeppermint
Cinnamon
Garlic

, Along with spices and herbs, some natural foods and other ingredients are notorious for keeping ants away. Try sprinkling these various ingredients around entryways, other spaces where you have encountered ants, or your garden area. Some common natural repellants include:Coffee grounds
Cornmeal
Lemon juice
Cream of wheat

, Borax is a cleaning chemical that is poisonous to ants, but non-toxic to humans.To try and kill the ants at their source, make a Borax bait that the ants will flock to, and bring back to their nest.Mix one part corn syrup (or any sweet, sticky substance) with one part Borax, and spread the mixture on an index card.Place the index card in an area where you have witnessed a lot of ant activity. The ants will bring this sweet, poisonous mixture back to their colony, and it will slowly eliminate the ants.


Consider setting this bait at night, because ants tend to hunt for food during the night hours.You could also make a poison mixture with Borax and powdered sugar. Mix together 1 part Borax with 3 parts of powdered sugar.Fill small containers with this mixture (bottle caps, spoons, etc.), and place these containers around areas where ants may be entering your house.
If you have pets or children who could get into this powdered Borax mix, consider mixing 1 cup of warm with ½ cup of sugar, and 3 tablespoons of Borax. Soak cotton balls in this mixture, and set the cotton balls out in shallow dishes near known ant entry points. , Commercial bait traps eliminate ants much the same way as Borax traps, but they tend to work a bit faster (although they are still slow-acting), and can be more targeted to specific food preferences of your invading ant.For example, there are ant baits that are sugar based, grease based, and protein based depending on what kind of ant you are dealing with.


When in doubt for what kind of ant bait to use, consider getting one of each.If you find that the ants are not taking the bait, you may have to change the type of bait you are using, or relocate the bait to a more active area.When using bait, all other food competition must be removed from the area.This food competition could inhibit the effectiveness of the bait.
When the ants start feeding on the bait, leave them alone to feast and bring it back to their colony. After some time, you should see a reduced number of ants.

, If you are able to follow an ant trail back to a nest or anthill, consider pouring salty boiling water down the hill opening.You may have to use many containers of water, but this will be a surefire way to eliminate a large amount of intruding ants.

, Since ants love to feast on small food particles, don’t let dishes and other dirty utensils sit in your sink for an extended period of time.After washing dishes, wipe down the sink with a paper towel to be sure that you have removed any sweet residues from the sink surface.


Consider pouring a small amount of bleach or vinegar down the sink drain to help clear away any remaining food particles that could attract ants., Bleach, much like vinegar, erases ant’s pheromone trails and can help reduce the number of ants you find crawling around. Wipe down surfaces such as countertops, refrigerator tops, cabinets, and other areas to help keep ants at bay., Kitchen floors are perfect areas for ants to find small particles of food to take back to their colony. Be sure to sweep and mop your floor regularly (if not every night) with warm water and bleach to keep ants from crawling around underneath your feet.It doesn’t take much food bits or spill residues to attract ants and bring their friends along with them.

, Along with sweeping and mopping, vacuum any areas where food is eaten. This could mean living rooms, dining rooms, or basements. You want to pick up any small particles of food that could entice ants to come into your house and feast., Any sitting food or dripping juices in your garbage will immediately attract ants into your house. Be sure to take your garbage out everyday, and use strong, durable bags that are less likely to puncture and spill waste., Ants will search your house for food wherever they can find it, so it’s really important to keep food products stored and sealed tightly. Consider keeping sticky foods such as honey, molasses, and syrups in the refrigerator.Consider keeping baking goods (sugar, flour, etc.) and cereals in airtight containers or bags., Check around your house for any foundational wood pieces, shingles, or frames that might be starting to decay. Decaying wood is where a lot of ants like to nest and enter through, into homes.If you find any areas of decay, consider replacing those materials to better your chances of keeping ants out of your home.

","How to Make a ""No Kill"" Mouse Trap"," A kitchen paper towel or toilet tissue roll is ideal for this purpose.;
, This creates a flat surface at the base of the tube, while leaving a small tunnel for the mouse to scuttle through. The end result will appear like a ""D"" shape, as pictured.

, Something like peanut butter is ideal.

, Make sure that the end with the bait is hanging into the air.

, The trash can should be lined or clean so that you're not introducing additional germs to the creature.


Leave this set up overnight.
You may also wish to crumple up some paper towel or newspaper to create a soft layer in the bottom of the trash can. Make it a shallow layer – too high and the mouse may use it to climb to a height that it can use to jump out of the trash can.

, The mouse (or other furry creature) should be attracted by the bait and run into the tube trap. The trap will tip the mouse into the trash can; you'll know that it worked if the cardboard tube is in the trash can in the morning.


Wear gloves when handling the creature, or gently prod it into a smaller container using something like a shoehorn. Another alternative is to carry the entire trash can outside and tip it on its side and let the mouse run free.

Use both sugar and protein-based ant traps.,
Make a sugar-based trap.,
Make a protein-based trap.,
Use caution with homemade bait traps.,
Buy ant traps.",How to Get Rid of Odorous Ants1," Sugar-based traps use sugar to attract ants. Protein-based traps use a protein source (usually combined with a sugar source) to attract ants. When dealing the odorous ants, the best option is to use a mixture of both sugar and protein-based ant traps., Mix two tablespoons of mint jelly and 1/4 teaspoon of boric acid powder. Place a dollop of the mixture on a small piece of wax paper and place the trap in an area with a high volume of odorous ant traffic. Place another trap near the entrances the ants are using to come into the house.If you don’t have mint jelly, you could use another jelly as long as it is not sugar-free.
You can obtain boric acid at your local pharmacy or hardware store.
After a few days, the ants will no longer be interested in the sugar-based trap. Discard old traps and replace them with a new batch every few days.

, Since odorous ants are also attracted to protein or grease-based traps, place a protein-based trap alongside each sugar-based trap. You can easily make a protein-based trap by mixing two tablespoons of honey, two tablespoons of peanut butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of boric acid powder. Just as you did with the sugar-based trap, scoop a bit of the bait on some wax paper and leave it near the odorous ants’ points of entry.Replace trap every other day or so, since it will not be appealing to the ants after it dries up.

, If you have pets or young children at home, keep a baby gate between the ant bait and your child or pet. Store the powdered boric acid on a high shelf where your pet or child cannot access it., If you don’t have the appropriate materials on hand to craft an ant trap of your own, there are plenty of options available at your local big box or grocery store. Many ant traps are meant to be used against specific ant species, so look for one that is designed to be most effective against odorous ants.While the exact directions for use vary according to manufacturer, you can generally snap off one of the ant traps from the packet and place it near the ants’ point of entry or their trail.
Consult manufacturer instructions before use.

"
"
Sprinkle a powder barrier in front of the ants’ point of entry.,
Apply a scented liquid to the area where the ants are.,
Place cucumber slices around areas with ant activity.,
Use mint tea bags to discourage odorous ants.,
Spray essential oils near areas of ant activity.",How to Get Rid of Odorous Ants2," Once you’ve identified the point at which the ants are entering your home, there are many substances that you can use to discourage them from doing so. For instance, sprinkling a thin line of salt or talcum powder across the crack where the ants are coming in can force them to abandon that particular area.Other powdered products that might help include:baby powder
cornmeal
black pepper
baking sodacinnamon
chalk powder
diatomaceous earth
dried mint

, Ants are averse to several strong scents, including vinegar, perfume, and lemon juice. Fill a small ramekin with one or two tablespoons of one of these products. Place it near the area where the ants are most active. Place another ramekin of the product near the crack where the ants are coming into your home.Alternately, dab a cloth with one of these products and wipe down the areas with significant odorous ant activity.You could also create a solution by mixing equal parts water and vinegar (or water and lemon juice), then spraying it in the area where the odorous ants are.You could use white or apple cider vinegar.

, Slice the skin off the cucumber. Use a vacuum to suck up any odorous ants that you see, then drag a few cucumber slices across the trail they were using. Place a handful of cucumber slices near the odorous ants’ entry point.Repeat every few days, or when you see the odorous ants return.

, If you drink mint tea, place a used tea bag near the cracks or gaps through which the odorous ants are entering your home. Place a few others along odorous ant trails., Like strong-smelling lemon and vinegar, odorous ants despise many essential oils. The most effective essential oils are cinnamon, lemon, and peppermint. Simply spray a mixture of water and essential oil on the areas where the ants are entering your home and along the areas.While the exact amount of essential oil you will need depends on the concentration of oil you’ve obtained, you can generally mix the essential oil of you choice with water in a 1:99 ratio. In other words, you might mix half a teaspoon of cinnamon essential oil with 49.5 teaspoons of water.
Some essential oils are not appropriate for use around pets and children. Consult the manufacturer instructions on your essential oil bottle before use.

"
"
Clean your house.,
Make food inaccessible to the ants.,
Use an ant spray.,
Block ants from entering your home.,
Consult a professional.",How to Get Rid of Odorous Ants3," Pay special attention to the kitchen, where odorous ants are most likely to be found scavenging for crumbs and food. Wipe down your counters with soapy water, then sweep the floor. Follow up by mopping with a soapy water mixture. Wash the dishes as soon as possible, and empty your bin regularly.Soap will eliminate pheromone trails, disrupting odorous ants’ ability to navigate your home.
Soap also weakens ants’ exoskeletons, causing dehydration and death.

, Food left out on counters or in the sink will attract odorous ants. When preparing food, use what you need, then replace it immediately in the fridge. Use airtight containers or resealable bags for uneaten crackers, desserts, and breads.If you have a large amount of some foodstuff that cannot be transferred to a resealable container (a large bag of potato crisps, for instance), seal the container as well as you can and place it high on a shelf or on top of your refrigerator.
Covering pans and plates with tinfoil will not be enough to prevent odorous ant access.

, Aerosol ant sprays will kill odorous ants either on the spot or a short time after exposure. Instructions for use vary with the specific product you use, but generally, you can simply aim the nozzle of the can at the odorous ants or their entry point, then push down briefly on the can’s actuator (the “button” on top of the can).Some sprays can be harmful for pets and children. Consult manufacturer directions before using an aerosol ant spray.
If possible, obtain an ant spray designed for maximum efficacy against odorous ants.

, Trace the ant trail back to its point of origin and try to block it. For instance, if odorous ants are coming in through your window casings or a small crack beneath your kitchen counter, seal it by applying a line of caulk or an extra layer of paint to the area., If all your homemade and store-bought remedies have not enabled you to get rid of odorous ants, it might be time to bring in someone with more experience. Contact your local exterminator. Look for an exterminator who has dealt specifically with odorous ants. Be warned, though -- exterminators are expensive, often charging $400 to $1,000 to eliminate ants.Most exterminators will treat odorous ants with professional-grade insecticides.
A good exterminator will also help you identify home modifications that can prevent future odorous ant invasions.

However, be aware that raccoons can and do chew through plastic bins.If you're not sure what bin to choose, ask a knowledgeable salesperson to help you – be sure to mention that it must be raccoon-proof. Also, special commercial raccoon locks for bins can be bought.

Never leave your trash can exposed by leaving the lid off! That is an invitation to foraging.;
, Alternatively, you can use a chain and lock – raccoons aren't smart enough (yet) to pick a lock!


For a lid that doesn't lock in place, attach plastic hose pipe or tubing all around the edge of the lid so that it creates a seal when fitted onto the bin. Cut a piece of rubber tubing or hose pipe along one side and slip it over the rim of your trash can. This will create a tight seal for the lid and make it difficult for raccoons to pry off.Tie the lid of your trash can to the can with a rope or bungee cord secured around the handles. Wrapping the bungee cord all the way around the bin on two sides will put off the most intrepid raccoons., The only problem with this method is the heaviness of the item. If members of the household have trouble lifting it up, they're likely to stop taking out the garbage, so bear this in mind and only use this method if those who use the trash can are still able to get to the trash can easily.

, Alternatively, place ammonia-soaked cloths inside the trash can or pour ammonia in neat. Ammonia smells like urine to a raccoon, making it highly offensive to them.You can also spray other areas where raccoons seem to congregate, to discourage them from entering your yard in the first place.

, Raccoons will not like the taste of almost any type of commercial repellent product.


If you do not wish to use repellent granules, you can use hot pepper or cayenne pepper instead.
Other suitable repellents include oil of mustard and naphtha flakes.Note that the use of naphtha flakes, naphthalene mothballs, etc. may be illegal in your area as they are possible carcinogens; check local regulations.

, Raccoons prefer darkness and might be deterred by a sudden bright light. A 100 watt bulb is a good choice for the lighting level.If possible, place a radio near your trash can. Set it to an all-news or talk station. The sound of human voices might deter raccoons from coming near your trash cans.You can use a low level volume and gradually increase it if needed.

, If no animal can get in without a human opening a door, then the trash cans will be left undisturbed.

Set up motion-activated lights or sprinklers.Place motion-activated devices near the perimeter of your house, at the front of your property, around fruit trees, or on any other spots where possums frequent.,
Scatter dog or cat fur.,
Spread something that smells potent.,
Apply a chemical repellent.",How to Get Rid of Possums1,"


Motion-activated devices are triggered once the possum crosses the sensor, and once these devices turn on, they may frighten many possums away.
Motion-activated sprinklers tend to be slightly more effective than motion-activated lights. Lights are enough to frighten away skittish possums that are afraid of humans, but water sprinklers work better with possums that are a little more mature and a little harder to startle.;
, The smell of a potential predator might be enough to deter many possums from hanging around.


Do not let your dog or cat roam free through the yard for the purpose of scaring away possums. They could get into a fight with aggressive possums or other dangerous animals.
Collect pet hair after brushing your dog or cat. Place the hair in small mesh bags and hang them or scatter them around areas at which possums frequently gather.

, Ammonia, mothballs, and garlic are all scents that possums tend to flee from.


Pour a small amount of ammonia into a coffee can with a lid. Place a rag inside the ammonia and bring one end up through a hole cut into the lid. The rag will act as a wick to disperse the fumes. Place one of these containers in every area where possums gather.
Scatter mothballs around any area where you have noticed possum activity. You can contain the mothballs in a mesh bag, or you can scatter them around individually.
Place a clove of crushed garlic in any area that you want neighborhood possums to avoid. Crushed garlic is better than whole garlic since crushing it first allows more of the scent to escape.

, Chemical repellents can be applied to gardens, flowerbeds, or the base of a structure.


Follow the instructions on the repellent to apply it safely. Most repellents consist of a powder that is sprinkled over the desired area.
Different repellents use different ingredients, but predator urine is often one element of it.

Keep your home clean.,
Apply peppermint oil.,
Use dried snake feces.,
Zap mice with ultrasonic sounds.,
Use a commercial, organic deterrent.,
Get a cat.,
Put your trash cans far from your home.,
Promote the nesting of birds of prey in your yard.",How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally1," Many times mice are drawn into homes on the search for food. If there is nothing to eat, mice will be less likely to stay. Keep all food stored properly in airtight containers or in places that are safe from mouse attack., Peppermint oil is a natural deterrent. The smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it. It also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning. It also gives the house a lovely smell, and is not toxic, unlike many synthetic chemical treatments. You can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores.Place a drop or two on a cotton ball.
Place a cotton ball under or near your garbage can to deter mice from getting into it.
Place the cotton balls in areas where mice are likely to enter your house, by doorways, or heat vents, etc.
Peppermint oil cotton balls need to be replaced after 5-7 days, depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it.
Try growing peppermint plants near the entryways. You can use the mint in cooking, as well as it serving a deterrent purpose.

, Visit a local reptile center, zoo, or pet store and ask for some dried snake poo. You can also sometimes find someone who owns a pet snake. Place near entrances and in places where mice seem to go. This will keep mice away.Be sure to keep the feces out of the reach of children and pets.

, There are electronic units sold that emit an ultrasonic beeping sound that rodents hate. They should be available at your local home improvement store or online.


These work only on a single line of sight, so you need to know the exact path the mice are taking.
The units may only work for a short time because mice can become used to them., Many companies that specialize in organic garden and home products make mice repellents that are better for the environment than traditional poisons. Many of these products use natural ingredients, such as peppermint, that are known to be disagreeable to mice. They will not kill mice but they should keep them out of areas where the product is applied.


These products should be available at your local gardening or home improvement center. If you want a specific product, try doing a online search to see where it is available locally.

, A house cat can take care of the problem. Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse. Just be aware, not all cats have enough energy, interest or training to hunt mice. Kittens typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser. Well-food indoor kitties might just see the mouse as a toy, and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless.


Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter, and generally do not test for this. Sometimes this information is available, but usually not.
While many mousers are great pets as well, not all are. ""Barn cats"" may not be socialized well with humans, although used to hunting mice for food.
Even if you do not have a cat, you can use used kitty litter to deter mice. Place tubs of used kitty litter around entrances of the house. The mice will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy.
If you have a large infestation, a cat may not be enough to totally get rid of it. However, once you eliminate the infestation, a cat will probably prevent reinfestation., Mice smell garbage and get attracted to your house. If you keep the cans away from the house, they are less likely to take up residence in your home.

, Build a shelter box in your garden to attract some onto your property. This may take some time, but it's worth the effort if you can attract a wild mouse eater to your yard.Make sure the shelter box has no nails or safety hazards.
A barn owl is the best. A family of barn owls can eat many mice in a night! However, you might attract other types of owls or birds of prey with your nesting box.

Remove food sources.,
Eliminate outdoor cover.Even though possums will not make dens in outdoor covering, they may find it an appealing place to hide.",How to Get Rid of Possums2," Possums are attracted to yards and homes where food is plentiful. By removing food sources, you will make your property dramatically less appealing.


Do not intentionally provide food for the possums. You may think that you are doing a good deed, but possums fed by humans gradually lose their fear of humans and are more likely to become aggressive when food is not given to them.
Prevent possums from getting into your trash. Keep the lid of your garbage cans closed by securing it with bungee cords, chains, ropes, or weights. You could also by garbage cans with lids that have clamps to keep them on. Securing side handles to stakes driven into the ground will prevent the trash bins from tipping over.Feed your pets indoors. If this is not possible, feed your pets outdoors in the late morning or middle of the afternoon. Remove all sources of food and water before dusk settles in, and keep pet food away from pet doors or other openings to the house.
Keep food in secure compost containers. Do not use open compost piles. Instead, keep the compost in covered compost structures or covered worm boxes.
Clean barbecue grills and grease traps after you use them.
Pick up fruit that drops from trees or bushes. Better yet, avoid having plants that produce appetizing fruit.
Avoid laying out bird seed. If you do provide bird seed, try to lay some out in the late morning or mid-afternoon and only spread enough to feed the birds for that single day. Alternatively, fill bird feeders with seed and transfer them inside each night at dusk.

,


Mow tall grass, especially around houses and other buildings.
Remove piles of wood, grass clippings, or other debris. This also includes items like overturned planters or barrels.

Use a live-holding cage trap.Live-holding traps capture possums without hurting or killing them.,
Place the trap in the possum's path.,
Set the trap.,
Monitor the trap.,
Release the animal from the trap.",How to Get Rid of Possums3," They are generally preferable to quick-kill traps.


Note that in many states and municipalities, using quick-kill traps to dispose of possums may be restricted or prohibited. Live-holding traps are rarely banned, however.
Find out from your municipality if there are any restrictions on trapping. Some cities may require you to obtain a permit. Others may have specific demands about where to release the animal and who can do so.

, Setting it near the suspected den is ideal, but any area that frequently suffers damage due to a possum is an acceptable location to choose.


Sit the trap on soft ground or place it on plywood if setting it on a hard surface. The trapped possum may attempt to dig its way out, and placing the trap on a protective surface will prevent it from damaging its paws.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions to bait and set the trap.


Set the trap at dusk to increase your odds of catching a possum, which is a nocturnal animal. Close an empty trap at dawn to prevent the accidental trapping of a diurnal animal.
Each cage trap is set in a slightly different manner, but most have a trigger rod or knob that must be pulled or twisted out when opening the door of the cage. When the animal steps inside, it triggers this rod and snaps the door closed. Follow the specific manufacturer's instructions that come with your cage trap for more specific directions.
Place a tennis ball inside the trap to give the animal a way of venting frustration inside the cage. Doing so may cause it to become tired, making it easier to release later.
Use appropriate bait. Fruit, berries, vegetables, raw egg, peanut butter, and sardines are attractive bait options for possums.

, Watch the trap continually so that you will know as soon as possible whether you are successful in your efforts.


Once the possum is captured, move the trap to a quiet spot and cover it with a tarp until you are ready to release it. Use thick gloves or a long pole to prevent yourself from getting scratched through the cage.

, Exercise caution when releasing the animal or call a wildlife professional.


When releasing the animal, point the opening in the direction you want the animal to run off in. Stand at the opposite end of the door and tap the trap with your foot or a long pole until the animal runs out.
If you suspect that the possum may bite you, attach a rope to the door before setting it so that you can open it from a distance.
Know your local laws concerning releasing possums and other trapped animals. Some areas may have few, if any, restrictions, in which case, you should drive the possum several miles away from your property before releasing it into a wooded area. Other areas may require that you release the possum on your property or hire a professional to release the possum.

"
Cover your foundation vents.One of the easiest ways for possums to sneak into your home is through the dryer vent or other vents along the foundation.,
Trim tree branches.,
Protect low decks.,
Create a temporary one-way exit for any trapped possums to escape through.,
Seal any other open spaces.",How to Get Rid of Possums4,"


Block possums from sneaking in through these openings by covering them with slotted metal vent covers. These covers are screwed onto the vent and have just enough room for steam and smoke to escape but not enough for possums to sneak through.

, Possums can sneak onto the roof if tree branches or other tall plants are positioned nearby.


Tree branches should be trimmed a minimum of 10 ft (3.05 m) away from the roof.
Do not place climbing plants near the house, especially not near the eaves areas.

, Possums have been known to hide out under low decks, so these should also be protected with some form of metal barrier.


Use 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) grid screening or solid metal flashing.
Dig a trench around the perimeter of the deck. The hole should be at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep.
Place the screening or flashing in the trench. The barrier should extend from the bottom of the hole to the bottom or underside of the deck.
Fill the trench in with dirt, packing it down in place to prevent the screening from being jolted or wiggled around.
Attach the top of the screening to the deck. Nails or fence post staples usually work best.

, If you suspect that possums might be trapped below your deck, provide them with a temporary means of escape.


Instead of sealing up the final section of screening, use 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) grid screening to form a funnel.
The large end should be big enough for a possum to fit through and should be attached to the barrier using nails or fence post staples.
The small end should extend away from the building and should have a hole roughly 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) in diameter. This will allow possums to squeeze their way out but not squeeze their way in.
Keep this passage open for a few days to one week before sealing up the hole.

, Your home may have other open spaces that will appear inviting to a possum looking for a warm home or a free meal.


Attic vents and chimneys should be covered with 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) grid screening. You could also use insect screening over the vents or you have a chimney cap installed.
Repair any holes in deck lattices, window screens, or door screens.
If you live in a mobile home, cover the open space below the home with wire cloth. Make sure that the barrier extends from the ground all the way up to the bottom of the trailer. Cement block and wood lattice can also be used.
Lock or cover pet doors at night.

Find the location where the mice are entering.Sometimes there will be greasy stains, and there will almost always will be feces near an entry point.,
Block up any holes in interior walls.,
Seal the exterior entry points.,
Check entry points again.",How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally2," There is also a characteristic odor.


Mark the spot with caulk if it was hard to find, so that you can find it again easily.

, Start with the interior walls, as it's best to leave a way out for the mice. They may leave your home or apartment for easier pickings elsewhere. Use spackle or caulk to seal holes that are relatively small. If you have larger holes that can't be fixed with caulk or spackle, you will need to patch your plaster or drywall. This is a bigger job but important, as a mouse can surely fit through a bigger hole.
Make sure baseboards are secured and do not have gaps, so that mice can't squeeze out from behind them.
If trapped within the walls, mice may chew new holes. This is why it is important to give them a chance to leave before sealing up the exterior entry point.

, The usual recommendation is to fill holes with steel wool. Unfortunately, steel wool rusts and thus is not a permanent solution. Instead, use green kitchen pads, cut to the right size, or copper scouring pads. The pads must be secured to the sides of the hole or the mice will eventually pull them out. Large holes will need to be repaired.Once you are sure that the interior walls are secure, seal any holes on the exterior of your building. You may use plastic scouring pads, but in some cases walls may need tuck-pointing or other repairs.

, After a couple of days, look for evidence of any continuing mouse activity. If there is any, check the holes that you sealed, and look for more holes. Seal as needed.


Clean up the area around the entrance. Remove feces and disinfect the area to get rid of the smell. Use a solution of one part bleach and ten parts water to accomplish this."

Try a commercial live-catch trap.,
Create a homemade humane trap.,
Lure the mouse into a container it can't get out of.,
Throw a towel over the mouse.",How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally3," There are various traps that you might like to try using, all of which allow you to set the mouse free. The most common traps catch the mouse in a box that it can get in but not out of. This is a humane way to catch mice.Once you catch them, you will need to release them at least 1 mile (1.6 km) from your home, perhaps in a heavily wooded area to give them somewhere else to go.
Killing or removing rodents alone will not typically solve the problem, nor keep mice gone for long. When animals are killed or removed, more will move in to use available resources. In fact, killing or removing mice can actually result in a temporary spike in the food supply, causing remaining rodents to breed. Still, it is better to reduce the population rather than give up.

, Use a glass bowl and a coin. Invert a large glass bowl with some chocolate stuck to the inside of the bowl. Balance the bowl at an angle with the large coin on the edge, edge to edge. Leave it in an area where you know the mouse roams.


The mouse will enter under the bowl and reach up for the chocolate, upsetting the balance. The bowl will fall and trap the mouse underneath.
Remove the mouse and place it well away from the house.

, You can set up a 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium with food in it. Put the aquarium in a spot that the mouse has been seen in, ideally in a place that blocks the mouse's usual path. Place something next to the aquarium that the mouse can crawl up, like a stack of books.

The mouse should try to get the food and jump in to the aquarium. Once inside, the mouse should be trapped by the high walls.
Check the trap frequently.
Put a top on the aquarium if you find a mouse in there. Release the mouse well away from the house.

, It will stay under the towel for only a short time, so you need to act quickly. Put an inverted waste-paper basket over the towel. Tuck the exposed bits of towel under the basket so it is in contact with the ground. Slide an LP record or large piece of cardboard under the basket and towel. Carefully turn the basket over the right way, with the cardboard tight against the lip of the basket.


Take the whole thing outside and walk (or run!) the basket, mouse, and towel as far from your home as possible.
Once you're far from your home, release the mouse.

Understand what you're dealing with.,
Call a local beekeeper.,
Call an exterminator.,
Trap the bees outside.,
Use pesticides.,
Clean up afterwards.,
Wait it out.,
Call a beekeeper.,
Relocate them.,
Use pesticides.,
Use dish soap and water.,

Fill wall cavities.,
Remove any traces of honey or beeswax.,
Use natural bee repellents.",How to Remove Bees," Before you take any action, it's important to make sure that it is definitely bees you're dealing with, and not wasps or hornets. Bees are valuable pollinators and are not aggressive or dangerous (unless someone in your family has an allergy), so killing them should be avoided if possible.


You can identify bees by examining their appearance (this is easiest if you can find a dead bee). Look for hairs on the body - all bees have hairs, whereas wasps tend to have smooth exteriors.
Also try to get a look at the nest. Honey bees build their nests out of wax, in a honeycomb formation, whereas other stinging insects tend to construct their nests out of wood fiber or mud.
Honey bees tend to be most active in spring, when they are collecting pollen. Watch for signs of them flying back and forth from the nest.;
, If you have confirmed the presence of honey bees and have identified the location of their nest (they prefer enclosed spaces like wall cavities, roofs and chimneys), your first step should be to call a local beekeeper. Not only will they be happy to remove the bees but you could also be saving an endangered species. Honey bees are disappearing rapidly, and without them to pollinate, every plant on Earth may be affected negatively.


Beekeepers will often physically remove both the bees and their hive, without needing to exterminate them. They may do this for free or they may charge a fee, depending on the location of the nest and the effort involved in removing them. In some places, they might even pay you.
The beekeeper will usually cut out the honeycombs with the brood inside and place them in frames, which the beekeeper can later transfer to his/her own hive box.
However, if the nest is difficult to reach, the beekeeper may use a special vacuum to suck up the bees without killing them.
If the nest is behind a wall, you may need to call a contractor to knock down a portion of the wall to give the beekeeper access to the bees. As the homeowner, you will need to cover the cost of this, and any repairs that follow.
The bees are likely to become agitated as the beekeeper is doing his/her job. Therefore it's recommended that you keep your family, especially any children or pets, inside until the job is complete. The beekeeper will be protected by their beekeeping suit., In some circumstances, local beekeepers will be unwilling or unable to remove the nest. They may not have room for the bees, or the effort required in removing the bees may not be worth their time. If this is the case, you will need to call a professional exterminator, who will generally kill the bees before removing them.


Exterminating bees can be a difficult job and might involve a hefty fee. The exterminator will usually use a pesticide to kill the bees. However, it is important to be aware that this will usually only kill the bees near the surface of the nest, and new pupa will emerge within a couple of days, so you will need the exterminators to return two or three times over the next couple of weeks in order to completely remove the bees.
Normally, the exterminators will only kill the bees, they will not remove the dead bees or the nest. Rather than just sealing up the wall cavity, it is very important to completely remove any traces of the nest, otherwise the bees and the honey from the combs could start to rot, producing a very bad smell and potentially damaging the drywall.
Remember that the dead bees, the honey and the nest have all been treated with pesticides, so you will need to handle them as hazardous waste when disposing of them. Then you will need to thoroughly clean the area with warm soapy water, and repaint if necessary.

, Another option for removing the bees without killing them is to trap them outside the nest. However, this is a time-consuming process, so it should only be undertaken by homeowners who are not in a rush to get rid of the bees.


To trap the bees, you will need an exit cone made from screen wire. The wide end of the cone should be secured over the entrance to the hive, while the narrow end should have an exit hole with a diameter no larger than 3/8"". This allows the bees to exit the cone, but prevents them from getting back in.
For this method to work, it is imperative that you seal up all other entrances (such as holes and cracks) leading to the hive, otherwise the bees will simply find another way in.
To ensure that the trapped bees survive, you will need to put a second, small hive (provided by a beekeeper) as close to the exit cone as possible. This small hive is known as a ""nuc"" and contains a new queen, some honey and a small number of worker bees. When the trapped bees find that they can no longer return to their original nest, they will join this new nest instead.
Depending on the size of the original hive, it may take up to two months for the majority of bees to exit. The original queen will not abandon her brood, so you will need to inject some pesticide into the wall to kill her and any remaining bees. , If you aren't able to enlist the help of a beekeeper and don't want to pay an exterminator, you can get rid of the bees yourself using pesticides.


Find an aerosol pesticide containing pyrethroids. Don't worry if it's intended for wasps and hornets -- it will work just as well on bees, killing them upon contact.
Cover yourself up in protective clothing and spray the pesticide into the hive (following the label's instructions), from any available access points. Do this in the late evening, when the bees are less active.
Keep in mind that the pesticide will only kill the bees it comes in direct contact with, so it won't have any effect on the developing pupa which have yet to hatch. Therefore, you will need to repeat the spraying process two or three weeks later to ensure that the newly hatched bees are also exterminated.
If you don't want to use an aerosol, you could also use a motor blower to blow an insecticidal dust like Sevin into the hive. The dust will not kill the bees immediately, but the worker bees will track the dust into the center of the hive, eventually killing off the entire hive., Once the bees have been removed, it is very important that you remove the hive and clean up any honey or dead bees before sealing the area.


If the honey and dead bees are not removed, they can start to rot or ferment causing a very bad odor that may fill your home. The unattended honey may also seep through drywall, causing a lot of damage to your home.
In addition, the smell of old honey and wax can attract new swarms to set up their hive in the same location, so it's important to remove the old one and seal off the area in order to avoid going through the whole bee removal process again the following year.
In order to remove a large hive, you may need to tear down a wall -- this is a pain, but remember that the cost of fixing the wall is less than the potential cost of replacing damaged drywall. Clean up the old hive, then paint over the area.
The final step is to fill in the cavity (expandable foam insulation is recommended) and seal up any holes or cracks in the wall where the bees could potentially reenter. It's also advisable to inspect the area periodically throughout the year, to make sure all of the entrances remain sealed., If the bees have set up residence in a tree, fence or other location somewhere near your houses, you should consider just leaving it alone and allowing bee season to pass.


Bees are not typically very aggressive (unless they feel under threat) so if you leave them alone to go about their business, you shouldn't have any problems.
When the cold winter weather sets in, the worker bees will dies and the new queens will leave. Then you can safely remove the nest.Of course, this is only possible if the bees are not interfering with your use of the garden and if no one in your family has a bee allergy.

, If you can find a local beekeeper who is willing to help you with your bee problem, they may be able to save most of the bees by transferring them to a hive box. This can be done in several ways:


If the hive is easily accessible, the beekeeper will be able to simply cut out the comb containing the brood and bees and place it directly into a hive box.
Alternatively, if the hive is trapped in a section of tree or fence, a hive body can be placed over the entrance and the bees will crawl into it by themselves.
Finally, if the hive is in a difficult to reach the spot, the beekeeper may place an exit cone (like the one described in the section above) over the entrance to the hive. This will trap the worker bees outside. A hive body will then be hung in a nearby location, which the trapped-out bees will eventually join.

, If the bees have set up their hive inside a tree, one possible option is just to relocate them by carefully cutting out the tree section containing the bees and placing it in a secluded location, away from your house.


If you decide to go down this route, you should do so as early in the year as possible, before the number of bees significantly increases.
Make sure to cover yourself up fully in protective clothing, as the bees will probably become aggravated by the sawing or chopping near their hive.
Choose the new location of the hive carefully -- don't place it on somebody else's land without their permission, and don't put it anywhere that someone might accidentally stumble across it., If you do not have the time or resources to remove the bees or relocate them, you may have no choice but to exterminate them. This can easily be achieved using aerosol or spray pesticides.


Spray the aerosol or sprinkle the insecticide dust into the entrance to the hive. Do this late in the evening when the bees are least active, while wearing protective clothing.
You will need to repeat this process once or twice more over the coming weeks, as the hive's pupa are protected by a layer of wax so you will need to wait until they hatch before you can kill them with the pesticide.

, If you are opposed to the use of pesticides but still want to kill off the bees, you can attempt to do so using a solution of soap and water. The soapy water is able to penetrate the bees protective waxy surface, essentially drowning the bees.


Mix a solution of one part dish soap and four parts water and pour it into a spray bottle. Cover yourself head to toe in protective clothing (as the water will not kill the bees immediately and they will probably become agitated) and begin to spray the soapy water into the hive and at any visible bees.
The soapy water will only kill the bees it comes in direct contact with, so you will need to repeat the process several times over to target as many bees as possible., The best way to prevent bees from setting up inside the walls of your home is to prevent them from entering in the first place. You can do this by inspecting your exterior wall for any holes or cracks that are large enough to insert a pencil through, then sealing them up with caulk., You should also fill up any wall cavities -- this way, even if the bees manage to get in, they won't have space to set up a hive. The best way to fill in wall cavities quickly and easily is to use expandable foam.

, As mentioned before, bees are attracted to sites where other bees have previously set up their hives, as they can smell traces of honey or beeswax.


Therefore, it's important to remove these substances completely after you've got rid of the hive.
If the hive was outdoors, you could use a power hose, if it was indoors, you could use strong cleaning products and possibly paint over the area afterwards.

, Another simple way to prevent a future bee infestation is to use natural bee repellents to deter them from building a hive near your home. Try one of the following:



Citronella: The scent of citronella is believed to ward off bees and wasps. You can take advantage of this fact by growing citronella plants in your garden, or by burning citronella candles or incense outdoors during bee season.

Cucumber peels: The peelings from a cucumber are also believed to naturally repel bees. Simply sprinkle the cucumber peels over your lawn and any flower beds. This will deter the bees which also helping to fertilize your garden!

Sugar water: An alternative technique is to dissolve a couple of tablespoons of sugar in a basin of water and leave it out in your garden. The bees will be attracted to the sweet scent of the water (thinking it's honey) and end up drowning in the water. It also helps if you add a little dish soap to the water, as this breaks down the wax covering the bee's body and makes it drown faster."

Seal off the attic.,
Create an exit.,
Draw them out.",How to Get Rid of Squirrels in the Attic1," Patch up holes and cover spaces that are wide enough for a squirrel to get through.


Place a chimney cap or wire mesh fencing over your chimney. (Note UK domestic regulations apply to chimney terminal guards. Please seek advice of compitant persons.)
Cover any vents with wire mesh fencing.
Patch up all chewed-out holes leading to the outside of the home, except for one. You will need at least one hole to fashion an exit for the squirrels, but this hole must be covered a couple of weeks after the problem stops.
Also make sure to secure any openings between the attic and the rest of your home. A panic-stricken squirrel may find its way further into your home if it senses that the attic is no longer a welcome place.;
, Create a funnel out of a sheet of metal or fine wire mesh. Attach this funnel to the remaining hole in your attic and direct the narrow end outside. (UK regulations state no combustible materials to be introduced into the chimney, seek advice of compitant persons)


The wide end of the funnel should be placed over the hole on the outside of your home. It should be roughly 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38 cm) wide.
Make sure that the funnel is about 1 foot (30.5 cm) long.
The narrow end of the funnel should extend out and should be roughly as wide as the hold in the woodwork, if not slightly smaller.
A squirrel that finds its way out of this funnel will usually be unable to find its way back in.

, Make the space outside the funnel appealing by placing food, like peanuts or apple slices, near the narrow mouth of the funnel.


This may not be necessary since squirrels will likely leave the area on their own to gather food. Placing a food source nearby may encourage them to evacuate sooner, however.

Disinfect surfaces where the mouse has traveled.",How to Catch a Mouse," Mouse traps come in many types, including traditional spring-loaded traps, electric traps, and glue traps. They vary in their method of eliminating mice but are handled in basically the same way. These can all be purchased at most hardware stores and online. Multiple traps are useful for ensnaring a single mouse, but mice spread quickly so you may have more than one in your home.Avoid poison. The mouse will eat the poison and die somewhere hidden. In addition, the poison can be eaten by children and animals.
Glue traps are the least humane. The mouse will either starve to death or chew off its own leg and die in an unknown location.;
, Forget the idea that mice eat cheese. While cheese can work, mice eat grains, fruit, and seeds in the wild. Peanut butter is a common household foodstuff that mice love. High-fat, high-protein, and sugary foods also attract them, such as bacon and chocolate. The stronger the object smells and the softer it is, the more likely the mouse will be to respond., Be careful not to use too much bait. Keep your bait to the size of a pea and place it firmly inside the trap. Many people make the mistake of adding too much bait. On a spring trap, for example, this allows the mouse to eat without stepping onto the trap.It is best to bait the trap before you set it. In spring-loaded traps, for example, it’s easy to trigger the trap and have it snap closed on your fingers.
Keeping the bait thin can also force the mouse to work more to eat it. Peanut butter for instance when left in a thin coating will start to dry.

, Mice like enclosed dark spaces, such as in a cupboard or under furniture. They often stick near walls when scurrying about. You may find rat droppings or smell urine.

, Go back to where you found evidence of the mouse. Now push the trap all the way to the wall. The baited trigger part or opening should be in contact with the wall. For a standard spring trap, the mechanical part should be away from the wall. Mice run along the wall, so this is more likely to attract them and, if the trap is perpendicular to the wall, prevent them from triggering it prematurely., At a maximum of two or three feet (.6-.9 meters) away along the wall, set another trap. Repeat this in both directions until the high-traffic areas are covered. Of course, even for one mouse, multiple baited traps increase the likelihood of catching it. But if one mouse got in, another might have also and they reproduce quickly.


You may have multiple areas with a lot of mice traffic. Cover those areas too.

, Return often to see if the trap has been activated. If you’ve caught a mouse, you need to dispose of it quickly or else the mouse will start to decompose, creating an awful smell while attracting other pests and bacteria.

, Put on protective gloves and possibly a breathing mask. Throw disposable traps away and take them to the dumpster to avoid lingering smells in your home.When on a budget, traps can be reused. Scrub them thoroughly with soap and water while wearing disposable gloves. Throw the gloves away before resetting the traps.

, Be sure to wash your hands after handling the mouse and cleaning up your house. Pick up droppings with a paper towel, launder fabrics, and scrub surfaces with soap and water to avoid exposure to harmful bacteria.

, Save an empty cardboard tube from a roll of paper towels or toilet paper. Similar objects can be used as long as they’re big enough for the mouse to fit inside but also flimsy enough to not support the mouse’s weight.


Stores may also carry humane traps. Check at your hardware store or online.

, Run your fingers along the length of the tube on one side, pressing in as you go. When finished, the tube should be able to rest flat-side-down on a counter or table., Place bait on one end of the tube. A small dollop of peanut butter, some cracker crumbs, or a sliver of bacon will be enough to attract the mouse. Peanut butter works well because it sticks to the inside of the tube.

, Choose an edge that is a few feet off the ground but also has some free floor space under it. Place the tube flat-side-down with the baited end off the counter, then push the tube until it is half off the edge.If you’re having trouble getting the tube to stay still or balance, you can tape it lightly. Make sure the tape isn’t holding it tight enough that it won’t move when the mouse is inside.
If you do not have a table or counter that will work, you can instead construct a ramp up to the top of the bucket. Numerous objects, including cardboard or stacked wood, can be used as long as the ramp is sturdy enough to support the mouse’s weight.

, Find an empty container that will catch the mouse. Make sure the container is at least two feet tall or else the mouse may escape the trap.

, Your catching container goes directly under the baited end of the tube hanging off the table. When the mouse moves in to get the bait, its weight causes the tube to fall off the table and into the bucket., Come back at least once a day to see if the tube is in place, the bait has been eaten, or a mouse is in the bucket. Make adjustments, such as rebalancing the tube. If a mouse is caught, it must be moved soon or else it will starve. Starving mice will also eat one another.

, The mouse needs to be moved at least a mile (1.6 km) away. This prevents the mouse from returning to your home. To keep the mouse safe from predators, go no further than three miles (4.8 km). Find an area with cover, such as wooded areas, wood piles, or rocky ground and consider leaving food in such enclosed areas until the mouse can get established.Food options include uncooked oatmeal, peanuts, bird seed, and dry pet food.

, These surfaces may contain dangerous bacteria from the mouse. Pick up droppings using paper towels and scrub surfaces with soap and water. Don’t forget to wash your hands.

Do your research.,
Wear gloves when handling the trap, to keep your scent off it.,
Bait the trap with fruits or vegetables.Groundhogs particularly like cantaloupe, but if you have noticed anything disappearing especially quickly from your garden you can use this as well.The bait should be placed as far back as possible, to ensure that the groundhog must enter the cage fully in order to reach it.,
Camouflage the trap.,
Check the trap regularly.,
Release the groundhog.",How to Get Rid of Groundhogs1," Before you commit to trapping groundhogs in a live trap and releasing them elsewhere, be sure to check with your state’s wildlife agency about relocating trapped wildlife, as laws vary from state to state., Place it trap directly in front of the burrow entrance. It can be helpful to spray it with a hose and roll it in dirt to help camouflage it., Place a brick on top of the cage to help prevent the animal from rolling it over once trapped., Place sticks, dirt, and leaves inside and around it,and then set the trigger. This will vary slightly depending on the trap you purchased. Follow the instructions on the packaging carefully.








, A trapped groundhog is an unhappy groundhog, and the longer you leave it in the trap the more likely it is to injure itself in distress.Once you have trapped a groundhog, handle the cage only while wearing thick gloves, and hold it away from your body.

, Transport it at least 5 miles away from your property, to an area that will be attractive to it as a new home. While groundhogs are not usually aggressive, you should stand back as it exits the trap."
"
Set the right sort of trap.Use a small, live cage trap and set it in a corner or other ""safe,"" hidden area of the attic.,
Use the right sort of bait.Squirrels will not go near a trap unless you have some rather appetizing food inside.,
Relocate the squirrels.,
Keep the traps in place until all squirrels are out.",How to Get Rid of Squirrels in the Attic2,"


Squirrels are more likely to approach the trap if it is positioned out of the way rather than in the open middle of the attic.
Only use small traps since squirrels may panic and hurt themselves in larger traps. As a general guideline, a trap that is 6 inches (15.25 cm) by 6 inches (15.25 cm) by 18 inches (45.75 cm) is a good size.
Live cage traps can usually be purchased at hardware stores.
Each trap might be set a little differently, so you should read the instructions in order to set it up properly. Usually, you will need to position a swing bar trigger mechanism in a specific way so that it will be ""tripped"" as soon as the squirrel enters the cage, closing and locking the door.

,


Peanuts, peanut butter, walnuts, soda crackers, bread crusts, and apple slices are common choices.
Make sure that the food is placed far enough inside the cage to prevent the squirrels from grabbing it through the side.

, After trapping a squirrel, you should move it away from your home.


Moving the squirrel roughly 10 miles (16 km) away from your home and yard is usually enough to discourage squirrels from coming back.
Do not simply move the squirrel into your yard, unless municipal regulations only allow you to do that much. If you move the squirrel into your yard, it is likely to simply search for a way back inside.
Check the attic for baby squirrels. It is possible that you caught a mother squirrel, in which case, her babies will be helpless without her. Make sure to relocate baby squirrels along with the mother.
Wear thick, heavy gloves when releasing a squirrel from a trap. If it seems angry, release it from a distance by attaching a cord or rope to the release mechanism and pulling at it from far away.
Check your local laws about animal relocation. In most municipalities, it will not be a problem for you to trap and relocate squirrels. This may not be the case for every city or county, though.

, Leave the trap in place for at least an additional week after catching your last squirrel.


For best results, you should also patch up any entrances to your attic. Leave the trap in place for a week after catching the last squirrel before patching up holes. After blocking squirrels out, continue to keep the traps up for an additional few days to a week.

Consider carefully.,
Pick your moment.,
Locate all the burrow entrances.,
Read the instructions carefully.,
Light the cartridge.,
Place the pre-cut sod into the hole.",How to Get Rid of Groundhogs2," There is a good chance poison is not your best bet. Many people do not recommend using poison to deal with groundhogs, for a number of reasons.Before you resort to this method, consider bringing in a professional to assess the situation.


Killing animals with poison often inflicts great suffering. The groundhog may die slowly from internal bleeding, suffocation, or a number of other painful things, over the course of hours or days.It is not reliably effective. Most legal rodent poisons are designed to kill rats or mice, not woodchucks.Substances toxic to groundhogs are also toxic to humans and all other animals. Pets can and frequently do get into poison, and it can impact human health as well.The best-case scenario is that you will have toxic, rotting rodent bodies in your lawn to dispose of. The bodies will smell awful as they decay underground, and may attract other pests.The cleanup process can be time-consuming and dangerous., Groundhogs tend to go into hibernation in late September or early October, and their hibernation chamber is walled off, making them impossible to fumigate after this time., Place a piece of pre-cut sod beside each one.







, The process of igniting and placing the fumigation cartridge varies from brand to brand., Place it as deep inside the burrow as you can reach without throwing it. Use the end of a shovel to push it even farther.







, Stomp on it to create an airtight seal. Wait about five minutes, and watch the other holes to see if they are leaking smoke. If so, seal them with sod. Repeat until all the burrow entrances are tightly sealed.







"
"
Use lethal traps.,
Poison them.,
Shoot them.",How to Get Rid of Groundhogs3," This can often be an inhumane solution, as these traps do not always kill animals instantly. It can also be difficult to know which burrow entrance to place the trap outside, and the traps pose a significant danger to small children and pets. The specifics of setting lethal traps vary depending on the type you buy, and you should pay close attention to the instructions., This poses the same threats as traps and fumigation: the poison poses a danger to pets and people, and the bodies will be very hard to deal with if they die underground. If you decide to go this route, however, the process is very straightforward: place the poison in the areas of your garden that the groundhogs most like to frequent., This is generally only an option if you live in a removed area, and are an excellent marksman. A groundhog that has been shot but not killed can become much more dangerous and aggressive than it otherwise would be, and can present a real danger to children and pets if it gets away. As such, this is generally not a recommended way to deal with groundhogs.

"
Make your yard less attractive to groundhogs.,
Build a fence around your garden.,
Sprinkle the plants in your garden with Epsom salts.,
Scare them off.",How to Get Rid of Groundhogs4," The best way to deal with groundhogs is to be proactive, and keep them from making their home in your garden to begin with. If you already have a groundhog problem, come back to this section when you have gotten rid of them to help keep your property groundhog-free.


Harvest vegetables as early as possible.Remove brush and piles of rock from your yard to help make them feel more exposed, and trim back any overgrown foliage.Because they are prey animals, groundhogs feel most comfortable when they can easily take cover from predators.
Remove tree trunks they could use to grind down their teeth.Fill in abandoned burrows with rocks or gravel., Although they don’t look much like their squirrel cousins, groundhogs are surprisingly good climbers. To be effective at keeping them out, a fence should be made of wire with openings no larger than 3 inches. They should measure 3 or 4 feet above ground level, go at least 2 foot deep into the ground,and bend out awkwardly at the top to make climbing difficult; if possible, create an “L” shape underground for maximum effectiveness.







, This will make them taste bad to groundhogs. The salts will wash off in the rain, however, and need to be reapplied.







, If groundhogs think your yard is frequented by predators, they will be less likely to set up shop there. If you have a cat, sprinkle small piles of used cat litter strategically around your garden. If you do not have a cat, ammonia-soaked rags can be used to similar effect (the groundhogs will mistake the smell of ammonia for urine). Ammonia can damage your lawn, so if this is a concern you should put the rags on top of stones or pieces of wood.You can also buy a number of chemical repellents for this purpose, though there is some debate about how effective these really are.

",How to Make a Wasp Trap," (The neck is the cone part of the bottle including the cap.)






;
,, Keep in mind that you will need to take them apart often to switch out the bait and remove dead wasps.








, It should not reach the opening of the bottle––the wasps should have to completely enter the trap in order to access the bait. You can also do this before you attach the two pieces together. Some bait ideas include:









Meat - This is the best choice in the spring and late winter because wasps are making nests and laying eggs, so they're searching for high protein food; you may even catch a queen this way, in which case the wasps will relocate their nest.Dishwashing liquid and water
Mashed grapes
Sugar and lemon juice
Kokanee beer or coolers
Sugar and water
Sugar and vinegar
1 tsp liquid laundry soap, 1 tsp sugar (to attract them), and water - if they do get out, they will still die from the laundry soap
Soda (lemonade, etc.) that has lost its fizz. This way it can still be of use. Add a few drops of washing up liquid to help break the surface tension of the soda.

,


Once the wasps go in they can't figure out how to get out, so they get trapped.
Adding petroleum jelly or cooking oil along the steep edges of the trap can cause them to lose their footing and fall into the hole.

, Be sure the wasps are dead before removing them. Not only do you want to prevent a defensive sting, but living wasps that escape may return with their friends. Pour hot, soapy water into the funnel (the upside-down neck of the bottle) to make sure, or put a plastic bag over the trap and put it in the freezer for a few days.Bury the dead wasps, or flush them down the toilet, as their bodies might release a chemical that alerts the rest of the colony to their fate.

Keep food sources, especially protein, indoors.,
Don't leave sugar out.,
Put out sliced cucumbers.,
Seal your garbage cans tightly.,
Hang up a crumpled brown paper bag.,
Seal up the sides of your home and shore up your awnings.,
Don't do these things.",How to Keep Yellow Jacket Wasps Away1," Yellow jackets feed primarily off of protein, so be sure to keep those turkey sandwiches indoors and enjoy the postprandial glow outside instead of the other way around.


Food sources include your pet's food as well. Make sure you find an effective way to store your pet food (if you do store it outside) so that any roaming yellow jackets can't make a quick feast out of your furry friend's treat.;
, In the spring and summer, yellow jackets eat primarily protein. In the fall, yellow jackets begin to incorporate sugars into their diet. Sugar can increase the lifespan and reproductive function of many predatory wasps, making it a particularly dangerous thing to keep around.If picnicking, try to keep sweets such as sodas and desserts indoors.
Hummingbird feeders, essentially sugar-water dispensers, can be especially problematic. Investigate ways to kill or remove the entire colony before you put up a lot of sugar-water for them to gorge on.

, If you have to put out food (we do not advocate blowing off 4th of July on account of some pesky wasps), one unusual wasp repellent you can try is cucumber. This vegetable has an acid property that wasps don't like. Cut up a few slices and leave around your picnic or BBQ area. They stay away and you can enjoy your outdoor activities without fear of getting stung.

, Yellow jackets are primarily hunters, but they can morph into greedy little scavengers if the prize is worth it. An open or easy-to-access garbage can is just that.


Remember that sugars and proteins are especially pleasing to yellow jackets, so consider isolating those into separate bins to be extra sure. It's not necessary if you take care to lock up your entire garbage heap, but it may give succor to those fiercely afraid of yellow jackets.

, Wasps are territorial so they will not make a nest where one already exist. To give the illusion of a wasp nest crumple up a small brown grocery bag, attach a string, and hang near your doors. They cannot tell if it's truly a nest but they seem to trust what they see. Their instincts will kick in and they will go away.

, Awnings and loose siding on your home is a safe, enticing place for yellow jackets to shack up and make a home. Seal these places properly to prevent a yellow jacket infestation from making its way — quite literally — into your home.


Infestations of yellow jackets into your home will most likely require the expertise of a professional exterminator, and will cost you a pretty penny while you're at it. If you're the patient type, wait for winter. Cold enough weather will kill off the entire colony, after which time you can remove the wasp nest and seal up your home properly.

, In addition to the advice above, don't do any of the following thing, as they are most likely counterproductive:


Don't wear bright colors. The yellow jackets could think that you're a flower and be attracted to you.
Don't swat at yellow jackets. Killing one yellow jacket may be cathartic, but it also causes a pheromone to be released which attracts other wasps. Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Don't wear overly aromatic perfumes. Yellow jackets are attracted to sweet smells.

"
Scare them off with sound.Leave the radio on or use an ultrasonic repellent inside the attic.,
Flash lights.,
Use commercial squirrel repellent.,
Use ammonia-soaked rags.Wet a few old rags with a little household ammonia and strategically place the rags around any spot you suspect squirrels to be living in.,
Scatter mothballs.",How to Get Rid of Squirrels in the Attic3,"


If using the radio, turn it to a talk station so that the squirrels constantly hear human voices. The radio does not need to be loud enough for you to hear, but it must be loud enough for the squirrels to hear. This may have limited usefulness if you are dealing with squirrels that are used to humans, though.
Ultrasonic repellents produce a high-decibel noise that only small animals can hear. It can make your attic an unbearable place for squirrels that have recently moved in, but squirrels can eventually adapt to it and settle in. Note that it may also bother other animals in your home, even though you cannot hear it.

, Leave the attic light on or install flashing strobe lights in the attic.


The constant light provided by a standard attic light may be enough to drive many squirrels away, especially those that are not accustomed to being around people.
For tougher cases, a pulsating strobe light might be more effective since the sudden, bright flashes of light might startle a squirrel and cause it to run off. When using strobe lights, though, you should also back the method up with exclusion techniques to prevent the startled critters from braving their way back inside.
In either instance, make sure that the scared squirrel takes any offspring with it. If not, you may need to trap the offspring and take them outside or hire a professional to do so.

, Purchase a chemical or natural squirrel repellent from a manufacturer and apply the spray according to label instructions, focusing specifically on squirrel nesting areas inside the attic.


Try an animal repellent made with predator urine. The most commonly used predator urine is fox spray, which can be purchased by itself from various hunting supply stores. This is a fairly non-toxic product and relies on the squirrels' senses of smell and self-preservation. When the squirrels get a whiff of a natural predator, they learn to avoid the area.
Note that no repellent proves quite as successful as physical removal, but many people do seem to have some success with them.

,


Ammonia is mostly a folk remedy against squirrels, so there is no definitive proof that such a method is effective. Many homeowners have reported luck with it, though. To increase the likelihood of experiencing success, you should also employ trapping and exclusion techniques to keep the squirrels out.
As the theory goes, the strong, pungent smell of ammonia will drive the squirrels in your attic away.
After the squirrels have cleared out of your attic, run a few electric fans to clear the air inside the space. Ammonia can burn your nasal passages and cause other health concerns, so you should air out the attic after using this method to prevent future trouble.
Prohibit kids and pets from entering the attic while this method is in use.

, Place mothballs near possible entrances to the attic and around any cardboard box or other area with detectable signs of infestation.


Note that there is no scientific evidence supporting the use of mothballs as a squirrel repellent. Some homeowners report that mothballs work against squirrels, while others insist that they do not. To maximize your odds of having success, use mothballs in conjunction with exclusion or trapping techniques.
Modern mothballs are made of para-dichlorobenzene, but older mothballs may contain naphthalene. Since naphthalene is flammable, you should use precaution when using old mothballs.
Keep mothballs away from small children and pets. This is not usually a problem if you only use mothballs in the attic, since this area is not usually frequented by kids or household animals, but if it is an issue then you should secure the mothballs in breathable mesh bags or keep them out of reach by placing them on a high shelf.

Make sure you’re dealing with bees.,
Take a photo to determine what type of bee it is.,
Distinguish between bumblebees and carpenter bees.,
Use their nest to identify them if needed.,
Don't worry if you can't identify them.,
Ask yourself if getting rid of them is really necessary.,

Call beekeepers before exterminators to remove honeybees.,
Contact bee specialists rather than general pest control companies.,
Remove all nests and honeycombs.,
Make all necessary repairs immediately.,
Clear your property of ideal nesting spots.",How to Get Rid of Bees," Whenever you spot what you think is a bee, take a good look at the insect before you attempt to do anything else. Confirm that it is indeed a bee and not a wasp or hornet. Tell the difference by:


Hair: Bees appear furry all over. Wasps and hornets may have a small amount of hair on their bodies, but you’d need to inspect them very closely to see it.Food sources: Bees nourish themselves from flowers’ nectar. Wasps and hornets prey on other insects and/or scavenge food waste.
Thickness: Bees tend to be pretty plump in the middle, while wasps and hornets have thinner waists and more elongated bodies.;
, Expect different types of bees to require different approaches when it comes to getting rid of them.Take a picture of them to show a professional exterminator or beekeeper, or compare it with online resources like http://www.adkinsbeeremoval.com/bee-id-chart.php. If you're in the United States, you'll most likely be dealing with either honeybees, bumblebees, carpenter bees, or possibly Africanized honeybees.








, Expect these two to appear fairly similar at first glance. If you’re comparing photos online and believe that you have one or the other, do a little more digging to be sure. Tell the two apart by:








Visual clues: Carpenter bees feature a black dot on the the top of their thorax (the part where the wings and legs grow from). They also have less hair than a bumblebee.
Sociability: Carpenter bees are generally solitary in nature, while bumblebees tend to swarm.

, If you’re unable to take a photo (or if your photos don’t come out that great), don’t worry. Look for their nest. Use that to help narrow down the species.








Honeybees’ nests are often found within hollow spaces, such as tree trunks, logs, and fence posts. They usually don’t use home structures to build their nests, but are sometimes found in roofs, attics, and wall cavities if there is access from the outside. Bumblebees typically nest in or near soil, such as in deserted rodent nests, compost piles, or underneath raised outdoor structures like sheds or porches.
Carpenter bees usually burrow into wood to build their nests. Look for bee activity around coin-sized holes in things like eaves, porches, and trimming., If you can't figure out what type of bee it is, don't beat yourself up about it. Knowing what type it is will help you anticipate how much work will be needed in order to get rid of them (and thus cost-compare between companies and budget accordingly), but it's not necessary to start the process. Simply contact a pest-control company specializing in bees and arrange for an inspection so they can identify them for you.

, If the bees are only seen outside, consider leaving them alone unless someone is allergic to bees. Remember that they play an important role in the environment by promoting pollination, and that honeybees in particular have been declining in population over recent years.Also keep in mind that:









Although most bees have stingers, they usually only ever use them as a last resort, which means you really have to antagonize them before they’ll sting you. As long as you stay relaxed when they’re around, you should be fine. In fact, some bees (like male carpenter bees) don’t even have stingers.One exception to this rule may be Africanized honeybees, which are much more likely to turn aggressive and stay that way once they’re disturbed., If you’re seeing bees inside the house (or if you’ve spotted, say, carpenter bees burrowing into wooden portions of your house), consider this to be a situation where it’s appropriate to get rid of them. Any damage they may cause to the structure will be minimal in the beginning, but expect the risk and extent of damage to increase over time if left untreated.








Carpenter bees will continue to expand their nests throughout wooden structures if left alone.
Honeybees create honeycombs. These can become quite heavy and possibly damage surrounding areas.The honey may also attract other animals., Killing a single bee is relatively easy, but expect dealing with a whole nest of them to be a much more involved and lengthy process. Keep in mind that if it isn’t done correctly and thoroughly, you’ll most likely end up with a new batch of bees appearing in the near future. Also remember:Bees are usually happy to ignore you right up until you start messing with their nest. And though a single bee sting is pretty bearable, you may be faced with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of the little guys when you attack them at the source.Depending on the type of bee you have, the method for removing them may vary. Professionals may use smoke, pesticides, or other means of extraction for the bees themselves, plus using a second hive to extract honey from the left-behind nest.
Removal of the nest itself may also require carpentry work in order to gain access and repair damage to structures.

, First, determine if the bees’ nest is technically on public property instead of your own. If so, contact your local government and report it so they can deal with it. If not, call them anyway, since they may offer free services to have the nest removed, depending on your area.What free services (if any) are available will depend on your area. They may include extraction of both bees and nests or only the bees themselves. They may or may not include repairs to any structural damage.
Free services are more likely to be available if the nest is in a natural structure (like a tree) rather than your home or other manmade structure. However, it’s still worth calling and finding out for sure about their policy regarding manmade structures on your property.

, Keep in mind that even though the “free services” offered may technically be free, they won’t necessarily cover all the work that needs to be done. Find out exactly what those services cover and then contact private companies on your own to explore your options.This is especially important if the nest is located within your home’s structure. Gaining access to it may involve cutting into the structure in order to expose the nest. Free services may not include repairs needed afterward.
If repairs aren’t done or are done improperly, new bees make take up residence in the same area. This means it may be cheaper in the long run to hire a private company that will remove the bees, make repairs, and offer a warranty covering future infestations.

, If you’re sure that you have honeybees, look up local beekeepers in your area. Have the beekeepers remove the honeybees from your property if possible rather than kill them. Remember that healthy honeybees are in decline, which is unfortunate because they play an integral part in pollinating fruit and vegetable crops.








If you aren’t able to locate a beekeeper in your area, find a pest control company specializing in bees instead. They may also attempt to remove honeybees before resorting to extermination.

, If the bees have nested in your home’s structure (or any other on your property), expect whomever you may hire to possibly have to cut through walls, floors, and ceilings to gain access. Obviously, this means repair work will have to be done afterward. For this reason, search for pest control companies that specifically specialize in bees.Bee specialists are more likely to take care of repairs themselves, while a more general pest control company will probably only get rid of the bees. This means you will have to either do the repairs yourself or hire a contractor.
Bee specialists are also more likely to offer you a warranty in case bees return to the same area, which may save you more money in the long run.

, Make sure that whomever you hire doesn’t simply kill or remove the bees and leave their nest and honeycomb behind. Expect these to attract new bees. Prevent a new problem by making sure that the old one is taken care of thoroughly., If the company needed to cut into any part of your home’s structure in order to reach the nest and didn’t repair the damage themselves, do so immediately. Assume that if one bee colony found this area to be a good place to build a nest, others will, too. Seal off their access to it as soon as possible.








Close any other gaps, cracks, or other points of access, too. Remember: if one bee colony set up shop within a structure, others will do the same. Assess the area and identify any points where bees could possibly access it. Seal those points with caulk, insulation foam, or whatever the situation demands.

, Limit the number of places where bees can build a nest. Remove any unnecessary junk that has accumulated and now offers bees a perfect spot to build a nest. Depending on which types of bees live in your area, also consider:









Blocking access to crawlspaces and underneath raised structures like outdoor sheds, porches, or decks.
Filling in old rodent dens and other holes in the ground.
Putting compost into a container rather than leaving it as an open pile.
Removing hollowed trees and logs.

"
Put safety first.",How to Get Rid of Hornets1," Wasps and hornets can sting numerous times and will do so aggressively, if provoked. Remember that this type of pest removal can be very risky even if you are not allergic, and proceed with caution. If you are unsure, call a professional for advice; you might wish to use his/her services if the risks to you outweighs your desire to do it yourself.

Spray them with soap and water.,
Get a non-toxic wasp trap and set it out early in the season.,
Build a trap of your own using a large soda bottle.,
Cover the entrance and exit of the yellow jacket's nest with a powdered insecticide.,
Dispose of an aerial nest with a big cloth bag.,
Dispose of an underground nest by sealing off all entry and exit points.,
Wait it out.",How to Keep Yellow Jacket Wasps Away2," Old fashioned soap and water is the first natural repellent to use. Spray the soapy mixture on the wasp and their nest. The soap will stick to their wings and weigh them down. Eventually they will suffocate.


Line your doors and windows with soap to keep the wasps away.
If the yellow jackets have built a nest in the ground, pour soapy water into the hole at night and preferably during cooler temperature. The entire colony should die. Be sure to wear protective clothing in case the yellow jackets are feeling especially murderous.

, Non-toxic wasp traps don't use any chemicals to kill wasps caught inside. Instead, they rely on asphyxiation, drowning, starvation, or exhaustion to kill the yellow jackets. Not exactly the most humane, but this is war, isn't it?


Place the trap two to four feet above the ground and as far away from human habitation as possible.This is the ideal scenario.

, Cut off the top 1/3 of a 2-liter soda bottle. Turn the top around (so that it's facing the bottom of the soda bottle instead of the top) and staple it to the remaining soda bottle. You should have a kind of minnow trap with the inverted neck as a funnel.


Fill the soda bottle about halfway full with soapy water. Coat the neck of the soda bottle with sweet jam. The yellow jackets will try to get to the jam and accidentally fall into the bottle, from which it is very difficult to get out.
Empty and refill the soda bottle frequently. Dead yellow jackets can form a barrier that other caught yellow jackets can rest on, possibly escaping. Empty the contents of your homemade trap frequently to cut down on this risk.

, The yellow jackets will crawl through the insecticide in order to get into their nest, carrying the insecticide into the nest and infecting the other members of the colony. Coating both the entrance and exit of their nest will increase the likelihood of extermination.

, During nighttime, when the yellow jackets are drowsy, sneak up to the aerial nest and quickly envelop it in your cloth bag. Make sure to tie off the bag so that none of the wasps may escape. Break the wasp nest off from its mooring and submerge it completely in water to drown the yellow jackets. Use a couple rocks to help keep the nest submerged.

, Once you are sure you have located all of the possible entry and exit points of the nest, approach them during the nighttime when the wasps are drowsy. Place a large bowl over any entrances and exits, working them into the ground so that they create a kind of seal.


Leave the bowls over the entry and exit points for approximately two weeks. The yellow jackets will be disoriented but unable to leave their underground prison. They should die off after the two weeks, if not relocate to another more accessible nest.

, Wasps cannot survive the harsh winter months, during which time they regularly die off. If you discover a yellow jacket nest during the end of summer/fall, consider waiting for the first frost to kill off your pesky yellow jackets for you. You won't risk getting stung and, if you can stand it, you won't have to worry with the headache of playing exterminator for weeks on end.

Locate the nest.",How to Get Rid of Hornets2," A hornet's nest is a paper or mud-like construction often shaped like a pine cone, upside down beehive, or just a mass lump. Hornets will look for a sheltered location to make their nest, and such nests can be found under leaves, in tree branches, on windows, in attics, under rafters, inside abandoned buildings or vehicles, etc. Any space that is protected from the weather and undisturbed can attract hornets to nest.;
"
"
Wear the right gear.,
Purchase a large, strong plastic bag.,
Place the plastic bag underneath the tree branch or bush.,
Using long-handled hedge trimmers, cut the branch down and let the nest drop into the bag.,
Fill the bag with hornet-appropriate insecticide and tie it shut, tightly.",How to Get Rid of Hornets3," Cover yourselves from head to toe, to protect you from stings. Wear thick clothing, gloves, safety glasses or goggles.

, It must be strong enough to resist easy rips.

, Estimate the trajectory of the nest when it falls, so that the bag will be under it.

, Alternatively, snip the part of the nest attached to the branch.

, Dispose of, or burn, straight away.

"
"
Get the proper insecticide.,
Spray at evening or dawn.,
Don (put on) protective gear.,
Wear a respirator, if in enclosed areas or desired.,
Mount your assault, saturating the nest with the aerosol cans.",How to Get Rid of Hornets4," Home repair and improvement warehouse stores will have a wide selection of wasp and hornet sprays for a variety of prices. (Buy the least expensive product; they all work similarly.) Two or more aerosol cans are recommended for anything larger than a small nest.


Don't buy generic insecticide unless the label confirms that it works on hornets. You must be certain that the spray has the capacity to handle hornets.

, The wasps or hornets will be mostly by the nest getting ready to sleep or wake up and won't be flying around. Night is also good since they will be sleeping, and therefore more docile, but you will have more trouble seeing and escaping if the nest does get aggressive.

, Wear long sleeves, tucked into gloves, long pants tucked into your socks, and a wide brimmed hat with a nylon stocking over it, tucked into the neckline of your shirt.

, Insecticide kills insects, but it isn't exactly good for people, either. At the very least, provide good ventilation with a fan or retreat quickly after the initial assault.

, Most have a 15 foot (4.6 m) or more range, so you can start from far away, but after a few seconds you will want to get in close and really soak the nest. The chemicals kill nearly instantly, so there is not much risk. After applying the chemical, leave the area and allow fumes to clear.


The returning wasps will also die, so leave the nest alone for a few days.

Make a vinegar trap.,
Make a bucket trap.,
Make as many traps as you feel are needed to cover the space.",How to Get Rid of Hornets5," Make a traditional wasp trap by cutting the neck off a large soda bottle. Turn the neck funnel downward and into the base of the soda bottle. This becomes the tunnel for the wasp to enter through. Pierce two holes either side of the trap and thread through a string handle for hanging; knot in place either side.


Inside the trap, place a cup of apple cider vinegar, a drop of dish soap and a little raw meat. The raw meat can be hung by string or fishing wire.
Hang where hornets have been seen buzzing around. Wait. Hornets will drop in and either drown or won't be able to find their way back out again.
To catch the queen, use this trap early in the spring to lure her in. Queens awaken in early spring and begin to look for nesting sites. If your trap catches her, that's one less colony in your backyard.

, Fill a bucket with sugar water, vinegar and a little mild dish washing soap. Set outside and wait for the hornets to drop by and drown.


Replace regularly.

, One trap may be sufficient but if you have various inviting eaves around the place, place several, just in case you accidentally ward off one spot only to encourage nest-building on the other side of the house!

"
"
Vacuum the hornet.",How to Get Rid of Hornets6," Simply aim the nozzle in the direction of the hornet and suck the hornet up.


Be aware that swatting or squashing hornets releases a chemical signal that encourages other hornets to turn up and sting in defense. While this might not be an issue indoors, be careful. And never squash a hornet outdoors!"
"
You may wish to remove the nest completely.,
Inspect your house regularly afterward.",How to Get Rid of Hornets7," Pull it down (while still wearing safety equipment) and dispose of it in a large plastic bag that can be tied off. If the nest was in an enclosed area such as a ventilation duct or air conditioner port, a long, serrated bread knife may be useful in removal.


Seal up any entrance holes that you can gauge by checking around. This will help to discourage future hornet intrusion.

, A small nest is a simple affair to remove––squirt the chemicals and yank it down, while a large one may require a repeat of this whole process.

Gather the supplies you will need for the project.,
Get your tools out, and set up saw horses or a work table for cutting an assembling your bee traps.

,
Measure the following lengths of 1X4 pine lumber.,
Cut these pieces, using an angle square to mark a 15 degree angle on the first 2 pieces, and setting the saw at a 15 degree bevel for the second 2 pieces.,
Nail the trap box together as shown in the photograph.,Drill a 1/2 inch (1.27cm) hole near the top of each side angled toward the top of the trap so the resulting hole slopes slightly upward.,
Drill a 1 1/4 inch (3.1cm) hole in the center of the bottom board.

,
Fashion a funnel by cutting the top off a soft drink or water bottle as shown in the photo.,
Staple the funnel to the bottom of the trap, centering it over the 1 1/4 inch (3.1cm) hole you drilled earlier.,
Cut the bottom off of a one liter water or soft drink bottle, and notch it so it can be flared to create a flange similar to the one you made on the funnel section in an earlier step.

,
Attach an eye screw or hook to the center of the top of the trap to suspend it.,
Empty the lower, large bottle by removing the cap and dumping the bees.

",How to Build a Carpenter Bee Trap," You may find some scrap lumber around building sites, but if you don't, one 8 foot (2.4m) long 1X4 will be enough to build several of these simple traps. Collecting the plastic soft drink bottles beforehand should also be easy to do.
,,
2 pieces 7 inches (17.5cm) to the short side of a 15 degree angle.






1 piece 7 inches (17.5cm) to the long side of a 15 degree bevel.






1 piece 8 inches (20cm) to the short side of a 15 degree bevel.






1 piece 5 inches (12.5cm) long, cut square on both ends.






1 piece but first you need a 15 degree bevel across the short distance of the 1x4. From the short end of that bevel edge, measure 6 1/2 inches (16.5cm). Make a straight cut through this new measured end.







, The next piece will be cut with the saw set to 90 degrees (square), and the last piece will be cut on a 15 degree bevel the same direction on both ends., A pneumatic finish nail or staple gun makes this step easier, but small nails, or even wood screws may be used.

,,, Notch it so the end can be bent outward to create a flange to attach it to the bottom of the trap.

, Remove cap.

,, Then, install another eye hook to the eave or rafter of the building you are installing the trap on, and hang the trap.

That is because there are many different ant species that all have different habits and behaviors which can affect the treatment needed to get rid of them.Look at the ants in your kitchen and note their characteristics. Some characteristics to look for are their size and color. Ants in your kitchen are most likely either pharaoh ants or pavement ants, but it is possible they are a different species.Once you know some identifying characteristics about the ants, do some online research to correctly determine the species of ants in your kitchen, and some of the best methods recommended for eliminating that species.;
, Follow the ants that are already in your house for a few minutes, and try and find the spots where they are entering your home. Look inside the house around windows, doorways, and cracks in the floor, but also outside the house around doorways, windows, siding, and accent lights.If any ants are coming in and out through these points, focus on these areas in your cleaning efforts to ensure the ants don’t enter through these points.

, Once you have identified a trail and entry points from which the ants are entering your house, try and notice the trail that the ants follow out of your house. You will see that they all follow the same trail. That is because when they enter your home, they leave a scented trail behind them for the rest of the colony to follow.


It won’t always be easy to find an ant nest, but if you do identify its location, you can spray the ant hill with a poison spray, or attack the ant problem at the source by baiting the ants in your house to take poison back to the nest, and kill the colony.

, Even if you see a single ant in your house, you are more than likely to see more. That is because ants leave trails behind wherever they travel that other ants can smell, and follow.If you just mop or sweep your floor, that’s not enough to eliminate the ant trail. The trail is a pheromone trail, it can’t just be swept away; it needs to be cleared away with some disinfecting cleanser. Instead, mix ½ vinegar and ½ water in a spray bottle, and cover all of your kitchen surfaces with the spray mixture. Make sure to target the areas where you have witnessed ants crawling around before.


Keep in mind that this spray mixture will not kill the ants that are already in your house. This simply erases the trail from those ants, so new, outside ants can’t follow their pheromone trail inside.
You can also substitute bleach for vinegar for the spray solution. The most important part of the spray solution is a sterile cleanser to erase the ant trail.

, Fill a plastic spray bottle with 1 capful of liquid hand soap and water. Shake the bottle to let the soap and water mix together. Then spray the mixture on ants whenever you see them in your kitchen. Wait about 5 minutes to wipe up, because ants are a lot easier to clean off your counters once they stop moving.You can also use bar soap for your soap additive: Shave off a few ounces of the bar soap, and add it to about a liter of water. Then microwave the water and soap flakes to melt the soap, and add it to a spray bottle.This method is safe for children and pets since it doesn’t contain insecticides, and can be used in your garden to repel bugs from your plants.

, Blend together 1 cup of lemon juice with 4 cups of warm water in a big container. Then dip a cleaning cloth into the mixture, and wipe down your counters, the inside of your cabinets and cupboards, the top of your refrigerator, around kitchen windows, and any other surfaces ants might crawl around in your kitchen.The citrus scent repels ants. Orange peels and cucumber rinds have been known to have the same repelling effect.
You can also mop the floor with this solution, but be sure to specifically mop the areas on the ground, where ants are most likely entering your home.

, Scatter some ground cinnamon around possible areas where ants may enter (windows, doorways, etc.), but also around edges of your counter, and areas where you have seen ants in general. The smell from the cinnamon is an ant repellant, but it will also give your kitchen a spicy fragrance.You can also sprinkle these other spices and herbs to deter the ants:Black pepper
Cayenne pepper
Chili pepper
Cloves
Garlic
Bay leaves
Mint leaves
Basil leaves

, Observe the areas around your kitchen where you have seen the most ants. IF you have mostly seen ants in small, nooky, areas like edges of the kitchen, tiny cracks in the walls, edges of the floor and baseboards, or along windows, apply dry diatomaceous earth to these areas.Once you apply the DE, see if the ants have stopped entering your house, or have just found substitute routes to take. If you have to, apply more DE to their new routes. After about a month has passed, clean the areas where you originally applied the DE, and add more if the ants still are not gone., Take note if the ants are moving across bigger, flat areas rather than moving around the edges and cracks of your kitchen. If they have been wandering along your walls, you should use a wet application of DE. Follow the instructions listed on the spray bottle for application, and use the spray bottle to target the larger areas such as walls, where you have seen the ants traveling. Again, try to keep track and see if the ants have stopped coming into the house all together, or have found alternative paths to take. If, after a month of the initial application of the wet DE, you still see ants, apply another spraying round of wet DE.
The DE doesn’t do it’s work while it’s wet; it works when the water in the solution dries and evaporates, leaving behind a finely ground powder that terminates the ants., Coffee grounds, cornmeal, rice, cucumber peels, chalk, and baby powder have all been known to repel ants.Try sprinkling these items around areas where ants gather, and test to see which methods work for your house and your ants. Repelling ants in this manner (using random spices and foods), is very much a trial and error process. What might work for one household with one type of ant, might not work for another.


Many of the smells and ingredients of these items are disliked by ants. Therefore, these items usually repel ants from areas surrounded and covered with these items.

, Seal any open cracks and crevices the ants are entering your home through, with caulk. These cracks might be more common near windows or doors. By sealing these areas with caulk, you cut off the ants’ entryways, while also enabling better temperature regulation of your house.To effectively caulk holes and cracks, insert the caulking tip into the hole or crack, and begin to fill the hole or crack. When the caulk starts to slightly overflow from the hole or crack, that means that the opening is filled and no longer has open space.
This is a non-toxic, pet and child safe method to keep ants at bay.

, Scout ants (the ants you see around your kitchen) are the ants that bring back food to the rest of the colony. Set out a pre-bait in the areas of your house where you have seen the most amount of ant activity. Arrange a small plate with some sugar based food (like honey, syrup, jam, etc.), and some fried food (like french fries or fried chicken). See which flavoring of food attracts more ants. You don't have to leave this pre-bait out for long to see which type of food the ants prefer.Ants’ taste preferences can change depending on the time of year, so that’s why it’s a good idea to do a pre-bait; so you can successfully identify the ants' preferred flavoring, and buy a poisonous ant bait targeted to their particular taste.
This pre-bait step isn't necessary for all ant problems in the kitchen, but it does help to narrow down and the type of bait you should use. When in doubt, purchase bait that caters to ants that want both sweet and savory foods.
These toxic ant baits come in both solid and liquid form, but when ants prefer sweet foods, liquid bait seems to work best.

, Right after you have set out poisonous bait targeted to the ants’ taste, you will probably see an increase in the number of ants around your house. That is because the bait is drawing them in. This is what you want, because the more ants around the bait, the more ants are taking it back to the nest to kill the rest of the colony.Keep in mind that this baiting extermination process might take some time. That is because you aren’t just killing the ants walking around your house, you have to kill multiple ‘’’generations’’’ of ants, including the adult ants, their pupae, (which are the ants still in their cocoon stage), the larvae, and the eggs. This process can take anywhere from a few days to weeks.When using this bait system, all other foods need to be eliminated. The bait can’t have other foods sources tempting the ants. You want the ants to take the toxic bait, and the toxic bait only. Also, do not disturb the ants or bait once the ants have started eating it.If you still have ants after two weeks of letting the bait sit, replace the kind of bait you are using. It evidently is not effective or as effective as it should be., Mix 1 tbsp of organic boric acid, 1 tbsp of maple syrup (or any other kind of sticky sweet like honey, jam, etc.). Spread this boric acid and sweet substance onto a piece of bread or cracker. Then, poke holes into a small cardboard box, and place the food with the bait in the center of the box. Just like the store bought ant bait, the food scent will entice the ants to the bait, and boric acid will eradicate the rest of the colony when the ants take the “food” back to the nest.Leave the trap out during the nighttime, since that is when ants go hunting for food.
Attack the ant nest at the source. If you were able to find the ant nest, expel the ants by killing the colony. Spray the nest and the area of the nest with an insecticide that has bifenthrin as the main ingredient., You might need to call an exterminator and have them do an assessment if your own methods for eliminating the ants haven't worked.


A professional exterminator would be able to determine entryways, and maybe identify other nests, therefore providing useful insight and better methods for treating your ant problem.

, Clean off and rinse thoroughly any dishes that you want to leave overnight in the sink.You want to make sure there isn’t any food residue that could attract the ants during the nighttime.


Consider pouring a little bit of bleach down the drain to wipe out the smell of left over food particles.

, Ants only need a little crumb of food to begin calling in for backup, so be sure to clean up any bits and pieces of food that could be strewed on the floor and hidden underneath kitchen appliances.Sweep the floor to eliminate food sources for the ants. Mop your floor with a ½ bleach ½ water solution.


Again, this mopping solution can also be a solution of ½ vinegar and ½ water. The only thing that matters is the sterile cleaning agent to eliminate ant trails.
You can spray the mixture of vinegar and water around pet food bowls to prevent ants from gathering there.

, Just like sweeping and mopping, vacuuming helps clean up any bits of food that could attract ants to come into your house.This is especially important for homes with carpeting, as food bits are harder to see against carpet.

, Use sturdy, durable garbage bags, and remove your trash as often as you can to reduce the possibility of ants feeding on food near and in your garbage can.Often, a puncture hole in a garbage bag allows for juices to spill and therefore, can attract ants.
Consider sprinkling baking soda at the bottom of your garbage can to freshen the can, and repel ants from the food smells.

If the test confirms that you are not allergic to stings, then you can proceed with getting rid of the nest by yourself.
However, if you find out that you do have an allergy, you absolutely should ask someone else to deal with the nest or call an exterminator, as getting stung could be a life-threatening situation.;
, Though not available everywhere, vector control deals with disease-carrying or potentially dangerous insects and animals (vectors). These professionals can help you with identification, advise you on what to do, and may even remove the wasps for you.Do a quick internet search for ""vector control"" in your area to find contact information and request service.

, In most situations, it's best to leave nest removal to the professionals. If there is no vector control district or they are unable to come remove the nest, try an exterminator instead. This is especially true if you have ground-nesting yellow jackets.If the wasp nest is in an awkward or hard-to-reach location, such as inside a wall or attic or underneath a concrete slab, you will definitely want help from a professional.
It is also advisable to call a professional exterminator if you are allergic to wasp stings, as getting rid of the nest by yourself could be dangerous. In fact, even if you aren't allergic, approaching a wasp's nest can be incredibly dangerous and, in fact, deadly if things go wrong.

, If the wasps' nest is far enough away from your house that it doesn't pose a significant threat, you should consider leaving it alone, especially if it belongs to a less aggressive wasp species such as the paper wasp. Wasps are an important part of the ecosystem, as they pollinate plants and flowers and eat other garden pests such as caterpillars.


If you discover that the nest actually belongs to bees instead of wasps, do not destroy it. Honey bee populations are in significant decline, so it's important that you do what you can to help preserve existing bees.
Instead of destroying the nest, call a local beekeeper. He or she will be more than happy to come and collect the nest, either for free or for a small fee.

, Before you tackle the nest, it's a good idea to know what species of wasp you're dealing with, as this will give you an indication of the best way to get rid of it. Someone from your vector control district or an entomologist from a nearby university may also be willing to help identify the wasps. The three main types of wasps you'll have to deal with are as follows:



Paper wasps: Paper wasps have long bodies and long legs, relative to other species of wasp. They build large, exposed nests where the combs are clearly visible. Their nests are often compared to an upside down umbrella and are usually built in sheltered areas like the eaves of a house or the end of an open pipe. They will only attack if they feel threatened, but their sting can be quite painful and potentially dangerous.Yellow jackets: Yellow jackets have thick black antennae and shorter legs (compared to paper wasps). They build papery-looking, covered-in nests and prefer enclosed spaces like wall voids or cavities in the ground. They can be very aggressive, stinging multiple times and attacking in swarms.

Hornets: Hornets are the largest type of social wasp. In North America, the bald faced hornet is the most common - it can be identified by the white markings on its head and thorax. The European hornet is brown with orange markings. Hornets tend to build paper nests, which are often found in tree trunks and wall cavities., It's very important to wear protective clothing when you attempt to get rid of a wasp's nest, to prevent getting stung. Even if you're not allergic, a wasp sting can be painful!


Wear long jeans, socks and boots, a sweater with the hood pulled over your head and gloves.
You should also wrap a scarf around the lower half of your face and wear protective glasses or ski goggles.
If you are using a pesticide spray, make sure the clothes are old, as residue from the spray could enter the fabric. You should wash or discard the clothes immediately afterwards.
If you do happen to get stung while getting rid of the nest, see treatment instructions here.

, If the wasps' nest is somewhere up high, like the eave of a two-story house or a high tree branch, do not use a ladder to attempt to reach it.


If you are standing on a ladder and a swarm of wasps flies at you when you disturb the nest, you are very likely to fall and seriously injure yourself.
In this situation it is best to call a professional exterminator or use something like the smoke method (see below) to get rid of the wasps.
You should only attempt to get rid of a wasps' nest by yourself when it is within easy reach.

, If you decide to use a pesticide spray or powder to kill off the wasps, it's important to section off the area and make sure no one — especially small children or pets — comes near it, at least for 24 hours. The pesticides used in wasp killing spray are extremely strong and poisonous.


In addition, it's important that you pick up and dispose of any dead wasps that you find on the ground near the nest. Otherwise, your pet cat or dog, or local wildlife might ingest the dead wasps and be poisoned themselves as a result.

, The time of year you choose to destroy a wasps' nest can have a huge impact on whether or not you succeed. To understand this, it's useful to be aware of how these social wasps (paper wasps, yellow jackets and hornets) operate.


In early spring, the queen wasp (who was in hibernation for the winter) will select a spot for her nest and build a small structure to house the first brood of worker wasps. Once these worker wasps arrive, they will work tirelessly to expand their nest and protect their queen.
The colony of wasps will continue to grow throughout the spring and summer, until it reaches its peak in late August. At this time, yellow jacket colonies can hold up to two thousand wasps.
In addition, towards the end of summer, the last brood of wasps are born. This brood contains male wasps and next year's queens, so the colony is very protective of them and becomes more aggressive towards anyone who threatens the nest.
Therefore the best time to destroy a wasps' nest is as early in the year as possible, when the colony is smaller and the wasps are less aggressive. Plus, if you manage to kill the queen, you won't need to worry about a new nest being formed that year.However, if you do not find the wasps' nest until late summer or fall, destroying the nest may not be necessary (depending on your location) as freezing nighttime temperatures will kill the colony off naturally. Then you can simply dispose of the nest come winter., If you are planning to get rid of a wasps' nest yourself, it is best to do it at night. This is when the wasps are least active, so their reaction time is slower, and they are less aggressive.


For illumination do not use a regular flashlight to view the nest, as this will attract the wasps to you. Instead, use a red or amber colored light for safe visibility when performing night-time treatment of a wasp nest. Alternatively, you can try to target the nest in the very early morning before the wasps become active, as you will have the benefit of the morning light.

, Before you set your plan of attack in motion, it is a good idea to figure out your escape route. After you spray the nest, the wasps will quickly start to stream out and may swarm at you - therefore you will need to make a quick getaway before this happens.


Plan your escape route so you have somewhere you can quickly take cover after targeting the nest.
Also make sure that there are no obstacles such as children's toys or gardening equipment in your path which you could potentially trip over.

, Purchase an aerosol spray pesticide designed especially for killing wasps from your local supermarket or hardware store. Pesticides designed for smaller insects like ants may not be strong enough to kill the wasps.


Wearing the proper protective clothing and following the other safety measures outlined in the section above, target the bottom opening of the nest with a stream of pesticide. Do this for approximately 10 to 15 seconds (or according to the instructions on the can), then quickly vacate the area.
Leave the spray to take effect overnight. The next day, observe the nest from a distance. If you still see activity around the nest, repeat the process a second time.
Once activity has ceased and most of the wasps are dead, it is safe to knock down the nest using a long stick. Use the stick to break the nest apart, then saturate the pieces with the pesticide spray.
Dispose of the broken nest and any dead wasps immediately., When it comes to ground nests (such as those occupied by yellow jackets), insecticidal dust is much more effective than aerosol sprays, which can't quite penetrate the heart of the nest.


Get your hands on some insecticidal dust, such as ""Sevin 5 Garden Dust"" and measure out about ¼ cup into a bulb duster (or disposable plastic cup).
During the night or early morning, apply the dust liberally onto the nest opening, while wearing the proper protective gear. Immediately vacate the area.
Don't block or cover the nest - allow the wasps to enter and exit freely. As they pass through the opening, their legs and wings will become coated with the insecticidal dust, which they will then carry with them into the center of the nest, contaminating the other wasps.
Following the application of insecticidal dust, the wasps should die off within a day or two. If not, you can try repeating the process.

, If you're not a fan of using pesticide, a simple solution of dish soap and water can be extremely effective at killing off wasps, as it coats their wings to prevent them from flying and eventually drowns them.


Prepare a soap solution by mixing a good quantity of dish soap (about ¼ cup) with a liter of hot water, until it's nice and sudsy.
If you're targeting an aerial nest, pour the soap solution into a hose-end spray bottle, then aim a powerful stream of water directly at the entrance of the nest for 10 to 15 seconds.
If you're targeting a ground nest, simply pour the solution directly into the entrance, then quickly vacate the area.
Although the soap and water solution is very effective, you may need to repeat the process several times, as the soapy water needs to come in direct contact with each wasp before it can kill it.

, Another pesticide-free way of clearing out an aerial wasps' nest is to use smoke.


Build a small fire or light a fire in your grill directly below the nest. The smoke will rise up and enter the nest, suffocating the wasps and forcing them to vacate the nest.
Leave the smoke to rise for an hour or two, and when you are sure that the nest is empty you can put out the fire and knock the nest down with a stick, before disposing of it. However, you may want to have a spray bottle filled with soap and water in case there are any live wasps remaining in the nest.
Keep in mind that this method is only suitable for aerial nests that are hanging from tree branches or other exposed areas. It is not suitable for nests in doorways, eaves or anywhere too close to your house, as the flames may accidentally set your house on fire.

, It is possible to drown a free-hanging, aerial wasp nest using a cloth bag and a bucket of water.


Wearing your protective clothing, set a bucket of water beneath the wasps' nest. Grab a large cloth bag, with no holes or tears.
Quickly and carefully, place the cloth bag over the nest and tightly secure the top with a piece of string. As you do so, pull the nest from the tree branch.
Dump the bag containing the wasps' nest into the bucket of water, and place a heavy stone on top to hold the bag underwater.
Leave the bag in the water overnight, and by morning all the wasps will have drowned.
Keep in mind that this method involves coming in very close contact with the wasp's nest - so it is not for the clumsy or faint-hearted!, Over the winter, do a thorough inspection of the outside of your house to look for potential wasp entry points, such as loose siding, unsealed vents and cracks around windows and door frames. These are all ideal locations for a wasp's nest, so sealing them off now could prevent a potential infestation come spring.

, Although wasps will never return to a previously used nest, several species of wasp will build their new nest on top of the old one. Therefore it is a good idea to knock down any empty, abandoned nests over the winter and thoroughly clean the area before the queen bee reclaims the area come springtime.

, The scent of old food can attract wasps, so it's a good idea to make sure your garbage cans are well sealed. You should also give any garbage cans a good clean with water and disinfectant on a semi-regular basis, to remove any food residue that could attract wasps.

, Fruit trees, and particularly rotting, fallen fruit is a magnet for wasps and bees, so think twice before planting one too close to your house. If you already have fruit trees, it's a good idea to regularly harvest ripe fruit and to pick any fallen fruit off the ground and dispose of it before the wasps can get to it.

, Wasps are extremely territorial and will not build their nest close to another colony's. Therefore, hanging a fake wasps' nest or two is a great way to deter them. You can purchase fake nests at gardening centers and hardware stores (many of which are beautifully designed) but you can have just as much success by hanging a brown paper bag!

Set an ant trap.",How to Control Ants1," While they especially like sweet things, ants are not picky eaters and will find many food sources inside your home especially attractive. Cleaning your house to eliminate any crumbs and traces of food is one of the most effective ways to control ants.Researchers have found that ants will travel as far away as two football fields to hunt for food.;
, In addition to food, ants are also interested in locating sources of water. Drying your counters and floors will also help control ants. , Leaving dirty dishes in the sink will attract ants, so wash your dishes right away or rinse them and run them through the dishwasher. This will eliminate potential food sources for ants.Don’t forget to clean your pet’s food dishes.

, Sweeping and vacuuming your house will get rid of any crumbs that hungry ants might want to track down.Sweep or vacuum after meals to keep ants at bay.

, Spills and splashes inevitably occur in your home, but wiping these messes up quickly and thoroughly will help prevent ants from invading your home. , If you recycle, make sure you carefully rinse the containers out so there are no traces of food or liquid that ants will find tasty. It’s also a good idea to store the recycling outside so ants won’t come looking for tasty treats inside your home.Don’t forget about soda bottles or cans, since ants really like sweet things.

, If there is food that you do not store in the fridge, make sure it is tightly sealed and securely covered. This will prevent ants from getting into your food and gaining a foothold inside your space.Store pet food in an airtight container rather than an open bag so ants aren’t attracted to this as a potential food source.

, Regularly disposing of trash, especially any trash containing food, will make your home less attractive to ants. It’s also a good idea to keep your trash cans away from your house so ants don’t have a direct pathway into your home.To make an ant barrier on your trash can, spread a little petroleum jelly under the lip of the can. The ants can't cross it easily., To prevent ants from invading your domain, you need to eliminate any potential points of entry. Caulk or seal cracks and crevices inside your home.While silicone caulk offers a more lasting solution to seal areas where ants may enter, many people find that petroleum jelly is also effective because ants can’t cross over it.Apply to any places where you’ve seen ants enter your home, but also window cracks and door jambs.

, When you see ants in your home, pay attention to where they seem to be traveling and how they are getting in. Ants leave behind a pheromone trail that tells other ants where to go, so you want to eliminate the path they are traveling by scrubbing these areas with soapy water.As a precaution, also scrub any potential areas that may be entry points for ants. Even though you don’t see ants at the moment, you can eliminate the pheromone trail and the ants will have a harder time remembering where to go.

, Ant traps or ant bait stations are effective because the ants feed on the bait. Then, they return with it to the nest and share it with other members of the colony. You can usually purchase these at grocery, garden, and home-improvement stores, but you can also make your own.If you buy a bait or trap at the store, make sure you pick a product that is specifically designed for ants.
Locate the bait near areas where you see ants so they will take the bait.
Don’t use other insecticides or ant treatments around the bait stations, because the ants won’t visit them.
You may not notice improvement for a few weeks or even months.
If the ant population doesn't seem to be subsiding, try switching to a different type or brand of ant bait. Ants can be picky eaters, and some baits are more effective against specific types of ants.
Be careful not to place traps or bait in areas where pets or children can access since the ingredients are typically poisonous.
To make your own ant trap, try sprinkling cornmeal or cornstarch in areas infested with ants. They can’t digest the cornmeal or cornstarch and will die after eating it."

Contact an expert about the best time.,
Find an area with several active ant colonies.,
Look for a queen ant.,
Wait until you see a queen ant wandering around erratically.,
Handle your new queen ant with care.",How to Catch a Queen Ant1," Queen ants in existing colonies will venture off to start new colonies during certain times of the year.Local entomologists (people who study insects) or even local pest control companies will likely know the best time of year for you to search for a queen ant venturing off to build a new colony.


Day length, temperature, and rainfall are just a few of the variables to take into consideration for your area regarding when a queen will do this. For dryer areas such as the Southwest, it will usually be in the springtime, whereas later summer monsoons may be the ideal time in other regions.;
, The more ant colonies you check during the correct window of opportunity, the more likely you will be to find a queen ant during her search. A queen is also likely to try to build a colony in an area where other ant colonies already thrive, so look for spots in undeveloped areas with several colonies within a short distance of one another., Queen ants and the males that mate with them don’t simply fly out of the mature colony entrance knowing where to go. During the correct window, you might see several queen ants walking around near the entrance to their parent colony. During this period, the queen ants are testing the weather to decide on the right time to start a new colony.Since you're looking for a queen ant, you should know how to differentiate them from the other ants in the colony. At this stage, the queen ant will have wings. However, even after the stage where she pulls off her wings, you can identify her by her much larger size compared to the other ants. This will be most prominent in the thorax, which is the middle section of the ant between the head and the abdomen of the ant. You can also find additional characteristics provided at: How to Identify a Queen Ant

If you simply want a queen ant, this is the ideal time to cup one; however, if you want a queen ant in order to start your own ant colony, then you shouldn’t do it yet. These still winged queen ants have not yet mated in this step of colony building., Once a queen mates, she will look for the new colony location. In contrast to the fairly oriented paths of most ants, the queen ant will wander around checking cracks and crevices, changing directions, and generally resembling a lost tourist in a big city.Her erratic behavior simply means she’s looking for the ideal spot to begin her new colony.


Another sign that a queen ant has already mated is when she has pulled off her wings.Once she picks a general area, she will pull off her wings in order to appear less conspicuous. She will still walk around trying to find the perfect location in her chosen area, though.

, Once she has pulled off her wings, it’s much easier to catch a queen ant, but make sure you handle her gently. If you want to transport your queen ant to make a personal ant farm, a film canister works well. Make sure she gets plenty of water by placing a damp cotton ball inside the canister as well.If you want to build an ant farm, you should also take several scoops of soil from the area where you caught the queen for her to begin nesting in once you have transported her."

Consider altering the environment.,
Add a decoy.,
Keep protein sources away from hornets.Hornets in North America are mainly insect feeders, and thrive on protein sources.",How to Get Rid of Hornets8," Depending on where the hornets made their nest, there are several possible approaches to making it seem different to them, and therefore hopefully deterring them from rebuilding the nest. These include:


Cutting down branches, bushes and even a tree
Repainting a wall, eave, birdhouse, other items around the home
Putting up sparkly, sun-catching mobiles, mirrors or CDs in the vicinity of the demolished/removed nest.
Changing some other element dramatically around the garden or home where the hornets were hanging around.

, Purchase an artificial nest from a hardware store. The theory is that hornets that see an existing nest will keep away because they're territorial. Replace the artificial nest every year, to ensure that it looks intact and is neat.

, Hence, don't feed pets or leave pet food anywhere around the area where hornets have previously congregated.


Keep garbage covered at all times. Not only will this deter hornets but it will keep away all manner of yard pests.

Seal off all entrance areas.,
Seal cracks with caulk.,
Line suspected entryways with anti-ant substances.,
Make a tape barrier.,
Try making a barrier from talcum powder.,
Try using nontoxic ant deterrents.",How to Stop Ants From Coming Into Your Home1," Since ants are tiny, they can find thousands of tiny doorways into your residence. Some of them of are easy to identify; others will only be discovered when there's a parade of ants marching through them. First, figure out where the ants are entering the house: follow the trail of ants to see where they're entering and leaving your home. Seal all the entrance holes that you can find using silicone caulk, putty, glue or plaster. Temporary methods might include petroleum jelly or poster tack.


If you use a temporary sealant, like poster tack, only do so until you can fill the space with a more permanent solution. A weaker material will deteriorate over time, and the gap will open up again.;
, Close the gaps around windows, doors, and walls. Block off any space that might permit passage to an ant army. Your sealing efforts will be most effective if you're thorough.


An additional benefit of sealing off your home: more effective temperature control, and thus lower energy bills. Plus, this is one of the least risky methods where kids or pets are concerned.

, This is a somewhat more aggressive tactic than simply caulking up the cracks. You can create barriers of chemicals and powders that repel—even kill—unwitting ants. Consider diatomaceous earth, salt, and even commercial ant poisons. This might function as a form of baiting.


Diatomaceous earth is a fine powder that kills ants by pulling all the moisture from their bodies. It works by absorbing moisture from the ant itself, but it's best used in dry environments. You also don't want anyone in the house (especially pets and children) sniffing it up.
Try using salt. It has a similar drying-out effect on ants, especially if they carry it back to their nests. You can spread it under doors, near windows, and along the edges of your walls., Line your kitchen with adhesive tape, sticky-side up. No poison or messy powders necessary. When ants try to climb over the tape, they may stick to the adhesive – effectively stopping them in their tracks. Make sure that the ants can't crawl under the tape; try using double-sided tape, or taping the back of the tape to your floors, walls, and counters so that there is no room for ants underneath., Talc in various forms is thought to deter ants, although the mechanism is poorly understood. Tailor's chalk and baby powder usually contain talc, so you can use them to create a barrier for ants. Regardless of which form of talc you use: keep in mind that talc has been called out as a potential carcinogen.


Many sources recommend using normal chalk; however, this is made of gypsum, not talc. This misconception could be the result of confusion with ""ant chalk"", which is an insecticide that looks just like normal chalk. It was outlawed in the US in the 1990s, but you may still be able to find it in certain underground markets.
Some baby powder brands are made of corn starch, so they will not work effectively against ants. Check the ingredients before you build your barrier.

, You can also defend your home with scents and substances that ants don't like. Consider some combination of vinegar, peppermint oil, cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne pepper, whole cloves, and bay leaves.Be careful where you place your deterrents: keep peppers and spicy things away from curious pets and children.

The first few ants you see are “scout” ants looking for food or nesting sources. If you can address the problem while there are just a few ants, you are more likely to permanently remove them from your house.



 


Spray a solution of 1 part distilled white vinegar to 1 part water on entryway points or ant trails. The scout ants make trails that other ants can follow. Although this is tedious work, it can confuse them while you find your solution.





;
,

Take a close-up photo of the ant. Email it to the office and ask what type of ant you are dealing with. Local extension offices often keep files on local plants, insects and animals.






Ask for an information packet on ridding your house or yard of this type of ants. They may be able to give you special instructions on the best methods.






If you are dealing with carpenter ants, call an exterminator immediately. They can cause structural damage in the home.







,

If the ant nest is outside, this indicates that there are holes in the home allowing the ants to come in and look for food.






If the ant nest is inside, it indicates that you have soft, water-damaged areas of the home that need to be reconstructed. Remove damaged sections of the wall or cabinet, so that you can set bait on the nest itself.






If you know the ant nest is inside, but you are unable to get at the area, you may want to call a professional exterminator. Shortly after, you will want to get advice from a contractor about how to repair the damage to your home.

,

Chemicals are more likely to produce results quickly.






Curious pets or small kids are good reasons to try natural remedies first.







, Ant traps, keep the bait and chemicals inside a small plastic trap, meaning there is less mess and chemical distribution around your house.


Set the traps around ant entry points, such as windows, doorways or cracked foundations.
Look for traps that bait both sweet and grease eating ants. Ants’ food preferences change throughout the year, so these traps are more versatile.

, This natural remedy is extremely effective, if you have established where the nests are. It dries out the ants, killing them within 3 days.


Diatomaceous earth is a sedimentary rock made from fossilized algae. It absorbs lipids from the surface of insects, dehydrating them.
You can use borax by spreading it on nests and windowsills in a similar fashion. Although borax isn’t dangerous to adults, it can be toxic in large quantities and if eaten by small children.

, If you see ants away from the nest, then you can kill them where they are without using harsh chemicals.


Mix a solution of 2 tbsp. (30ml) of dishwashing liquid in 16 oz. (0.5l) of water. Pour it into a spray bottle.






Follow the ants and spritz them. Wipe up dead ants with paper towels.







,

Spray an insecticide on your lawn an hour after you mow it. Ants may start on the lawn and move closer to the house over time. Buy a lawn spray insecticide and repeat every year.






Trim bushes, trees and flowers that are close to the house. Letting plants touch the house creates bridges for the ants to find a pathway inside. Trim every year to avoid ant problems.






Seal up windows and foundation with sealing caulk. If you rent your home, then ask a landlord to caulk areas where you know there is a problem.







,

Vacuum your kitchen and dining areas daily. Even the smallest food crumbs can attract ants.






Discourage eating in other areas of the house.






Wipe counters with dishwashing liquid and water solutions or vinegar and water solutions. They will erase ant trails and clean surfaces.

Remove plants and pests that attract ants.,
Keep mulch, plants, and grass away from the foundation of your homes.,
Trim trees and bushes.,
Unclog gutters.,
Get rid of wood that is wet, rotted, or decaying.,
Repair leaks and wood rot quickly.,
Tackle the nest.",How to Control Ants2," To manage ants outside and keep them from congregating near your house, get rid of potential food sources such as ripened fruit from fruit trees or any plants infested with aphids.Ants are attracted to plants with aphids because the aphids leave behind a sweet substance called honeydew on the plants, which ants love., Ants nest and forage in plants, grass, and mulch, so keep these materials at least a foot away from the foundation of your home., Trimming trees and bushes around your house will prevent ants from dropping from overhanging branches or accessing your house as easily., Gutters that are clogged and filled with leaves, dirt, and other debris make a nice cozy home for an ant colony. Cleaning your gutters will help keep ants from establishing colonies in these locations., Certain types of ants such as carpenter ants are attracted to decaying wood, and they can cause significant structural damage if they establish a presence. Getting rid of any wood that is water damaged, rotting, or decaying is a good step to control ants outside your home.Keep firewood or other wood away from your house in the event that carpenter ants or ants attracted to decaying wood decide to make it their home. Storing the wood off the ground will also help protect it from ants.
Using pressure-treated wood will also help prevent decay and deter ants.
Don’t forget to remove stumps and fallen limbs on your property.

, To reduce the risk of an ant infestation, you should also repair any leaky pipes and roofs as soon as possible. Quickly replace wood that becomes waterlogged and rotted such as windowsills, door jambs, or decks., One of the most effective ways to control ants outside your home and prevent them from entering your house is to locate and eliminate the nest.Look for mounds or ant hills in your yard and around the perimeter of your home.
Ants also like to build nests under wood, stones, pavement, mulch, and gravel.
You can find many types of outdoor insecticides and ant bait at home-improvement stores. These are often in liquid or granule form, and you apply the product directly to the nest. Since these products are poisonous, be sure to follow the directions carefully, and do not use these methods indoors or around pets and children.
If you’re looking for a homemade option that is less toxic, try pouring soapy, boiling water on the nest."
"
Understand ant behavior.,
Pay attention to where you see ants in your home.,
Try to locate their nest.,
Make sure you aren’t dealing with carpenter ants or termites.,
Work with a pest control company.",How to Control Ants3," To more effectively control ants, you need to understand a few basic facts about their behavior:Ants are social insects that live in colonies. As a result, killing a few isolated ants won’t eliminate your ant problem.
If they enter your house, they are looking for protection from the weather, food, and water.
Most of the ants you see around your home or outside are worker ants, tasked with finding food and bringing it back to the colony. These ants leave behind an invisible chemical trail of pheromones to lead other ants to sources of food.
They will travel long distances from the nest to locate food, and don’t necessarily travel in a straight line along the way.
With the exception of a few species such as fire ants, ants are not aggressive and don’t deliver a painful bite or sting.

, Being aware of where ants are located in your home can help you diagnose and treat the source of your infestation.If the ants you observe inside your home seem to congregate around a window or door, this suggests the ants are currently living outside and traveling inside to locate food. You can probably control ants by sealing off entry points and eliminating food sources. Alternatively, you can attempt to locate and destroy their nest outside.
If you notice ants around electrical outlets, in cabinets, or cracks in your floor, they may be nesting somewhere inside your home. Unfortunately, these infestations can be harder to resolve because it’s difficult to locate the nest. You can attempt to use bait stations safe for indoor use and get rid of food sources, which should help control the ants.

, Destroying the nest inside or outside your home will offer the most long-term solution to your ant problem. You can locate an ant nest by observing and following the ants.They usually crawl single file, and you can get a pretty good idea of where they are headed and coming from.

, Ants, carpenter ants and termites can look similar, but carpenter ants and termites can cause much more serious damage to your home and property. Keep these facts in mind to make sure you are dealing with ants and not carpenter ants or termites:While termites and ants can both have wings when new queens leave after hatching to start a new colony, termite wings are much larger and longer.
Ants have a narrow body and waist, while termites are more rectangular and do not have any indentations on the body.
Ants are typically more visible than termites. While it is normal to see ants in the open, most termites avoid light and are more reclusive.
If you suspect you have a carpenter ant or termite rather than an ant problem, contact a pest control company for an inspection as soon as possible so they can begin treatment before the carpenter ants or termites cause irreversible damage.

, One of the most effective steps you can take to control ants is to work with a professional pest control company. They will be able to identify, diagnose, and treat your specific ant problem.Different ants may require different types of treatment to control the population.
Pest control companies often have access to products that are unavailable to most consumers, and highly effective.
Regular pest control visits and treatments can prevent ant problems before they start.

Use a spade to cut a trench around the ant colony.,
Use a large spade to dig out the colony.,
Shovel the soil into five-gallon buckets.,
Follow chambers and tunnels where possible.,
Sort through the buckets.,
Locate the queen.",How to Catch a Queen Ant2," This method will require more work but less expert timing. Begin by using a spade to cut a 6-8” radius trench around the entrance of the ant hill., Once you finish creating the trench, start shoveling out the area inside the trench, which will be comprised of the majority of the ant colony., You will need to dig up quite a bit of ground to reach all the various chambers of the colony, so keep two five-gallon buckets on hand and shovel the soil into them.Try to keep the clumps of earth as intact as possible so as not to collapse every tunnel as you dig the colony out.You also want to make sure that you cover each bucket as you will it to stop any queens from potentially escaping.
If you use this method on a brand new colony where the queen has just mated and is still digging out her nest, then you won’t have to dig very far, and you won’t have much to sift through to find her.Telltale signs for this type of brand new colony include a very small entrance hole with a small heap of fresh dirt beside it that hasn’t yet been formed into a mound., They can be hard to identify while working quickly, but you should especially follow chambers and tunnels in the soil as you dig out the colony. Keep collecting samples until you see very few ants left in the hole., Once you have collected the colony, you will have to sort through the buckets manually to find the queen. Use a spoon to sift through the dirt and separate ants.You may want to transfer the ants into smaller jars as you separate them and the soil.
For obvious reasons, you probably don’t want to do this inside your house.

, It will be a painstaking process, but you should eventually locate the queen as you go through the colony. If you are unsure of what exactly you are looking for, the queen will be the largest ant in the colony, and her middle section--the thorax--will be especially pronounced. You can consult How to Identify a Queen Ant for more assistance.

Squish the scouts.,
Use water.,
Bring down the nest.,
Kill the queen.",How to Stop Ants From Coming Into Your Home2," Colonies regularly send out lone ants to check for food sources. If you see an individual ant strolling across your coffee table, don't let it make it back to the nest alive. It'll tell the colony where you spilled the apple juice. If the scout makes it back to the nest and brings back some friends, they'll be following a scent trail, single file. Unless you're ready to bait them and wait them out – squish them all, and do it quickly.


Spray the trail with all-purpose cleaner or a bleach solution, then wipe it up with a wet paper towel. Spraying the nest can be effective, but you want to make sure that you get them all. If you only kill part of the colony, you may simply encourage some species of ant to establish new colonies – which ultimately won't stop ants from coming into your home.
For a less hands-on solution, vacuum them all up. Then, vacuum some talcum powder or diatomaceous earth to finish off the ants inside the vacuum cleaner. This second step is important: make sure that the ants don't survive their trip into the vacuum!
In a pinch, just use your hands or a damp towel. Squish the ants or wipe them into oblivion. You don't need any fancy methods to eliminate the scouts.

, If the ants are all over the floor, throw some water over them and wipe them up with a paper towel. If ants are on your bed, get a good handful of paper towels and a cup of water. Dip the towels into the water. Squeeze to let out all the extra water—you don't want to be sleeping on a soppy bed—and then wipe them all up.


Repeat this process as needed. You might need to do it many times to rid your home of all the ants.

, If ants continue to raid your home, you're going to have to raid theirs. If you're able to locate the nest, you can pour several gallons of boiling water into it to instantly kill most of the insects within. If you don't know where they're coming from, your best alternative is to bait them., The most permanent way to get rid of ants is to destroy their source: the ant queen. The queen produces a large number of ants, and she gives direction to the nest. Destroy the queen, and you'll scatter the ants. You can find the queen at the center of the ant nest. Follow the trail of ants back to the nest, if possible.


Consider hiring an exterminator. If the trail of ant-workers disappears into the wall of your kitchen, you'll find it much more difficult to trace. An exterminator can do this for you."
"
Don't leave food out.,
Remember that all it takes is one ant.,
Store food in airtight containers.,
Keep the sink clean.",How to Stop Ants From Coming Into Your Home3," These ants are coming into your home because there is something there for them: a food source or a warm environment. If you have a very dirty house, ants will multiply – so make sure that you clean daily. The cleaner you keep the house, the less they'll have to eat, and the more they'll look elsewhere for sustenance.Wipe down all surfaces. Spray tables and counter-tops with a mild bleach or vinegar solution. Make sure you keep up with a regular cleaning regimen: sweep, mop, and vacuum at least a few days each week.
If you do accidentally leave something out, take the opportunity to trace the trail of ants back to their source. It can be tempting to wipe out a swarm immediately – but try to think long-term about the problem.

, If you see a lone ant roaming your counters, it is acting as a scout. It is scoping out your kitchen for scents and food sources. If this ant discovers a perceived food source—even just a sticky sweet spot on the counter-top—it will carry the information back to its nest, and you'll have an infestation on your hands.

, Even if you've stashed your food in a cupboard, ants can still find their way in through the smallest of holes. If they can smell it and reach it, then they will swarm it. Putting food in airtight containers has the added bonus of keeping the food fresher.


Consider buying Tupperware or another brand of standardized, sealed containers. It may be easier to keep track of your containers (lids and bottoms) if you're using a uniform set.
Consider washing out resealable containers, then reusing them to store food. This might be a resealable yogurt tub, or a plastic takeout box, or even a lightly-used Ziploc bag.

, This means no dirty dishes, no standing water for ants to drink, and no food in the drain. If you clean your hands, food, and dishes in this sink, you want to make sure that it's a safe and sanitary environment.


Place pet-food bowls in a slightly larger bowl, then add some water to the larger bowl. This creates a moat around the pet food that the ants can't easily cross.

Keep food in an airtight plastic container.,
Wash the food bowls.,
Keep the feeding area clean.,
Shift the feeding area.,
Make a boundary around the food.,
Cover the outside of the bowl with petroleum jelly.,
Use essential oils safely.,
Use a lure to attract the ants.",How to Keep Ants Away From Cat Food1," Instead of keeping cat food in the bag, move the food from the bag to the plastic container after opening the bag. There are many of these available that are designed for pet food., Ants are attracted to crumbs and any food left behind. Wash the bowls at least once every two days, or more if possible. This is extremely important if you have an ant problem.Use a cat safe detergent and rinse thoroughly with fresh, clean water.

, Deter ants from getting interested in the food area in the first place by keeping it clean. Sweep up any crumbs or leftover food after your cat has finished eating. Mop the floor with vinegar or lemon mixtures to help dissuade ants from approaching.You may consider moving the bowl off the floor when your cat is not eating, or leaving it out during certain hours, but picking it up at night.

, You can also try to move the bowl to another place. This way the ants may not be able to find it. If you have ants coming into the room, move the bowl away from the ant colony.

, Try making a boundary around your cat's food bowl that ants can't cross. There are certain substances that will help repel ants.


Draw a line around the bowl with chalk.
Place a newspaper under the bowl and surround the bowl with a line of ground cinnamon, coffee grounds, chili powder, or ash.Surround the edge of the food container with petroleum jelly.
Spray vinegar or lemon on the floor around your pet's bowl. Mix 1 part vinegar or lemon juice to 1 part water. Place in a spray bottle and spray around the bowl, creating a boundary., A messy method to prevent ants from reaching the food is to smear the outside of the food bowl with petroleum jelly. The ants have trouble walking up the slippery surface.You can also place this on the outside of the moat container as an extra line of defense.

, Many essential oils can help repel ants. Try wiping down the floor around your cat's bowl with a damp cloth that contains a few drops of peppermint oil. Ants are repelled by the strong smell.You can also use lemon, orange, or grapefruit oil to repel ants. Try wiping the floor around the bowl with a cotton ball covered in the oil.Essential oils are natural products and do not contain chemicals; however, make sure your cat never ingests undiluted essential oils as these can be toxic. Any essential oil that is applied where a cat might accidentally lick should be well-diluted.

, A good way to keep the ants far from the bowl is to place commercial ant bait (under a cat-safe box) in the general area. Make sure that there is just a small hole for the ants to get in and eat the poison. At the same time, make sure your pet cannot access the bait.


One way might be to screw a box directly into the floor or deck. It might be possible to jamb the cover box behind a stove or refrigerator, but only if the space is excessively narrow for your cat to access it. Just remember that cats are curious and can get into unimaginable places.

Do not attempt to treat an infestation on your own.",How to Identify a Termite," Termites look similar to ants and need to be inspected closely to differentiate. If possible, trap one of the bugs in question for examination and look at it under a magnifying glass or something similar. You can pick up a termite by gently clasping it between your thumb and forefinger.Place the termite in something like a mason jar to examine it.
You can still examine a dead termite, but it may be easier to observe a live one. Pick up the bug carefully to avoid killing it.;
, Termites have distinctly different wings and antennae than ants. One way to tell you're dealing with a termite and not an ant is to carefully examine the bug's wings and antennae.Termites have four wings. All four wings are the same size as a termite's body. Ants' wings are different sizes.
Termites have two straight antennae. Ants' antennae are somewhat curved.

, If you can get a close enough look to count a termite's legs, do so. Termites have six legs. Their legs are short and stubby in appearance., Termites have three different types: winged termites, worker termites, and soldier termites. If you see different types of bugs around your house, you may be looking at different types of termites.Winged termites are dark brown or black. These are the termites you are likely to see and inspect.
Worker termites do not have wings, but still have six legs and the same antennae. They are white in appearance and sometimes translucent.
Soldier termites do not have wings and are brownish in colors. They have pincers near their heads, as well as antennae and six legs.

, You do not necessarily need to measure a termite and doing so may be difficult. However, try to note the rough size. Termites are about three eighths of an inch., Termites can cause damage to your home. In the event of an infestation, you may notice signs of damage. Your wood may sound hollow when you tap or knock against it. You may also notice your floors and ceilings are sagging. Crumbling wood and chipped paint can also indicate and infestation., You can often hear an infestation before you see it. Soldier termites sometimes tap their heads inside your walls. If you hear tapping noises in your home, this may be indicate a termite infestation., Termite droppings are another sign your home is infested. Droppings look like tiny pellets and may show up near walls or other places termites congregate. If you notice pellets piling up in your home, this is a sign of an infestation., Termites often build tubes of mud and dirt against walls. These are to protect termites from predators. Unusual tubes of mud running against walls in your home, often found outdoors, are a sign of termites. The structures look clay-like and dark brown.Termites often build mud tubes overnight, so you may notice them cropping up unexpectedly in the morning.

, A termite infestation can cause major damage to your home. It should be treated promptly by a professional. Select a reputable pest control company right away if you suspect you have termites.Make sure any company you choose is licensed with the Department of Agriculture. A company that's a member of the National Pest Management Association is also a plus.
Contact two to three companies to get estimates. It can be costly to deal with termites, so make sure you seek out the best deal.
Termites can cause damage, but do so slowly. It's okay to take some time selecting a quality company. If a company uses scare tactics to pressure you into signing a contract quickly, this is probably not a good company.

, Termites are usually treated with sprays and pesticides. While FDA approved pesticides should be safe for your health, if you're not comfortable with chemicals you can try sprays instead. Talk over your options with a pest control representative carefully to decide on the right treatment option for you.In addition to deciding between baits and sprays, talk about how much of your home to treat. Sometimes, a termite infestation can be cleared up with spot treatments or treating the perimeter of your home. Other times, your entire house will need to be treated.

, When using chemicals, your pest control company will give you specific instructions. You may have to stay out of your home for a certain period of time or remove your pets. You may want to consult a physician if you have a medical condition that may be worsened by exposure to chemicals., Treating a termite infestation is complicated and requires a specific set of skills. Under no circumstances should you attempt to treat an infestation yourself. Always talk to a professional exterminator to go over treatment options."

Try a boric acid bait.,
Clean up your house to make it a bad breeding ground for carpenter ants.,

Clean up crumbs and water leaks.",How to Get Rid of Carpenter Ants," Carpenter ants are large black or dark brown insects with three body segments and six legs. They have bent antennae. The worker ants are wingless, while the reproductive ants have wings. They tend to walk in long trails. Termites, which are a far worse problem to have, have straight antennae and light colored bodies. If you're dealing with termites, read this article.;
, Frass is a sawdust-like material left behind when ants bore into wood to make their nests. It will contains body parts and debris, but will basically look like a pile of light wood shavings. If you see this around your house, it's a telltale sign you've got an ant problem on your hands.

, Wood that is serving as a nest for ants will have slits or holes. You'll usually see frass scattered nearby as well. Ants like to nest in walls, hollow doors, cabinets, beams, and structural wood. Look for areas where the wood is slightly damp, since ants like to build their nests in moist wood.

, To find the nest, you'll need to lure the ants out with some bait, then trail them back to the nest so you can figure out exactly where they're hiding. Set out very small bits of honeydew or another sugary fruit near where you believe the nest to be located.

, When the ants take the bait, follow them back to the nest. You'll probably see them crawl into a space in the wall, a cabinet, or a door. Keep watching until you're sure where the nest is located.


If the nest is visible and accessible, you can get rid of the nest itself by moving to the next step.
If the nest is hidden and difficult to reach, you're going to want to use the toxic bait to kill the ants. It will take about three days to go into effect.

, This method is best to use if the nest is hidden or inaccessible. You'll use toxic bait to lure the ants out of the nest; they'll carry it back to the nest, and within about three days the ant population will be poisoned. Buy some carpenter ant toxic gel bait and mix it with a spoonful of sugar and a spoonful of milk. Set some out near where you suspect the ants live. Wait for the ants to come out and take the bait.


It is essential that the bait you use be slow acting. If it kills the worker ants on their way back to the nest, the thousands of ants still back at the nest won't be affected. Choose a bait that takes about three days to work.Never spray the line of carpenter ants you see coming from the nest with insecticide. This won't harm the ants still lying in wait, and could actually cause them to sense danger and spread out to build more nests.If you have pets or small children, tamper-resistant bait stations are a safer option for dispensing toxic baits.

, This method is effective when you can access the nest easily and apply carpenter ant dust directly to the queen and the entire colony. Choose a carpenter ant dust and follow the instructions on the package to apply the dust to the nest.


Diatomaceous earth is a natural, nontoxic dust that can be used to kill carpenter ants without bringing poisons into your home.
Other chemical dust such as Delta Dust and Drione Pest Insecticide Dust is also effective, but it does contain toxins and could pose health risks to pets and children.

,


Buy boric acid at a garden supply store.
Mix with powdered sugar, in a ratio of about 1/3 sugar to 2/3 boric acid.
Fill bottle caps with the mixture. Set down around the area where you observe the ants.
When they return it to the nest, it will kill the ants in the nest. Boric acid penetrates the ant's body and dissolves inside of the ant.

, Do this by cleaning floors well, fixing any leaky faucets that might dampen wood, and removing any clutter that creates shelter for them.

, Use caulk to seal your foundation and cracks around doors, windows, and any other areas where ants could get into your home. Install screens on your windows and doors.

, Cut tree limbs back so they aren't hanging directly over your house. Clean up weeds, leaves, wood piles, and other natural debris that's close to your house and could be harboring an ant population.

, Ants need sugar, protein and water sources to survive. Keeping these basic needs away from them is the best way to prevent them from infesting your home. Keep the floors and counters free of crumbs and clean up spills, especially sugary spills. Fix faucet leaks and make sure there's no accessible water in the area."

Pick your poison.,
Mix the bait carefully.,
Administer the bait.,
Wait for the ants to show up.,
Move the bait closer and closer to the nest.",How to Stop Ants From Coming Into Your Home4," Mixing boric acid powder or borax with maple syrup is the most common bait; some popular commercial ant poisons essential monetize this mix. Boric acid affects ants both externally (when in powder form; similar to diatomaceous earth) and internally (when ingested). The ants bring the poison (borax or boric acid) with them to the colony and spread it around. If you get the quantity and timing just right, you can wipe out a large colony, but it might take anywhere from several weeks to a few months., A bait that's too strong will kill the ants before they make it home, and a bait that's too weak will only weaken the colony temporarily. Be intentional about your increments. The idea is for the poison to spread all throughout the colony before it begins to kill the unwitting ants.The boric acid kills the ants; the water dilutes the boric acid; and the sugar attracts the ants. Try the following recipes:


Mix 1 cup water, 2 cups sugar, and 2 tablespoons boric acid.
Mix 3 cups of water, 1 cup of sugar, and 4 teaspoons of boric acid.

, Try letting the mixture sit in an upturned lid or a low dish for easy access. If you have pets or small children, leave the bait in a container that will allow ants to enter, but isn't wide enough for larger creatures to get at the poison. Carefully shake the poison into the bottom of a metal can. Crush one side of the can, but leave a gap that is just thin enough for ants to get inside. , Remove any deterrents, if you used them; the idea of baiting is to attract the ants so that they'll defeat themselves. Don't lure new ants with the bait, or else you might attract new colonies.

, Once there's a line of busy and scavengers, place the bait next to the trail. The mass of ants will shift to swirl around the bait. Keep moving it further from your kitchen and closer to where the ants are entering your home.


Be careful not to place the bait directly on top of the ant trail. You'll confuse them and interrupt their march home, making your baiting strategy less effective.

Remove any ants already in your cat's food bowl.,
Wash the bowl.,
Clean the food area.,
Find a moat container.,
Fill the container with water.,
Place the food bowl in the moat container.,
Empty the moat container as needed.,
Keep up this process.",How to Keep Ants Away From Cat Food2," Dump out the ants and remaining contaminated food. Immediately close the bag and take outside. This helps keep the ants from crawling back out and getting back into the food., Ants leave pheromones behind that attract more ants, so make sure to thoroughly wash out the bowl with hot water and detergent. If the bowl is dishwasher friendly, you can put it through your dishwasher., After removing the ants, clean the area around the food. You have to remove the pheromone trail so ants from the colony won't return. Try using vinegar or lemon juice to erase the scent and deter future ants from approaching.You can also mop the area around the food container, or the entire kitchen floor. You can use what you normally use to mop, or use dish soap., Look for a shallow container that is wider than the cat food bowl. You can use a silver tray, a cake pan, a pie pan, a roasting tray, or anything else that will fit the cat bowl in.Make sure the container you put the cat bowl in isn't too big. However, there should be about an inch between the edge of the moat and the food bowl. This distance helps keep ants away.Some companies manufacture bowls that already incorporate the moat around the bowl's edge. These are great and easy to use and the entire bowl can be picked up and cleaned in one go. However, if you don't want to spend the money on that before seeing if it works, you can try this DIY method.

, Place a small amount of water in the moat container. You don't want to fill it too high so it spills into the food, but want enough water to provide a barrier for the ants. Ants aren't good swimmers, so it should drown or deter the ants from crossing.To help keep ants from crossing the water, try placing some vegetable oil, lemon essential oil, or dishwashing soap into the moat water. But only add dishwashing liquid if the space between the moat and food bowl is too small for the cat to drink from., Put the food bowl in the water. Make sure there is at least a 1-inch space between the edge of the moat and the food bowl. Fill the food bowl with fresh food.


If the container is extra large, put the food bowl close enough to its edge so your cat will be able to reach the food without difficulty, but far enough from the edge the ants won't be able to hop across.
If the food bowl is too short, use a block or other item to raise the food bowl above the edge of the moat container., The water may contain some drowned ants or spilled food. It will need refreshing as it begins to evaporate.

, Eventually, the ants will stop coming. In some places, like in warmer climates, you may have to feed your cat in this manner persistently as the ants never go away.

Retreat your house on schedule.",How to Get Rid of Termites," You may not see direct evidence of termite infestation, but that doesn't mean you should remain ignorant of it. Sagging floors, holes in woodwork and hollow parts of your foundation are all serious warning signs of termites. You may actually see the termites themselves, as well.


Take a screwdriver and flashlight with you to your basement, and examine crawlspaces and foundation beams by tapping on the wood to check for hollowness and to push the screwdriver into the wood to test for strength. If the wood gives easily and falls apart, you may have a termite problem on your hands.
When performing this examination, also be sure to keep an eye out for termite wastes. Termite droppings are wood colored or darker brown pellets of excrement. The presence of these droppings near weakened wood could indicate an infestation. You may also find a termite nest on your property; a subterranean termite infestation will build a system of tunnels and tubes of mud, while a drywood termite infestation will present itself in a nest inside the wood.;
, There are two general types of termites that might infest your home: subterranean and drywood termites. The former are found in both the soil around your home and the wood of your home, while the latter thrive solely in wood (not soil). Subterranean termites are found mostly in warm, coastal regions - primarily California, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Georgia. Drywood termites can be found anywhere in the states.


Subterranean termites can be found in wood and compost piles around your home, in addition to the foundational wood.
Subterranean termites typically do much more damage to a home than drywood, and may require different treatment methods., Take a couple flat strips of cardboard, wet them, and stack them on one another in an area where termites are likely to be. Because termites feed on cellulose (cardboard), this makes for an excellent spot trap. When the cardboard is infested with termites, take it out in a safe area and burn it. Repeat multiple times, if necessary.



Note: This spot trap will not solve all your termite problems. It is a quick fix to remove several hundred termites, often at a time. Combine this method with other fixes to deliver a more powerful punch.

, Beneficial nematodes are small unsegmented worm species that are natural parasites to garden pests, including termites. These nematodes search for hosts, such as termite larvae, and burrow into them, usually causing death within 48 hours. They use the host's carcass as a place to spawn.


You can purchase beneficial nematodes at your local garden supply store or online. Currently, there are about five varieties produced for sale.For use in soil temperatures above 60 °F (16 °C), nematodes should be used immediately after they are purchased. If you do not use them immediately, store them in a refrigerator. Plant them in the early morning or after sunset, as UV light will harm them.

, If the termite-infested item is not your home but rather a piece of furniture or an item that can be removed from your home, expose it to sunlight. Termites thrive in darkness, and the heat and light from the sun will kill them. On a sunny day, place your furniture outside for as long as possible - preferably 2-3 days.


This method works well in conjunction with the cardboard trap method for capturing/killing the termites.

, If you’re in a rainy area and can’t expose your furniture to sunlight, consider an alternative of freezing your furniture to kill the termites. Place your pieces (or parts of your pieces) of wooden furniture into a large freezer for 2-3 days. Although this can be tricky for large pieces of furniture, if you’re able the freezer method should guarantee the death of the termites., Boric acid is one of the most common and effective ways to dispatch of termites. In fact, it is the main insecticide used in many store-bought termite insecticides. Boric acid shuts down the termite's nervous system while dehydrating it.


The best way to kill termites with boric acid is to use bait stations.

Coat or spray wood (or another cellulose material) evenly with boric acid.
Plant the boric acid bait in the garden near your house or in an open infestation.
Check on the bait station regularly and replenish it with boric acid as needed. You should see the termite carcasses nearby.



, Readily available at your local hardware supply store, using termite-control products is the first step you need to take to get rid of these harmful pests. You can use termite-baiting control methods or a liquid termite-killing product. Lay the bait near infested areas and spray the termite control product on those same areas.

, Because heat will kill termites, you can have your home heated to a high temperature to kill them. This must be done by a professional though, as the tools required aren’t available for anyone to purchase/use. Call your local bug infestation control company, and see if this is an option for your home., If you decide that your infestation is simply too big, or the house is simply too important not to get it right the first time, you should probably call a professional extermination service. When you call professional exterminators, be sure that you:


Get at least three different quotes from competing firms.
Look at the service record of the firm from the Structural Pest Control Board before you decide on employing them.
Get a written agreement from the firm you are using insisting on complete termite extinction for two years. This may require the firm to come back periodically, check for new infestations, and clear them away — at no cost to you.

, In most states you can legally purchase the same products used by the professionals when you are using them for personal use only. Two top of the line products are Termidor SC and Taurus SC which are applied as a liquid around the exterior perimeter of your home. These products can be purchased online at a very economical price. For about a hundred dollars, you can treat an average size house yourself and get professional results if you are willing to provide the labor.

, Termites are naturally drawn to damp and moist habitats because they need water to survive. So make sure you ratchet up your vigilance about keeping things dry, or else termites will invade.


Make sure all leaks and standing water, both inside and outside of your home are secured and dry. Broom away or suction up any unwanted water if possible.
Dirty wet gutters are also an ideal home for termites, so keep your gutters free of debris for further prevention, too.

, Adding 0.1% (approximately 1 tablespoon to a gallon) permethrinto paint or wood polish or wallpaper glue while building or repainting the house will keep termites away permanently. You can even add permethrin to the cement you use to lay flooring or the glue you use to lay wooden flooring. Since permethrin is a safe pesticide approved for human use, there is no added risk of toxicity.

, Termites obviously feed heavily on wood so keep large amounts of firewood and other loose tree trunks and branches away from your home. If you maintain large amounts of wood on your property, you are only inviting a termite feast. If you must keep wood near your home, cover it completely to keep it dry; this will minimize the attraction for the termites. If you must use wood, treat it with permethrin as above.

, By simply caulking and sealing the windows, doorways and cracks around your home, you are taking the first and important steps toward making sure that no termites invade and infest your property. Gaps around electrical wiring and pipes to and from your house are another easy way for termites to traffic themselves into your home.


Screens on your doors, window and porch are also a necessity if you are wary of a termite infestation.

, One of the most effective ways to keep your home safe from termite damage is to maintain a protective barrier around the exterior perimeter of your home. Fortunately, this need not be a major expense if you do it yourself with professional quality products like Termidor SC or Taurus SC. Both of these contain the termiticide/insecticide Fipronil at the same concentration and are applied as a liquid around the outside perimeter of your home. Fipronil is very low in toxicity and is highly effective against both termites and ants.

Add cooking or vegetable oil to the barrel.",How to Prevent Mosquito Breeding in Rain Barrels," Instead of an open topped rain barrel, consider using a rain barrel with a downspout diverter. This creates a closed system, making mosquito breeding unlikely, if not impossible;
, This is probably the easiest way to keep mosquitoes at bay. Simply use your rain barrel regularly. Mosquitoes cannot breed in flowing water, only stagnant water. So, if you use your rain barrel regularly, there will not be an opportunity for mosquitoes to breed., Add between 1/4 teaspoon and 1/8 teaspoon per gallon of water. So, roughly 1-2 oz in a 50 gallon drum. This is drinking water safe per EPA and CDC guidelines, so it is well below anything that would bother your plants.It has the added benefit of also fighting algae., These are very simple to use. They are available at most online retailers and big box hardware stores. They cost between US$1-2 each and last 1 to 3 months each. They stay in the tank, so you only need to add another once they disappear., Though messy, this is the most organic method (other than regular use). A quarter of a cup of oil will be sufficient in the average sized rain barrel. The oil floats on top and does not allow the mosquitoes to breed, or will suffocate any larvae.

The only issue with this method is that you can only drain the barrel to the oil level, unless you want to add more oil each time it fills.

Heed the scouts.,
Clean dirty dishes immediately after using them.,
Sweep and vacuum the kitchen area daily.,
Rinse residue off containers.,
Seal all food items in containers.",How to Get Rid of Ants Naturally1," The first sign of ants in your kitchen is a warning to you. Scout ants are wandering ants, either singular or relatively few in number. They investigate your kitchen for food and supplies. If these ants return to the nest to inform the other ants, more will be on the way.Waste no time:


Cleaning your kitchen
Sealing all food and removing all sources of sticky, sweet, greasy, and meaty foods from their access.;
, Wash all dishes as they're used or place them into the dishwasher and shut the door tight. Wipe down all of your cupboard, benchtop, and counter surfaces with vinegar.


Vinegar not only cleans and disinfects, it is also an ants deterrent.
Remove all sources of garbage and keep the kitchen bin shut tightly.
Rinse all recyclable containers before putting them into storage., Food that's fallen on your floor or been lost in your kitchen's nooks and crannies will be an open invitation to ants. Crumbs and bits of food that have gotten caught in kitchen area rugs will attract ants in the same way.


If you're prone to forgetting to sweep and vacuum your kitchen area, you might want to try getting into the habit of doing it at the same time every day, like after breakfast or dinner.

, In particular, check jam/jelly jars, sauce bottles, pickle bottles, cordial bottles and honey and syrup containers. Place your honey jar and any other sugary ant favorites inside a bowl of water.For more details on the bowl of water technique, check out How to keep ants out of honey and How to keep ants away from cat food.

, Use airtight containers or similar ant-proof containers for food storage. Be relentless with this for 3 to 7 days. The ants, having nothing to eat, will go elsewhere. This works because the ants are following the chemical trails left by other ants, who did find food.You may also need to seal fragrant items such as cleaning powders, deodorants, and the like in case these attract the ants' initial attention. Be alert to any congregations of ants around non-food sources."

Sprinkle it at entry sites.,
Create a barrier line.,
Use cinnamon essential oils.,
Place sticks down.",How to Get Rid of Ants with Cinnamon1," The simplest method of using cinnamon is just to grab what you have in the cupboard. Add a dash or two where you see the ants entering the house. The cinnamon is so strong that it disrupts the trails the ants are trying to make, and they'll stop coming in that way., Instead of just sprinkling it, you can also use cinnamon to make a line that ants won't cross. If you see them in certain areas, try using a cotton swab to make a line across that area. Rub it in the cinnamon and spread it in a single, thin line., If you want to go a step further with your cinnamon, try using essential oil instead of the powdered stuff. It tends to be more potent. You can simply dip a cotton swab in it and then rub the oil along the areas where you've seen ants.Some other essential oils may also repel ants. The easiest way to spread essential around your home is by making a solution with water. Then you just spray it around your home in areas where you've been seeing ants.Start with a 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of water and a 1/4 cup of vodka (60 milliliters). The vodka helps keep the solution mixed together well. However, if you don't have it, substitute extra water (another 1/4 cup) for the vodka, and shake well before each use.
Add essential oils. Try adding 20-25 drops of cinnamon oil. Shake well.
Try other essential oils. You'll need 15 drops of tea tree oil, 15 drops of peppermint oil, and 7 drops of citrus oil (such orange, lemon, or lime). You can substitute 3 drops of clove in place of the citrus. Shake thoroughly.
However, if you want to use it in food areas, replace the tea tree oil with more peppermint oil.

, Another less messy option is using cinnamon sticks instead of the powder. Lay them out next to entrances you've seen. In fact, you can place sticks around anywhere you've seen ants. You can find cinnamon sticks in the bagged spice section of the grocery store."

Consider going from least harmful to most harmful approach first.,
Kill off the ant trail.,
Squish the scouts.,
Root out the ants already well entrenched in your pantry or other cupboard space.,
Consider using a borax bait made at home.,
Vacuum up the ants.,
Make a mixture of rubbing alcohol, dish soap and water.,
Get a ""Deep Reach"" fumigator (aka ""fogger"").",How to Get Rid of Ants1," Not only is this better for your health but it's also kinder for the environment.;
, A line of ants can be dealt with effectively and quickly so as to kill those in the line and deter any others from continuing to follow the trail. It is recommended to begin with locating the entry point first and creating a barrier straight away, such as a line of petroleum jelly, upturned duct tape or talc, so that the ants outside stop using the entryway. Then, try one of the following methods to deal with the ant trail:


Dip a sponge into soapy water. Simply wipe the sponge down the trail, collecting ants. Rinse them down the drain. Rinse and repeat as often as required until all ants in the trail have been removed.
Spray the trail with all-purpose cleaner or a bleach solution. Wipe it up with a wet paper towel. Spraying the nest can be effective, but you really want to make sure you get them all, otherwise killing part of the colony can simply encourage certain species to establish new colonies, which is counter-productive to you.

, Colonies regularly send out lone ants to check for food sources. If you see an individual ant strolling across your coffee table, don't let it make it back to the nest alive. It'll tell the colony where you spilled the apple juice. If the scout made it back to the nest and brought back some friends, they'll be following a scent trail, single file. Unless you're ready to bait them, kill them all quickly.


, You'll need to use an attractive poison bait to get the ants scurrying home with new ""treats"" from their food hunting missions. Mixing boric acid powder or borax with water and sugar is the most common bait.Boric acid affects ants both externally (when in powder form; similar to diatomaceous earth) and internally (when ingested).Make a mixture of 1 cup water, 2 cups sugar, 2 tablespoons boric acid.Wait for the ants to show up. Don't lure new ants with the bait because you could attract new colonies. Once there's a trail, place the bait next to it (not on it, or else you'll interrupt their march home). You can also place it in a safe part of the pantry where ants appear to be congregating.
If you have pets and/or children around (see Warnings below) use the bait in a jam jar where ants can go to seek ""food"". Screw the lid tightly and seal with adhesive tape. Pierce the lid with two or three small holes large enough for ants, and smear the outside with a little bit of non-poisoned bait to advertise the contents for ants. If you're concerned about the jar getting knocked over and the poisoned bait spilling out, loosely pack the inside above the bait with cotton balls.You can mix peanut butter as well. Ants' cravings vary depending on the needs of the colony (sometimes they want sweets, sometimes they want something oily), so providing both will increase the likelihood that they'll take the bait. Once they've had their fill, remove all bait which may lose its poison when weathered, but still attract ants. You don't want to attract a neighboring colony.

, Use 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of borax, 1 teaspoon of water. Mix well. Place a small amount on little pieces of cardboard where the ants are active. Watch them swarm it and carry back to nest.


If it kills them too quickly, try 1 1/2 teaspoons of borax. You want them to carry it back and kill the colony and the queen.


, Sprinkle and vacuum a little talcum powder or diatomaceous earth to finish them off in the vac and in the trash where you dispose of it. This second step is important to make sure that you don't provide the ants a new home inside your vacuum cleaner.


, Get a spray bottle, making sure to wash it out very well, and place about a teaspoon of rubbing alcohol and about a teaspoon and a half of dish soap. Then fill the spray bottle with water about an inch (2.5cm) away from the top and close it up tight. Shake the solution until bubbles start to appear and then you're ready to spray! Because of the alcohol in the solution, the ants will stay clear away from it.


, These are reported to kill ants for 6 to 8 months, with the downside being that you may have to stay out of the place you fumigate for anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Search online for product reviews and inquire at local home improvement stores. Make sure you know the volume of the place you need to fumigate. If you're concerned about the use of potentially harmful chemicals in the home environment, this is not the approach for you and should not be used, if you have children, whose immune systems are still developing.

Identify ant access points.,
Seal all entrance holes with silicone caulk.,
Arm yourself with a spray bottle of soapy water.",How to Get Rid of Ants Naturally2," While you clean your kitchen and get on ant scout patrol, do some scouting work of your own. Can you tell where the ants are entering the house? Follow the first ants to see where they're entering and leaving.


Popular routs of ingress for ants include things like gaps in the woodwork, cracks in cement, vents, screens, cracks in the floorboards, and so on., Alternatively, you can use putty, glue or plaster. Temporary methods of blocking ant access to your home include petroleum jelly or poster tack.


If you use a temporary sealant (such as poster tack), only use this until you can purchase a more permanent solution, as it will deteriorate over time and the gap will open again., Soapy water will both kill ants and destroy their chemical trail. This will prevent more ants from following in their tracks.This cheap and easy method consists simply of:


Putting one teaspoon of liquid dish soap into a spray bottle and filling it with water. Add mint oil, citrus peels, or citrus rind oil to make this spray extra potent.Spritzing the ants you see with the solution in your spray bottle.

"
"
Put up defensive barriers.,
Sprinkle around deterring odors.,
Use bay laurel or bay leaves to keep ants from attractants.,
Sprinkle Splenda over ant trails.,
Use coffee grounds.,
Use dish soap with baking soda.",How to Get Rid of Ants Naturally3," Many of the products that form these natural ant barriers are probably already in your kitchen; they just need to be deployed properly. A barrier doesn't need to be wider than a ¼ of an inch (6.35mm) but it must form an unbroken line.Use barriers on places like sills, floors, counters, and around ant access points. Some of the items with which you can form barriers include:Powdered charcoal
A line of chalk
Turmeric
Cinnamon
Citrus oil
Black pepper, cayenne pepper, or red chili pepper.
Vaseline (great for doors and windows)
Baby powder
Powdered cleanser
White vinegar and water
Desiccating dusts (such as diatomaceous earth or silica aerogel), Ants dislike various scents. Some of these include peppermint, camphor, and garlic.These can be used fresh or in oil form as a deterrent for ants in an area of your home. Use camphor with caution, as it is poisonous to humans and animals.


The great thing about these fragrant deterrents is that your own preferences for scent can be used to improve the overall smell of your household odors.
Sprinkle crushed mint leaves in ant infested rooms and grow mint near the entrance areas. Dried peppermint is also effective.Rub a raw clove of garlic over ant trails and entrances.
Sprinkle lavender oil in ant afflicted areas and grow lavender near their entrances.
Spread some oil of clove in ant zones or crush cloves and sprinkle it as a barrier., Ants are especially attracted to sugar, paprika, and flour. Put bay or bay laurel leaves in your sugar can, flour container, and paprika jar.Over time, the ant repelling strength of these leaves and lose potency. Replace these every month for best results.

, This is not a danger to kids, so it's a great technique to use where children congregate, such as at school. It's also pet safe, making this a great option if you have animals. Sprinkle Splenda over the trails of any ants you see.


Once the ants consume the Splenda, they should die shortly after the fact. Be sure to replenish your Splenda as necessary., Spread coffee grounds on ant hills and along your house foundation. This safe material confuses the worker ants because they lose their scent trails. This causes the hatched young in the ant colonies to have no food and starve.


Be persistent and patient with your use of grounds. It may take a season before you start noticing an effect.
It is important to reapply grounds every year, at minimum. Refreshing grounds more frequently will have a stronger, more immediate effect.

, Combine a small amount of dish soap and baking soda in a bucket half filled with water. Agitate this mixture with your hand or a stirring implement. Spread a thin line of this liquid along area where ants are coming in.This technique is a great solution for dealing with ants that are invading windowsills.

Create your own ant baits with boric acid and maple syrup.,
Use food against ants.,
Deal with carpenter ants as naturally as possible.",How to Get Rid of Ants Naturally4," You can buy ant baits, but those will likely be chemical preparations that don't fit well with natural attempts to control ants in the home. It's easy to make your own ant baits. A particularly effective one is made with boric acid. Boric acid and sodium borate salts are naturally found in minerals like sassolite.When ants walk in or over boric acid, they ingest it and die. Boric acid is poisonous and should not be ingested or come in contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Handle it with gloves.A sample boric acid bait could be made with boric acid and maple syrup. Drizzle a spoonful of syrup on a plate or saucer. Sprinkle this liberally with boric acid.Use a skewer, toothpick, or cotton swab to distribute the acid evenly through the syrup.
Place your boric acid bait wherever the ants are frequenting. Keep it out of the reach of children or pets. This method can take a week to take effect., There are many foods ants are unable to digest. These methods are effective, though you might have to clean up dead ants after the fact. Spread the following bait foods where the ants are appearing:



Corn meal. This method is especially great around pets or children, as cornmeal itself is not poisonous.
Cream of wheat (farina). Spread this raw where there are ants. It will expand in their stomachs, killing them.
Coffee grounds. Ants are sensitive to caffeine. Leave used coffee grounds where the ants will carry it home and eat it. This method takes a few weeks for results., An invasion of carpenter ants is serious. They can compromise or damage your house structure. Piles of broken wings and ants with longer than average bodies are indications of carpenters. You may also see fecal pellets (which look like sawdust) and they can sometimes be heard rustling in the walls. Some ways to deal with them include:Baiting them. They like sugar, so you can turn this against them. Use the boric acid method described previously.
Vacuuming their nests out of infested walls, if possible.
Calling an exterminator. Professionals can drill holes in the wall and blow in diatomaceous earth, silica aerogel, or boric acid inside to eliminate the infestation. Pyrethrin spray can also be used.

"
"
Verify the exterminator uses natural pesticides.,
Call a professional to deal with fire ants.,
Follow all advice given by exterminators.,
Attack the nest directly on your own.",How to Get Rid of Ants Naturally5," Some exterminators specialize in using natural pest control methods. Search for one near you by doing an online keyword search for ""organic insect and pest control"" or ""natural insect and pest extermination.""


This kind of pest control is often poorly regulated. Some pest services are only ""organic"" or ""natural"" in name, but not in fact.
Call exterminators and inquire directly about services, saying something like, ""Could you tell me how your methods are all natural?""

, Fire ants rarely enter the home, but if they do, get help immediately. They're aggressive, and their stings are painful and can sometimes trigger an allergic reaction.


If the ants must be sprayed, insist on the use of a bait that has an insect growth regulator, like abamectin, in it., Exterminators are professionals who have been trained not only in pest removal but also prevention. If you've had difficulty with any of the techniques mentioned here, ask the exterminator for their advice.


For example, you may have looked high and low but were unable to find the ants' entrance into your home. An exterminator could help pinpoint this for you.

, Although you're not a professional, using this professional technique can have professional results. Sneak up on an ant nest on a cool day. Then pour several gallons/liters of boiling water into the nest entrance.


If you want to make the water more deadly, add vinegar, insecticidal soaps, citrus oil, pyrethrum insecticide, or ammonia.Repeat this process every day or so until it seems that the ants have given up and moved. This may take several days to take effect."
"
Try white vinegar.,
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth.,
Pour boiling water on mounds outside.,
Spread out bay leaves.",How to Get Rid of Ants with Cinnamon2," Vinegar is such a strong smell that ants will often avoid it. Put some in a spray bottle to use around your kitchen. It's perfectly safe. Just clean your counters first. Then, spray them down lightly with vinegar. Let it dry. The smell will soon dissipate.In fact, spraying vinegar directly on ants may kill them.Reapply if you see more ants.

, Diatomaceous earth has been used as a natural deterrent for ants for years. It's non-toxic, so it's safe to use around kids and pets. However, make sure you get the food-safe variety, not the kind used to filter pools. Then just sprinkle it around where you've been seeing ants., One way to help reduce the number of ants is to use very hot water. The boiling water won't destroy the whole colony, but it will kill about two-thirds of it. Try about 3 gallons (11 L) of boiling water for each large anthill you see.Be very careful with this method. You can be burned both by the water and the steam.

, An old-fashioned deterrent is bay leaves. You can find bay leaves on the spice aisle, and they are usually still whole (though you can buy ground, too). Spread them out on places where you see ants, and often, the ants will not go in that area."
"
Locate the nest.,
Try a homemade solution.,
Kill the queen.",How to Get Rid of Ants2," If you can find the source, carefully dig/puncture the soil and dump several gallons of boiling water into the nest. That should take care of the entire colony.

, Mix one part camphor oil with 9 parts denatured alcohol (ethyl alcohol that has a chemical added to stop humans from enjoying it), may be methylated spirits containing poison non-drinking alcohol. Pour over the anthill., The best way to get rid of ants is to destroy their source: the ant queen. She produces a large number of ants and killing her will exterminate them; if you can, find and kill the queen inside the ant nest. She's rather shy and will hide in the bottom. This method is not recommended, if the ants are aggressive and/or sting.

Put food in airtight containers.,
Wipe down all surfaces.,
Keep on top of your regular cleaning regimen.,
Keep the sink clean.,
Put pet food bowls in a slightly larger bowl.",How to Get Rid of Ants3," This also has the added bonus of keeping your food fresher. Also, should bugs that come in egg form in the foodstuffs hatch, they're caught inside the container, making their disposal easy and preventing their spread through the entire pantry. It's definitely worth the initial outlay on good storage containers.

, Tables and countertops should be regularly sprayed and cleaned with a mild bleach or vinegar solution.

, Sweep, mop, and vacuum regularly.

, Avoid leaving dirty dishes and standing water for ants to drink and do not put food in the drain. Remove all in-sink disposal scraps as soon as added.

, Add some water to the larger bowl, creating a moat around the pet food that the ants can't easily cross. Refill regularly.

"
"
Barricade your home.,
Use caulk.,
Line suspected entryways with deterrent substances.,
Apply scents and substances that ants don't like.,
Create a landscape buffer.",How to Get Rid of Ants4," Since ants are tiny, they can find thousands of tiny doorways into your residence. Some of these are easy to identify, while others will only be discovered when there's a parade of ants marching through the chosen ant doorway.


, Seal windows, doors and any cracks the ants crawl through with caulk. An additional benefit of doing this is better temperature control and lower energy bills. Plus, it's one of the least risky methods when kids or pets are involved.

, Salt, chalk, baby powder and talc can be spread under doors, near windows and walls.


Keep in mind that there are concerns about the potential carcinogenicity of talc., Vinegar, peppermint oil, cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne pepper, whole cloves, and bay leaves are all examples that have varying claims of success.However, some of these might be harmful to pets and irritants to curious children.

, Ants often enter homes through nearby shrubs, vegetation, or overhanging trees. To eliminate this problem, create a dry, plant-free border by trimming or getting rid of overhanging trees, cutting back vegetation that is touching your home, and laying down a perimeter of gravel or rock."

Find a large box fan.,
Use zip ties or magnets to attach a mesh screen over one side.,
Let the fan run.,
Kill the mosquitoes with diluted isopropyl alcohol.",How to Kill Mosquitoes1," You can purchase a high-volume fan which sucks air in rather than out when compared to traditional fans from a home improvement store or a department store. Choose one with a metal frame, since you'll be using magnets in this trap. With this and a few other supplies, you can create a trap that will reduce the number of mosquitoes around at least in the short term. Its effect on long-term populations is unknown, but following the advice in the breeding prevention section as well is recommended.If you are trapping mosquitoes in your yard, you may need a long extension cord as well, so you can plug the fan into an indoor outlet.;
, Cover the front of the fan completely with a length of fine, insect-proof, metal mesh. Use several strong zip ties








, Whenever an area is overrun with mosquitoes, turn on the fan and let it run for at least a few hours. There will usually be a noticeable reduction in the number of mosquitoes for a day or two, although whether this translates to a long-term reduction is unclear.








, Mix an equal amount of 70% isopropyl alcohol and water into a spray bottle. Spray the solution (alcohol and water) on the screen to kill them, avoiding the central fan motor.You can now leave the screen of dead mosquitoes outside to feed other animals, or shake them into an exterior trash can. The screen is reusable.










Consider picking moths or other non-mosquito insects off the screen before spraying.

Gather your materials.,
Make a mark halfway down the plastic bottle.,
Draw a circle around the bottle 4 inches from the lid.,
Cut the plastic bottle in half.Cut carefully along your marked guide line until the bottle is in two sections.,
Measure 1/4 cup of brown sugar.,
Heat up 1-1 1/3 cup of hot water.,
Pour the hot water into the lower half of the bottle.,
Pour the brown sugar into the lower half of the bottle.,
Allow the mixture to cool.,
Add 1 gram of yeast to the plastic bottle.,
Hold the top half of the bottle upside down.,
Place the top half upside down inside the bottom part of the bottle.Push the top inside gently until the cut edges align.,
Secure the edges with tape.,
Place the trap on a sturdy surface near the mosquitos.,
Notice when the bottle is full of dead insects or is ineffective.,
Change the yeast and sugar solution when necessary.",How to Make a Plastic Bottle Mosquito Trap," You will all of the items below to make a plastic bottle mosquito trap. Every item is easily found at your local grocery and hardware store.


An empty, plastic 2 liter bottle
A marker or pen
A box cutter
A tape measure
1/4 cup brown sugar
1-1 1/3 cup hot water
1 gram of yeast
Measuring cup
Tape (duct, scotch, or electrical are fine);
, About 4 inches (10 cm) from the lid of the 2 liter bottle is about half of the bottle. You can use a ruler or measuring tape to find where 4 inches down the bottle is.









Extend the tape measure 4 inches.
Hold the end of the tape up to the end of the bottle’s lid.
Using your pen, make a mark where the tape measure ends; this is 4 inches.

, You will be cutting the plastic bottle in half. The measurements here do not need to be exact, but drawing a marked guide line will be helpful. Using the pen mark you just drew as a guide, draw a circle around the bottle 4 inches down from the lid. This will guide you in cutting the bottle in half.








, Keep both parts of the bottle; you'll use them both to make the trap.









Be careful of sharp plastic edges as you cut.
The edges don’t have to be perfect, so don’t worry if you’re a bit off from the marked guide line.

, Use your measuring cup to measure out 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Leave the sugar in the measuring cup; you will pour it into the bottle in the next step.

, You can heat up the water over the stove or in the microwave, whichever is more convenient. When the water begins to steam, it is hot enough for the trap.

, Pour the water slowly; since it is hot, you do not want to splash any water because it could burn you.








, Carefully pour the brown sugar from the measuring cup into the lower half of the bottle. Try not to spill any over the edges. Set the measuring cup aside once you’ve emptied it.








, Set the bottle aside for however long it takes the hot water to cool. Twenty minutes should be long enough.








, You don’t have to stir the mixture together. The yeast will consume the sugar and produce carbon dioxide, which attracts the mosquitoes.







, The lid of the bottle will be facing downwards at this point. While you are holding the top half of the bottle upside down, grab the bottom half with your other hand.

, Ensure the top of the bottle is above the water line.









Adult mosquito should have enough room to fly in the bottle and down the lid.
If there is not enough room for them to fly in the bottle, empty a bit of the solution out.
Now, insects can fly into the trap and die from suffocation or starvation.

, Use tape to keep the edges aligned. A few pieces of tape placed around the bottle will suffice to keep the edges in place.








, If there is a room or area where mosquitos have infested, place the trap there. A steady surface is optimal, such as a desk, counter, or the floor. Keep the trap out of people’s way so it won’t get knocked over.

, Eventually, many mosquitos will die in the bottle, and you will have to clean the trap for it to be effective again. Even if there are not many mosquitos, the liquid in the trap eventually loses its effectiveness because all the yeast has finished eating the sugar and no longer attracts mosquitos; many sources say this takes two weeks.Use a calendar to keep track of when you will need to change the liquid.
Change the liquid when the bottle is full of insects, even if two weeks have not passed.

, Luckily, this mosquito trap is reusable! Disassemble the trap by removing the tape. Then, wash both halves of the trap by rinsing it with water. Next, fill it up with more of the mosquito trap liquid.

Drain any areas with standing water.,
Add BTI mosquito treatments to open water.,
Manicure your vegetation.,
Add some repellant plants to your yard.,
Lay down some cedar mulch.,
Treat your yard with repellant.,
Change your outdoor light bulbs.,
Install a bat house.,
Use fans in your yard.",How to Get Rid of Mosquitoes in Your Yard," Mosquitoes use standing water as breeding sites to lay their eggs. On first glace you might think your yard is clear of possible breeding sites, but mosquito pupae and larvae can breed in very small and unsuspecting quantities of standing water (bottle caps).Look around your yard and drain or turn over any objects or areas that may be vessels for stagnant water. These vessels can include things like pet water bowls, saucers underneath plants, puddles near outdoor faucets, old tires, buckets, watering cans, wheel barrows, holes in trees, and depression or divot spots in your property.Consider hiring a professional to fill tree holes and property depressions.Clear out the gutters around your home as well as nearby street gutters.Any low points where water accumulates can become a breeding site for mosquitoes.If you have a pool, keep it chlorinated while in use, and drained and covered in the off season.Tightly tie down tarps covering objects and equipment so as not to leaves folds and depressions where water can settle, and mosquitoes can breed.If you have saucers underneath your plants, fill the area of the saucer with sand. That way, the plant can still absorb the water, but mosquitoes can’t use the standing water to lay their eggs.;
, BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) mosquito treatments are small, solid, naturally occurring bacterial larvicides that can be added to standing water unable to be drained, such as retention ponds, ditches, and rain barrels.BTI treatments come in a couple forms: BTI dunks can be added to open water where they float on the surface, and BTI bits can be sprinkled in gutters or wherever water tends to collect.BTI is safe for aquatic plants, animals (including fish), humans, and only kills breeding mosquito larvae., When they aren’t flying around, mosquitoes settle in cool, dark, damp, covered areas.Mow your lawn, keep trees and shrubs trimmed, and clear out any tall grasses or low lying brush.This will expose more of your vegetation to sunlight, which dry out any damp areas and make it less welcoming to lurking mosquitoes.Clear out any piles of leaves, brush, or decaying branches, as these dark, moist, piles become alternative and ideal places for mosquitoes to continue breeding., Growing certain plants in your yard garden can help repel mosquitoes. Plants like Lemon Balm, Lemongrass, Lantana, Lavender, Ageratum, and other mint-family plants are all good choices. These plants give off strong aromas that make mosquitoes want to steer clear.Citronella, Catnip, Basil, Lavender, Rosemary, Marigolds, and Geranium are some other plant options that can discourage mosquitoes from coming into your yard.Most of these plants not only repel mosquitoes, but make for attractive flowerbeds or outdoor table centerpieces.

, Use the cedar mulch in your vegetation and garden areas to keep moisture in the soil, soak up any excess moisture, improve the appearance of your vegetation, and repel mosquitoes.Since cedar oil is a common main ingredient in mosquito repellants, mosquitoes will steer clear from nesting near vegetation with the mulch., You can use a garden sprayer to treat yard with insect and mosquito specific replants such as pyrethrin and pyrethroid sprays. You can spray the underside of shrubbery in your yard or spray around the perimeter or your yard to create a barrier. Pyrethrin is a botanical insecticide made from dried chrysanthemums.Pyrethroid is a synthetic version of pyrethrin, and in some cases is considered to be a more effective repellant when compared to pyrethrin.There are also repellant granules that can be scattered across your lawn using a fertilizer spreader.These granules are normally infused with mosquito repelling oils. Typically, these granules are safe for pets and children.


These repellants can be bought at home department stores or online. You should check the packaging material to see how long the mosquito treatment is supposed to last; some treatments claim to last all summer, while other only last a number of weeks before another treatment is needed.You can spray your yard yourself with a store bought repellant, or hire a professional to treat larger yard areas. Professional may be able to better spray hard to reach places and may have different formulas that work on a variety of yard surfaces.Pyrethroid can be dangerous to other helpful insects such as bees and butterflies. To reduce the harming of these insects, pyrethroid spray treatments should be applied just before dusk, and on clear, non-rainy, non-windy days., Mosquitoes and other insects are attracted to incandescent lighting.To keep mosquitoes away and out of your yard, change your outdoor lights to fluorescent, LED, yellow “bug lights”, or sodium lamps.Replacing the bulbs near doors and entrances will especially help keep mosquitoes out of your home.

, Although mosquitoes account for only a portion of a bat’s diet, bats can eat hundreds of mosquitoes within an hourTo help combat the mosquitoes in your yard, buy or build your own bat house and attach it in an open, sunny area of your yard, about fifteen feet from the ground.Combined with other mosquito repelling approaches, a bat house in your yard can reduce the number of mosquitoes looking for a meal on your property.

, Since mosquitoes are very lightweight insects, a breeze more than 2 miles per hour can knock them out of their flight pattern.If you plan to relax outside, place a few fans in strategic areas (perhaps from behind) to blow the mosquitoes off their course and away from people."

Spray insecticide for a temporary solution.,
Consider a mosquito-repelling plant.,
Be skeptical of bug zappers and ultrasound machines.,
Use temporary measures.",How to Kill Mosquitoes2," DEET is the most effective pesticide for repelling mosquitoes, but it will only last a few hours at most, and can kill beneficial insects in your yard as well.Other insecticides may cause less collateral damage, but tend to be less effective, shorter lasting, and/or designed to work on clothing rather than large areas.



Check the label to see if the pesticide is approved for the intended use by the Environmental Protection Agency or another regulatory organization., The one plant proven to repel mosquitoes is the lantana plant, but be aware that this can be poisonous to pets, can cause allergic reactions, and is an invasive species in some areas.Other plants may have a minor effect, but try these only if you enjoy them in your garden or are willing to plant a large quantity:



Citronella, lemon grass, any citrus fruit, basil, rosemary, mint, or catnip may all have a minor effect.

, Bug zapper traps can seem effective because of loud sounds, bright lights, or sparks. However, most of the insects killed are not mosquitoes, and they can even kill insects that would normally eat or compete with mosquitoes.Ultrasound devices are simply not effective.Some mosquito-killing traps work using a fan system, very similar to the homemade trap described above. These can be effective, at least temporarily., Mosquitoes tend to avoid smoke, and will be blasted away by a strong fan. Dinner on the patio might not be as pleasant if you are sitting in a smoke cloud or wind tunnel, but if you only care about keeping them away for the next few minutes, this is one option.



Citronella candles are mostly effective due to the smoke, not the scent.Any candle will work almost as well.

Empty or treat standing water.,
Clean out gutters and trash piles.,
Keep lawns and shrubs trimmed and free of pools.",How to Kill Mosquitoes3," Still water is breeding grounds for mosquito larvae. Regularly empty all rain barrels, kiddie pools, pet water dishes, and other water containers. For puddles and other sources of water you can't pour out, add an insecticide targeted at killing mosquito larvae.



Always read the warning label on insecticides to find out if pets or young children could be harmed by drinking the treated water. Products that use bacterial agents to kill the larvae, rather than chemicals, are typically safer for other animal life., These are sources of standing water, and therefore mosquito breeding grounds, that you may not have thought of. Eliminate clutter from your yard often, especially during rainy weather.


, Keeping your lawn well-mowed and your shrubs trimmed back reduces the chance that pools of dew or rainwater will be trapped.Water your garden only as much as needed, making the soil moist but not soaked or covered in puddles."
"
Turn on a lamp or flashlight.,
Try using a vacuum cleaner.,
Wait for the mosquito to land on a wall.,
Swat the mosquito with any long object.,
Trap it with a glass.",How to Kill Mosquitoes4," Mosquitoes are attracted to lights, but if one is already buzzing around the room, there's no point turning them off. Keep a bright spot in your room to lure the mosquito to its doom.



Mosquitoes are not attracted to sodium lights, LED lights, and yellow ""bug lights.""Use these as night lighting to reduce the number of mosquitoes that show up, but not to attract a single mosquito victim.

, Ready the hose attachment on a larger vacuum. Once you've spotted a mosquito, turn on the vacuum and hunt it down. Once sucked in, the bug should die in the vacuum cleaner bag, but you can always empty the bag outside if you'd like to be sure.If this sounds like too much effort for one mosquito, you can keep reading to remind yourself of more traditional methods.


, If you continue to follow it with your eyes, or even to walk toward it to scare it into moving away from you and against a wall, then this should only take a minute or two.



If the mosquito won't land, try to kill it by clapping both hands together around it as it flies. This may take several tries.

, A rolled magazine, newspaper, or other old paper are all good options for increasing the force and reach of your swat. A shirt, book or other object will also work, as long as you're prepared to wash or wipe the squashed bug off afterward. Once you've successfully killed the mosquito, cackle maniacally and move on with your day.



You can purchase a fly swatter for this purpose, or even an electrified one that only needs to lightly touch the insect to kill it.

, If the mosquito keeps flying away before your whack lands, it's probably reacting to the rush of air that precedes your strike. Try rapidly moving a clear glass onto the surface the mosquito has landed on instead, trapping it inside. Slide a piece of paper or cardboard between the glass and the surface so you can move the trapped mosquito. Toss it outside, carefully remove the paper and squish it, or just leave the trapped mosquito to suffocate.

Lather the flea shampoo into your dog's coat and rinse thoroughly.;
, Talk to your veterinarian about any products she recommends. Many vets like Frontline and Advantage flea treatments. You can buy products from pet supply stores, your vet or in retail stores and online.


Follow the treatment instructions on the package. Most flea treatments will kill any fleas that are currently on your dog and prevent them from returning with a monthly application.






Wait 2 or 3 days after shampooing your dog with a flea shampoo to apply a flea treatment. If you wash your dog after applying the treatment, you will strip the dog's coat of the oils that keep the treatment working.







, Make sure your vet recommends a good flea collar because some of them contain harmful and toxic ingredients. They can also disrupt your dog's nervous system.

, Most dog owners prefer treatments and shampoos to powder because flea powder can cause dry skin on dogs. However, powders are inexpensive and easy to find in any discount store.

, You can do this in addition to other treatments, or on its own if you want an all natural way to protect your dogs from fleas.


Buy a spray with citronella, lavender, eucalyptus, cedar or lemongrass to repel fleas naturally. You can buy mists at natural food or health stores.






Remember that when you use natural oils, you are repelling the fleas from your dog, but not killing them. You will need to continually mist your dog to keep fleas away.

Check your property for standing water.,
Treat standing water that must remain.,
Refresh necessary water frequently.,
Report possible breeding grounds.",How to Control Mosquitoes1," Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant water, so the first step to reducing the number of mosquitoes on your property is to eliminate as much stagnant water from your property as possible.Remove any unnecessary basins you may have in your yard, including wheel barrows, buckets, and temporary swimming pools. If these items must remain outside, turn them upside down when not in use.
Clear your gutters frequently. They often get clogged with leaves and other debris, which can hold small amounts of water.
Even leaves on your lawn can provide enough water for mosquito larvae, so be sure to rake them up promptly.
Add topsoil to low areas that tend to accumulate water. In extreme cases, you may need to regrade your yard to improve drainage.
If any of your trees have rotted areas where water accumulates, fill the holes with mortar.;
, Sometimes it is not possible to eliminate all standing water. If you have a bird bath or a pond, for example, you can treat the water with larvicides that you can purchase at most gardening or home improvement stores. Most of these products contain either methoprene or Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, neither of which are believed to be toxic to humans, pets, fish, or birds when used appropriately.Read the directions carefully to determine how often you must reapply the larvicide. Protection can last for a month or more, but it depends on the amount of water being treated.
If you have a swimming pool, be sure to treat the water that accumulates on the cover during the off-season.

, If you have sources of water that cannot be treated, be sure to dump the water out and refill it every few days in order to interrupt the mosquito life cycle. Adult mosquitoes can emerge in less than two weeks after eggs are laid, so never let the water sit for longer than that.If you have items such as outdoor tarps that accumulate small amounts of water, tend to them regularly to ensure that water never stands for more than a few days at a time.

, If you are aware of possible mosquito breeding grounds that are not on your property, you should report them to the appropriate agency.


Many cities and counties have vector control agencies, which are responsible for controlling the populations of disease-spreading pests. If your area does not have such an agency, report the issue to your local public health department.
Whether the area is on public land or private property, the appropriate agency in your area may be able to take steps to remedy the problem.

Water that has been allowed to stand for as little as four days can be attractive to mosquitoes.;
, Bird baths should be cleaned out regularly. Avoid leaving buckets, wading pools, toys, gardening items, pots, any other form of containers, etc. to sit outside where they can gather water.

, If they are clogged up, they can accumulate water and provide ideal breeding grounds.

, If you have leaking taps or pipes, get these fixed. It is likely that the leak is pooling somewhere, not to mention wasting precious water.

, If there are ground depressions in the yard that can fill with water that doesn't drain around, fill these in. They can be a reclaimed garden or yard playing space. Use clean fill.

, Ensure that drips from air conditioning units are running free and evaporating, rather than pooling somewhere.

, Use the right pool treatment chemicals and procedures to prevent these from becoming breeding areas.


Empty or completely cover kid's pools when not in use. This is a drowning safety issue as much as a mosquito prevention issue too.

, A pond needs to be an active pond; if it goes stagnant, it will provide an ideal place for mosquito larvae. Stock it with fish (use the mosquito fish who will eat any larvae), keep the weeds out (infestations will choke the pond and leave it stagnant) and keep leaf litter, grass clippings, etc. away from it. Vegetation cleaning will also expose the water to direct sunlight and overheating that mosquitoes prefer to avoid., This can also be used for bird baths and other similar standing water areas.

Empty, drain or cover all things that can and may hold water.,
Change water collection pans for plant pots weekly.,
Clean bird baths weekly.,
Repair or prevent outside leaks.,
Maintain swimming pools with proper care.,
Keep the rain gutters and drains clean.,
Prevent other sources of standing water.",How to Prevent Mosquitoes from Breeding1," Areas of your backyard or porch may have spots where rainwater can pool. Barrels and trash cans tend to collect rainwater extremely well. Old tires, empty bottles, buckets, and other small containers can condense water vapor into tiny pools. Empty and drain all pools of water and cover them up to prevent more water from gathering.;
, When you water your plants, the excess water will run through the soil and collect in a pan. If you have any outdoor plants, these collection pans are a prime location for mosquitoes to breed. Empty and clean the pans at least once a week, preferably more frequently.

, If you have a bird bath outside your house, the stagnant water is a perfect place for mosquitoes to lay eggs. Minimize mosquitoes breeding there by changing the water and scrubbing down the bath at least once a week, preferably more frequently.

, Plumbing that runs outside can be affected by exposure to the weather, resulting in minor leaks. Window air conditioners often drip condensation, which can pool on the ground. Dripping outdoor faucets also pool on the ground. Repair these problems to minimize water collection as much as possible.

, If you have a small plastic pool meant to be used temporarily, make sure you drain all of the water and store it indoors when it's not in use. If you have a backyard swimming pool, monitor the chlorine levels regularly and keep the pool clean.

, If they are filled with debris, they will trap water during the next rainfall instead of letting it drain. Mosquitoes will then breed in this standing water., Standing water is the number one breeding spot for mosquitoes. Sometimes, it is nearly impossible to find all bodies of standing water and draining them. However, there are a few precautions you can take to prevent water from building up. Here are some tips to get you started:Get rid of any unused pots or bins or turn them upside down, so they don't collect water.
Keep trash and recycling bins covered. If you can't, try drilling drain holes into the bottom of them.
Keep a fine-mesh screen over rain barrels, water tanks, and cisterns.
Take a look at your plants. Are any of them collecting water in between the leaves and the stems? If so, consider poking a tiny hole with a pin into those areas to allow for proper drainage."

Wear long sleeves, pants, and closed shoes.,
Use mosquito repellent.,
Light candles with geraniol wax or citronella.,
Use tents or mosquito netting.,
Turn on fans.,
Stay away from tall grass, standing water, and heavily wooded areas.,
Stay indoors in the evening.",How to Keep Mosquitoes Away1," Mosquitoes are attracted to sweat and the natural bacteria that congregate on your skin. Keeping yourself covered in long sleeves, pants, and shoes will reduce mosquito attraction and also make it harder for them to bite you.Many outdoor superstores carry lightweight outerwear, so that wearing long layers is still cool and comfortable even in extremely warm temperatures.
Choose light-colored clothes, like whites, tans, and pastels. Mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors, like black and navy.;
, Sprays and lotions that contain DEET are highly effective for warding off mosquitoes while you enjoy the outdoors. DEET is safe when used as directed and can be used on kids as young as 2 months, but be sure to read safety and application instructions before applying.Eucalyptus, lemon essential oil, and picaridin are also effective ingredients in mosquito repellents.All lotions and sprays eventually wear off, so be sure to follow application instructions.
If you prefer to use a natural homemade repellent, combine 2 ounces of witch hazel and 2 ounces of distilled water in a spray bottle and add a total of 40 to 50 drops of essential oil, like citronella, eucalyptus, and lemon essential oils (you can choose your own combination). You'll want to use half the amount of drops if you're applying the repellent to children under 3 years old., Geraniol candles are 5 times more effective than citronella in repelling mosquitoes, so it’s best to buy those candles, though not everyone finds the smell as pleasant as citronella candles.Although citronella is not particularly effective in repelling mosquitoes, the smoke from the burning candle does help confuse them, which prevents them from biting you., If you’re hosting a garden party or hoping to lay in your hammock for a leisurely nap, consider moving inside a tent or under mosquito netting.


Tents and netting won’t necessarily keep mosquitoes far away, but they will keep them off of your skin, provided that you keep tent flaps and doors tightly closed and allow the netting to drape on the ground and make a seal against the intruders.

, Mosquitoes are not strong fliers, so electric fans strategically placed around you or your deck make it increasingly difficult for the pesky insects to reach you and bite. Mosquitoes are also highly attracted to the CO2 humans expel, and the fans help dissipate that, as well., These areas are where mosquitoes are most likely to live and breed, so by staying away from these areas, you are less likely to attract mosquitoes and get bitten.

, Mosquitoes are most active at night, beginning around dusk. If you head inside at night and wait until the next morning to resume your outdoor activities, you are less likely to get bitten.

Continue.,
They run to the head.",How to Kill Fleas With Dawn Dishsoap1," For dogs and other pets that can be bathed safely, you will need Dawn dish detergent. Using Dawn is recommended because it works best for killing the fleas where other brands may not, and it's the safest for your pet.;
, Next the only thing you need to do is prepare the warm (not hot!) bath for your pet. Just run enough water, then put him or her in the tub or use a water hose outdoors, if needed.

, Use a removable shower head, cup, or a water hose/spigot to fully soak the pet in water being cautious not to get in the eyes as it may irritate.

, Lather the pet with plenty of the Dawn dish detergent. You will need to spend several minutes scrubbing him or her, more depending on the severity of the fleas. Be gentle while scrubbing but you will need to scrub well to get to the skin where the fleas will hide. Having a pet brush on hand can be helpful when getting deep in the hair.

, When you start to see fleas fall off into the tub, you will need to rinse the pet to get rid of the dead fleas and get to the live ones. Basically, you should rinse and repeat just as you would if you were washing oil out of your own hair.

, Scrub until you see no fleas in the tub when you rinse. This can take a few minutes.

, Keep in mind that fleas will run to the head and face to hide. This means you will probably have to add a tiny drop of detergent and rinse. You can pick them off the face as you see them so you don't get soap and water in the eyes.

Spray your carpets with aerosol insecticides.,
Sprinkle your carpet and furniture with flea powder.,
Use a fogger.",How to Get Rid of Fleas on Dogs2," Fleas love to hide in carpets, and an aerosol spray treatment can kill the fleas and their eggs, protecting your dog and your family.


Purchase a can of flea spray for carpets online or in retail stores.

, Most powders contain toxins such as boric acid, which will kill fleas but can also be dangerous for your dog and other pets. Powders also leave a residue behind.


Consider using powders when you know you will be away for a while, such as before vacation.

, These can be purchased from hardware stores or pet supply stores and you can also hire an exterminator to fog your home if you have a flea infestation.


Remember that foggers will work best in open spaces. They will not be able to kill fleas that are hiding between furniture cushions, for example. Use an aerosol spray or powder for hard to reach places in addition to your fogger.

Consider a mosquito trap.,
Use fans.",How to Control Mosquitoes2," In addition to treating standing water with larvicide, you can also introduce species that like to feed on mosquito larvae. Try stocking ponds with top feeding predacious minnows.Controlling adult mosquitoes is more challenging. It may help to attract predators such as bats, birds, dragonflies, and frogs to your yard. You can do so by providing nesting areas for bats and birds and a garden and pond for dragonflies and frogs.
You might also consider raising chickens in your yard to help control your mosquito population., Adult mosquitoes like to lounge in shrubs and tall grass, so try to eliminate these habitats as much as possible. This is especially important in areas very close to your house., If you have a serious mosquito problem in your yard, you may want to consider contacting a company to have it professionally treated with chemicals. These treatments are typically effective for several weeks at a time. The active ingredient is most often Pyrethrum, which kills most insects, but is believed to pose a low toxicity risk for humans.If you are concerned about killing beneficial insects or overusing pesticides, you can also purchase non-residual fogs, which repel mosquitoes for short periods of time, but do not harm beneficial insects. These products are ideal for use right before an outdoor gathering.

, Citronella is an organic insect repellent that is available in various forms, such as candles and oils. It is effective in repelling mosquitoes, but only in very small areas.If you are gathering for an outdoor meal, place several citronella candles on the table for the best results.

, There are many different kinds of mosquito traps on the market, and most of them have mixed reviews. There is little independent evidence that proves that bug zappers, ultrasonic repellents, vacuum traps, or similar devices are particularly effective, but you may find that one of these products does work for you.There are new products coming out all the time. Before you purchase one, research it thoroughly and ask the manufacturer if they offer a satisfaction guarantee.

, Using an outdoor fan in the immediate area where you will be spending time outdoors may help repel mosquitoes. This technique is especially helpful for outdoor meals, when everyone will remain in one area."

Avoid peak mosquito hours.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Apply an insect repellent.,
Try mosquito-repelling plants.,
Keep mosquitoes out.",How to Control Mosquitoes3," If possible, try not to be outdoors at dawn and dusk, when many species of mosquitoes are most active. Keep in mind that mosquitoes are also most active when the weather is warm and humid., If you are planning on being outdoors during a time when you know there will be a lot of mosquitoes, protect yourself from bites by wearing tightly woven long sleeve tops and long pants.Bright colors like red and yellow may attract insects, so stick to light colors.
Woven fabrics like nylon and polyester offer better protection from bites than knit fabrics.
If you are hiking in areas that have lots of mosquitoes, you may want to purchase special gear, including clothing that is treated to repel insects and a mesh head net.
If you have a baby, make sure to protect the stroller with netting.
Pay extra attention to covering areas where your skin is thin, such as ankles and wrists., Repellents that contain the active ingredients Deet or Picaridin are most effective.If you are concerned about the possible health risks of chemical repellents, you can buy products that contain lemon eucalyptus oil, which the CDC recognizes as an effective repellent., Certain plants, including lemon thyme, citrosa, and rosemary, are believed to produce oils that repel mosquitoes. Try crushing the leaves and rubbing them on your skin.These plants are not as effective and do not last as long as chemical repellents, so you will need to reapply frequently.

, Make sure your windows and doors have tight screens that will keep mosquitoes out. You should also ensure that there are no other openings into your home that a mosquito might use.


Installing a screened-in porch might be a good option if you would like to spend more time outdoors without having to worry about mosquitoes

Eliminate or fill nooks, crannies, and holes.,
Mow your lawns weekly.,
Trim back tall weeds and bushes.,
Plant some mosquito-repelling flowers and herbs, especially near areas that are prone to collect water.,
Get some fish for your water garden.If you already have a water garden, consider adding some mosquito-eating fish, such as minnows or mosquito fish.,
Add a waterfall, fountain, or aerator to your water garden.Not only will it be good for the health of your pond, but it will disrupt the surface of the water.,
Make use of larvicides to kill mosquito larvae.,
Encourage other mosquito predators to visit your yard.",How to Prevent Mosquitoes from Breeding2," If you have a patio or a porch, there may be small crevices and openings that can harbor mosquitoes and their eggs. Trees on your lawn may have holes in their trunks where mosquitoes can reside and breed. If you can't eliminate the holes, consider filling them with sand.

, Mosquitoes aren't likely to lay eggs in tall grass, but they tend to sit in the tall grass for rest and hiding. Keep your grass as short as possible and as frequently as possible.

, These offer homes for adult mosquitoes. If you limit these, you will reduce the number of adult mosquitoes., You can place them directly into your garden, or you can place them in flower pots. Mosquitoes don't like the smell of these plants, and will stay away from them. Here are some plants you should consider planting in your garden:Herbs, such as: basil, lavender, rosemary, and peppermint
Flowers, such as: geranium, marigold, and pennyroyal
Other plants, such as: catnip, citronella, lemon balm, and garlic

, They are hardy, easy to care for, and love to feast on mosquito larva. If you have a larger pond, you can stock it with koi or goldfish instead.There are some larvicides that you can use in water gardens. Before you choose to use one, make sure that it is safe for fish and other animals.
Favor deeper water gardens and ponds over shallower ones. Aim for something that is 24 inches (60.96 centimeters) or deeper. It'll be better for your fish, and the depth will deter mosquitoes. Mosquitoes prefer shallower waters., Mosquitoes like standing water, and won't go near moving water. You can also add a fountain to your birdbath, if you have one.

, They often come in pellet form, and need to be applied monthly.They usually do not kill off other insects which prey upon mosquitoes, such as dragon flies. Listed below are common types of larvicides


Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI), such Mosquito Dunks, Mosquito Bits, and Microbe-Lift, are mosquito poisons. The mosquitoes die after they ingest it.
Methoprene, is an insect growth regulator (IGR). It prevents mosquito larvae from molting. They take a few days to kill, but they will other kill other insects as well.
Mineral oil based larvicides suffocate mosquito larvae when sprayed on top of water., Bats, dragonflies, and insect-eating birds will all feast on mosquitoes and mosquito larvae.You can do this simply by installing some bird houses or bat houses.If you have a water garden, you can also consider adding a frog or two.

Use industrial-strength pesticides if you live near heavily-wooded areas or marshes.",How to Keep Mosquitoes Away2," Birds and bats are natural predators of mosquitoes. By giving them a place to live near your home, you encourage them to stay and feast, which naturally reduces your mosquito infestation. Birds and bats will eat a number of other insect pests as well., Mosquitoes like to hide in tall, lush grasses. Remove the clippings after you have mowed. They can continue to host insects after they fall to the ground., Lavender, marigolds, lemon balm, pennyroyal, catnip, and basil are just a few of many plants you can grow near your home that will help deter mosquitoes., Fill in holes and uneven areas around your home. These places can collect water, giving mosquitoes a place to breed.You can buy concrete patch to fill foundations and driveways or simply pay a contractor to fill holes around your home with a professional grade product.
Remove canisters or containers that gather water in the rainy or snowy seasons. Cisterns, tarps, barbecues, garbage cans and plant pots that fill with water are excellent mosquito breeding grounds.
Regularly dump and clean birdbaths and pet dishes (where mosquito larvae can collect) every 24-48 hours.

, If you have a swimming pool, keep it filtered and chlorinated to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in the water.If you have a water feature near your home, like a pond, consider stocking it with mosquito-eating fish, koi, or comet goldfish., Tree stumps are a mosquito breeding area that people often ignore. Fill the tree stumps full of sand, soil, or gravel to avoid dampness and water accumulation., Coffee kills mosquito larva, so by spreading coffee grounds in puddles, ditches, or marshy garden areas near your home, you can help reduce their populations.Don’t put coffee grounds in ponds or wetlands where fish, birds, or other marine life thrive so that you don’t pollute their habitat.

, You can hire professionals to come and spray around your home for mosquitoes. If you have a pond or large body of water, they can spray larvicides that kill mosquito larva but remain non-toxic to other marine life.In some regions, you can buy and spray the pesticides yourself. Rules and regulations differ depending on where you live.
Some counties and districts in North America spray entire communities for mosquitoes. To find out more about your area’s pesticide use and spraying procedure, contact your local health department.

Understand the life cycle of the flea.,
Wash the puppy's bedding to kill any fleas.,
Use spray insecticides to kill fleas in carpeting and other fabrics.",How to Get Rid of Fleas on a Puppy Too Young for Normal Medication," Newborn puppies provide the perfect host for fleas — they are warm, produce moisture and provide blood for food. Unfortunately, there are no flea products that are safe for use on newborn pups. This is because puppies' internal organs are more delicate than those of older dogs and therefore more prone to adverse side effects caused by the anti-flea medications.


Depending on the medication, these side effects may include excessive salivation, vomiting, respiratory issues and either over-sensitivity to stimulation or profound depression.
Some anti-flea products will be clearly marked as unsuitable for puppies on the label. Other products have never been tested on puppies, so the manufacturers advise against using them.
In particular, stay away from pet shop products that contain permethrins, as these are not safe for use in youngsters. Puppies' metabolisms are too immature and are unable to break down the permethrins, which can build up in the puppies' systems and cause neurological damage resulting in excessive shaking, drooling, paralysis or even seizures.
Pet shop products that don't contain permethrin are unlikely to be effective and are a waste of money.;
, As there are no commercial or prescription products suitable for use on young puppies, the only solution is to keep the puppy clean and try to remove any fleas manually. To bathe the puppy:


Place a few inches of warm water into a sink or basin. The water should be approximately the same temperature you'd use to bathe a baby.
Place the puppy in the water, using your hand to support its head and keep it above the water.
Use your hand to scoop water over the puppy's coat until it is completely wet.
Lift the puppy out of the water and place him on a clean, warm towel. Gently rub the puppy with the towel to remove excess water.

, Place the puppy on a dry towel on a flat surface. Use a flea comb to groom the puppy's damp fur and remove any fleas.


Flea combs have teeth that are very close together and work by physically pulling fleas out of the fur.
Start at the puppy's neck and part the fur, combing a section at a time until you have covered his whole body and removed all of the fleas.

, It's important to kill any fleas that you remove from the puppy's fur, otherwise they could find their way back and re-infest. You can kill the fleas by squishing them between your fingernails or by dropping them into a cup of boiling water.


If you're using boiling water, make sure to place the cup where the puppy can't reach it, otherwise he could knock it over and burn himself.

, Once you have physically removed the fleas from his fur, the puppy should be free of fleas. However, there is no residual insecticide on his coat to stop new fleas from jumping onto him. Therefore it is important to keep the puppy away from his mother and any infected bedding until they can be treated. This will help to prevent the puppy from becoming reinfected.

, Once your puppy grows older, his body will be able to handle the ingredients used in anti-flea products and they will be safe to use. Always follow the instructions on the label to find out when it's safe to start using a specific product. Of the licensed anti-flea medications:


Revolution (active ingredient selamectin) can be used in puppies from 7 weeks of age onwards.
Frontline (active ingredient fipronil) can be used at 8 weeks and over.
Oral medications such as Comfortis (active ingredient spinosad) are only safe from 14 weeks of age onwards.
Never use these products on pups below the recommended age.

, If the puppies in a litter have fleas, then it's almost certain that the mother will have them too. As a result, it will be necessary to treat the mother in order to avoid reinfecting the puppies.


Keep in mind that if there are any other animals in the house that have come in contact with the mother dog or puppies, they will need to be treated for fleas also.

, Although anti-flea products can be used on the mother, it is important to be careful about the products you choose.


If the mother is still providing milk for her puppies, certain chemicals can be passed onto the puppies through the milk, which could make them sick. Therefore, it is essential that you only use prescription products designed for use in lactating mothers.
Some store bought products may be marked as ""natural"" or ""drug free"", but this does not mean that they are safe for very young puppies. And even if they don't cause any negative side-effects, natural or herbal products are unlikely to be effective in getting rid of fleas.

, Prescription medications that contain an ingredients called selamectin (such as Revolution and Stronghold) are licensed as being safe for use in pregnant and lactating mothers.The medication should be applied to the adult dog's skin, according to the manufacturers instructions, and allowed to dry for several hours before the puppies are allowed to come in contact with the mother.
Selamectin-based medications should only be given in the recommended dosages, and should only be administered topically. When given orally, selamectin was shown to cause foetal abnormalities in rats., There are several ingredients used commonly in anti-flea medications that should never be given to pregnant or lactating dogs. Therefore, it's important to read the label very careful or consult with your dog's vet to avoid using products containing these ingredients.


An ingredient called fipronil (which is found in an anti-flea product called Frontline) should never be used on pregnant or lactating mothers, as it has not been proven safe for puppies.
An ingredient called spinosad (which is used in an oral flea treatment call Comfortis) has been shown to be excreted in the mother's milk. As it is uncertain whether spinosad causes negative side effects in puppies, you should avoid using this product to treat the mother.

, The adult flea only visits its host to feed, so for every flea you see on the pet, it is estimated that another 20 are living off the animal in her bedding, the carpet and the sofa.


It is also important to be aware that the female flea lays her eggs on soft furnishings such as carpet and upholstery. These eggs are very hardy and, in the absence of a suitable host, can lie dormant for years.
Once the eggs hatch, the flea larvae and pupae will develop in carpet or bedding, feeding off dirt in order to complete their life cycle and become adults.
As a result, it is necessary to kill off any eggs or larvae hidden in the dog's bedding, or the carpeting and sofa, otherwise the mother dog or puppies could easily become reinfected.

, As explained in the step above, the environment in which the puppy lives is likely to be rich with flea eggs, larvae and pupae waiting to mature into the next generation of fleas. Therefore, this bedding needs to be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected in order to fully eliminate the fleas.


Flea eggs have an extremely tough protective shell, so putting the bedding through the washing machine will not be enough to eliminate them.
Use an anti-flea spray or bombs that contains insecticide. The insecticide will find its way into remote corners of the bedding where flea eggs, larvae and pupae may be hiding. Use the insecticide according to the instructions on the packaging.
Once you have applied the insecticide and given it time to take effect, you will need to put it through a very hot cycle in the washing machine to remove any residual insecticide (that could harm the puppies) and wash away dead eggs, larvae and fleas.

, Finally, you will need to kill any fleas living in carpeting or any other soft furnishings. To do this, you should use a permethrin-based insecticidal spray, such as Staykill or RIP fleas.


The manufacturers of these sprays recommend vacuuming prior to spraying. This loosens up the pile of the carpet and helps the spray to penetrate more deeply. In addition, the vibration from the vacuum is likely to ‘wake up’ the larvae who will then wriggle towards light in the hope of finding a host.
Spray the insecticide onto the carpet, sofa and other soft furnishings according to the instructions on the label. The permethrins in the spray work by paralyzing the insects' nervous systems, interfering with muscle function and eventually causing death. Insects are unable to breakdown pyrethroids in the same way mammals can and are therefore far more sensitive to their effects
Always remove the puppies, along with any other pets (including birds and fish) or children from the room before spraying with insecticide. Following the treatment, ventilate the room for several hours by opening the window, making sure the room is unoccupied.

Hold on to the tick firmly with the tweezers and pull it straight out.

, Use the hottest water possible and high-soil settings to wash clothes, linens, bedding, towels, and even toys. Use the highest drier settings as well, to ensure that the washing and drying process kills any fleas, ticks, and larvae that might be hiding out.Don’t forget to wash pet bowls, water dishes, and anything that needs to be washed in the sink that could be housing adults or larvae.

, Once everything’s been picked up and put in the washing machine, thoroughly vacuum everywhere and be sure to get in all the nooks and crannies. When you’re finished, dispose of the vacuum bags immediately, as they can house living flea larvae.

, Use either an aerosol spray or dust that’s designed to kill fleas and ticks, such as Ultracide, Onslaught, Permethrin, or Bifen. You can also use other pyrethrin-based pesticides, but make sure they contain an insect growth regulator that will prevent reproduction.Make sure all people and pets are out of the house, and wear protective gear like gloves and a mask.


Start away from the front of the house and work your way toward the door, focusing especially on areas where pets spend a lot of time.
Apply a light mist or dusting to floors, carpets, on and under rugs, pillows, on and under furniture, window sills, curtains, pet beds that couldn’t be washed, baseboards, and all cracks and crevices where ticks and fleas could be hiding.Keep everyone out of the house until the spray has dried or the dust has had time to settle.

, Once your spray has dried, apply a desiccant that will dry out and kill insects and arachnids and their eggs. Focus on areas that pets frequent, behind and under baseboards, carpets and rugs, behind doors and moulding, and all other nooks, cracks, and crannies.Good desiccants for this purpose include:


Evergreen Pyrethrum Concentrate
Drione Dust
Boric acid, which is good for eggs and larvae, If there are fleas or ticks living in the vicinity of your home, you must also deal with them, otherwise the infestation will keep recurring. Ticks can be found in overgrown areas, wooded areas, and tall grasses. Fleas like shaded, damp areas, such as under trees and shrubs. Remember to spray the lawn, bushes, shrubs, trees, fences, sheds, and play areas.You can use the same product you applied inside your house to target flea and tick habitats outside your home.You may have to regularly reapply pesticide outside if you live in an area that’s prone to flea or tick infestations. Consider applying an insecticide outside every three months to keep pests under control.

, Within 48 to 72 hours of treating your house, clean everything again to pick up dead fleas, ticks, and eggs., Ideally, you will only have to go through this process once, but it may take several cleaning and insecticide treatments before you fully destroy all the ticks or fleas plaguing your home.

, Use collars, sprays, skin treatments, or dips that will kill fleas and ticks that come in contact with your pets.This will protect your pet from infestation and disease, and protect your home from pests. Talk to your vet about the best product for your pet.

, Since pets are usually how ticks and fleas enter your home, keep an eye on them and monitor when they come in and out. Groom them after they’ve been outside, and keep them off furniture (ticks and fleas can hide out in fabrics and cushions).

, When venturing outside into tick- or flea-prone areas, wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts. Tuck your pant legs into your socks and your shirt into your pants at the waist. Spray yourself with an insect repellent that contains DEET, and spray your clothes with a repellent containing permethrin.

, Keeping your home as clean as possible will help prevent ticks, fleas, and other pests from getting comfortable there.

, Since ticks and fleas like overgrown areas, shrubs, or long grasses, it’s a good idea to keep your grass and weeds three inches or shorter, and keep shrubs and bushes near your house pruned.

, You want to prevent things that attract fleas, ticks, and the creatures that carry them, such as mice, rats, and birds. Attractants include brush, plants, leaf litter, ivy, wood piles, birdfeeders, and bird baths., Hanging clothes outside is a great way to dry them during the warmer months, but if they are too close to the ground or too near a wooded or grassy area, ticks can crawl onto them and fleas can leap onto them.


Hang clothes to dry in open areas, away from heavily treed or dense brush areas.

, Staying away from tick and flea infested areas can help prevent diseases and infestations. This includes wooded areas, areas that are overgrown, or places with lots of shrubs.


Keep your gardens in open areas, as well as children’s play areas, playgrounds, gardens, picnic tables, gazebos, patio furniture, and any other play or social area., Areas where fleas, ticks, or pest-ridden animals can enter your home should be sealed and covered. This includes vents, areas under decks, crawl spaces, and other access points."

Grow fast growing Eucalyptus trees.,
Be aware that fleas and ticks detest the aroma of Eucalyptus foliage and bark and will vacate the entire area where this odor exists.

,
Place soft branch cuttings from your Eucalyptus tree beneath your dog’s bed pillow or doghouse bedding.",How to Control Fleas With Eucalyptus Trees," These are very easy to grow both in your yard and in your house. The benefits include:


Enjoying the aroma. On top of the safety benefits of organic treatments, Eucalyptus adds a wonderful smell when added to cut or dried flower arrangements. The powdery blue leaves are very attractive as well as mutually beneficial to a pest-free pet and home.
Enjoying watering less. Once established, Eucalyptus trees are very drought tolerant. They aren’t fussy about soils and can easily be grown by anyone, anywhere.

Vacuum your carpet thoroughly.,
Vacuum any upholstered furniture in the room.,
Throw away the vacuum cleaner bag.,
Consider steam cleaning your carpets and furniture.,
Clean your pet's bedding.",How to Get Rid of Fleas in Carpets1," Use the nozzle attachment instead of just pushing the vacuum cleaner. Start at one end of the room, and vacuum in strips until you have covered the entire carpet. Pay special attention to the corners of the room and baseboards. Fleas like to hide in dark and humid areas, so vacuum underneath furniture well.


Be sure to focus on areas that your pet likes to spend time in, as well as around baseboards, near entryways, and under furniture.
For very heavy infestations, continue vacuuming every day for 10 to 14 days.;
, Make sure to get the base and the underside. Fleas often jump onto the furniture, and they could re-infest your carpet if not removed.

, Don't throw it away inside your house. Instead, take the bag out of the vacuum cleaner, put it in a plastic bag, tie the bag up, and throw it away outside your house. This will prevent any remaining fleas from getting back inside your home and back onto your carpet.If your vacuum cleaner uses a canister instead of a bag, take out the canister and empty the debris into a plastic bag. Tie the plastic bag up tightly and throw it away outside.

, If you do not own a steam cleaner, rent one from a home improvement or grocery store. Follow the instructions that come with the equipment carefully. You may also consider hiring a steam cleaning company to clean for you. The high temperature exerted from the steam cleaner will kill both adults and eggs.

, Wash them in a sanitary cycle in your washing machine. Also, use the hottest dryer setting available. Wash these daily until the flea infestation is gone.

, You should especially do this in areas that don't get much exposure to sunlight (fleas like humid and cool spots), anywhere that you find dried blood and feces (flea debris), and upholstered furniture. Before vacuuming the carpets, sprinkle salt, Borax or baking soda throughout. Work it into the base of the carpet with a broom. Let it sit for a few hours; all of these powders will cause the flea eggs that are tucked deep into the carpet to dry out.


Don't let your pets walk on the carpet during this time, since they might get some stuff on their paws and lick it off, causing them to get sick. If there's a chance the pet will walk on the carpet, use baking soda and be thorough when working it into the base of the carpet so it doesn't sit on the surface and get on your pet's paws.
When the vacuum bag is full, seal it in a plastic trash bag and put it in a covered trash container, preferably outside. Otherwise, the little buggers can crawl out and make themselves cozy again.

, A 4x4m room needs a 10L/Day dehumidifier (it removes 10L of water in the air per day). Apparently, fleas require 50% or higher relative humidity to live. Keep the humidity in your room under 50% for 2 days will kill adult fleas and larva, and stop flea eggs from hatching. You just need to vacuum the flea jerky and their eggs.

, Trim lawns and weeds and expose any cool, moist dark spots (which fleas love) to sunlight, or keep your pet away from those spots.

, Use any gentle shampoo. Wash the neck first so that the fleas don't jump up to the head during the bath. Be thorough because you'll probably see several fleas come off and float around in the water. Alternatively, wash kitten in Head and Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo. The acid in the shampoo kills fleas - you can pick off any remaining fleas still clinging on as they appear to be stunned.

, Take two cups of fresh rosemary leaves and add them to two pints of water. Boil for thirty minutes. Strain the liquid, discard the leaves and mix it with up to a gallon of warm water. Pour this over your pet until saturated. Do not rinse off, but allow your pet to air dry.


This is something to do on a hot day only. Also add 2 to 3 drops of the lemon mixture (see step 2 of next section) under your pet's collar to help keep fleas off.

, After your pet is dry, use a flea comb that is specifically designed to remove fleas in order to get rid of stubborn ones that remain. Use the brush all over their skin.

, Take the pet's collar or neckerchief and put on drops of Eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, citronella, lavender, or geranium. This will need to be done weekly.



Note: Do not use essential oils on cats! While cats are extremely sensitive to Eucalyptus and tea tree oils, a cat's ability to metabolize any essential oils inhaled, ingested or absorbed through skin is considered to be weak and there is always a risk of overloading a cat's system.
With tea tree oil, be especially careful to use products with 1% or less of this essential oil. It can cause nausea, vomiting, lethargy and general weakness, and should be used with caution. With this oil, more is not better.

, Plant it around your house. Do not do this if your pets are prone to eating plants or if you have children around.

, Slice a lemon thinly, add it to a pint of water and heat to a boiling point. Let it sit overnight and in the morning, spray it onto areas where you suspect fleas hang out (beware of staining) and rub it over your pet's fur. Don't soak, but rather dampen the fur. Do this once a month to combat fleas.


Do not use a lot at first, and keep an eye out for signs of digestive discomfort in your pet.

, In a spray bottle, add: 1/4 distilled white vinegar to 3/4 water. If you want, you can also add 1 tablespoon of dish soap to get rid of dirt. This mixture makes a safe cleaner for your counters and surfaces. It is also a very effective flea remover from all of your fabrics. Spray it once or twice a week on your fabrics and your flea problem will be over., This is a relatively easy and affordable way of getting rid of fleas on a dog. Salt dries up the eggs of fleas and eventually kills all of them.The first part:

Look for affected areas on dog/cat, and for each affected area, grab a pinch of salt.
Wet the tips of your fingers very lightly (a drop of water is perfect) and massage the area.
Reapply to each area day after day until the infestation is clear.
Don't put too much salt on, as it may irritate the dog's skin.

, If fleas are a problem in a specific area of your yard or home, fill an aluminum pie pan with soapy water and set it out in the area (i.e.under a bed). The fleas are trapped on top of the water due to the tension of the surface of the water. Change the water daily until there are no more fleas. If you are placing the pie pan outside, empty daily to prevent mosquitoes.

, If you miss any areas where fleas are infesting, you don't want to give them the chance to multiply.


Vacuum thoroughly every other day. Since fleas can develop resistance to insecticides, vacuuming regularly is essential in order to bring them under control.
Mow the lawn regularly.
Wash pet bedding in hot, soapy water at least once a week.

, This helps you monitor your progress. The more fleas you see, the more you need to clean.

It is always best to seek the help of a professional. They will seal your home and make it into a safe environment free of both fleas and pesticides.

, Anything alive must be removed from the fumigation area. This includes pets and plants as well as family. Do not allow anyone to breathe in the pesticides. Wait until the gasses dissipate before reentering the area., The gas will taint food, medicine, or other products that you consume. Seal them inside metal or plastic containers. Mattresses and pillows can also absorb chemicals, exposing you to them even after your home is deemed safe. If you can’t remove something, seal it inside a gas-resistant plastic bag.

, Closets, cupboards, drawers, cabinets, and safes should all be opened. If an object has a door on it, open it. This will allow the gas into the dark, closed areas where fleas like to hide. Be safe and open every area that you can.

, During fumigation, the area to be treated is sealed off by a tarp. Professional exterminators will do this for you. The gas fumigants should not be able to escape this area. Make sure all ventilation strips are closed tightly on the tarp., The tarp may have a pump that allows gas to be safely pumped through from the outside. Another option is industrial fog machines. Cold fog machines work best for indoor areas and spread pesticides in small droplets. Wear a gas mask before using a fog machine inside the sealed area.

, After the pesticides are in place, they will be left alone for a day or two. At this point, severe infestations should be neutralized. Use a handheld air quality detector to monitor the safety of your environment.

, Even after you are allowed back into your home, gas may still linger. Keep doors and windows open. Turn on fans. Allow the air circulate until your home is free of smells or chemical concerns."

, This may help you bring an infestation under control. Keeping your If your animal must go outside, keep it away from long grasses, fallen leaves, gravel areas or sandy patches.


If you have a dog and you need to walk the dog, try to stick to pavement for this first month. While your dog or cat is toxic to fleas jumping on them, you are trying to eliminate a nasty infestation, and you don't want to introduce new fleas to your pet when you are trying to kill off the old ones.
If possible, keep pets inside during the winter months, especially cats. Quarantining your animals can save you money because after your infestation is eliminated, you don't need to re-treat them unless you notice more fleas.

, If your pet stays inside, then you can probably stop the flea preventative treatments after four months. However, if your pets are going outside, you need to continue the treatments.

, Apply the spray to your socks, ankles and the cuffs of your pants every single day to prevent flea bites.


If you've treated your pet, the fleas will be killed on contact with its blood. However, you haven't been treated with flea preventative, so your blood will still make a tasty snack. Fleas only need a single blood meal to lay more eggs, so you want to deny them their food.
After 30 days, you can probably stop worrying about applying the DEET mosquito repellant to your ankles. If you no longer see fleas jumping around, then you are definitely safe. However, if you still see visible fleas or have bites on your ankles, then continue spraying with mosquito spray.

, This cleaning should include carpeted surfaces as well as smooth surfaces.


Vacuum all carpets, rugs and upholstery. Place one entire complete flea collar (chopped up) in the vacuum bag. Vacuuming not only sucks up fleas, eggs and larvae, but the vibrations from the vacuum cleaner also cause fleas to hatch from their cocoons. Since insecticides can't kill fleas in the pupa stage, getting as many of them to emerge as possible gives you a great chance of killing more fleas. Throw the vacuum bag away in an exterior garbage container after you're done. Follow this up with turning vacuum over and spraying the roller head with a spray lysing agent
Mop smooth floors. Use a cleaning agent like Pine-Sol or undiluted apple cider vinegar to cause the fleas to emerge from holes and cracks so that they are more exposed when you spray or fog your house.

, Read the instructions and make sure you have enough to completely bomb your entire square footage of every room. You need to make sure that the product kills flea eggs, so look for one of these active ingredients: methoprene, fenoxycarb or pyriproxyfen.


Spray your carpets, rugs, furniture, baseboards, along walls and on your pet's bedding. Make sure to follow the directions on the can.
Don't miss door edges, corners, floors with cracks and underneath furniture and furniture cushions. Flea larvae love to hide in dark places even if your pet is too large to crawl under your furniture.
If you use a fogger, you still need to spray the areas that the fogger can't reach. Follow the instructions very carefully, making sure you and your pets leave the house while the fogger is working. Consider treating your house one room at a time and stay out of that room for at least several hours.

,


Remove debris like fallen leaves, grass clippings or other organic items before treating your yard. Also, mow your lawn before you spray.
Make sure to spray all shaded or partially shaded areas. These can include inside dog houses, beneath trees, shrubbery and bushes or beneath your deck or porch.

, Many of the fleas in your house may still be in cocoons, or in the pupal stage, where insecticides can't reach them. Spraying a second time ensures that you'll catch the fleas that were in cocoons during your first spray.


You may also consider asking your vet about environmental products that have a persistent action for six to 12 months. When the cocoon hatches, the larvae come into contact with the chemical and die, and you will only have to repeat the application ever six to 12 months as necessary.

, Fleas don't survive well in cold environments. Keeping your house as cold as possible while you are not there will force the fleas to migrate to your pets, where they will die.


Purchase an electronic programmable thermostat that can turn your heat down or off while you are at work or asleep.
Leave windows wide open while you are out of the house whenever possible.

, Doing this will keep fleas from hiding inside your cushions, under pillows or under throw blankets.

, Squeeze the juice out of an orange or a lemon and rub the rind over your pets' fur. Your pet will smell great, and your pet won't be harmed if it licks the citrus juices from its fur.


Note that concentrated citrus oil is toxic to pets if licked, so only use the juice — never essential oils.

, You can purchase ""beneficial nematodes"" from a pet shop, a gardener's supply store or a store that focuses on organic lawn care. Beneficial nematodes consume flea larvae, which prevents the next generation of fleas from invading your home. Don't worry — these aren't the nematodes that can cause your pet to have heartworms., Add one teaspoon of vinegar for every four cups of water in the dog's water bowl. As your dog drinks the water, the vinegar gets into their system and make their blood taste bad to the fleas. It will take two to three bowls of water before you start to notice a difference; but it works great once the vinegar gets into the dog's system.


There is no scientific evidence to back this method, though some people report having luck.

Use a pesticide with chemicals that kill adult fleas and ticks as well as their eggs.
Be sure to ready the safety instructions before you treat your house. Your children and pets should not be inside your house when it is sprayed.
If you have a serious infestation, you might want to hire a fumigator to treat your house for you. In this case your entire family won't be able to go into the house for a couple of days, since the strong chemicals used are toxic.

, As the pesticide takes action in your home, it will kill adult fleas and ticks, and continue killing them as more hatch. It may take several weeks before the fleas and ticks are completely gone.

In general you will need 1 bomb per room you are treating; however in some cases, 1 bomb in a hallway adjacent to open doors can treat multiple rooms. Read the label carefully to determine the size of the area the product treats., Ask your veterinarian for his or her advice on which products they recommend. Check with friends and family for their opinions on the effectiveness of a flea bomb they might have used, or check online for feedback and reviews. Ask sales associates at your local home improvement or hardware store for any information they may have concerning flea bombs, but always back up what you're told by a retailer with your own quality research.

, Most flea bombs operate in similar ways. Ensure that you have read the directions carefully and fully prior to setting off the flea bomb in your home.

, The chemicals in the flea bomb are poisons which can easily cause illness to people and pets. Check the label on your flea bomb to ensure that your family is safe and can stay out of the house for the label's recommended time period.

, Open all doors to infested rooms so the chemicals from the flea bomb can kill the fleas. Open cabinet doors and drawers to kill fleas inside furniture.

, Remove such items from open cabinet doors or drawers to keep them away from the spray. Storing items away from the chemicals is much easier than cleaning them when the flea bomb is finished.

, The chemicals from the flea bomb can soil furniture, tables and countertops or damage electronic equipment. Cover these items with sheets or plastic tarps to prevent damage.Old sheets can be found easily at your local thrift store. Plastic painting tarps are available from hardware and auto stores.

, Chemicals in a flea bomb are dangerous to fish. If you can't move your fish tank to another location, cover it up well and seal it tightly with plastic wrap.

, The chemicals and propellants in a flea bomb can be flammable. Turn off the heater or air conditioner and extinguish the pilot light. Cut the power to all fans.

, Make sure that the flea bomb chemicals do not leak outside the house and have maximum effectiveness by closing all openings to the outside prior to treatment.

, The vibrations from a vacuum cleaner cause flea larvae to emerge making your flea bomb treatment as effective as possible., Flea eggs and larvae may find shelter in piles of dirty clothes. Ensure that you have laundered all of your clothes, or bag the clothes and take to a laundry mat while you are bombing the house., Placing a protective covering under the flea bomb will prevent the residues from the product from staining the floor directly around the flea bomb.

, Once a flea bomb is activated you should vacate the house immediately to prevent illness due to pesticide exposure.

, Follow package directions to activate the flea bomb. If you are setting off multiple flea bombs, start in the room furthest from the exit and work your way out. Once a flea bomb has been activated do not reenter the room.

, Avoid unnecessary exposure to the chemicals in a flea bomb by keeping all pets and people out of the house for 2 to 4 hours. Read the label carefully to determine the recommended time frame to be away from the house.

, While you are away from the home it is important to remove fleas from your pet so they do not bring them back into the home as soon as you return.


Ask your veterinarian about pills containing nitenpyramto kill any adult fleas that are on your pet.
Bathe your pet with a flea controlling shampoo.
Take your pet to a groomer to get a professional flea treatment or dip.

, Dead fleas, chemical residue and a coating of dust are common things to find after a flea bomb treatment. Vacuum and mop floors thoroughly, clean tables and countertops, wash sheets and clothes, and wash all surfaces.


It's recommended that you wear gloves when cleaning, and dispose of the gloves after cleaning to avoid picking up chemical traces on your skin.

, The smell of the pesticides may persist for several hours or days after treatment. Open doors and turn on any ceiling or ventilation fans to help remove the odors from the flea bomb from the house., Daily vacuuming will remove any newly hatched adult fleas that may have survived the flea bomb., Some products are not effective at killing flea eggs. Flea eggs and larvae may hatch days or weeks after your first treatment. Monitor your house and pets for several weeks following initial treatment to watch for signs of fleas., Flea dirt or droppings appear as reddish brown specks on your pet. If your pet is scratching, use a flea comb to check under their fur for signs of flea dirt or adult fleas."

Wash lived-in areas and items.,
Spray an insect growth regulator (IGR) like methoprene or pyriproxyfen.,
Become friends with your vacuum cleaner.,
Use botanical dust mixed with Borate acid.,
Reclaim your back yard.,
Fill shallow bowls of water with dish detergent.,
Get one or two dehumidifier(s) depending on the size of your room.",How to Get Rid of Fleas1," Throw all of the pet bedding in the washing machine and let it go for a deep spin. That includes anything that the pets like to regularly lie or sleep on, which isn't always intended to serve as pet bedding. Wash it all - the bedsheets, the throw on the sofa and the bathroom rug.


If the item is not salvageable or the inside of the pet bedding is full of dirt (dander, flea eggs, flea larvae, and flea excrement) best to throw it out and purchase a new bed. Even if you wash the cover and put the inside of the bedding back in the cover, the eggs will still hatch.
Fleas attack humans, too. If you suspect that you might be a victim of those blood-sucking vermin — even if you don't — you're going to need to wash your sheets and upholstery as well. Anything that you regularly touch is a vector for fleas. Wash it thoroughly.;
, Room foggers (total release aerosols) aren't as effective as sprays unless they contain an IGR to prevent the larvae from turning into adult fleas. Without IGRs, larvae won't be controlled because they won't be reached at the base of carpet fibers where they develop., While the loose, potentially flea-infested items are being washed, arm yourself with a vacuum and suck the flea life out of every surface, nook and cranny you can find. While you're doing this, send the pet(s) outside, or confine them to the bathroom, so that any fleas they're carrying won't jump onto the surface you just vacuumed.


Sticking a flea collar or broken-up mothballs in the vacuum cleaner helps to kill off the buggers that you've sucked up so they can't come back to haunt you. Fleas mostly won't survive the vacuum, but you want to play it safe.
Focus on areas that don't get much exposure to sunlight (fleas like humid and cool spots), anywhere that you find dried blood and feces (flea debris), upholstered furniture, and crevices around baseboards and cabinets (that's where the eggs and larvae are probably hiding).
When the vacuum bag is full, seal it in a plastic trash bag and put it in a covered trash container, preferably outside. Otherwise, the little buggers can crawl out and make themselves cozy again.

, An adult flea will live only about a week without blood from its host, while a flea larva can live several months. Treating your house with a safe, natural insecticide like botanical dust and borate helps attacks the larvae as well.


Botanical dusts are perhaps the oldest natural insecticides. Borates are minerals that are used widely as wood preservatives, detergents, and insecticides, acting as stomach poisons to fleas. They have low toxicity and are safe to use around humans.
While the botanical dust and borate mixture is very safe, care should be taken not to breathe it in. Use a mask when applying the dust mixture in the home.
You should dust the carpet, the furniture, the bed, the dog or cat's bed. It's good to do this when you're leaving your house for a good while, say 24 hours. When you come back, either vacuum and wash the sheets on both beds, or simply wash the sheets and leave much of the borate mixture in the carpet as a deterrent to future flea reproduction. (It is safe.)

, Before letting the pet(s) outside, prune foliage and trim grass to expose flea larvae to sunlight.Look around. Do you see any dark, moist spots? Find a way to expose them to sunlight if you can.


Even after you have exposed these places to the sunlight, you may find that your pets are still bringing in fleas from outside. The best way that you can solve this dilemma is to use either cedar wood chips or Eucalyptus leaves. Fleas hate them, and they are all-natural, so you won't contaminate nearby plants (and other useful insects) or even run the risk of harming your pet.
Purchase cedar wood chips from your nearby convenience store and spread them over the affected areas. If your dog can stand it, place cedar wood chips in its kennel. Place eucalyptus oil in affected areas. You can even plant eucalyptus bushes, although they grow quite robustly and can negatively affect the ability of other plants to grow around it.

, This is pretty much a homemade flea trap. The water and dish detergent mixture is like a toxic swimming pool for fleas. Fleas, lured in by a light source, jump into the water and cannot escape.


Place the water and detergent mixture in a very shallow bowl, low enough to the ground so that the fleas accidentally hop into it. An old flying disk or low-walled bowl does the job quite well.
Place the mixture next to a low-hanging light source, preferably something a little stronger than a night-light. The fleas are attracted to the light. After a few days, you should begin to notice that your bowl has turned into a flea cemetery.

, A 4x4m room needs a 10 L/Day dehumidifier (it removes 10L of water in the air per day). Apparently, fleas require 50% or higher relative humidity to live. Keep the humidity in your room under 50% for 2 days will kill adult fleas and larva, and stop flea eggs from hatching. You just need to vacuum the flea jerky and their eggs.

Learn how to kill bedbugs.,
Apply chemical insecticides.,
Suffocate bedbugs.,
Starve bedbugs.,
Clean and organize, this is a very important.,
Remember that nearly every household has bed bugs.,
Always think on the bright side.,
When you kill the bedbugs, it's a done feat.,
Read what others have done to get rid of bedbugs.",How to Deal with Bedbugs," Use rubbing alcohol or water and detergent applied from a good, big spray bottle. The spray bottles from home improvement and department stores are adequate. A better buy would be to use used and higher quality spray bottles for laundry pre-treatment, glass cleaners, car interior cleaners etc.


Alcohol - buy several large bottles of 70% rubbing alcohol and mix them with water at no less than 50% strength. Drench the ribbings of the mattresses and box springs, cracks where the walls and floors meet, and all cracks and crevices in chairs, furniture and other places.
Alternatively, use 90% rubbing alcohol and do not dilute; saturate the seams of the mattress. This kills them instantly but do open your windows for a while.
Detergent and water. Use this like rubbing alcohol and for cleaning of the bed before you encapsulate it. Detergent is a better cleaner than rubbing alcohol and kills bedbugs quickly.;
, This is optional, because the residual effect they have is minimal at best and its toxicity to humans. Use insecticide in out of the way places or where an aerosol spray would be more effective than from a spray bottle., After cleaning your bed especially at the corners, cover them with cheap, clear plastic bags for mattresses. Cover the box spring with the mattress cover too. Do not use the mattress cover with zippers because they cost more and especially if they have fibers in them that bedbugs can get a foothold on to climb and lay eggs. Seal the plastic bags with paper or masking tape.

, They can't live without feeding on you, so don't let them. Estimate how long they can live without feeding in your area and make every effort to starve them. Drape a plastic sheet over your bed and chair, it will be impossible for those bedbugs to pass this barrier. Move your bed away from the wall do not allow bedbugs to reach you by letting your blanket be a bridge from the floor to your bed.

, Cleaning includes washing clothes, sheets, pillows and rugs. Wipe down storage containers, and under and behind shelves and desks.

, Your neighbors or your friends might not mention it but they actually have an infested house., Did you get bitten by one? If you did, it's not a big deal because you can cure it.

, Don't fuss over a small situation. Bedbugs need food and it's just that way where they live. Even if they do come back, it's simple––kill them. On the flip side, if someone is young, old, handicapped or has an allergy, they are not going to be able to deal with bedbugs. People with untreated bed bug bites, from severe infestations, have required medical attention and hospitalization.

, There are a lot of bedbug stories on the internet. Read until the solutions become repetitious, so that you can become an expert on this subject. Ask other people about how they dealt with bedbugs. Deal with bedbugs comprehensively.

Use gel baits.,
Try a bait station.,
Use a sticky trap.",How to Kill German Roaches1," This type of bait comes in a tube and is applied by squeezing the tube to dispense the gel. Apply the gel along window and door trims, behind the trashcan, and along the cabinet doors in your kitchen and bathroom. Also apply bait gel under sinks where the drainpipe enters the wall in your kitchen and bathroom.Apply gel bait in the crevices and cracks of your kitchen drawers, and along upper shelving and baseboards.
If you have children or pets, then make sure to apply the gel in areas that are out of their reach.;
, Bait stations consist of a plastic housing that contains poison. Cockroaches enter through small holes in the housing to retrieve the bait. Make sure to place the bait stations against the walls and in corners in high traffic areas like your kitchen and bathroom.Place bait stations behind the refrigerator, microwave, oven, toasters, toilet, and other major appliances in your kitchen and bathroom. Also place them underneath your dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, washer, dryer, and hot water heater.
Identify high traffic areas by looking for roach droppings. Roach droppings resemble ground black pepper.

, Sticky traps contain pheromones that will attract the roaches. Upon entering the trap, the roaches will become stuck in it and suffocate. Also place these traps against the walls and in corners in high traffic areas.Place sticky traps in the same areas you place bait stations.
Do not spray sticky traps and bait stations with insecticides or cleaning products. These will contaminate the baits. If the bait is contaminated, then the roaches will not enter."
"
Purchase some baits.,
Make your own baits.,
Place bait stations in identified problem areas.,
Use bait gels in small spaces.,
Change and replace your bait stations frequently.,
Make sure other food sources are not available.",How to Get Rid Of Roaches In an Apartment1," Baits are one of the safest and most effective ways to eliminate roaches. They work over an extended period of time and can either kill roaches directly (when roaches eat the bait) or indirectly (when roaches eat the poisoned feces or corpses of those that have already sampled the bait). You can purchase baits in the form of small containers filled with bait (bait stations) or dispensable gels. A variety of bait gels and baited traps are available from most hardware stores, drug stores, and supermarkets. Common brand names include Avert, Blue Diamond, Combat, and Max Force.;
, You can make effective baits out of a variety of household ingredients. Try one of these bait recipes:


Mix small, equal portions of white flour, cocoa, oatmeal, boric acid, and Plaster of Paris.
Mix 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of citrus pulp, ¾ teaspoon (about 4 ml) of brown sugar, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of corn meal, and ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) of boric acid.
Bait mixtures containing boric acid should be kept out of reach of children and pets.

, Bait stations are most effective if set up in areas where cockroaches are known to gather, such as cabinets, the spaces behind and under appliances, and areas where food and moisture are readily available (such as bathrooms and kitchens).


Avoid leaving your bait stations out in the open. They are more likely to be effective (and less likely to be found by pets and children) if they are placed under or between appliances, in dark corners, and inside cabinets.
If you made your own bait, put it in a small container, like a shallow bowl or a plastic food storage container lid, and place it as you would a commercial bait station.

, Bait gel is ideal for cracks and crevices where cockroaches like to hide, but where regular bait stations will not fit.

, Since bait stations serve as food sources for roaches, they will become empty quickly in areas where roaches gather. Empty bait stations can serve as hiding places for cockroaches.


How quickly your bait stations become empty will depend on how many roaches you have. Commercial baits may include instructions to replace your baits every 3-6 months, or more frequently if roaches return before the recommended period ends.
If you make your own baits, inspect them every few weeks and replace them once the bait is depleted or cockroaches begin to reappear.

, For baits to be effective, they must serve as the roaches’ primary food source. Clean up and put away food in areas where your traps are set up.

Squish the excess water out of the pet's fur.,
Dry the pet with a clean dry towel.",How to Get Rid of Fleas2," Anything with conventional insecticides (pyrethrins, permethrin, d-limonene, chlorpyrifos, or carbaryl) might irritate or harm your pet and the people around it.Instead, try natural insecticides or flea irritants. They shouldn't harm your pet but will be mighty nasty for fleas. Make sure to check with your vet first, though. Here's a list of insecticides or irritants you could consider:

Rosemary oil
Eucalyptus oil
Citrus oil
Cedar oil (toxic to cats)
Tea tree oil (toxic to cats)Can be toxic to dogs if ingested, not worth the risk!!



, This way, fleas don't jump up to the head during the bath.


When fleas sense water, they immediately seek cover in dry, hard-to-reach places on your pet. So it's a good idea to at least wet, if not clean, the rectum, ears, eye cavity, and neck before getting the entire body wet.
For extra security, keep lathering up your pet for up to 15 minutes. 5 minutes is the minimum time needed to begin killing off the fleas, but 15 minutes is the safe bet.
Rinse your pet under warm/lukewarm water for several minutes, making sure to cleanse the soap from its skin and soak the remaining potential hiding places for fleas.

, This could be a flea-collar, a spot-on, or oral medication. Prescription strength (from a vet) spot-on treatments usually work best.If the collar contains only insect growth regulator (which prevents larvae from turning into adults, but does not affect the existing adults), use another treatment such as a spot-on product, to control adult fleas. Collars can be irritating to the pet's skin and are sometimes ineffective.
The following products are not considered to be effective: Vitamin B1 (thiamine hydrochloride) supplements, herbal collars and ultrasonic devices.

, A flea is covered with tiny hairs that allow them to ""grip"" onto the host's fur. Using a comb with teeth that are close enough together that the flea can't slip through is the most effective way to dislodge them. A comb designed for another purpose or a brush won't remove all the fleas., Add mild dish soap.

, Add more dish soap as needed. Wash for around 15 minutes.

, Let the water fill in the cup under the faucet, as you check for soapy areas.

, Spray or pour only vinegar in areas of the pet where heavy flea activity was found.

, Give the pet extra TLC, and apply flea medicine.

Try dish soap.,
Use yeast as a weapon.,
Make your own herbal flea dip for pets.,
Spread salt over the surface of your carpet.,
Make a citrus spray.,
Consider using diatomaceous earth.,
Follow up.",How to Get Rid of Fleas3,", Coat the dog well with a strong solution of soapy water. Let it soak in for five to ten minutes (or more), then comb the dead fleas away. Rinse the dog and let it dry. Dish soap also leaves your dog soft, shiny and smelling great.


Make sure you rinse your dog off thoroughly to prevent dry skin.
Be aware that some dogs may be sensitive to strong detergents, so if you see a reaction, rinse thoroughly with cool water and try baby shampoo after the skin has returned to normal.

, Fleas reportedly don't like the taste of yeast. Although this has not been proven, many people swear by it. Buy some brewer's or nutritional yeast and rub it onto your pet's skin. You can also sprinkle a small amount onto their wet food and mix it in.

, Take two cups of fresh rosemary leaves and add them to two pints of water. Boil for thirty minutes. Strain the liquid, discard the leaves and mix it with up to a gallon of warm water. Pour this over your pet until they are saturated. Do not rinse off, but allow your pet to air dry.

, Salt is a desiccant, meaning it saps the moisture from things and dries them out. When a salt crystal attaches itself to a flea, it will attach itself to the flea. This causes chafing and scraping on the flea, essentially bleeding the flea to death as it walks.


Use very fine-grained salt for this. The finer the better; you want it to be small enough to attach itself to the flea.
After 7-10 days, vacuum the salted area very thoroughly, making sure to pick up all the salt and flea carcasses from the carpet area. Repeat the process one or two more times.
When you're done vacuuming, discard the old vacuum bag from the vacuum and replace it with a new one. Seal the discarded vacuum bag in a plastic bag and discard outside the house.

, Slice a lemon thinly, add to a pint of water and heat to a boiling point. Let it sit overnight and in the morning, put the mixture in a spray bottle. Spray it onto areas where you suspect fleas hang out (beware of staining). Be sure to also rub it over your cat's fur. Don't soak, but dampen the fur. Do this once a month to combat fleas.


Another way to make a citrus spray is to buy essential oils (available at natural food stores); you can buy a bottle of lemon oil and add 10-20 drops per ounce of water.
This is something to do on a hot day only: Add 2 to 3 drops of the lemon mixture under your pet's collar to help keep fleas off.

, Diatomaceous Earth is a widely available, low cost, organic powder that kills fleas and most insects when applied to your yard or carpets.


It's food-grade, meaning it is safe for humans and animals to ingest. Diatomaceous earth works by puncturing the exoskeleton of the insects, causing them to dry out.

, This is the most critical step because if you skimp on it, all your efforts from your previous steps will be undone. The eggs that survived will hatch, and the entire cycle will begin again. Do the following until you find no traces of fleas on your pets or in your home:


Vacuum thoroughly every other day. Since fleas can develop resistance to insecticides, vacuuming regularly is essential in order to bring them under control.Mow the lawn regularly.
Wash pet bedding in hot, soapy water at least once a week.

Clean out your car.,
Wash blankets and throw covers.,
Spray the interior of the car with flea spray.,
Vacuum thoroughly.,
Spray or dust with a leave-in product.",How to Get Rid of Fleas4," While you are working on cleaning up your home, don't forget your car. Even if your pet hasn't been in the car, fleas may have hitched a ride on your shoes or pants. Place any trash in a plastic bag, then seal it and throw it away.

, Make sure to wash them in hot water and dry them using high heat.

, Pay close attention to corners, edges, cracks between the seats, and under the seats and floor mats. Wait half an hour before wiping away the spray.

, Again, pay close attention to corners, edges, cracks between the seats and the area under the seats and mats. Be sure to empty your vacuum afterward, since eggs you vacuumed up can hatch at a later time.

, Choose a product that can be left on the carpeting. Lemon spray, eucalyptus spray and cedar oil work well as flea repellents and will leave your car smelling fresh.

Use a duster bulb to apply the acid.,
Administer boric acid in between your walls.,
Use it in combination with gel bait and bait stations.",How to Kill German Roaches2," A duster bulb will enable you to apply a thin layer of boric acid. Squeeze the bulb to puff a small layer of powder along the floor and walls in your kitchen and bathroom. The layer should be barely visible to your eye. Do not apply too much boric acid. If you do, then the roaches will be able to detect it and they will avoid the area.Do not use a spoon to apply the boric acid.
You can purchase the acid from your local hardware store.
Do not apply the acid on countertops, especially where food is prepared.

, Drill a hole in your drywall big enough to fit the tip of the duster bulb. Place the tip of the duster bulb into the hole. Squeeze the bulb to dispense the boric acid in between your walls.Since roaches tend to live in between walls, this is an effective way to kill them.

, But do not use it in combination with sticky traps. The traps will prevent the roaches from going back home, which helps spread the acid to other roaches."

Caulk holes and cracks.",How to Kill German Roaches3," Remove particles of food and clean up spills on your counters, tables, sink, stovetop, and other surfaces in your kitchen. Also make sure to sweep your kitchen and dining room floors, as well as other areas where you eat at least five times a week, if not every day.Try not to leave dirty dishes and food in the sink overnight.
Empty the trash every night and cover the trashcan with a tight fitting lid.

, Store flour, sugar, cookies, bread, cereal, crackers, and other food items in airtight containers. This will prevent the cockroaches from smelling the food and invading your kitchen., Use an expanding foam to cover cracks, holes, crevices, and gaps along the bottom of the walls in your kitchen and bathroom. Make sure to cover cracks and crevices around the pipes under the sinks in your kitchen and bathroom as well.You can purchase expanding foams from your local hardware store.

Purchase one or more pesticide dusts.,
Place pesticide dusts in places where roaches hide.,
Keep pesticide dusts away from pets and children.",How to Get Rid Of Roaches In an Apartment2," Three basic types are available: silica (as found in products like Delta Dust or Safer Ant & Crawling Insect Killer), diatomaceous earth (Roach and Ant Killer D-E Dust), and boric acid (Borid, Pic Boric, or Roach Prufe). Silica and diatomaceous earth work by damaging and desiccating the cockroach’s exoskeleton, while boric acid is highly toxic to roaches when ingested.Borax (sodium borate) is often used as a homemade roach pesticide. Borax contains the same element (boron) as boric acid, but may be less effective as a pesticide.

, These dusts should be used sparingly. Roaches will notice and avoid big piles of dust. Use a small pesticide powder duster to puff a thin (barely visible) film into cracks, void spaces around cabinets, and underneath appliances. Re-apply your dusts every 3-4 months, or as recommended by the manufacturer.

, Although these pesticides are relatively safe, they can still be harmful. Be especially cautious when using dusts that contain boric acid. Do not use these dusts on surfaces where food is prepared or consumed.

Vacuum up roaches when you see them.,
Set sticky traps and jar traps.,
Hire a licensed professional to treat your apartment.",How to Get Rid Of Roaches In an Apartment3," This is a quick and effective way to “spot treat” your roach problem. If you see live roaches, droppings, or egg cases, vacuum them up and dispose of your vacuum bag or the contents of your vacuum canister in a garbage container outside of your building., These types of traps can help reduce the number of roaches in your apartment, and can also be useful for helping you identify areas in your apartment where roaches are most likely to gather.


You can purchase sticky traps in most hardware stores, drug stores, or department stores.
You can make your own traps by lining the inside of a jar with Vaseline and placing a slightly moist piece of bread and some slices of raw potato inside as bait. You can kill the roaches you trap in the jar by filling the jar with soapy water.Dispose of the trapped roaches in a garbage container outside your building.

, Pest control experts are permitted to use chemicals that private citizens are not, such as Avermectin. Contact your landlord to find out if they already have a working relationship with an exterminator in your area.

Talk to your property manager or building supervisor.,
Eliminate all roach food sources.,
Keep problem areas clean.,
Pick up clutter.,
Eliminate sources of moisture.,
Check for cracks and holes.",How to Get Rid Of Roaches In an Apartment4," Even if you eliminate roaches from your specific apartment, they will keep returning if the building is not treated. Roaches can inhabit the walls and spaces between units, or travel between units in a building., They love the carbohydrates and sugar found in your food, soaps, and even plants.


Keep food (for humans and pets) in glass or plastic containers, with lids that fit tightly. Transfer any food that you keep in bags, boxes, or other materials that are easy for roaches to chew through.
Replace bar soap with liquid soap dispensers, and spread a bit of petroleum jelly on plant holders and pots to keep roaches away from the plants in your apartment.
Keep garbage, compost and recycling in tightly sealed containers, and take out your garbage frequently.

, Crumbs, spills, and stains will attract roaches. Clean kitchen surfaces thoroughly after preparing food. Sweep up crumbs and mop up spills immediately. Scrub inside cabinets and around and under appliances.Take extra care to sweep and scrub up any roach droppings that you find, since these can attract other roaches.

, Roaches like to hide in boxes, stacks of paper, or piles of laundry. Avoid storing paper bags, magazines, or newspapers on the floor or in cabinets., Keep your bathroom and kitchen as dry as possible. If you have leaky pipes or worn grout, bring them to your landlord’s attention. Mop up spilled water immediately, and wipe down sinks and bathtubs immediately after use. You may wish to empty pet water dishes overnight., Roaches travel in and out of walls, doors and windows through cracks as small as 1/5 inch (0.5 cm). Check your window screens, doors and walls for holes or other damage. Put weather stripping over any cracks in your doors. Cracks and holes in the walls can be repaired with spackle or caulk. You may wish to consult with your landlord before attempting any repairs yourself.

Get some non-permeable mattress and pillow covers.,
Buy some bug interceptors, and install them beneath all four feet of your bed frame.",How to Get Rid of Bed Bugs Naturally," Get rid of anything you no longer want or need. Put them in plastic bags, and throw them away. This will make it easier to tackle your bed bug problem.


If you need to move something out of an infested room temporarily, put it into a plastic bin with a tight fitting lid first.;
, If something cannot be laundered, see if you can take it to a dry cleaner instead. You can also sanitize it by putting it into the dryer for at 15 minutes on a high heat setting.Depending on how severe your infestation is, you may need to wash everything once or twice a week for several months—even after the bed bugs are gone.
Don't forget to clean the laundry area with a sanitizing cleaner once you are done.
This also includes soft toys. Be sure to put them inside a pillowcase when washing them, so that you don't damage their fur.

, You can also use plastic, zippered or resealable bags instead. Whatever container you choose to use, you must keep it closed whenever you are not handling the things inside. This will prevent the newly-cleaned items from getting re-infested. Store these bins away from the infested room., This includes anything made out of fibers, such as box springs, carpets, curtains, mattresses, and upholstered items. It also includes ""hard"" items, such as furniture, hardwood floors, baseboards, and anything else with nooks and crannies.

, Take the bag out of the vacuum cleaner and put it into a plastic bag. Tie the plastic bag up tightly, and throw it away immediately outside your house. Do not leave the bag inside your house, or you may get another infestation., It is important that you use one which reaches at least 200°F (93.4°C) and which produces dry steam. The ""dry steam"" is important because you don't want everything left soaking wet, which can lead to mold and mildew.

, If something is beyond saving, get rid of it. Rip off the covers of upholstered furniture. Mark infested pieces clearly with ""Infested with Bed Bugs"" or ""Bed Bugs"" signs. Make arrangements with your city to have these items disposed of as soon as possible.This will prevent people from attempting to make treasures from your trash, and inheriting your bed bug infestation.

, Most insects hate the smell of these plants, and bed bugs are no exception. You can use these herbs fresh or dried. Here area few ideas on how you can use eucalyptus, lavender, mint, and rosemary to ward off bed bugs:Tie up bundles of these herbs, and hang them in your wardrobe.
Place sachets containing these herbs in your dresser and linen closet.

, The essential oils that work the best on bed bugs include: citronella, eucalyptus, lavender, mint, and rosemary. Note that if you have pets, you should use tea tree oil with care, as it can be toxic to them. Listed below are a few ways you can use essential oils to get rid of bed bugs:Rub some essential oil onto your bed frame.
Add a few drops of essential oil into your laundry the next time you wash your bedding.Make a simple spray by adding a few drops essential oil into a spray bottle filled with ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water. Use this spray on your bedding, carpet, and linens., Diatomaceous earth is made from diatoms. It appears like a powder, but to bed bugs, it is like shattered glass. It not only kills bed bugs, but keeps them out.While pesticide grade diatomaceous earth is considered safe for humans and animals, you would not want to eat it or breathe it in.


Avoid getting pool or food grade diatomaceous earth. The grains are too fine, and can be harmful for you., Find 8 to 10 dryer sheets, and place them between the box spring and the mattress. Place 8 to 10 more of these sheets on the mattress underneath your bed sheets. The strong smell of the dryer sheets will send the bedbugs scurrying.Consider stuffing a dryer sheet or two inside your pillow case, dresser drawers, and linen closet.
Bed bugs seem to hate the smell of lavender in particular. Consider using some lavender-scented dryer sheets.

, These covers are special, because they don't have any seams and other crannies for the bed bugs to hide out in.They are also easy to wash, and keep bed bugs from infesting your pillows and mattress., They will keep the bed bugs from crawling onto your bed.If you can't find any, get some plastic bowls or dishes, and place them beneath all four feet of your bed. Fill them with some soapy water to drown any bed bugs who dare climb up your bed."

Inventory potential roach habitats in your home.,
Check these areas for infestation.,
Note any areas roaches would live, feed, or lay eggs.,
Check areas roaches may live for unpleasant smells.,
Clean areas of any food debris or standing water.,
Use borax if you are uncomfortable making boric acid.,
React excess hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid) with Borax to produce boric acid and salt water.,
Filter out the boric acid crystals.,
Take the borax or boric acid and place it in a container.,
Sprinkle or spray the borax or boric acid on target areas.,
Remove electrical outlet covers, dust inside the walls with borax.,
Cover any noted areas with a light dusting of insecticide.,
Sprinkle the borax or boric acid, dry, on any carpet or rug.,
Wipe down any targeted areas with a damp cloth before using the surface.",How to Get Rid of Roaches with Borax," Roaches are omnivorous and seek dark, moist places . Inspect areas around the baseboards of your floor, under or around pipes, anywhere there is food waste, behind electrical outlet covers, and narrow, hard to reach spaces are ripe for potential infestation. Roaches prefer to leave their eggs protected in dark crevices if they are not viviparous or oviparous.;
, You can do this by blowing a portable fan around the area to provoke an escape response, or by using an intense sudden light source to provoke the escape response . Leaving bait out without any pesticide is not recommended, as it will simply encourage infestation.

, These are areas with regular food contact, exposure to water, or that are dark and inaccessible. These areas should be targeted regardless of observed infestation. Boric acid has a strong prophylactic effect that kills generations of insects over time.

, Cockroaches have a number of scent glands used in communication and courtship that produce a distinctive smell, in some cases sweet, in others oily and musky. These are telltale signs of an area that is infested and should be targeted.Some cockroaches are perching insects that can thrive on top of high surfaces like shelves, and these should be inventoried and cleared for application of the insecticide.

, Make sure this is done before preparing or applying the insecticide. Clean surfaces and preventing standing water from building up deprive cockroaches of resources. Bait is unnecessary with this insecticide, and eggs are less likely to be spread where there is no feeding resource for the female insect.

, Boric acid is a more effective insecticide, more soluble in water, and is equally unlikely to produce any lasting harm in humans. Both can be applied as a powder and have identical methods of killing the insect. , Boric acid will appear as large white crystals in suspension. Boric acid can be bought as well, and is less hazardous than hydrochloric acid, which is required to convert borax into the far more effective insecticide, boric acid.


Hydrochloric acid is sold commonly as muriatic acid as a solution to acidify swimming pools. Hydrochloric acid should be handled with extreme caution. Use gloves, eye protection, and respiratory protection (in a well-ventilated area) and can cause significant harm. Have baking soda on hand to neutralize any strong-acid reaction that is unintended. Do not use water to treat strong acid burns., Treat any excess solution with baking soda to neutralize the strong acid. Do not pour the solution down the sink until you are sure it is neutralized. Use litmus paper to test the acidity of the excess solution. When the crystals are dry they are ready for storage.

, Make sure it is clean, inert, clearly labelled container and free of moisture. Proper storage and labeling is key to maintaining safety and avoiding accidentally ingesting the product, as it is visually quite similar to table salt. Avoiding moisture will prevent unwanted large chunks from forming.


A recycled ketchup bottle can be used as a kind of bellows to distribute the insecticide powder in the tight space of an electrical outlet with minimal risk. Squeeze the bottle to test and make sure dust comes out (take care to not get any in your eyes, mouth or nose). Make sure the hole of the bottle you’re using is large enough for the borax crystals to go through freely.
Borax is soluble in hot water, as is boric acid and can be dissolved and put in a spray bottle, and the dried residue of aqueous boric acid is essentially undetectable to the insect and low risk to humans. However, if you are applying it near electrical outlets use it as a powder.

, It is unnecessary to mix it with bait, as it is not repellant to insects normally, and is tracked by the insect and spread as a surface toxin to other insects. Once you have covered the areas take care that no food preparation or dusting occurs to prevent accidental ingestion.

, This is an easy access to interior spaces in walls where roaches live and lay eggs. Spray the borax into the space using your bottle like a bellows, squeezing repeatedly. Replace the outlet covers when done. Do not use dissolved borax.

, The insecticide will spread among the colony through contact. Complete coverage is desirable, but if any targeted areas have infestations, the insecticide will spread to other insects and kill them, and will not affect the desirability of food to the insects considerably.

, The borax will destroy eggs and larvae in the carpet. Vacuum up the powder some 20 minutes after application. Any eggs or insects killed will go up with them. Follow any rug care instructions.


If you targeted carpeted areas, vacuum a short time after application. Any eggs will be killed in short order, but the insecticide dust can cause lung irritation or toxicity in pets and small children. It is not advisable to leave it in an area where it will be kicked up as dust continually.

, Reapply treatment after use, or after several days if roaches are still a problem. This is a relatively slow insecticide, but an extremely effective one. Continue the treatment in this manner until the roaches are gone.

Exterminators alone will not help, and their products are not good for you.,
At home, put a tube of caulk in the caulking gun (see: Things You'll Need).,
Start in the kitchen.,
It's also helpful to keep a sponge and a bucket of water with you.,
Now you need to do an exhaustive search.,
Switch plate covers -- here is where you may want to call an exterminator.,
Dropped or acoustic ceilings are the hardest thing to fix if the acoustic tile has big holes in it (pencil eraser size, for example).,
Next, do the plumbing.,
If you have forced air heat, lift out the vent covers and caulk or foam around the opening.,
The last thing we had to do was fill very small gaps between the hardwood floorboards.,
Keep your eyes open.",How to Get Rid of Roaches by Caulking," The pest control guys and building superintendents want to come in and ""bomb"" your stuff. Let's see, putting the residue of toxic bug killing haze all over your furniture, floors, walls and toys hurts who -- the bugs who live hidden in other spaces, or the people who use and touch the stuff? Just say no to cockroach ""bombing"".


To really cure this problem, you need to be in a place you are going to stay for awhile. If you'll only be there for a month or two, you might just want to find a different place. Otherwise it is not labor or cost effective.
This worked for us. We got rid of 100% of the cockroaches in our apartment without exposing ourselves or our kids to toxic pesticides. No more checking my kids in the night and seeing a giant pregnant one crawling across the headboard (Gut reaction: Kill! Kill! Kill!).
We used the barrier method. It may not be 100% effective in preventing pregnancy but it works pretty damn good for bugs. Basically, roaches live in the walls. People don't, so we decided not to care if they did. We just stopped them from coming out into our side of the apartment (outside the walls). Let's get started!;
, Cut an opening in the tip, and keep it small so you have good control.

, Keep a damp paper towel handy to wipe your hand on. Examine your cabinets. Cabinets are hung on walls which may have openings in them that you can't see or seal up, so seal with caulk all around your cabinets. If you do a neat job, your landlord will not even know you did anything. They'll only be pissed at you if you make a big messy blob. Ask for help if you've never done it before. Squirt the caulk out along the joint, then smooth it down with a damp fingertip. Wipe off excess.

, Dampen the sponge, squeeze it out and run the long edge along the floor (or surface)where you just caulked. Don't press really hard--let the sponge keep an edge. You'll have a thin, smooth line when you're done. Wring/rise out the sponge after each swipe.


Make sure to caulk between each cabinet box where it butts against the next cabinet. Also get up on the counter and check the top side of the cabinets and seal it off up there, too. Look inside your cabinets and seal any openings on the back wall. Make sure the sink is sealed to the countertop.
If you find any major holes (we found a whopper behind a blank panel where they had pulled off the old cabinets) use the expanding foam to fill it. That stuff is ugly, so if it is exposed, make a plan to fill the space that looks better than the foam.
A secret opening the cockroaches know about but you don't is the gap between the countertop and the cabinet box on the underside. Take out all your stuff and caulk that baby good! Do all the cabinets on all sides in your whole kitchen.

, Crawl around the edges of all of your rooms. Anywhere a wall meets a floor, ceiling, windowsill, door jamb or trim item needs to be caulked. This takes time, and a LOT of caulk. When in doubt, caulk it.

, There are special baits an exterminator has access to that a regular person does not. Before you take off all the switch plate covers and seal around them, the exterminator can place bait inside the walls. Tell them to put in a lot because it will be hard to get back under there when you are done. The baited cockroaches go back to the nest, die, are eaten by others and kill at least some of them, too. A comforting thought.


After you've resolve the bait issue, every single switchplate and outlet cover of any type must be must be taken off, caulked around the inside edge and stuck back on (wipe off any extra that oozes out). You might think they'd come through the prong openings on an outlet but there is not really much access. You can use the plug covers if that bothers you.

, You might want to replace the holey kind, or hire someone to float drywall mud over it and paint it. Ask your landlord to do it, or at least for permission if you are a renter. This type are usually glued to the ceiling and may have asbestos so it is better not to pull them down.


If the fibrous acoustic tiles do not have holes in them, either paint the whole thing to seal between the panels and the metal hanging strips, or lift each panel,caulk around it and set it back down.

, This is very important, since roaches need water even more than they need food -- they've got nest mates for that! Make sure your tub is caulked all around, even at the top of the wall surround. Caulk gaps in the grout if you have tiles. Get down and caulk all around the base of your toilet. Pull the thin metal flanges away from the wall where the pipes come through and caulk around the pipes. Caulk around the cabinet or around the sink itself if it is hung from the wall.

, Make sure you leave room for the vent cover to go back on, and not get stuck in the gooey caulk. If your ducts seem to have gaps in them inside the wall where you can't reach, roaches might be able to get access. You can fix some screen fabric under the vent to prevent them from getting in. A hot glue gun would be helpful for that. The screens would need to be cleaned periodically.

, A flooring person would not recommend this, but a person who wants the bugs gone would!

, If you see them, follow them and find out where they are coming in. Pretty soon they will be gone, gone, gone. We lived above a group of bachelors who did not care. The exterminator said it was one of the worst places he had ever seen, but we had zero bugs. He was impressed. Victory for our side!!

Cut off water sources.,
Clean your house thoroughly.,
Hide your food.,
Mop the floor routinely.,
Take out the trash regularly.",How to Get Rid of Roaches1," Cockroaches must have a source of water. Depending on the temperature and their size, they can live for a month without any food, but no more than a week without water. Find all the water leaks in your house, and fix them. Once their water source(s) have been eliminated, they will be much more interested in eating gel-based baits you set out.;
, A clean house is key to keeping cockroaches away, and the first place to start is the kitchen. Wash your dishes and put food away promptly after meals. Clean up crumbs and spills right away, and generally keep the area clean. Pay special attention to range tops, as cockroaches love grease.

, Keep food containers sealed, and don't leave food out for extended periods. Don't leave dirty dishes out overnight, and don't leave fruit on the countertop.

, This should clean up crumbs and sticky spots. Do not slop water against the walls; remember, they need water.

, Have one trash can for food in your house. Don't let it sit for too long. Use a trash can with a lid, rather than one that stays open. Keep it in sealed containers that aren't sitting right next to your house.

Replace your mattress and box spring every 2-3 years.,
Use protective covers on your mattresses and box springs.,
Vacuum carpets and rugs often.,
Use essential oils to repel bed bugs.,
Clear out clutter.,
Install door sweeps or door jams.",How to Prevent Bed Bugs1," While this may seem like a very short time to have a mattress, it may be a smart action to take in order to eliminate the problem at its source. Once bed bugs have gotten into your bed, it’s extremely difficult to tell how many are in there, figure out exactly where they are, and get them out. Additionally, bed bugs can linger in other areas around your home but they are most often going to be in your bed.
, You can keep bed bugs from infecting your bed by encasing your mattress and box springs in a plastic protective cover. The bugs will have difficulty crawling under the elastic of the protective cover and cannot penetrate the fabric. While you may already have a protective cover on your mattress, adding one to your box springs will eliminate hiding places.Mattress protective covers are widely available at most stores that sell bedding, such as big box stores, home goods stores, and internet retailers.
If you do bring home bed bugs, your protective cover will make it easier to see the bugs quickly. First wash all of the clothing and other fabric that you travelled with, and then check the cover so that you can immediately recognize and address the problem.If bed bugs have already gotten into the mattress and box spring, it’s better to dispose of them immediately than try to remove the bed bugs.

, Vacuum at least weekly. If you suspect that you’ve come into contact with bed bugs, then vacuum daily until you’re sure that your home is clear.Dispose of the vacuum contents carefully in a plastic bag that you can seal, then remove from your home immediately.
If you do have bed bugs, failing to empty the vacuum cleaner can allow the bugs to spread.

, There are several scent options for keeping away the bed bugs, so you just need to pick the one you like. Add 6-10 drops of pure essential oil to a small spray bottle filled with ¼ cup of water. Spray your scented water in your house and on items you take with you in public, such as your outerwear, handbags, totes, backpacks, and luggage.Essential oils that repel bed bugs include the following: cinnamon, lemongrass, clove, peppermint, lavender, thyme, tea tree, and eucalyptus.You can make a repellant for your body if you mix the oil in a carrier oil, such as jojoba or grapeseed oil., Clutter gives bed bugs a place to hide and makes it easier for the bugs to infest your home. It’s much harder to monitor for the presence of bed bugs if you can’t get to items or easily move them around. Minimizing the places where the bugs can hide is essential for keeping the bugs out., If you live near other homes, such as in an apartment building or townhouse row, seal off your apartment by blocking the gap below your door. You can either install a door sweep or purchase a door jam that completely covers the open space. This will make it more difficult for the bugs to come into your home.If your home has cracks or other damage to the walls or ceiling, get these repaired so that the bugs can’t enter that way.

, Bedbugs take in the blood of other humans and if you smash one you could get that blood, with any diseases it contains, on you. Plus your fingers may be going into some grungy places.

, Grab your tools, a flashlight with a strong beam and an old credit card.

, Remove all the bedding down to the bottom sheet.

, Run your flashlight over the sheet looking for excrement or bloodstains. If the linen has just been changed you probably won’t find anything.

, Remove the bottom sheet and examine the mattress. Use the flashlight to look for excrement and bloodstains on the top surface of the mattress. Look for shed bedbug skins and eggs.

, Use the credit card to run along the mattress seam, holding it open to look with your flashlight. You may see live bedbugs hiding there, skins or excrement.

, Run the credit card under any buttons to chase out any hiding bugs. Examine any straps, and look under any tags on the mattress.

, Watch for fleeing bugs as you do so. While the mattress is in the air, check the rails of the bed frame under it.

, Quickly shine the flashlight on the wall behind it, looking for fleeing bugs. Then examine the wall for stains from excrement or small spots of blood.

, Bugs may be hiding in the seams between pieces of wood or in the holes for screws.

, Check any piece of upholstered furniture thoroughly as you did the mattress, using the flashlight and your credit card. Turn it over and look at the underside.

, Don’t forget cribs and bassinets.

, Inspect the seams of decorative pillows.

, Turn them over, move them away from the wall, pull out any drawers and flip them over. Run the credit card in crevices. Inspect hollow legs.

, Take the clothes out of dresser drawers and shake the drawers out over a clean white sheet, looking for bugs, skins or excrement.

, Check the seams and underside of dresser drawers with the flashlight and credit card.

, Take the clothes out of closets and shake them over a white sheet. Examine the seams of heavy clothing like coats and under collars.

, Move all remaining items from the closets and inspect the walls with your flashlight.

, Look inside, under, and around all objects in the room, lamps, radios, clocks, TV’s, computers and so on.

,, This is another place where bedbugs love to hide!

, Start with the bed, proceed to the rest of the room (working outward from the bed), and then check other rooms in the house.

, Similarly, you'll want to check behind picture frames and mirrors as well.

, You are more likely to find them lower to the ground but this does not mean you should neglect the upper areas.

, Look under throw rugs and around the edges of carpets. This is another time where the card and light come in handy.

, If you can turn it over inspect the bottom.

, You will need other tools for this. Remove outlet and switch covers and shine the flashlight inside.

, Run the credit card behind moldings and baseboards if you don’t want to remove them.

, Move appliances away from the wall; shine the flashlight on the wall and on the back of the appliance.

, Sweep under large appliances like refrigerators then get down and look under them with a flashlight.

, Pay attention to the laundry room. Inspect dirty clothes; look carefully at hampers and baskets, particularly wicker items.

Use store-bought cockroach bait.,
Try homemade cockroach baits.",How to Get Rid of Roaches2," Cockroach bait is either housed in a childproof-case or applied as a gel and contains a slow-working poison mixed in with an attractive food (for cockroaches).The roaches eat the poison and bring it back to the nest, where it eventually kills all the other roaches.


Place the bait in an area where you know cockroaches will encounter it, such as along baseboards, under the sink, and in corners. It should be as close to the nest as possible, so that as many roaches as possible will eat it and take it back to the nest.
Most cockroach baits contain Fipronil .05% or Hydramethylnon 2% as the active ingredient. Roaches will eat the poison, then excrete it back at the nest, where other roaches will come into contact with it and die.
Killing roaches using this method can take several weeks. Once the first generation of cockroaches is killed, their eggs will hatch and more cockroaches will have to be poisoned before the nest is gone for good.

, Mix one part powdered (not granular) boric acid (sometimes sold as a roach-killing powder, but often available in pharmacies), one part white flour, one part powdered white sugar. The sugar and flour attracts the roaches, and the boric acid kills them.Sprinkle the powder in the backs of drawers and cabinets, under the refrigerator, under the stove, and so on.


You can also try a similar mixture of 1 part boric acid, 2 parts flour and 1 part cocoa.
Expect at least 3 cycles of disappearance/reemergence of progressively smaller hordes of cockroaches, lasting about 2 weeks each. Continue using boric acid till roaches are gone.
Kids, dogs, and some other pets will eat this mixture. Boric acid is not highly toxic to humans and pets, but is for external use only, so place it where only the bugs can get it.
The mixture will cake hard in humid environments, so paper or foil trays may be needed to protect your floors and cabinets.

Use a solution of soap and water.,
Use an insecticide spray.,
Apply a liquid concentrate.,
Get professional grade pesticides.",How to Get Rid of Roaches3," This is an easy way to kill adult roaches. Make a light solution of soap (bath soap is fine) and water that is thin enough to spray through a spray bottle.You can splash it, spray it or just throw it on the roach. Just 2 or 3 drops of a soapy water solution can kill a roach. Ensure that it makes contact with the roach's head and lower abdomen. If you can turn the roach over, hitting the belly is best. The roach will run or try to run, but will suddenly stop and die or be almost dead in one minute.


The soapy water kills them by forming a thin film over the roach's breathing pores that stays in place due to surface tension, causing the roach to suffocate.
Throw the roach away as soon as possible, since it could recover if the water dries up or has not touched a large percentage of its body.

, Get some insecticide that is labeled for use against cockroaches and contains Cyfluthrin or another insecticide as the active ingredient.Spray wherever cockroaches may be hiding or entering the house, including along walls, in cracks, and in vents.


Keep pets and children out of the way when you are spraying, and follow all safety instructions on the product's label.
If you're also using roach bait, don't spray near the bait. The spray may contaminate the bait and cause roaches to stay away from it.
Using spray against roaches works to keep them out of sight for the present moment, but it can also serve to drive them further into your walls and make the problem worse. It's important to treat the nest as well as killing roaches on site.

, Liquid concentrates, once the exclusive domain of professional exterminators, are now being made for use by the public.The concentrate is a poison or deterrent chemical that is diluted with water and then sprayed, wiped, or mopped onto just about any surface, crack or crevice to kill roaches that walk there. Concentrates can be particularly effective providing protection against re-infestation, as they usually deter roaches for 1-2 weeks or more.

, For the worst infestations, as a very last resort, you might want to order the strongest pesticides available. Look for a pesticide that contains Cypermethrin.Professional baits, glue traps with pheromones, and professional sprays are far more effective than products bought at a local home store. Cy-Kick CS is a micro-encapsulated product that is very effective against roaches.You'll probably have to buy it online, because this pesticide isn't usually sold in hardware stores. It will kill live bugs, as well as provide a residual effect for three months. Spray it around the perimeter of your home and in places like your basement.


The downside is that this will kill all bugs, even ones that eat roaches, like spiders and millipedes.
Use this only as a last resort, and don't use it at all if you have pets and kids around. It's a very strong poison that will harm anyone who eats it.

Stay in top grade hotels.,
Check the bed, nightstand, and upholstered furniture for signs of bed bugs.,
Keep your luggage away from the bed.,
Use the luggage rack.,
Unpack your suitcase outside.,
Wash your travel clothes separate from other laundry immediately.,
Run clothes and bags through the dryer on high heat.,
Use cold to treat items that can’t be heated.,
Vacuum your luggage.",How to Prevent Bed Bugs2," Most three, four, and five star hotels have fixed policies on how often they change out mattresses and pillows. Staying in a nicer, more expensive hotel won’t ensure a bed bug-free environment, but it definitely increases your chances., Move the sheets and look in the crevices of the mattress and box springs. Look for reddish-brown bugs, small red spots, yellow skins, and egg casings, which look like tiny translucent sacks. Check seams and crevices of all furniture.Don’t neglect the headboard and other wooden furniture near the mattress. Bed bugs can hide in the cracks.
If you find a bed bug, contact the front desk and leave immediately.
You may not always be able to see the bed bugs. Just because you can't find them doesn't mean they are not there. If you wake up and have developed an itchy rash, then bed bugs may be in your bed.

, Even if you don’t find signs of bed bugs, it’s best to avoid placing luggage on the bed, even for a moment while removing items from it. Your luggage is the item most likely to carry bugs back from your trip and it’s the hardest to treat. Keeping it free of bugs will give you the best chance at preventing an infestation.While you initially inspect the room, place your bag in the bathtub where it’s unlikely to pick up bugs., After you check it for contamination, move the luggage rack away from the wall and put your luggage on top of it.If there’s not a luggage rack, the bathroom and tub are the safest locations in the hotel room for you luggage.

, When you get home, avoid bringing in hitchhiking bugs by removing the contents of your suitcase outside. Place all clothes in plastic bags for immediate washing, and leave your suitcase outside until you’ve inspected it., Include all of the clothes that you brought on your trip in your washing, not just the clothes you wore. Wash and dry the clothes on the highest setting that the fabric can withstand or take items to the dry cleaners.Undress on a hard surface floor rather than on carpet if you suspect bed bugs are on your clothing. Wipe off the floor to capture any bed bugs that fall off the clothes.

, The heat from a dryer can kill bed bugs at any stage of their development. Washing alone won’t kill the bugs. To get the best results, wash the items in hot water and then dry them for 30 minutes on high heat., If you can’t dry an item, placing it in the freezer can also kill bed bugs. Place items that are better suited for cold in your freezer., Use an attachment on your vacuum cleaner or a handheld vacuum to clean your bag. Pay special attention to the crevices.You can also use a no-pest strip to treat your bag if you’re worried you may have encountered bed bugs. Place the strip and your luggage in a large garbage bag. Seal it and let it sit for two weeks."
"
Check secondhand furniture and clothes.,
Minimize contact with surfaces at shared laundry facilities.,
Inspect clothes you’re going to purchase.",How to Prevent Bed Bugs3," Secondhand items are one of the biggest risks for bed bug infestation, so buying new items is always the safest bet. If you choose to buy secondhand furniture and clothing, make sure to carefully inspect the seams and crevices of all secondhand items for small reddish-brown bugs or red spots.Don’t take pieces of furniture or mattresses from the dumpster or trash.
Immediately wash and dry any washable items. Drying on high heat kills the bugs, so run items like pillows through the dryer.

, Don’t let your clothes sit in the washer or the dryer. As soon as your clothes finish drying, take them out and place them in your own container. Don’t put them in the facility carts or on a folding table. Fold your clothes at home to avoid picking up any bugs that may have traveled with other patrons., New clothing can become infected from other shoppers or contact with bed bug-infested parcels during shipping. Pay special attention to the seams of the clothing. Don’t just look for the bugs; remember to check for the tell-tale red spots..


When trying on items, put your own clothes on the hooks in the dressing room rather than the seating area because bugs are most likely to hide there."
"
First you need Boric Acid.,
Next, mix your ingredients: 1/3 cup boric acid to 1 cup flour, add minced onions or about a teaspoon of onion powder, add a tablespoon of sugar, fold in your lard until all the batter is moistened, then add just enough water to make a moldable dough (like you would a biscuit).

,
Next, tear off small squares of tin foil and use the bottle cap as a mold to form small tin cups.

,
Then, pinch off about a teaspoon of the dough and form it into a ball and place in the tin cups.

,
Place the cups behind furniture, in back of your cupboards and other hiding places where roaches are a problem.,
Replace every three to six months as needed.",How to Eliminate Cockroaches with Roach Balls," You can find this at most grocery store and some pharmacies carry this as well. You also need flour, sugar, onions (or onion powder), lard or (preferably bacon grease, aluminum foil, and a bottle cap.;
,,,, Primarily in your kitchen and bathroom since these are the places where there is food and/or water.

, Once in a while you may find a roach - a dead one. Other than that, your roach problem should go away if you've followed these instructions.

Map out the infestation.,
Collect all laundry.,
Pick up and throw out any garbage.,
Throw out paper products.,
Pack up all your personal items.,
Empty your dressers and closets.,
Separate your bed from everything.,
Eliminate hiding places.,
Wash and dry all laundry.,
Brush infested areas.,
Vacuum thoroughly.,
Kill bugs on personal items.,
Quarantine items that can't be treated or thrown out.,
Treat and encase the affected mattresses.,
Treat infested areas with insecticide.,
Monitor and treat again if necessary.",How to Get Rid of Bed Bugs at Home," Before you can treat for bed bugs, you have to determine the extent and location of the infestation. In a larger infestation, the bugs may be in multiple rooms, on sofas and other furniture, and in baseboards and cracks. As you go through the house cleaning and collecting items to treat, use a flashlight to inspect for bed bugs. Pay attention to areas like:Mattress seams and piping
Tears in mattresses and box springs
Head and footboards
Bed frames
Cushions and seams
Desk and dresser drawers (seams and crevices)
Electrical switch plates
Behind baseboards
Cracks in walls, plaster, and wallpaper
Electronics and appliances;
, Bed bugs don’t actually live on humans or pets, but rather in and on things that get close to people, such as clothes. To treat bed bugs at home, you have to collect any fabrics that could be hiding bed bugs. Place all your fabric items into plastic bags and seal them until you can wash and dry everything. Items to collect include:Bedding
Drapes and curtains
Laundry
Clothes lying about on the floor
Towels in the kitchen and bathroom

, Any clutter or garbage can give bed bugs a place to hide. Go around the entire house and collect garbage, items you don’t need or want, and other things that can be disposed of. Place everything into plastic bags and seal the bags well.


Remove bags from the house as soon as they're full and sealed. Store the bags outside until they can be picked up or dumped properly., Bed bugs can flatten their bodies, so magazines, cardboard, boxes, and other paper products make great hiding places for them. Collect any magazines and newspapers that can be thrown out and place them in plastic bags. Seal the bags and store them outside until they can be disposed of.


If you use boxes for storage, replace them with plastic totes and dispose of the cardboard.

, Pick up all personal items from the floor, shelves, desks, dressers, and other areas and transfer them to plastic bags until you can treat them. Seal the plastic bags and store each bag in the same room the items were in. This will help stop the infestation from spreading. You should pack up all personal items, including:Books
Toys and stuffed animals
Small electronics
Notepads
Decorations
Pictures

, Bed bugs can also live on the clothes in your dresser and closet. Empty all the clothes from these areas and transfer them to plastic bags to be washed. Seal the plastic bags when you’ve collected all your clothes.


When the dresser is empty, remove the drawers so they can be treated., Bed bugs are most likely to be found where people sleep, and it’s possible that the only infested item in your home is the bed. Because the bugs can't jump or fly, separating the bed will stop them from moving around easily.Pull the bed out from the walls so there's at least 6 inches (15 cm) of space between the bed and the walls.
Install bug interceptors on the legs of each bed.
Pull out anything that’s under the bed.
Remove all rugs from around the bed area.
Tuck bed sheets between the mattress and box spring so they aren't touching the floor (after the bed and bedding have been treated).

, Cracks in drywall, plaster, and wallpaper also make excellent hiding places for bed bugs. To flush the bugs from these areas, patch and repair cracks.Use plaster to fix cracks and holes in drywall or plaster.
Use glue to mend peeling wallpaper.
Remove paint in areas where it’s chipped or bubbled.

, Heat is a very effective way to kill bed bugs, so washing your laundry and drying it in a dryer is a great way to eliminate them from clothes, bedding, towels, carpets, drapes, and other fabrics. Only open a bag when you're ready to wash the contents. When the items go into the dryer, use the highest temperature setting and run the dryer for at least 30 minutes to kill the bugs.


Once a load comes out of the drier, transfer the clean items to sealable plastic bags to prevent them from becoming re-infested., Bed bugs reproduce by laying eggs, and you have to dislodge the eggs from infested areas in order to remove them. Use a stiff-bristled brush and go over all the infested areas that you located when you were cleaning.


Pay particular attention to mattresses, box springs, and sofas where people sleep, as these are the most likely places for eggs to be., Vacuum all the areas where you found signs of infestation. Do not use bristled brush attachments, as bed bugs can hide in the bristles. Use the hose attachment to access hard to reach areas. When you're finished, remove the vacuum bag and throw it out immediately, or empty the canister into the garbage and take it outside. Areas to concentrate on when vacuuming include:Baseboards
Walls
Furniture and cushions
Cracks and crevices
Rugs and carpets

, There are a number of ways that you can treat a bed bug infestation on personal items. Aside from insecticide, two other effective methods are heat and cold. After you clean an item, place it into a clean, sealable plastic bag to prevent re-infestation.


For items that can withstand heat, such as shoes and toys, place them in the dryer on high heat for at least 30 minutes.
On hot summer days that are 95 F (35 C) or higher, you can also leave bagged items in direct sunlight to kill the bed bugs inside.For items that can't be washed or heated, place them in the freezer in bags. Set the freezer to 0 F (-18 C) and leave the items in there for at least four days.

, There may be some items that you won’t want to throw out, but cannot treat because they can't be washed, heated, frozen, or sprayed with insecticide. Transfer all these items to a separate plastic bag. Seal the bag, and then seal it within another bag to prevent the bugs from escaping.


Leave these items sealed in the bag for an entire year. Bed bugs can possibly survive for this long without feeding, so the only way to kill the bugs is to starve them., After you’ve removed the bedding from the affected mattresses and vacuumed the mattress, box spring, headboard, and frame, you'll have to treat the mattress. The most effective way to treat an infestation and prevent a future one is with guard liners or encasements.


Active Guard Mattress Liners are special fitted sheets that are treated with a mattress-safe product that will kill bed bugs within 72 hours.
Zippered mattress encasements trap bed bugs inside and prevent them from escaping or feeding. Leave the case on for a year to ensure that the bugs have died., Cleaning and vacuuming alone usually isn't sufficient to get rid of a bed bug infestation in the home. Insecticides are usually required to properly treat infested areas. Take all safety precautions, and carefully follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Wear a mask, goggles, respirators, and other personal safety equipment when using pesticides.Areas to concentrate on include baseboards, cabinets, the bottom and sides of drawers, inside closets, door frames, doors, windows, dresser feet, and bed feet.
To spray areas like beds, couches, and other furniture that’s used and touched often, only use a product that’s safe for such areas.
Make sure the pesticide you use is EPA certified and specifically for bed bugs.
Optional pesticides include desiccants, dusts, aerosols, and liquids.

, One round of cleaning and treatment may not be enough to get rid of your bed bug infestation. Over the next one to two weeks, perform daily inspections to look for signs of bed bugs.


Leave all your cleaned items in sealed plastic bags until you're certain the infestation has been addressed.
If you find evidence that the infestation is still there, clean and treat the house again.
Consider using a different kind of pesticide the second time around, as bed bugs do develop resistance to these chemicals.

Use caution when steaming an area that has recently been treated with chemicals (including diatomaceous earth powder).,
Before steaming, vacuum the areas to be treated.,
Carefully read the instructions provided with your steamer to prepare the steamer for operation.,
Purge the steamer into a cloth towel to clear the nozzle of excess water that has been collected.,
When steaming, start from the top of the room (drapes, etc.),
When possible, use a larger head attachment for the nozzle, as smaller heads may create too much centralized pressure, thus scattering the bed bugs rather than killing them.,
Take your time with the steamer.,
After steaming your mattress, allow adequate time for the steam to completely dry before applying a mattress, box spring or pillow encasement.,
After steaming, keep an eye out for any signs of bed bugs in the next few days.",How to Kill Bed Bugs With Steam," Heat may break down the chemicals already applied, undermining their residual effect. As a general rule, apply chemicals after steaming.;
, This will increase the effectiveness of the steamer. If possible, use a vacuum cleaner with a bag, as this allows for easy disposal of any bed bugs that may have been captured in the vacuum. If you have a bagless vacuum cleaner, dispose of all contents in a bag outside of your house, place the bag straight into the outdoor garbage, then wash the vacuum container and filter in as hot water as the vacuum components can stand. Allow to air dry before refitting to the vacuum cleaner.


Another option is to use a steamer/vacuum combination.

, Remember that steamers produce extremely hot steam, so use caution to avoid burning yourself.

, Do this both when the steamer heats up initially and when moving between locations. Once the water is purged, you can attach the appropriate accessory and begin steaming.


Keep a dry towel or moisture-absorbent cloth on hand to help absorb excess water that may accumulate while steaming.

, and work your way down to the floorboards. The steamer can be used on moldings, mattresses, box springs, headboards, sofas, carpeting, floorboards and more. However, never steam into an electrical outlet or appliances!

, Some steamers have a pressure control valve, allowing you to control the pressure of the steam.

, Keep the tip of the nozzle about one to two inches (2.5cm-5cm) from the surface you are treating, and move at a rate of about one inch (2.5cm) per second.

, Applying encasements before the steam has dried may result in the growth of mold.

, If signs of bed bugs appear, re-treat the area with steam. It is always recommended to follow up a steam treatment with an EPA-approved bed bug spray.

These are small, brownish red insects that are oval in shape. They live off of the blood in animals and humans. Look around the edges of your mattress, the creases of your sheets, and pillowcases. If there is a bedbug problem, you will see a mass of small black bugs ranging from eggs (1mm) to adults (5mm, size of an appleseed). While most are black, some are pearl white, and the size of a pinhead.Bedbugs however do not always mass together. Sometimes they are more spread out, across the entire mattress or bed spread. In that case, use a magnifying glass to check around the edges of your mattress and sheets.
A flashlight can also help in a dim bedroom. Hold your flashlight about 6 inches away from the mattress in order to use the light effectively.
Bedbugs do not fly, but they do however move rather quickly along multiple surfaces, including but not limited to: ceilings, walls, and fabrics. If the bug you find does have wings, or is flying, the bug is probably a mosquito or a fly, rather than a bedbug.;
, Bedbugs feed for approximately 3-10 minutes a day before they retreat. Small blood spots can occur from fresh wounds (bedbug release anti-clotting agents into their bite) or slight larger spots from rolling onto an engorged bedbug (who then bursts from the pressure). Their fecal matter appears to the human eye as small black specks (the size of a marker dot). This is because they feed on blood, and then that blood dries when it is released by the bedbugs.Often times the bedbug defecates where it originally ate. This includes, but is not limited to, edges of mattresses, creases in bed spreads, and cracks in a headboard.
You might have to use a magnifying glass if the excrement is spread out over a wide area (not clumped together). Rub your hand gently over the surface area to see if anything kicks up, or has been embedded.
Get near the area you think the bedbugs might be. Put your hand near the potentially affected area and waft your hand. If bedbugs have produced fecal matter you should be able to detect a musty odor from the bedbug's scent glands.

, Bedbugs, like all other bugs, mate, reproduce, and shed their skin. When bedbugs mate they can produce hundreds of offspring, which can then lead to the production of a ton of exoskeleton waste products.Look near the edges of your mattress, creases in the bed spread, and the cracks of your headboard. See if there are small, white larvae (1mm, size of a pinpoint) bunched together. Also, look for clear, tan, or dark brown excess skin in those places as well.
Because the larvae are small, and the exoskeleton waste is likely to be clear, you will want to use a magnifying glass to detect any potential problems. Run your hand gently over the surface to see if anything has been lodged inward or embedded.
If your bed has any brown, black, or red marks on it, this could be because bedbugs have been squashed and killed during the night.

, While these places are not primary feeding grounds for bedbugs, they are great places for them to live, retreat after feeding, and to reproduce. Cracks and crevices are perfect breeding grounds which need a thorough going over.Remove the dust cover over the bottom of your box spring. Examine the cracks and seams in the wood framing. Use a magnifying glass and a flashlight to inspect the area. Look for black specks (living bedbugs) or pearl white larvae.
Peel back the fabric where it is stapled to the bed frame. Check in the crevices and underneath the surface area.
Bedbugs love to live and breed where wood frames meet, or where the wood has come to be split apart by age and maturation, so you will want to check there too.

, Bedbugs love to hide out in small crevices wherever they can reproduce. These can include books, night stands, telephones, radios, and even electrical outlets.Open up your books that are near your bed and flip through the pages. Check and make sure that there are no black, or dark red specks within the pages.
Lift up your radios and telephones. Use a magnifying glass and a flash light to inspect the places where the wooden boards of your night stand are nailed together.
Unscrew your electrical outlets. Make sure that when you do so, you first cut the circuit breaker for that particular bedroom. Use a flashlight and see if there are any remnants of bedbugs, whether they be alive, shells, or fecal matter.

, Different types of flooring like carpeting (tight or loose) or linoleum are great places for bedbugs to hide out. These are also perfect for seclusion which bedbugs need to reproduce. If you can do so, without damaging your carpet/linoleum, peel up the edge. Use a magnifying glass and a flash light to detect any bedbugs, shells, or defecation. Do the same around the floor boards where the wood paneling meets the floor.

, Bedbugs love to live on the fabrics of shirts and pants, especially if they have not been washed in a while. The closet provides seclusion, heat, and yet still easy access to your bed.


Go in your closet and inspect your clothes. Rub your hands against the fabric of your hanging clothes. See if any dark black specks begin to release as you apply pressure.
You can do the same with your clothes in a dresser drawer. Rub your hands against the fabric. Check with a magnifying glass and a flashlight the cracks and crevices of the inner paneling of the dresser.

, These are another great area for bedbugs to roam about. They get seclusion and easy access to your bed. If the bedbugs are not readily apparent, peel back some of the chipped paint and/or wallpaper. Look for tiny white larvae using your magnifying glass. There may be also black specks which pop out as you peel some of the paint and/or wallpaper back., Bedbugs generally feed at night (nocturnal) on human flesh in order to extract blood. These bite marks are often mistaken for mosquito bites, but are very different.Inspect your ankles/feet in the mornings. Bedbugs feed on exposed skin, and the ankle/feet area is the part most likely to be exposed at night. However, the marks could occur almost anywhere along your body.
Notice whether or not you see bite marks after you wake up in the morning. Bedbugs bite in linear groups of three, as compared to the mosquito which generally only bites once. Bedbug bites appear as a series of small red dots.These bites are mostly painless at first. However, if you notice that they begin to itch after a few days they most likely are bedbugs. The itchiness and swelling can last up to nine days.

, Sometimes bedbugs are hard to find, or not readily apparent. A great thing to do is to call your local exterminator who is trained in the field, to come and inspect the house. He or she will be able to give you an exact answer.

, This is the quickest and easiest way to get rid of bedbugs. The insects do not last long in extreme heat, so putting your sheets, pillow cases, and comforter in the washer can help.


Simply put your linens in the washer. Make sure the water is hot. Check beforehand whether or not your bedding can be washed with hot water (look at the tag).After they come out of the washer, put them immediately in the dryer at the highest temperature setting.
You can do the same with your clothes. However, you will need to be extra pre-cautious with clothes, as they might tend to shrink in both hot water, and the extreme heat of the dryer.
For items that cannot be washed, stick them in the dryer on high heat for thirty minutes.

, Wrap your mattress and box spring with tightly woven fabric, such as a mattress cover. This will prevent the bedbugs from becoming embedded in the mattress and box spring cracks and crevices. It will also make it easier to get rid of the bedbugs because you can simply throw the fabric in the wash.

, Buy four plastic cups and place them upright as if you were about to drink out of them. Sit each of your beds legs in one of the four cups. This can prevent the bedbugs from crawling out of your closet, or from your carpet, and onto your bed.

, Because clutter is a great place for bedbugs to hide out, clean up the area around your bed. This will get rid of hiding places, and make your bedroom more sanitary in the process.Stack up books, and place them far away from your bed, or on a bookshelf.
Clothes should also be clean, neatly folded, and placed far away from your bed. Hang them up in a closet, or keep them in a dresser drawer.
Make sure that your nightstand and/or desk are neat, and properly maintained. Pick up any garbage, cups, plates, utensils, napkins, tissues, etc. Wipe the surface down with a damp cloth, or use a healthy cleaning spray.

, Bedbugs like to embed in the fabric of the carpet, and use the carpet as a means to move around. Make sure that your vacuum is powerful enough to pick up materials which are deeply embedded.Vacuums with cyclone technology, or 4-chamber suction are great for this job.
Vacuum regularly, whether it be once a day, or once a week. You do not want to attract the bedbugs in any way, and give them time to move about.

, Bedbugs love to breed and live within the cracks of furniture, bed posts, and headboards. Use putty, plaster, or safe wood glue to fill in the cracks which might have the potential to house the bugs.

, These can be either handheld, or ones that sit upright on the floor. Because bedbugs cannot live in extreme temperatures, the heating chamber will kill them.Use an upright heating chamber, and sit it on your bedroom floor. Turn the heat up to between 80-85 degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure to shut the door to keep the heat in. Warning: Continuously check on your room that there isn't a fire resulting from the heating chamber.Use a handheld heating chamber, and run it over the surfaces you believe to be infected. Be careful as to not touch the heating chamber directly, as it will be very hot.
After you have you have used either of these, clean the area of dead bedbugs. Vacuum the carpeting, wipe the wood furnishings, and throw your linens in the washer.

, This is oftentimes a last resort, but if the bedbugs have overwhelmed the situation, it is best to start over.


Dispose of your mattress a great distance from your house. Either leave the mattress near the place where the trash men pick the garbage up, or take the mattress directly to the garbage dump. Do the same with any furniture infected with bedbugs.
Remember, secondhand furniture and mattresses are especially vulnerable to having bedbugs in them. If your furniture or mattresses are secondhand, it is even more of a necessity to rid yourself of these furnishings. They have likely already had bedbugs in them before, and are a breeding ground for more to come.

, There are many name brand bedbug removal chemical agents that are available at stores across the country. Find one that is safe to use, and that comes in a spray bottle form.Spray the chemical agent onto the surface you wish to rid of bedbugs. Let it sit there for a few minutes.
You can also buy some chemicals which you can leave sit in a particular room which will kill bedbugs, much like the chemicals an exterminator uses.
After you have used the chemicals, wash the surface off with a damp washcloth or paper towel. Immediately dispose of the cloth as it will contain chemicals and dead bugs/feces/shells.

, Rather than use chemicals which might be harmful, it might be better to call a professional. He or she will be able to document the problem, and provide an adequate chemical solution.

, Whether it be an apartment, dormitory, cruise ship, hotel, or homeless shelter, it is critical that you examine the space for any bedbugs/feces/shells. Even the best, five star hotels, have been known to have bedbug problems.Bring along a magnifying glass and a flashlight with you. Get up close and personal with your mattress, bedding, headboard, carpet, closets, and anywhere else you think bedbugs might be lurking. Check not only for small, dark, oval shaped bugs, but also little black marks (feces) and clear or yellowish bedbug shells.
If you find something suspicious, immediately contact the tenant of your temporary home. They will be able to bring in people who will clean the area, and disinfect., Upon returning home from a vacation, it is imperative that you check whether bedbugs from a hotel, cruise ship, etc. have entered into your luggage.


Use the magnifying glass and flashlight to first see whether there are any bedbugs. Check along the creases of the luggage where the fabric is sewn together, and check your clothes.
Whether you find bedbugs or not, it is best to disinfect anyways. Use a mild chemical agent and spray down your luggage (after you have taken your clothes out). After you have done so, wipe the luggage down with a clean, wet cloth or paper towel.

, The minute you get home from a vacation or retreat, put your clothes in the washer. Make sure the water is hot, which will kill any bedbugs. Finally, put them in the dryer at the highest heating setting.

, Believe it or not, work can be a great place for bedbugs to reside. They can camp out in break room furniture, teachers' lounges, offices, and storage facilities.


Use a magnifying glass and a flashlight to check the furniture. Look along the creases of the fabrics where they are sewn together. Inspect the wood paneling that s near the floor (baseboard). Check to see whether there are any cracks in the wall, peeling paint/wallpaper. These are great places for bedbugs to hide out.
Look for the bedbugs themselves, along with black dots (feces) and any clear bedbug shells.
If you are allowed to, clean the area with a safe chemical agent. Follow that by wiping the area clean with a wet washcloth or paper towel. If you are not allowed to disinfect the area, notify the supervisors of any bedbug problems you are aware of.

, It is important that your fellow co-workers/employees knows what to look for when it comes to bedbugs. Let them know that it is important to be on notice of any small, dark, oval shaped bugs. As well as small dark marks which are bedbug feces, and clear or yellowish bedbug shells., Write up a schedule so each employee has a set time that they are to check for bedbugs. This will distribute the workload, and make sure that bedbugs are consistently being monitored for.


Ask each employee to send in to you a time of the week that they are free to check the lounge, office, furniture, etc. Compile the list into a block schedule. List everyone's particular times on one master schedule.
Send this master schedule out to all employees, and post one on the wall near the lounge area. This will provide a consistent reminder to the rest of the staff.

, The office you work in should not be in hysteria over bedbugs. These are not lethal insects, and they are found even in the most clean environments. Make sure that your employees know what to look for, and are vigilant. However, looking for bedbugs should not replace normal work activities/interfere with your daily work life., Write on a small sheet of paper, or on the back of a business card, what to look for when you are searching out bedbugs. You can then carry this around in your wallet/purse, and always be ready to look out for those pesky insects."

Use store-bought cockroach traps.,
Use water jars.,
Use soda bottle traps.",How to Get Rid of Roaches4," Cockroach traps lure cockroaches in and then trap them with an adhesive. Get several of these, and place them wherever cockroaches are known to frequent. While this is an effective way to kill a small population of adult roaches, it won't affect the nest itself.

, A simple and effective homemade way to lure and trap roaches is with a jar placed next to a wall. This allows the roaches to get in, but not escape. Any bait can be placed in the jar, including coffee grounds and water, but it also works with just plain water in drier climates. Again, this is a good way to kill adult roaches, but it doesn't affect the nest and eggs.

, Take a plastic soda bottle and cut off the top where it curves. Invert the top and place it into the body of the bottle so that it acts like a funnel inside the bottle. Tape it into place around the rim. Pour a bit of water with soap in the bottom of the bottle, and set the trap in a place where roaches hang out. They'll craw into the trap and drown."
"
Move yard debris away from the outside of the house.,
Seal the house to keep roaches from entering.,
Set out preventative traps.",How to Get Rid of Roaches5," Cockroaches love piles of wood and other convenient hiding places, and as the weather turns colder, they'll migrate inside the house to keep warm. Make sure your woodpile is well away from the house. Remove piles of straw, leaves, clippings, and any other yard waste.

, Seal cracks in exterior walls to keep roaches out of the house by blocking their entrance. Seal cracks everywhere you can inside your house as well. This takes time, but the payoff is great, because you eliminate most of their favorite hiding and breeding places.


Fill every crack inside every cabinet in your kitchen.
Fill the cracks on both sides of floor, door, and window moldings.
Fill all openings around pipes in bathrooms and kitchens.

, Even if you successfully got rid of a nest, prevent a re-infestation by setting out traps that will kill roaches before they get out of control. The best approach is to leave the caulk off a few cracks that are close to potential areas of entry, like the drain or vents, and place traps as follows:


Spray over with insecticide (such as Raid) in either gel or liquid form. This serves as a second line of defense should any roaches survive or get past the steel wool; this will at the very least weaken them.
Fix any openings with caulk, Spackle or some other hardening mixture. If the crack is on a baseboard or wood, after putting the Spackle down, rub with resin or cover with wood paint. Once the Spackle has hardened, 4-6 hours after its application, it is child-safe.

,
Be vigilant.",How to Get Rid of Bed Bugs," You most likely know a bedbug infestation by a rash that resembles a mosquito bite. Most often these come at night but in an serious infestation they can occur during the day. A bedbug bite unlike a mosquito bite swells and spreads out. Also the bites can come in lines and also burn unlike a mosquito bite. A mosquito bite stays round and neat looking.;
, Things to look for are the bugs themselves and the light-brown, molted skins of the nymphs (young bugs). Dark spots of dried bed bug excrement (blood) are often present along mattress seams or wherever the bugs have resided. There's also a smell of rotten raspberries, or dried blood.

, Bedbugs can be found any place humans rest and lounge and nearby. Bedbugs can be found under school desks, restaurant benches, on computers in the library, chairs, hospital beds and curtains or on a store wall. The same goes for carpets. Many times a brush against a wall in on infested area can lead to bedbugs in the home. Bedbugs are very good at clinging onto fabrics. Transportation hubs such as airports, train stations and bus terminals are also key infestation stations to be wary of.


They can also cling to curtain rods, air conditioners, fans and also inside electronics.

, Many affluent communities and households also have bedbug problems. Many business trips to airports and to the companies themselves have led to bedbug infestations.

, Oftentimes, the gauze fabric underlying the box spring must be removed to gain access for inspection and possible treatment. Cracks and crevices of bed frames should be examined, especially if the frame is wood (bed bugs have an affinity for wood and fabric more so than metal or plastic).


Successful treatment of mattresses and box springs is difficult and infested components may need to be discarded.
Alternatively, place a bed bug proof mattress cover over an infested mattress to trap the bed bugs inside and starve them to death. This will eliminate the need to purchase a new mattress/boxspring and make treatment and future inspections easier. (Starving the bugs CAN take up to 400 days, so make sure your cover stays sealed for at least that long.) Bed bugs also hide among items stored underneath beds.

, Examine them inside and out, then tip them over to inspect the woodwork underneath. Oftentimes, the bugs will be hiding in cracks, corners and recesses.

, Pay close attention to the seams, tufts, skirts and crevices beneath cushions. Sofas can be major bed bug hotspots when used for sleeping.

, These include along and under the edge of wall-to-wall carpeting (especially behind beds and furniture), cracks in wood molding and ceiling-wall junctures. Bed bugs tend to congregate in certain areas, but it is common to find an individual or some eggs scattered here and there.

, Inspectors sometimes also inject a pyrethrum-based ""flushing agent"" into crevices to help reveal where bugs may be hiding.

, This involves multiple tactics such as preventive measures, sanitation, and chemicals applied to targeted sites.

, Smaller items that cannot be laundered can sometimes be de-infested by heating. Individual items, for example, can be wrapped in plastic and placed in a hot, sunny location for at least a few days (the 122°F/50ºC minimum target temperature should be monitored in the center-most location with a thermometer). Bedbugs also succumb to cold temperatures below freezing, but the chilling period must be maintained for at least two weeks. Attempts to rid an entire home or apartment of bed bugs by raising or lowering the thermostat will be entirely unsuccessful.


Wash all linen on hot, dry on hot setting. Gather all linen, cloth and leather bags, mattress covers, clothing, teddy bears... etc. Machine wash on hot - wash the laundry bag also. Tumble dry on hot. Steam kills bed bugs. Some metropolitan areas offer bed bug laundry and dry cleaning services which have the added benefits of proven methods for killing bed bugs and bagging or storing cleaned items so they do not become re-infested while the home is still being exterminated.
If something cannot be washed or discarded (such as a valuable leather purse) spray with non-toxic bed bug spray (such as diatomaceous earth), seal in a plastic bag and leave for a few months.
Dry clean to remove odor if need be.

, You may get a simple device capable of generating steam at your local hardware store. You may also convert a simple electric kettle to a steam machine by attaching a flexible tube. Steam should kill all bedbugs and the eggs. Thoroughly spray steam at all corners and seams.

, This will remove bugs and eggs from mattresses, carpet, walls and other surfaces. Pay particular attention to seams, tufts and edges of mattresses and box springs, and the perimeter edge of wall-to-wall carpets. Afterward, dispose of the vacuum contents in a sealed trash bag. Steam cleaning of carpets is also helpful for killing bugs and eggs that vacuuming may have missed.


A vacuum with a HEPA filter is especially effective.

, Remove and destroy wild animal roosts and bird nests when possible.

, Residual insecticides (usually pyrethroids) are applied as spot treatments to cracks and crevices where bed bugs are hiding. Increased penetration of the insecticide into cracks and crevices can be achieved if accumulated dirt and debris are first removed using a vacuum cleaner. Many readily available aerosol pesticide sprays will cause bed bugs to scatter making eradication more difficult. Dust formulations may be used to treat wall voids and attics.


Repeat insecticide applications if bed bugs are present two weeks after the initial treatment. It is difficult to find all hiding places and hidden eggs may have hatched.
Beware of insecticide ""programs""(which require repeats) in local stores which can be unnecessarily messy and toxic. Many of these ""programs"" are also not very potent at all and can become a money pit. Look for other options.

, Experienced companies know where to look for bed bugs, and have an assortment of management tools at their disposal. Owners and occupants will need to assist the professional in important ways. Allowing access for inspection and treatment is essential and excess clutter should be removed.

, In some cases, infested mattresses and box springs will need to be discarded. Since bed bugs can disperse throughout a building, it also may be necessary to inspect adjoining rooms and apartments. Pay it forward: chop up and/or damage the items you discard so nobody will be tempted to take them home and spread the problem further.

, Grind up some crystal silica gel and apply it all over in your bedroom. Put some on your mattress, around the bed and along the wall. The fine silica gel will get stuck to the bug and it cannot be shaken off, causing the bug to dehydrate and die. Be careful not to inhale it.


Diatomaceous earth has similar effects to silica gel and can be used around mattress seams and along the rails of the box spring. The sharp micro fossils cut into the soft bugs making them bleed.
If you have a cat, change the cat litter (crystal silica gel) every 5 days so the newly hatched eggs will dehydrate too. Repeat for 5 weeks.

, This oil can eradicate bedbugs in the house.


Clean the house thoroughly, top to bottom.
Wash all bedding and clothing, with a few drops of tea tree oil added.
Vacuum and wash all carpets.
Take all beds apart. Spray them all down with tea tree oil.
Apply pest control spray around the entire home, inside and out. To make this spray: Mix 18 oz of water with 18 drops of tea tree oil and spray the entire house with it––the carpets, beds, and furniture.
Use wintergreen alcohol to kill bedbugs and their eggs instantly. It's very inexpensive and easily accessible. Pour the wintergreen alcohol full strength into a spray bottle and spray directly on the bedbugs and nests. The wintergreen burns the bugs on contact. You can also drench your mattress and box spring with this as well.

, Bedbugs love to hide in dump sites which and if one is near your home the bedbugs might find their way into your house. It also looks and smells bad for everybody in the community.

, Keep the plastic covering that comes on your mattress when purchased new. Purchase special bedbug covers for you mattress and box spring. Make sure that they are quality ones with heavy duty zippers and constructed with special fabric that doesn't rip easily. Don't buy the cheap versions which are not thick enough to prevent the bedbugs from sticking their feeding tubes into the skin through the cover.

, At a minimum, such items should be examined closely before being brought into the home.

, Laws in the U.S are now requiring all bed and breakfasts, hotels, motels to have and maintain bedbug bed covers installed on their mattresses and box springs.

,, Warehouses, storage facilities, trucks and railroad cars may be infested so common bed bugs can infest homes by stowing away on new furniture stored or shipped from these places. Familiarity may help to avoid infestation, or at least prompt earlier intervention by a professional.

Buy bed bug mattress and pillow protectors.",How to Get Rid of Bed Bugs Organically," It is always easier to isolate the problem and work in a clean environment. And don't assume that just because your house is clean/dirty, that is the reason you have an infestation. Bed bugs are an epidemic, and they prefer any environment that houses a warm, living body for them to feed on, including your pets. Your personal cleanliness has nothing to do with it. Bed bugs do like to hide in piles of laundry and (surprise) your bed, bed-skirt, and box spring. They will make it into couch cushions and blankets, and whatever else they can. More often than not, though, they are coming in through a hole, opening, or crack somewhere.;
,


Wash any and all exposed clothing, bedding, cushions, fabric, etc. in as hot water as the fabric can stand, and use bleach if possible on anything that you can. A color-safe bleach would be perfect for this purpose.

Vacuum and mop the carpets and floors. Use bleach on the floor first and then use the water/alcohol solution to spray and mop it down after. Wipe down any surfaces that can handle the water/alcohol solution without suffering any damage as a result.
If possible, bag up anything you cannot wash with an airtight seal and put it outside (if you live somewhere that temperatures are freezing, somewhere in the snow, or if not, put it somewhere that may expose them to heat but will not damage the bag or the item you have inside it; you are trying to cut off their air supply and kill them with extreme temperature).
When in doubt, throw it out (if you have the means to do so).
If there's anything else not mentioned yet, just clean it at the very least with very hot water or freezing.

, That is, move it away from the wall(s) so that there is no direct contact between your bed and said wall(s) (and therefore, no longer an easy route to your sweet, succulent blood). Cover the bed in the mattress cover (if you have one), and if your bed is on a frame or raised from the ground in some other fashion and can handle petroleum jelly on its surface, cover the legs of your frame with the petroleum jelly; these insects cannot fly and, therefore, must crawl to whatever height they reach. If there's a good bit of jelly on there, they'll get stuck and you can just wipe them off and reapply as needed. For more tips, see How to Avoid Insect Bites While Sleeping.


Make sure to keep your bed at least 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) away from everything, including the wall, nightstand, books, etc. Your bed should be surrounded by space only.
""Climb Up Insect Interceptor Cups"" can be placed beneath beds that have four legs. The cups have two rings inside; the bug climbs into the outer ring, which is coated in a fine dust (don't inhale it) and becomes stuck there permanently, unable to grip on to the slippery sides to climb into the second ring where the leg of your bed is standing.
Make sure the leg of the bed is high enough off the ground so that bed bugs can't reach.
Make sure no bed sheet or comforter ever touches the floor or you will still get bitten and have to wash everything all over again.
Make sure you never put something that was sitting on the floor on the bed if you don't want to wash everything again.
Bed bugs can climb up any object, including the ceiling and fall onto your bed. If your infestation is severe they will even fall down from the ceiling. In that case, it's time to call the exterminator.

, Diatomaceous earth is an ingredient in most of the bombs aimed at bed bugs; the shards of the shell (or powder) are microscopically sharp and puncture the thin, waxy, exoskeletons of these night-feeding demons, causing them to dehydrate and die, our eventual goal in all of this.

, You may also want to consider wearing more clothing when you sleep as well; and ladies, pull your hair back or put it in something because they will crawl into loose hair. Anything you can do to prevent them from getting to you, do it! Although bedbugs don't carry disease, and for most people the bites are unnoticeable, for some they itch, and itch, and itch. Bedbugs can bite you anywhere.

, In fact, the small blood stains left as a result of rolling over and killing them is often what makes a lot of people realize they have a bed bug infestation in the first place. One place you may want to look at closely is in the folds of the bed-skirt. The last of them should die off in about a week, possibly two. But it may happen sooner than that; it all depends on the severity of the infestation., This is to remove any dead bugs lying around and just as another precautionary measure in case there were still some eggs or baby blood-suckers that made it through the initial phase of cleaning. They will get vacuumed up very easily.

, Wash everything where a bed bug can potentially hide.

, You can't wash these in the laundry machine, so wrap them up with a protector that has a bed bug-proof zipper that will seal any existing bed bugs inside and prevent any new ones from crawling in.

Pre-soak your clothes before washing.,
Draw water into the laundry machine.,
Add detergent or stain remover.,
Soak your clothes.,
Rinse the soaked clothes to remove detergent.,
Wash clothing as normal.",How to Soak Clothes1," You can soak clothes directly in the chamber of your washing machine if you plan to machine wash them afterward. All you need to do is add detergent to the water drawn into the washing machine, then let the clothes soak for 20-30 minutes in the mix of detergent and standing water.It will be easier to soak clothes in a top-loading washing machine than in a side-loading machine. Check your side-loading machine for an integrated pre-soak function.Pre-soaking in the machine can be convenient because you won't need to transfer the fabric after the soak. However, you don't need to soak in the washing machine if you plan to hand-wash your clothes.;
, Start the wash cycle with the machine empty so that the chamber fills up with water. Then, when it is at least half-full, stop the cycle so that you can prepare the soak.

, Use the regular amount that you would use to wash your clothes.Swish and stir the cleaning agent to ensure that it dissolves into the water. When the detergent is evenly distributed and the water is soapy, you are ready to add your clothing.


The recommended dose of detergent should be listed on the bottle of the cleaning product. If there is a cap to the detergent, you can usually get by with filling the cap.

, Put all of the clothes you wish to wash into the chamber of the laundry machine. Make sure that all garments are completely submerged beneath the water-and-detergent mixture. Leave the fabrics to soak for up to an hour unless otherwise directed.


Leave tough stains to soak for even longer. If the fabric is resilient—say, denim or canvas—you can soak for several hours to launch a more powerful attack on the stain.
Don't soak for too long! Fragile fibers like wool and cotton may begin to come apart or dissolve with extended exposure to stain-removal agents. This is especially the case if you are using an industrial-strength product like bleach.

, When the hour has passed, take the clothing out of the washing machine and rinse it thoroughly to remove the soaking detergent or stain-removal fluid. This step is generally considered optional if you plan to immediately run the clothing through the wash.

, If the soak did not remove the stain, then you may consider soaking again – but be careful not to be too hard on the fabric. A more intensive, localized soak or scrub might be the way to tackle a tough stain.

Wash towels with warm or hot water.,
Soak towels in fabric softener.,
Replace detergent and fabric softener with vinegar.,
Use baking soda.",How to Soften Towels1," Warmer water absorbs detergent better, which means that less soap residue is left caked onto the fabric. Furthermore, hot water can help dissolve oils that are left over from hygiene products and skin.Be aware that brightly-colored towels may fade with repeated hot-water washing. If you don't care about fading, then proceed to wash with hot water. If you want to retain the color, then wash with cold water and try other towel-softening techniques.;
, Mix one cup fabric softener with as much hot water as you need to submerge your towels. Soak the towels in the softener solution for at least an hour, until the softener has had time to thoroughly permeate the fabric., Most commercial fabric softeners contain silicon, which can coat the surface of your towels and limit their absorptive properties. Use the extra rinse cycle when you machine-wash your towels, and use a half-cup of white vinegar instead of soap in the first cycle. The vinegar will remove the oils and soapy residue that toughen up your towel, making it fluffier and more absorbent. Use a light soap (or just water) in the second rinse cycle to rinse out the smell of vinegar but retain the soft finish., Try mixing half a cup of baking soda into your regular detergent. This should help wash away any oils, dirt, or chemicals that are making your towel stiff or scratchy. This is also great for removing musty odors – the sort of stink that develops when a towel has been left damp for a while."

Read the labels on the garment.,
Wash the garment in hot water.,
Place the garment in the dryer.,
Try the garment on.,
Repeat this process.",How to Shrink Clothes1," Different fibers, like wool and cotton, have different ways of shrinking, so you will want to determine what the garment is made of before washing it. Wool, for example, is a delicate material and is very susceptible to shrinking in the dryer. Cotton, on the other hand, is tougher, and will need to be in the dryer at a higher setting. Silk will generally shrink about 8-10% in the wash.Determine whether or not the garment is pre-washed. New clothes will usually shrink on the first wash. Pre-washed clothes tend to stay the same size and may need to be altered.;
, You can do this by hand or in a washing machine.


If you decide to do it by hand, heat a pot of boiling water. Place the garment into the water and let it boil in the water for several minutes, then remove from the heat.
Don’t use fabric softener., For a cotton garment, run the dryer on high heat, checking occasionally to see whether it has reached the desired size. Once it has, remove it from the dryer and allow it to air-dry to prevent further shrinking.


Leave the garment in the dryer if you want more shrinking time.
Polyester and wool garments should be dried on medium heat until they have fully dried.

, Determine whether it has reached the desired size. A benefit about fixing the size of your clothes is that you can usually shrink it further or stretch it out if you went too far.

, Do this as many times until the desired size is reached. Remember that most shrinking will happen during the first wash. If you still want the garment to be smaller, then consider getting it altered.

Prepare the clothes to be washed.,
Adjust the settings on your washing machine.,
Place the clothing in the washing machine.,
Add salt to the washing machine.,
Run the washing machine.,
Dry the clothes.",How to Set Colors in Clothes,"

Some people prefer to wash newly-purchased clothing before wearing it for the first time. If this sounds like you, remember to remove all of the tags and stickers from the clothes before preparing to wash them. If the clothes have been worn before their first washing, the tags already will have been removed, making this step unnecessary.



 

;
,

To set the color in your clothes, it is essential that they are washed in water that is as cold as possible. Adjust the water temperature settings on your machine before placing the clothing inside it. If you are especially concerned about the clothing, consider turning off the water heater for the time being. This will ensure that the water is very cold.







,

During the first washing of new clothes, they should be washed either alone or with other clothing that is of a very similar color.







,

In food, salt acts as a preservative, extending the shelf life of many products. Similarly, when used correctly, salt can maintain vibrant colors in clothes. Add 1/4 of a cup of iodized salt to the washing machine, directly on top of the clothing.







,

Consider using a gentle to medium speed setting on the washing machine during this first bout of washing.







,

As discussed above, heat is notorious for leaching color from clothing. Because of this, it is important that clothes are dried without the use of excessive heat. Air dry your clothes as much as possible, either by placing them on a drying rack, clothesline, or simply by hanging them on a shower curtain. If you must use a dryer, put the setting on tumble dry. This will limit the amount of heat to which your clothing is exposed. Then hang the clothing immediately when the dryer finishes the cycle.







"
"
Adjust the temperature setting on your washing machine to hot.,
Wash the clothing on the longest wash cycle available.,
Dry the clothing on a high cycle.,
Repeat the wash and dryer cycles for polyester if the garment hasn't shrunk to your needs.",How to Shrink Clothes in the Wash1," Fabric is constantly being stretched and stressed in the process of being made. When fabric is heated, the stress relaxes out, causing the fabric threads/yarn to shorten.Applying heat is the most successful way to shrink almost all kinds of fabric.;
, Heat is even more effective when combined with moisture and movement. This is known as consolidation shrinkage. It releases the tension in cotton, denim, and to some extent polyester threads, reshaping the garment. The longer the fabric can be placed in these conditions, the more it's likely to shrink. Remove the clothing right after the wash cycle. Do not air dry. Air drying cools off fabric very quickly, making it less likely to shrink., High heat is what's needed to cause cotton, denim, and polyester to contract. Just as hot water causes fabric to condense, so does hot air.


Choose the longest cycle available. Agitation (such as the spinning of the dryer) may help with shrinkage. As the threads receive heat and undergo movement, they shrink.
Leave the fabric in the dryer until it is completely dry. Hanging it to air dry will cool the fabric too quickly. In the case of denim, it may also cause it to stretch. , Polyester is a synthetic fiber, and more difficult to shrink than most other fabrics. It is durable and can go through many cycles without damage."

Wash the garment with hot water.,
Transfer the wet garment to an ironing board.,
Lay a pressing cloth over the garment.,
Iron on a low to medium heat setting.,
Examine the finished garment for shrinkage.",How to Shrink Polyester2," Set the washing machine to the hottest water setting and the longest wash cycle. Use a hot wash and a hot rinse setting., Immediately after the washing cycle finishes, pull the polyester garment from the washing machine and transfer it to an ironing board. Make sure that the garment is still inside-out to reduce the risk of fading., Make sure the cloth completely covers your garment. This will prevent the iron from damaging your clothing.

, Using a lower setting will prevent the polyester from becoming too stiff. Pass the iron over your article of clothing. Continue ironing the garment until it is completely dried.


Do not use a steam setting on the iron. A dry iron will dry out the polyester as you pass over it, which is the effect you’re looking for.

, Make sure not to repeat the ironing process, as this could damage the polyester and cause colors to fade.If you’ve already put the garment through more than one washing and drying cycles, as well as ironing it, you’ve likely shrunk it much as you can.

Fill the soaking container.,
Add stain remover or detergent.,
Submerge the clothing.,
Let the clothing soak.,
Wash the soaked clothing as normal.",How to Soak Clothes2," Use a bucket, tub, or trough deep enough to submerge the entire garment underwater. Suitable soaking spaces may include a clean laundry sink, a clean bucket, or even a baby's bath. Add enough water that you can submerge all of the clothing, but not so much that the addition of the clothing will displace the water and make it spill over. To avoid this problem: try first filling the bucket with the clothes that you want to soak, and then pouring the water over the clothing.You will need to locate a suitable container that can be filled with water and still take the added clothing size. Remember that the weight of the clothing will increase the water level!

, Use the regular amount that you would use to wash your clothes. Swish and stir the cleaning agent to ensure that it dissolves into the water.

, Add the clothing and push deep under the water so that all of the garments are completely covered with water. Push down any pieces of fabric that pop up above the waterline.


If you are trying to remove a small, localized stain, then consider only soaking the stained corner of the fabric. This way, you won't need as much room.If the water spills over, then you've added too many garments. Try soaking in stages, or soaking simultaneously in multiple buckets., The length depends on the fabric: e.g. denim can be soaked for hours, and wool or cotton should not be exposed to stain remover for longer than 20-30 minutes.Do a light soak (20-30 minutes) if you're just having a routine wash. Soak for longer if you're trying to intensively remove a heavy stain., Rinse the fabric out before washing to remove the detergent. If the soak did not remove the stain, then you may consider soaking again – but be careful not to be too hard on the fabric. A more intensive, localized soak or scrub might be the way to tackle a tough stain."
"
Read the care labels before soaking.,
Deal with individual stains.",How to Soak Clothes3," This is an absolute must. Some fabrics are ideally suited to soaking, but others will not stand up so well to the procedure. In general, heavy, durable fabrics are great to soak, whereas delicate garments might be better suited to a scrub.


Be careful about soaking wool. It is a soft, delicate fabric, and a wool garment runs the risk of shrinking if you soak it for too long.

, If stains are especially bad, then it usually pays to rub on a small amount of detergent or the suggested stain removal agent directly to the stain. Run a web search to determine the best practice for a particular type of stain: e.g. grass, blood, food, urine.

Try air-drying your towels outside.,
Tumble-dry on a low heat.,
Shake out your towels.,
Add dryer balls or tennis balls to the load.",How to Soften Towels2," Ideally, do this on a cool day with a light breeze. Once the towel is dry, knead it with your hands as though it is a piece of dough or a hunk of meat. This should help to loosen up the stiffness.

, High heat will certainly make your towels fluffier, but it may also damage the integrity of the fabric. You can also alternate between air drying and high-heat tumble-drying. Try partially drying towels on the line, then finishing them up in the dryer for extra warmth and fluff.After drying, put the towel in for another round – but select the wrinkle-free option, if available. This will fluff the towel, which should help soften the fabric.

, Give each towel a thorough shake when it comes out of the wash, and also when it comes out of the dryer. This should help keep the fabric fluffy.

, When you tumble-dry your towels, pop a few clean tennis balls or dryer balls into the mix before closing the door. As the dry cycle rumbles, the balls will bounce around and pummel your towels. This should work the fibers and help soften up the stiff bits."
"
Use less detergent.,
Do not overfill your washing machine.,
Look out for hard water.",How to Soften Towels3," Laundry soap is highly concentrated, and a little bit goes a long way. If you use too much, the residue can congeal on the fabric, making the fibers stiff and scratchy. Try using less detergent than you normally would.


Too much detergent residue can also foster mold and bacterial growth – especially if a towel stays damp for a while.

, If the chamber is too full, it might be keeping your towels from getting a full rinse. This can leave the fabric stiff with residue from minerals, dirt, and detergent.


The same goes for drying! Be patient and run multiple loads to avoid overcrowding.

, If your home's water supply is ""hard"" and full of minerals, then the faucet or washing machine might be leaving chalky deposits in your towels. Consider buying a mineral filter to soften up your water supply, or washing your towels only with off-grid water."

Wash the clothes on high heat.,
Dry on high heat.,
Pursue an alteration.",How to Shrink Clothes2," Wash the clothes in hot water. Refrain from using any fabric softeners or other chemicals that may reduce the chance of shrinkage.


Just because a garment is labelled pre-shrunk, doesn’t mean it can’t be shrunk., Select the longest cycle available for the highest level of shrinkage. Careful not to abuse your clothing by damaging them in high heat dryers.


Dry cotton garments on high heat
Dry polyester or wool garments on medium heat.

, Since pre-washed, or pre-shrunk clothes usually stay true to size and form, you may need to get the garment altered or alter it yourself.


Alterations are preferable to shrinking when possible, especially if you wish to shorten the length of a garment without reducing its width. Remember that running delicate clothing through a washer and dryer may damage the quality of the fabric."
"
Avoid dry hanging.,
Do not hang sweaters.,
Use a dry-cleaner when advised.,
Fasten buttons and zippers before washing.",How to Shrink Clothes3," Drying your clothes using a clothesline can potentially stretch out your fabric. Avoid this by going to a laundromat and having your clothes properly dried. This could ruin your intention of shrinking if you previously washed using high heat.

, Any heavy wool-based fabric like sweaters should not be hung in your closet. This type of material will stretch easily when hung because of the weight and make of the garment., Although some think they can take shrinking into their own hands, you could potentially damage the elasticity when drying at home. The elastic in your clothes should not suffer from home-drying techniques.Increase the life and size of certain clothes and delicate garments by bringing them to the dry cleaners.

, Your clothes could get caught on a loose button or zipper in the wash. This can stretch out pieces of your clothing. Avoid this from happening by paying attention to what state your clothes are in before put into the wash."

Wash the clothing on a delicate, short cycle.,
Dry the garment on a low heat cycle.,
Check the garment periodically during the cycle to make sure it's shrinking evenly on all sides.Because wool is so responsive to heat and movement, it's easy to shrink it too much.",How to Shrink Clothes in the Wash2," Wool is a relatively delicate fabric. It should be treated carefully. Wool fibers, because wool is made of animal hair, consist of hundreds of tiny scales. When exposed to heat, water, or agitation, these scales interlock and mat together, shrinking the fabric. This process is called felting.Wool is highly responsive to heat and movement, so a short cycle is ideal.

, For wool, movement is at least as important for shrinkage as temperature. The movement of the dryer rubs the scales together and causes the wool to shrink. Wool shrinks very quickly, so it's best to use a low setting.

, If you accidentally shrink the garment smaller than you would like, immediately soak it in cool water for about thirty minutes. Then wrap it in a towel to dry."

, Most washing machines have a ""delicate"" setting with a low temperature, which is ideal. Low heat can tighten the weave, causing it to shrink as the threads pull closer together.Use a mild detergent. Avoid chlorine bleach at all costs as it will damage the silk.
Check the silk periodically. You may choose to take the garment out after half a cycle. , This will remove the excess moisture. Do not wring out the garment, as this could damage the fabric.

, Unlike many other fabrics, silk retains its shape well, and will not stretch. You may hang it up to dry without harming it. Do not place in direct sunlight as this can fade the color, and avoid a wood drying rack as the silk can leave stains on the wood. Allow to dry nearly completely. At this point, you may choose to use a dryer to complete the drying process.


Put the garment in the dryer for five minutes at a time.Some tumble dryers have a silk setting. If yours does not, use a heatless air setting.
Check it often to make sure the silk isn't being damaged. You may want to set a timer to make sure it doesn't stay in the dryer too long. Once the garment has shrunk to your taste, remove.

Prepare a large, boiling pot of water.,
Once the pot is boiling, remove it from the heat and put a shirt in it.,
Let the shirt soak in the water for about 20 minutes.,
Drain the water and let the shirt cool slightly before handling it.,
Dry the shirt.",How to Shrink a Cotton T Shirt1," Clothing companies often stretch out their fabric so that less cloth is needed to manufacture a shirt.Washing the cotton shirt, or submerging it, in warm water will help the cloth in the shirt shrink back to its natural state.









If you want to avoid the hassle of buying a shirt that's too big and shrinking it yourself, look for pre-shrunk garments when you shop. Pre-shrunk shirts are increasingly common.;
, The warmer the water, the greater the shrinkage.








If you want your shirt to shrink roughly 1-2 sizes, put your shirt in immediately after you remove the pot from the burner.
If you want your shirt to shrink roughly 1/2-1 size, wait 5 minutes before placing the shirt in the water.
If you want your shirt to shrink roughly 1/4-1/2 size, wait 10-15 minutes before placing the shirt in the water.

, You may have to alter the time based on the shirt size. Again, the longer the shirt is exposed to the hot water, the more it will shrink.








, Be careful not to burn yourself if the water is still scalding.








, For slight to moderate shrinking, wring the shirt out and let air dry. To shrink the shirt by 2 or 3 sizes compared to its original shape, use a dryer instead, as the tumbling will cause it to shrink.

Transfer the shirt to a drying machine and dry thoroughly.,
Remember that machine-drying your shirt can affect its appearance.,
Wear your newly fitted shirt.",How to Shrink a Cotton T Shirt2," Contrary to popular belief, dryer heat actually does not shrink garments! According to a fabric technologist for Whirlpool, shrinkage is caused when the fabric tumbles against the sides of the washer and the dryer.








The movement of the garments inside your washing machine also affects how much the fabric shrinks. Washing machines that are front-loaders, meaning the machines' loading and unloading doors are in the front, produce less agitation, and therefore less shrinkage, than top-loaded washing machines., Remember, you don't need to blast your cotton shirt with heat (it's the tumbling action that causes shrinking), so use a medium-heat setting to dry.








, Dark garments quickly lose their brand-new feeling when put in the dryer and subjected to repeated tumbling. This is because the tumbling action raises microscopically small fibers, giving them a ""powdery"" look.







, Enjoy the way your shirt fits better than it did before!

Use a good, waterproof bathroom sealant or caulk to repair any joints that do not lend themselves to grouting, such as metal trim or fixture penetrations.

",How to Quickly Repair Bathroom Shower Tiles," You may have to break the tile into small pieces and remove it. The biggest problem with this is that you can easily break some of the adjoining tiles.


Using a grout saw or other tool, remove the grout from the tile joints surrounding the damaged tile(s). Be careful not to cut through any membrane waterproofing underneath or behind the tiles.






Using a masonry bit, drill a hole through the middle of the tiles you need to remove. For large tiles you may need to drill several holes so the tile can be broken up to remove it. Again, be careful not to drill too deep, or the substrate and/or any waterproofing membrane may be damaged.






Use a chisel to break out the tile(s) in small pieces.






Remove the thinset mortar or tile adhesive behind the tile you have removed. You will need a smooth, clean surface to install the replacement tile(s) on.

This is extremely important that this base is structurally sound, otherwise you will soon find cracks in your tile work....and if it's really bad your whole floor or wall could come falling down under the weight! Check your subfloor, cabinets, or wall frame, depending on what you're tiling.


Look for signs of mold or rot and try place weight on the boards. If they bow or seem unsteady, they might need to be replaced or reinforced.;
, You will need to install cement board or a similar product (like a tile backer) before laying down the tiles. Do not use plywood. Cement board will help waterproof your structure and it will also be much more resistant to warping, which helps to prevent cracks.


Score the cement board and then snap it cut out the pieces that you need.
Screw it down along the edges (every couple inches) and also at the center (3-4 evenly spaced locations should do).
Make sure to stagger the joints between different rows of the cement board. This will prevent large cracks from appearing over time.
If attaching the cement board to a subfloor, you will need to apply mortar before lying down each panel, and then screwing it into place. Use the method described later in the article for mortaring the tiles.

, Use a carpenter's level to check that the cement board is flat in all directions. You should also continue to check for level as you go through the various layers of the tiling project. If the cement board is not level, you can adjust it with shims from below.

, Using strips of fiber mesh tape, first cover the joints in thinset mortar, lay down a strip of tape over the joint, and then lay down another skimcoat of mortar.Once everything is smooth and set, you're ready to go.

, Walls in a room are often not square or straight, and ceilings are notorious for being uneven. Use a snap chalk line, a carpenter's level, and a measuring tape to mark some truly straight lines for your tiles to follow. Measure the halfway point on each wall (or edge of a wall, if that's what you're tiling), and then snap a chalk line between opposite sides. Measure to see if the intersections at the middle of the room are square. If not, adjust. You can use this as a base to measure and draw other straight lines and perfect corners in the room.


You only need to actually mark the corners or outside edges of where the tiles will go, not mark every row.

, Once you've figured out where your tiles are going to go, dry fit the tiles until you're comfortable with how the pattern looks and how all the tiles should fit together. This is very important if you're using different tiles in a pattern or tiles of a different size.


You'll also want to plan where you want to start the tiles, so that the edges look nice. Some tiles will almost certainly need to be cut to fit at the edges, so plan where you want the tiles to start so that the cut, edge tiles look nice and balanced.

, Mix up some thin set mortar according to the manufacturer's instructions for the brand you buy. Generally, you'll have a powder to which you add water. You want the texture of the mortar to be like that of peanut butter. Add the water in slowly and mix as you go, so that you don't get too much water in the mix.


You'll also want to let it ""slake"" or rest after you do the initial mixing. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes and then mix it up again. It's now ready to use.

, Spread mortar in a small area where you will begin to work. Only work with a roughly 2'x3' area at a time. You do not want the mortar to have time to set before you can lay your tile. Using a notched trowel (different sizes may be needed, 3/8"" is a good starting point), spread the mortar between sections that you marked with the chalk line.


If the mortar rises up between the tiles (to be flush or nearly flush with the tile surface), that means it's too thick or that the ridges need to be shorter.
The mortar should be covering the entire tile, if you lift it up after placing it. If when you lift up the tiles you see only lines of mortar on the tile, then the mortar has dried out too much or the bed is too thin and the height of the ridges must be increased.
If using tile sheets, use a trowel with smaller notches. This will keep the mortar from coming up through the gaps between the tiles.

, Lay your tiles onto the mortar, starting at the right corner you marked and following a straight line.


Leave gaps of 1/8"" where the edge of the tile meets up with the wall or floor. This is to allow room for expansion and movement, as the material naturally changes with its environment. This gap can be covered with grout, molding, or shoe tile.

, Place tile spaces between each tile as you go, or simply use your eyes to estimate if using tile sheets. These spacers are usually places at the corners of each tile and look like the cross shape that is formed by four tiles being next to each other.

, Use a carpenter's level as you go to make sure that the tiles are level.

, Use a masonry wet saw to cut any tiles you need for the corners and edges, carefully measuring them to fit for your particular project. Don't forget to leave the 1/8"" gap all around the edge.

, Remove the spaces once the mortar has set and you're ready to grout!

, You'll need to decide between sanded and unsanded grout. Which you choose will depend on the size of the gaps between your tiles. Use sanded grout for gaps bigger than 3mm and unsanded grout for smaller gaps.

, Mix the grout according to the packaging directions. You might want to mix in additives to make it more water resistant or add color that matches better with your tile. Only mix as much as you can apply in about 20 minutes, since you don't want it drying out.

, Using a grout float, spread the grout over the area to be grouted (working in a small area at a time, again). Hold the float at a 45 degree angle and spread across the gaps at an angle as well. Spreading parallel to the grout lines can gouge out the grout.


Remove as much of the excess from the tile faces using the grout float as you can at this time.

, Let the grout cure for 20 minutes.

, Using a damp sponge, gently wipe down the tiles and grout lines to remove the excess. Clean just a small area, rinse, wring, and start again. You want to keep the sponge as clean and dry as possible.

, Leave the grout to cure for 3 hours before starting the next section.

, Keep repeating this process until the entire surface is done. You might want to clean off any remaining residue once the grout has cured using an old sock or dry rag.

, Seal the grout and then reseal the grout every six months. Each sealant is different but generally they are a wax-like substance which you apply to a rag or sponge and then rub into the grout in a circular motion.

",How to Mop Ceramic Tile,",,,

If the bucket you're using has a wringer on it, this is the preferred method of extracting the excess water. Some mops, especially those with cloth strips, have a wringer attached and these work just as well. If you don't have either of these, you can simply use your hands to wring the mop.

,

The grout is very porous and tends to hold more dirt than the tiles. Pay close attention to the grout when mopping your tile floor to be sure you're covering the grouted parts well.

,,,, Speed up the drying process by opening windows and/or turning on fans in the room, if possible.,,,,,

Mopping the floor with clean water removes any build-up that may be left behind by the cleaning solution. The floor stays cleaner longer and helps reduce slipping.

You can purchase it in sheets or in liquid form.Opt to cut sheets of “Ditra” membrane to fit the area you are tiling. You will need to apply thinset to the concrete and smooth the membrane sheets down with a trowel.
You can also paint a thick coat of liquid anti-fracture membrane on the concrete with a roller brush.
The anti-fracture membrane keeps an insulated layer between the concrete and the tile so that it can move with the change of seasons and temperature without cracking the tiles., Use a carpenters square or triangle ruler (try square) to check that the lines are perfectly perpendicular. Alternatively, mark a spots 3' and 4' away from the center point. If the distance between the two is exactly 5', the lines are perpendicular (since a 3-4-5 triangle is a right triangle). If not, adjust the center lines.

,, Cover the whole surface in a thorough dry run.

, In almost all cases, tile must be cut near the edges to finish the tiling.

, Move a center line to one side enough so that you have even tile cuts on all sides.

Leave a 1/4"" gap on all edges (by walls, cabinets, fireplace hearths, etc.) to allow for thermal expansion.

, This is where you will start the installation. You can remove the tiles quarter by quarter or all at once, as long as you know where they will go.

, Place the bucket and a one-fourth inch (0.6cm) notched trowel near your empty quarter. You may want to put on knee pads during the installation process.

, Smooth it over the entire area with a smooth trowel.

, The lines should be horizontal and run the same direction throughout your installation.

, Push down lightly to ensure it adheres. Keep a bucket of water and a damp sponge nearby to wipe off tiles if they get thinset on the top.


Wipe them off immediately to avoid ruining the surface of the tile., You can also skip using spacers and create a thin grout line at the end of your installation.

, Check that they are level. If a tile is not level, you can “back-butter” it by placing an extra layer of thinset in a corner to make it level.

, Take your time to ensure you have an even surface. Use a 4' carpenter's level, if you have one.

,, Make sure it is lump free before spreading it.

, Hold the float at a 45-degree angle and run it across the surface of the tile. Repeat until all the grout spaces seem to be filled.

, Return and clean the top of the tile with a damp sponge. Clean it often and ensure it isn’t too wet.

, Buff the surface of the tile with a dry cheesecloth. Let the grout continue to dry for 72 hours.

Use a diamond hole saw to bore into the tile and drill a perfect hole.,When your floor is rehearsed and all tiles are laid, measured, and cut, and appear to your liking, you are ready to lay the adhesive,

,
Pick up all tiles and set aside.,
Wait.,
Continue working in quadrants as before.,
Consider caulk.,
Let the floor cure.",How to Lay a Ceramic or Porcelain Tile Floor," An unpleasant question to be faced is ""What is your floor made up of?"" Plywood is good. But, if you have the typical 1/2"" to 5/8"" particle board on top of a deck made of 2x8s, you have some work to do. After removal of the base trim, the particle board should be pulled up (this is easiest if you first cut it into about 16"" squares)and replaced by plywood. You will need a Skil saw, and if you're doing the kitchen, you'll need a ""toe-kick saw."" Replace the particle board up to where the tile will stop. While you have the particle board off, you can inspect the deck to make sure it is firmly attached to the floor joists. Now you're ready for leveling compound (if needed).
, You will need to lay backerboard (fiberglass or preferably cement sheets that are usually 3 by 5 feet) as well, or the tile will pop off.

, A first phase of evaluation is to determine the size of the room to be tiled (or re-tiled).


The number of tiles you will need will depend on the size of the tile you wish to lay, as well as the tile pattern you will like on the floor.
Using a tape measure or digital laser tape, measure the room from one wall to the opposite wall, and note the distance. Let’s say the measure of this distance is 12 feet (3.7 m).
Measure the distance of the opposing walls to each other. Let’s say this distance is 7 feet (2.1 m). Multiplying these 2 distances (12 feet x 7 feet) will yield a total area of 84 square feet.

Note: These measurements are based on squared dimensions. If the room is not perfectly ""squared"" (or in this case “rectangle"") because of an irregular floor plan (where there might be a small section off of one side, for example), do not factor this space into your measurement. While you will of course need to tile this space, factoring this space into your measurements will affect finding the ""center"" of the room, which will be discussed shortly.
This area is important to note, since it will provide you with an estimate of the number of tiles you will need to purchase to cover the area to be tiled.



,


Tile comes in different sizes: 4 inch (10.2 cm) by 4 inch (10.2 cm), 8 inch (20.3 cm) by 8 inch (20.3 cm), 12 inch (30.5 cm) by 12 inch (30.5 cm), for example (there are others, too). Tiles can also be laid in different patterns.
The total number of tiles you will need will depend on the size and pattern you want. For simplicity's sake, let's assume we are going to use 12 inch (30.5 cm) by 12 inch (30.5 cm) tiles and use a traditional grid design, where tiles are simply laid in pattern like graph paper.
Because the area of the room is 84 square feet, we will need about 84 12 inch (30.5 cm) x 12 inch (30.5 cm) (1 square foot) tiles (even accounting for the spaces in between tiles, known as ""joints""). However, it is a good rule of thumb for beginners to purchase extra tiles to account for improperly cut or scored tiles, or for breakage. Buy an extra pack or two of tiles to be safe.
When laying tile diagonally, a lot of material is wasted as cutoffs. A good rule of thumb here, even for experts, is to buy 15% more tile than the square footage would dictate.

, You are only limited by your imagination (and the store's stock).


Choice of color typically is a matter of individual choice. The only additional step of planning and preparation with regard to color of the tile is with the grout selection. Grout is the ""filler"" that goes in the spaces between tiles, the joints.
It can be grey, white, terra cotta, and so on. Typically, dark tiles with light grout really show the spaces in between tiles, and vice versa.
The selection of grout color will really depend on how you would like the floor to look to the eye. There is no hard and fast rule.

,


Be sure that the entire surface is as smooth as possible.
You will likely need to use floor leveling compound (available at your do it yourself hardware store) to float (create gradual transitions in the floor's surface) out any divots, holes, or differences in subflooring heights. If you don't ""float"" out these differences your tile will crack. Your surface is now prepared for tiling.

, You have already determined the size of your room, which is 84 square feet.


Finding the center point is critical for laying the tile. It will determine where you will lay your first tile and the next ones.
Measure one wall, for example the 12 foot (3.7 m) wall. At 6 feet (1.8 m), half the distance, mark a point with a pencil.
Do the same on the other 12 foot (3.7 m) wall. Using your chalk line, anchor one end at the midpoint of one wall and stretch across to the midpoint of the other. ""Snap"" the chalk line by lifting it up slightly and letting it hit the ground; this will leave a straight line on the floor.
Measure the 7 foot (2.1 m) walls and mark a point a 3 ½ feet on both sides.

, When you have found your center point, you will notice you will have a ""quadrant"" design on the floor, or 4 equally sized areas.


Starting at the center, ""rehearse"" your tile pattern by simply laying them on the floor without any adhesive or glue.
Place the first tile at the corner nearest the center point. You are only going to work in one quadrant at a time.
Begin placing tiles in a straight line towards either wall, leaving a small space in between the tiles.

,


You will use 3 full tiles and 1 tile cut to 4 inches (10.2 cm), since the size of the 3 joints plus the 1 wall joint equals 2 inches (5.1 cm) and your original tile size was 6 inches (15.2 cm) (6 inches original tile- 2 inches total joint= 4 inch tile).
Note that this does not follow the realignment strategy mentioned above. Because this room is ""squared,"" the true center is best left where it actually is. Simply make uniform cuts as they correspond to each side (in this case, you will have 9 inch (22.9 cm) tiles as the wall tiles on the ""short"" 7 foot (2.1 m) walls and 4 inch (10.2 cm) tiles on the long 12 foot (3.7 m) walls.

, Because this design is uniform, it is best to follow the same size cuts all the way around.

, To achieve this you may have to drain down radiator systems, remove the rad from the wall and take the taps off the pipework. Very time consuming but worth the effort if a minimal look is desired. Your floor will look better if you can drill a hole in the tile and lay the tile over the pipe.

, If you do not have a hole saw you can use a wet-tile saw to cut a square hole in the center of the tile. Draw a square on the back of the tile in the desired location of the hole. Carefully place the backside of the tile against the wet-saw blade at the midpoint of one of the sides of the square. Gently push the tile against the the blade until the edge of the square is cut. Repeat for the other sides of the square hole.

,,


On your prepared surface, begin spreading the adhesive with the notched trowel. You will start from the center point, work only in one quadrant, and apply small sections at a time, following the pattern during the rehearsal.
Spread adhesive evenly, then using the notched edge, make a raking motion. You should have grooves neither too deep nor too shallow.
Set the first tile in place at the corner lines made by the center point. Do not twist tile; simply press the tile down firmly yet softly.
Set tile spacer and then continue with additional tiles. (Remember to set tile spacers after each tile).
Use your level to determine degree of level of the tiles as you go along. (Not all surfaces are perfectly level!).
If slightly uneven, either manipulate the tile or add a little more adhesive to the floor until level. Usually, after a quadrant is complete, remove the tile spacers so they do not set into the adhesive.
Follow this process for the remainder of the floor, making sure to check the level as you go along..

, After the tiles have been set, it is usually advised to wait at least one day (or overnight) to allow the adhesive to dry, or cure. After the adhesive has cured, you will grout the joints.

,


Using a rubber float, apply only enough grout as you can effectively work with.
In a diagonal direction, press grout into the joints to an even level with the tile.


Skim excess from tile with the rubber float. You will notice a mild “grout haze” on your tiles.


Wait a few minutes for the grout to stiffen up in the joints.
Use a damp sponge work across the joints, (working along joints can drag out too much grout) to remove grout haze from tiles and finish the joints, make sure not to press too hard on joints.
As you work, check each joint is full and smoothly finished.
Continue this process with other joints in remaining quadrants.

, For joints at the wall and floor interface it is best to use caulk instead of grout. There are benefits to using caulk along wall joints. All tiles may expand or contract depending on temperature fluctuations. The wall joints are also known as expansion joints. Using caulk here will buffer expansion and contraction a bit.

, Wait for the entire floor to cure for about a week before giving it a good mopping to remove remaining grout haze.


You may also choose to seal the grout with a sealer to lock out dirt and or grease.

Decide how you will use your alphabet tiles.,
Consider what size tile you should use.,
What do you ultimately want to achieve from this project?",How to Make Handprint Alphabet Tiles1," Are you going to use them to tile your child’s bathroom or will you give them as a gift? Knowing how you will be using the tiles will dictate how you approach the project.;
, Once you know how you will use the tiles, you can determine the tile size. Of course you will need tiles that are large enough to hold your child’s handprint so measure your child’s hand before choosing tiles.

, Are you tracking your child’s growth and plan to add a new tile every few months or every year or do you want to simply capture a moment in time.


Tracking your child’s growth. If you plan to track your child’s growth, consider how often you want to add to your collection. If you start at birth and do one hand tile per year you may be asking your teenage to young adult child to add to your collection every year. Since kids grow quickly, you could add to it in the beginning every month and then as your child’s growth slows you can add yearly.
Capturing his/her small hand as a child. If you are capturing a moment in time, consider your child’s age and patience level. Although you may want that tiny handprint from when he’s six months old, it may not be practical to have a six month old sit for 26 tiles for a handprint.
Create as a keepsake for a grandparent or parent. If you are planning to give the tiles as a gift, think about how your recipient might use the tiles? Perhaps he/she mentioned something about wanting to tile a portion of the back patio or even consider using them to tile over a stone patio set. Take the recipient’s needs into consideration first before you start the project.

Many of these removal jobs can be a project unto themselves, but you can find help at How to: Remove Floor Tile, Take Out Carpet, and Remove Wallpaper.;
, Take exact measurements of the area you plan to tile. You will need to know the total area in square footage, so you can purchase the correct amount of tile.

, Once you’re rolling on the project, you don’t want to have to stop to purchase more tile, thin-set mortar, or anything else, so purchase it all in advance. Consult with the tile vendor or a home improvement store regarding how much thin-set you will need for your particular job. You’ll additionally need buckets to mix the mortar, trowels to spread it, sponges to clean as you go, and a tile cutter to make exact cuts for corner and edge pieces.


Inevitably, you will lose some tile to dropping, cracking, chipping, etc. during the process, so ensure that you purchase extra.
Due to the unique coloring of travertine, it also also doesn’t hurt to have extra matching tiles in storage in case any of the tiles chip or crack down the road.

, Once you have your previous covering removed and all of your materials on hand, you should prep the surface for tile.


If you’re applying the tile to a wall as a backsplash, then you should remove all switch plates and use 80-grit sandpaper to sand the wall by hand.This will create a rougher surface on the paint that will bind better to the thin-set mortar. Use a damp rag to remove any dust from the wall after sanding as well.For travertine flooring, you need a clean, even surface, so remove any leftover residue from the previous flooring and mop to remove any debris. For a wood rather than concrete subfloor, lay down 0.5” cement fiberboard to create an even subfloor., Whether you’re tiling flooring or a backsplash, you want to mark the midpoint of the surface.This is to ensure that you’re starting with the focal point of the room and that the tile feels symmetrical across.


For flooring, you want to mark both the X and Y axis along the flooring in order to find the exact center of the room. Make chalk lines and double check the angles with a carpenter’s angle.For a backsplash, you only need to find the horizontal middle, but mark this middle with a vertical chalk line down the wall. Use a carpenter’s level to ensure the line is straight., With the floor prepped and the center marked, you can lay out the design of the tile. Start with the center gridline(s) and place additional tiles leaving the appropriate amount of room for the spacers, which will later be grout lines.For a backsplash, you will have to measure the exact space and lay the tiles out on the ground to match it since you cannot hold the tiles to the wall to check the design.
For floor tiling, you can use the space you left for the grout to chalk in an entire grid for the project if you so choose.

, You will not be able to mix the thin-set for the entire project at once. Instead mix small batches in a five-gallon bucket. As you get going, you’ll gain a pretty quick understanding of the pace you go and how much you use. Whatever you mix must be used within two hours.Regardless of whether you’re installing floor or wall tiling, the thin-set should have the consistency of mashed potatoes when you mix it., Start with the area where you measured your initial chalk lines and spread enough thin-set to place two or three tiles to start. Use the edge of a V-notched trowel at roughly a 45-degree angle to spread the thin-set. You want to have an evenly, thinly covered space before putting down a tile.You want to actually scrape the trowel along the surface slightly to achieve the even spread.There will be slight furrows in the thin-set from the notches in the edge of the trowel. They are supposed to be there as they help air escape as the mortar sets., Place the first tile flush with your chalk centerline(s). For a backsplash, the process is easiest to do in rows.For a flooring job, it’s easiest to start at one of the 90-degree angles in the center lines and work in quadrants based on those lines., As you place the tiles, make sure you’re putting spacers between each to help keep consistent lines for grouting later., Every two or three tiles, use a carpenter’s level to ensure flat, even placement of the tiles. If you want to take extra precautions to maintain the level surface, you can also purchase a leveling system, which consists of threaded pegs that go between the spacers and knobs that you can gently tighten down against the tops of the tiles to help perfectly level them and hold them in place., Don’t worry if any thin-set ends up on the top surface of a tile as you trowel it. You can use a damp sponge to wipe it away.

, As you work toward the edges of your surface, you will likely have to cut some of the tiles to fit them. Take the exact measurement to which you need to cut the tile accounting for any spacers and transfer the measurement to the tile with a pencil. Then use a wet saw to make the cuts.


If you are unfamiliar with how to use a wet saw, then you can find more at Use a Tile Saw.
Since the saws aren’t cheap, you will probably prefer to rent one from a hardware store for your project.
For dealing with placing tiles around electrical outlets, you can find more information at Tile Around Outlets.

, You must wait until the thin-set mortar has cured completely before applying grout, which based on your brand, the consistency to which you mixed, the temperature, and the humidity can take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.Since the spaces between the tiles allow air to escape as the mortar sets, it is imperative not to grout until the process is complete.

, After you have removed the spacers and any leveling system pegs, you can apply the grout. You’ll mix the grout with water into a thick paste and apply it with a grout float, which allows you both to push grout into the joints and even it as you go.


Because travertine is a porous tile and can stain, you should use white grout with travertine., Since grout begins to set quickly, work on small sections at a time and use a damp sponge to clear any excess grout on the tiles. The amount of tile to let the grout dry will depend on the brand, but it will be clearly marked on the packaging.

, To extend the life of your new travertine floor or backsplash, you should apply a sealant to it. Though most sealants require waiting at least two weeks before application. For more information on that process, visit Seal Travertine.

Hire a professional.",How to Reglaze Tile," These kits are sold at hardware and home repair stores as well as online. Some just come with the epoxy paint, while others include rollers and sprayers for application. Read over what each kit contains and compare prices to determine the best choice for you. Expect to spend around $80-$100 for a kit with everything included., Before you start the glazing process, unpack your kit and spend some time going over the step-by-step instructions. If you are unclear about the directions, look for a customer service number or helpline that you can call. The instruction booklet will also tell you what kind of safety gear you’ll need.Pay close attention to any of the kit’s warning labels or notices. For example, it might advise you that certain types of tile, such as laminate, are not good candidates for refinishing. In this case, you may need to replace the tiles or talk with a professional installer., Refinishing can’t repair any heavily damaged tiles. In fact, the new finish will probably make any imperfections even more obvious. Your best option is to find the same size tile to replace the broken ones. This means that you’ll need to chip that tile out and glue in a fresh one.If the refinishing glaze that you are using is opaque, don’t worry too much about matching the replacement tile’s color exactly with the old ones. After all, they will all look the same after the paint coating.
Repair small cracks or minor chips by applying a polyester putty to the area and then smoothing it out. This will make the tile waterproof once more and the repairs will be covered up by the refinishing process., If your grout is cracking, falling apart, or extremely moldy, then go ahead and chisel it out before moving forward. Use a flat head screwdriver, small hammer, and utility knife to apply pressure to the caulk beads. They may peel right up or you may need to gradually chip them away with the knife. Always keep your hands away from the knife’s path and go slowly.This step can get pretty messy, so keep a vacuum close by to suck up the dust and debris.
You’ll want to replace the grout either before painting or after the epoxy paint has cured. It is really your choice. Grout covered with epoxy paint will be uniform and easier to clean. But, some people like the look of grout lines.

, Your kit will likely come with specific cleaning instructions. It might ask you to mix together an enclosed powder with water and then scrub it on the tile. If instructions are not provided, clean the tiles with bleach, a powdered cleaner (such as Comet), and a rust and lime remover. After each cleaner application, do a full rinse with water.If you are working with kitchen tiles, use a degreaser cleaner or rubbing alcohol to remove any oily residue., Go over each tile with 400/600 grit sandpaper. Choose the wet/dry type of paper, so that you can move on to sanding directly after cleaning. Move your hand in small circles or back and forth motions and try to cover all tiles evenly. Rinse off the tiles with water when you are finished.Remember that your goal is to remove any surface bumps and imperfections, not to sand it down to its base.
Sanding increases the lifespan of your refinishing job by allowing the epoxy paint to more fully adhered to the surface of your tiles.
Don’t get too discouraged if you can’t see clear results from your sanding. Just keep going and rub your hands over the tile’s surface to feel the change in texture., Wait at least a day or two for the grout and tiles to fully dry before moving forward. If you apply a refinishing paint to a wet surface, it will not stick as well and may even leave air bubbles behind., When the area is completely dry, apply a strip of tape to any wood trim or other surfaces that connect to the tile. This will keep the epoxy paint from spreading beyond the tile. Keep this tape on until a few minutes after you finish your final paint application., Before you start the application, make sure to put a tarp or even a sheet over the floors in the room where the tile is located. This will keep them clean in the event that you accidently splatter or spill any epoxy paint. When you are finished with your project simply gather this sheet up and toss it or clean it off elsewhere., Most people suggest opening as many windows as you can to let out some of the fumes from the painting process. To get rid of the smell, try to keep them open for as long as you can, usually the entire day of application.If the day is warm or hot, opening the windows may shorten the drying time.

, Some kits come with respirators or masks, high quality rubber gloves, and protective glasses. If this is the case, go ahead and put these on before continuing. If your kit does not provide these items, make sure to go out and purchase them in advance. A respirator, in particular, is a great way to minimize your contact with the nasty fumes.Check that the gloves that you plan on using fit you well. If your gloves are loose or baggy they may hurt your ability to apply the paint cleanly.

, Depending on what your kit suggests, either use a primer meant for glossy ceramics or an acid-based deglosser. These products make it easier for the epoxy paint to adhere to the surface of the tile. Some kits come with the necessary primer, but in many cases you’ll have to purchase it separately. Follow the primer directions carefully to make sure that you apply it correctly.Some suggest using a sprayer to apply the primer, instead of rolling or brushing it on. This may prevent some stickiness, but you’ll likely want to practice with the sprayer beforehand, as they can sometimes be difficult to use., Most kits come with two separate paint cans: the activator and the base. Grab each can and give it a good shake. Then, slowly pour them together in your paint tray. If the final mixture looks a little transparent or milky, that is okay. It will handle a bit like glue and will dry solid, too., Pour the mixed paint into a sprayer or dip a brush into your paint pan. If you are working with a brush, start with the edges first and work your way in. You could even brush out the edges and then use a roller for the middle. After your first coat is finished, give it at least two hour to dry. Then, apply the next one.It’s generally best to use a foam roller, as it will leave less of a pattern on the tile. And, if you use a paint pan, make sure to change out the liner and refresh the paint before applying a second coat. Otherwise, you may end up with dried paint lumps on your tile., If your tile has a special border or extra embellishments, expect to go a little bit more slowly on these areas. You may want to switch to a brush, so that you can get deeper into any indentions or prints., In between various steps, go outside of the room for a few minutes, take off your respirator, and breathe in the fresh air. If you had to hunch over or lean down while painting, take a quick stretch before going back in., After applying your epoxy paint, you now have to wait for it to cure. This is the time when the paint hardens to the point where you can get the tile wet without damaging the surface. Epoxy coatings can dry in 2-3 days, but it is probably safer to leave it alone for a full week., An experienced tile worker or kitchen/bathroom remodeler can offer you some additional options beyond standard refinishing. For example, some of them can spray on a primer followed by a urethane coating that mimics a glaze when buffed. Make sure to go with a contractor that you trust and guarantee a competitive price by getting at least two bids."

Plot what kind of alphabet will you create.,
Consider your color scheme.",How to Make Handprint Alphabet Tiles2," Although you know you will include your child’s handprint, what will you create from the handprint? Animals, people, transportation? The possibilities are endless.


Sketch out each letter and how you will create it with the child’s handprint. Make a plan for how each tile will appear. Use a pencil and sketch out each design and add your child’s “handprint” by just sketching it at first so you can see how it will appear.

, You could do all white tiles with bright colored paint or you could use colored tiles, black tiles and reverse white or bright colored paint. Consider how you plan to display the tiles when choosing your color scheme into consideration.


Take placement into consideration. If you are planning to display the tiles in a bathroom or main area of the home you will want to plan accordingly in order the match the overall tone of the room.
Find the right suite of paints. Select paint that is not only compatible on tile but matches the color of tile you selected and the room colors.

You could also visit a discount tile store for tile choices for better priced materials. Gather tiles, ceramic-compatible paint, brushes and possibly spray on sealant. If you plan to add extra pieces such as faux jewels, pick up the jewels and adhesive too.

, You will probably need an area that is not only flat but provides you with enough room to create the tiles and then have an area where they can dry. You also need a place where your child can come into the room, have his or her hand painted and then placed on a tile.

, Sketch out how you’d like each tile to appear. Think of ways you can use his or her little fingers or thumb to be part of your design. Also, consider if you want to add words or sayings on each tile and plan accordingly.

, Apply paint to your child’s hand using a paint brush. Guide his or her hand to the tile and press down firmly. Remove the hand and either re-paint and repeat or clean his or her hand and move onto the next color of paint.


Consider covering same color tiles in one sweep, then wipe your child’s hand clean and use the next color. This may be a more efficient way to paint the tiles.







, Allow the first round of painted hands to fully dry before you add decoration or any other paint. If you attempt to paint over damp or wet paint you could smudge the handprint and ruin the project.

, Follow your pencil lines and create the finished tile.


Use a variety of paint mediums to create your tiles including brushes and paint pens. If you plan to write words or need to include intricate lines, use a paint pen for the cleanest method.

Complete the finishing touches.",How to Install Tiles on a Concrete Basement Floor," Concrete floors are dull, drab and boring, but oftentimes people lack the time or the necessity to lay down an alternative floor. Most often, concrete floors are seen in basements and other out of the way places. However, if you choose to remodel your basement and need a new floor, the first thing to consider is what type of floor you need. Several varieties of tiles, including ceramic and vinyl, can be used; choose the one that best suits your anticipated use.;
, This is a vital step of the project. Accumulated mud, dirt and other debris must be removed completely to ensure that the tiles are laid properly and stick to the concrete. For this purpose, be sure to use a commercial or industrial strength cleaning agent, along with lots of water and a brush.

, To lay an even surface, the underlying concrete needs to be uniform and level as well. To achieve this, get rid of any protrusions, bumps or cracks in the surface. Using sandpaper to level the bumps and concrete and other fillers to stop cracks, you should be able to get a smooth surface. Be sure to wash it after this is done and let it dry.

, After preparing the surface, plan how you intend to lay down the tiles. Depending on size and shape, you can have a wide variety of patterns to choose from and you may even decide to get creative with your patterns and create something original. Be sure to plan this out carefully before starting the actual work to ensure that there are no mistakes.

, Once everything is ready, start by applying a layer of mortar to the floor. Mortar is basically the adhesive that helps the tile stick to the concrete, so choose the one that best suits your needs and your current situation. The commercially available mortars generally need to be mixed with a proportional amount of water. Be sure to read the manufacturers instructions on this.


Once you have prepared your mortar solution, use a trowel to spread it onto the floor. Once the mortar has been spread evenly, gently lay the tiles and tap them into place with the trowel.
Use spacers into ensure that the tiles are properly spaced as you lay them into your envisaged patterns. Once the tiles have been set, let them dry out for at least a day.

, Once the tiles have set properly, finish them off using grout. Grout is commercially available in a variety of colours, choose the one that suits your needs best. Mix as directed and apply to the gaps in the tiles.


Be sure to clean off the excess grout from between the tiles and any that spills onto their surface. After this is done, let the floor set for a couple of days. Clean off the floor one last time with a wet mop, and then it is ready for use.

You don't want to do all this beautiful tile work just to have to tear it down in two years! This means checking the wall studs if you're putting the tile on a wall, the subfloor and floor joists if you're tiling a floor, or the counter base and tile backing if you're tiling a countertop.


Look for signs of mold and rot. This will usually be obvious, with seriously discolored wood or a surface which is soft and gives way under pressure.
You'll also want to look for cracks in the surface that you're tiling. Small cracks may be normal but big cracks might need to be dealt with before you can continue.;
, If you don't have a solid surface to put your tiles on, you'll need to add one. Cement board or drywall is best, as these can handle the moisture of the tiling process. Plywood should be absolutely avoided, since the wood will warp with the added moisture and it will also be less waterproof, even after tiling.


Cover any joints. Make sure that joints between cement boards or drywall are bridged with fiber mesh tape. You do not want the panels to move individual once your tile is up, since this will cause the tiles to crack.

, With your surface prepared, you'll want to create even lines that you can follow when setting your tiles. For glass tiles, using a laser level will be the easiest option. These can be purchased fairly cheaply and will project a straight line onto your surface that you can follow with your tiles. Just set it to level and then project the line where you want the tiles to go.


A laser level is handy because it will continue to be available even after you lay down your mortar. You can use a chalk line to line up your tiles but it's easy to accidentally cover it.
Getting a level line is important because walls, ceilings, and other surfaces in your home are often not as straight as they look. A wall, for example, can be taller in one spot than it is in another.

, Dry fit your tiles before putting up any mortar to make sure that you like your pattern and that you know how the different tiles or sheets properly fit together. Lay out a couple to get an idea and then get ready for the fun to start!

, You will use thin set mortar to attach the tiles to the wall or other tiling surface. You'll need to mix the mortar according to the package instructions, but generally you want to start with the powder and add water very gradually. When the mortar has a consistency like peanut butter, you've got the right amount of water. Mix only what you can spread in 20 minutes. Let the mortar sit for 10 minutes, stir it up again and then it's ready to use.

, Spread the mortar using a notched trowel in a roughly 3'x3' space. Spread the mortar out and then use the trowel to create straight, parallel lines in the mortar. These will help the tiles adhere to the wall. You might want to do a test tile first, however, in order to make sure that your mortar is the right consistency. Place a tile down and them pull it back off: when you set the tile on the mortar, if the mortar comes up between the tiles so that it is even with the face of the tile, then your mortar is too thick or maybe wet. If you see lines of mortar on the back of your tile when you pull it up, then your mortar is too dry or the bed of mortar is too thin.


Talk to your local hardware store about the trowel size that they would recommend for your particular project. Usually, glass tiles come in sheets and trowel with smaller notches will be needed. However, if you are using larger glass tiles that are not in a sheet, the average 3/8"" trowel will probably be better.

, With the mortar in place, you can start setting out your tiles or tile sheets. Simply press them firmly into the mortar; push it solidly against the surface but remember that it's not toothpaste. You don't want to push the tile so that you disturb the mortar. You just want to get the tile to stick. Try to start in a corner or against a wall, to cut down on the amount of cutting and sizing that you need to do. Insert tile spacers between the tiles or tile sheets as you go.


If you are using tile sheets, you can cut the sheets as needed to create a sheet of any size or shape for your project. You can also cut out the middle of a sheet in order to make space for outlets. Simply use a utility knife to cut the mesh backing.

, You will likely have a space that does not perfectly fit the tiles that you have, create a need for only a portion of a tile. In order to fill these gaps, you will need to cut the tiles to size. You will need to use a wet saw with a blade designed for glass in order to cut glass tiles. Be very careful and keep your fingers as far away from the blade as possible.


The old rule of ""measure twice, cut once"" is your friend here. Be very sure about how much tile tile you need before you cut it.

, Once you've got all of your tiles in place, you can remove your tile spacers. If you mixed your mortar correctly, the tiles should now stay in place.

, You will now want to let the mortar thoroughly cure before you do the grout. This usually takes around 24 hours. Make sure that the area is well ventilated and that moisture is kept to a minimum.

, There are two main types of grout: sanded and unsanded grout. Sanded grout is used when the gaps between tiles are larger than 3mm. Unsanded grout is used when the gaps between tiles are smaller than that. Measure the gaps between your tiles to find out which grout is best for your project.


Glass tiles almost always come in sheets these days and these sheets tend to have very small gaps between the tiles, meaning you will probably want unsanded grout.
It is important to choose the right grout for your project because not doing so will cause cracks (and all the problems that come with them) in your tiles.
There is also technically epoxy grout, which you can use, but it is more expensive and difficult to apply if you do not have experience applying grout.

, Mix your grout according to the instructions on the packaging, making sure to also mix in any additives you want. It should have a consistency like smooth peanut butter. Make sure that you mix no more than what you can spread in 20 minutes. This will keep the grout from drying out. You should only work on small areas at a time, finishing one section before continuing on to the next, so plan on mixing many small batches of grout.


You can get grout additives that make it more mold resistant or water resistant, as well as additives that do things like giving the grout a color.

, Grab a grout float and get ready to spread! Working in only a small area at a time (again, what you can cover in 20 minutes), spread the grout onto the tiles. Hold the float at a 45 degree angle and criss-cross the gaps between the tiles. You do not want to move the float parallel or perpendicular to any tiles, since this will push the grout out of the gaps.

, Use the float to remove the major excess grout and then let the grout begin to cure. Wait roughly 20 minutes, or whatever time is recommended in the instructions for your specific product, so that the majority of the grout can set enough for you to remove the excess that is on the tiles.

, Get a large bucket of sink-full of water and a large sponge. Get the sponge wet and then wring out the excess water, so that it is only damp. You want to have as little water on the sponge as possible. Now, wipe all along the tiled area to clean off the excess grout. Do not press very hard or you will remove the grout between the tile. Rinse and wring your sponge frequently, keeping it as clean as you can. Get new, cleaner water as needed.

, Once you have grouted all of the tiled area, allow the grout to cure. You should follow the instructions for your specific product but generally three hours are needed to cure grout properly (as many as 24-48 hours may be needed, however). Make sure that the area is well ventilated and that moisture is kept to an absolute minimum.

, Once your grout has cured, you will want to seal your grout. This step is often skipped but you should not skip it if at all possible. Sealing your grout will be very important in keeping it from getting moldy or stained. Find an appropriate grout sealant at your local hardware store and apply it according to the included instructions.


Usually, the sealant will be wax-like and is applied using a rag. Rub it in circular motions along the grout lines to apply.
Grout will need to be resealed roughly every 6 months and should at least be resealed once a year.

, If you need to, you can apply caulk as needed around your new tiles. This may be useful at the corners and along the seams, such as if you have applied a short backsplash along a wall. Simply caulk the line, shape the caulk by running your finger down the line, and let it set.

Select the type of paneling you like best, as there are many wood options to choose among.,
Measure the room you would like to install paneling in, so you can calculate exactly how much you need to purchase.,
Purchase the wood paneling.,
Lay out the wood panels in the room you will be installing them in, and allow them to acclimate to the room temperature and humidity level for approximately 2 to 5 days.,
Position the first panel at the corner of the first wall, and use a second person to hold the wood.,
Remove the first panel from the wall, and shave the edge along your marked line with a saber saw.,
Ask your helper to assist you.,
Repeat the installation process with the next panel piece, and continue along the wall or walls until you have completed the room.

",How to Panel a Wall," You will need to decide whether you want to install wood sheeting or boards and in what size and wood type. You can research the various styles and colors online or at your local hardware supply store to help make your choice.;
, Use a tape measure, begin at 1 end of the first wall, and extend the measuring tape along the length of the wall until you reach the other side. Repeat this step on any other walls you wish to panel, and record the results so you can take them with you to the store.

, Most manufacturers offer guides that can calculate how much paneling to purchase. If you are unsure, ask a sales associate for help.

, This will prevent the wood from shrinking or expanding once installed.

, Use a level to make sure the paneling is plumb or even. Use a compass to mark the corner edge of the panel so you can cut it to fit tightly in to the corner, and make sure to draw the compass down the adjoining wall as you go. This will copy any wall unevenness on the panel board and make for a tighter fit.

, Use a fine-toothed blade to avoid fraying or shredding the wood.

, Replace the paneling flush against the wall, and nail it to the corner with wood-paneling nails. For best results, use a nail gun, but a hammer will also work. Place the nails in the dark groove surfaces to achieve the best look.

, Be sure to remove all the tacks and nails that stick out of the subflooring.

, If you have a cement floor, use a leveling compound to improve the surface. If you have a wood floor, secure loose boards so that they will not squeak.If your wood subfloor is thinner than one and one-fourth-inch (0.6-cm), install a second layer of five-eighths-inch (1.6-cm) plywood or cement board to ensure the slate has a stable foundation.
Screw these sheets into the subfloor every eight inches (20.3 cm).

, Paint an anti-fracture membrane onto cement subfloor. You can paint or roll it on., Write down the length and width of the tile.

,, You can find a construction calculator easily online.

, Ask how long shipment will take so that you can schedule a day to install it. In 2014, estimates for slate flooring for a 100 square foot (30.5 m) area were between $250 and $400.


Without labor, other materials and equipment rentals can result in a cost of $400 to $850 per 100 square foot room.You may want to order five percent more tile in case of breakage.

, If you want very fine grout line, you can place your tiles side by side.

, You will need a trowel with quarter-inch (0.6-cm) notches.

, Reorder tile before you start your project, so that you can ensure you have enough tile to complete the flooring.

, Some tiles are thicker than others and surrounding tiles will need to be built up with adhesive to ensure a flat surface.

, Since slate tiles can vary slightly in size, it is important to do a dry run with your tiles so you know where to adjust the surface level and position of your tiles.

, Draw an “x” through the room with chalk. When the lines cross they will create a 90-degree angle on which you can check for even spacing.

, Use tile spacers during the dry run to ensure you have even spacing.

, If you do, you will want to reposition your layout, so that cut tiles of even width can be laid at either end. This will result in a symmetrical floor.

, Measure the tile to account for a one-eighth-inch (0.3-cm) grout space along the wall. You can cut slate tile with a diamond-blade wet saw, grinder or hacksaw with an abrasive blade.

, Place a line of chalk on them during your dry run, so that you can make this important change when you lay your mortar.

, Start with the section farthest from the door.

, You can use slate tile adhesive or thinset (Portland cement) mortar mixed with acrylic. Mix it well and set it nearby.


Consider purchasing a mixing attachment to use with your power drill. It will mix the thinset more thoroughly than hand mixing.

,, Place a generous amount of mortar down within a section of your chalk line. Smooth it out with the smooth edge of the trowel until it covers the area.

, Always groove the thinset in the same direction.

Measure the area of the space you need to fill.,
Remove any old tiles or paneling you may have installed previously.,
Apply plywood to uneven or flaking walls.,
Cut your tin tiles according to your measurements.",How to Install a Tin Tile Backsplash1," Determine where you want to lay your tin tiles. Use a tape measure and get an accurate measurement of the space where your tin tiles will lay. Mark the space on your wall where your tiles will lay with blue painter's tape or a pencil. This measurement will also indicate how you will cut your tin.


Measure any spaces you may need to cut due to electrical outlets as well.;
, If you are installing tin tiles over existing tile, you may not have to remove the tile unless you want an entirely even wall. If you need to remove wall tiles, you need to remove the surrounding grout first, then use a tool like a chisel to dislodge the tile from the wall. The surface of your wall should be clear of dust and dirt. Try to make the wall as even and smooth as you can by sanding it.


If you have cracking paint, you need to sand off the cracking paint before proceeding., If you are working with an uneven wall or a wall that needs to be sanded, you can screw in a piece of plywood to the area as an alternative to sanding before installing your tin tiles. This will give you a flat surface to work on and will give your adhesive something to stick to. Measure a piece of plywood that will fit your space and attach it to the wall before placing your tiles.You can screw, nail, or glue your plywood to the wall.


If your wall is already a smooth and even surface you can skip this step.

, Draw lines on your tin tiles that correspond to the measurements that you took. These lines will help guide you when you make your cuts. Use a sharp metal cutting tool like tin snips or metal shears to cut through the tin. Consider overlap and make sure to remember to cut holes for electrical outlets or other things that need to be visible on the wall. When you've completed cutting, use sandpaper to dull down the sharp edges of your tin backdrop.


If you are cutting thicker metal tiles, you can use a utility knife to score a straight line to weaken the tile. Then work each side of the tile back and forth until it breaks on the perfect line.Wear thick leather gloves to protect you while using your cutting tool."
"
Decide on what kind of adhesive you want to use.,
Apply the adhesive to your cut out tiles.,
Press your tin tiles against the wall.,
Use nails to fasten your tin tile backdrop to the wall.,
Let the adhesive dry for 24 hours.",How to Install a Tin Tile Backsplash2," The material that your tin backsplash will lay on will help you determine what kind of adhesive to use. For instance, if applying it to drywall, using silicone adhesive is a great option.If you are applying it to tile, however, a resin based ceramic tile adhesive like epoxy may work best.Other options include superglue and double-sided adhesive tape.
Purchase adhesive at a hardware store or online.

, Apply the adhesive evenly across the back of the tiles that you want to place against the wall. Use a back and forth pattern. If you're using embossed tiles, make sure to spread enough adhesive to fill in the back of the tin, because tin tends to dent.If you are using adhesive tape, put a continuous strip on the top and bottom of your tin tiles., Once you've put the tin tile against the wall, press hard with both of your palms. Rub the surface of the tile with your hands and make sure that it's laying evenly on the wall.Make adjustments to your tile before the glue dries.
Using a level will also give you an additional level of precision when working with the tile.

, Use a nail gun or a hammer with nails and nail the backdrop into your wall or plywood.Use nails that match the color of your tin backdrop so that they blend in and aren't obvious. Put a nail in each corner of your backdrop. If you want to add extra stability, you can add extra nails in between your four nails on each side of the backdrop.


Make sure that the nail is flush with your tin backdrop, so it doesn't get snagged on someone's clothes.

, Let the glue dry completely before running a shower or touching it. It's important to tell people not to lean or touch the tiles while it sets. If you notice something is wrong with the tiles, make sure to adjust it before the glue begins to dry.

Mix your mortar with water per the instructions.,
Use a trowel to apply mortar to your wall.,
Apply your tin tiles to the wet mortar.,
Tap a wooden block over your tile with a hammer.,
Allow the tiles to dry for 24 hours.",How to Install a Tin Tile Backsplash3," You can purchase mortar mix at most hardware or home improvement stores. In a large disposable bucket or mixer, combine the mortar mix with water and stir it with a trowel until it reaches a thick but viscous consistency. Let the mortar settle for around 5 minutes before moving onto the next step.An 80-pound bag of mix requires around 5 US quarts (5,000 ml) of water on average.

, Dip your tool into the mortar mixture and apply a good layer of mortar over your wall. Use the trowel to even out the wall and make sure that it is a similar depth across your wall.

, Press your tin tile backdrop over the wet mortar. Hold it in place and make adjustments so that it is even. The tiles should line up with the lines you drew or the blue painter's tape that you laid down. Press down on the back of the tiles to make sure that they fit in place. Continue to do this across the wall while making adjustments to ensure that your tiles are even.

, Once all of your tin tile backdrop is laid you can ensure that it is all laying evenly by lightly tapping the back of the tile with a wooden block. If you are using an embossed piece of tin tile, skip this step because it can dent your tin tile backdrop.

, Allow your tin tile backdrop to dry and the mortar to set. Once it's dry, you can shine and clean the tiles with a damp sponge or rag.

Lay your tiles out on a flat surface.,
Prime the surface of your wall.,
Remove the white film and press tile against the wall.",How to Install a Tin Tile Backsplash4," Make an outline on a piece of butcher paper and arrange your tiles on a flat surface. This will allow you to visualize how they will lay on your wall. Some stick-on tiles will be smaller, brick-sized tiles while others will be sheets. If they are brick sized, stagger them when you line them up on your butcher paper.

, Dip a large flat brush into an oil based primer. The primer will prepare the surface of your wall so that the adhesive will stick to it better. If you don't prime the wall, you'll likely have to add additional adhesive to the back of your tiles to ensure that they stick for the long run., Remove the white film on the back of the stick-on tiles to reveal the adhesive. This adhesive is usually incredibly strong so be careful when laying them onto your wall. If you need to reposition them, make sure to do so before the adhesive fully sets.Removing the clear plastic film before placing the tiles makes it easier to remove.

Choose the accessories you need to install.,
Determine the best method for drilling holes required for mounting your accessory, and the best anchor to secure the device.

,
Use the supplied measurements or template to lay out the location for holes you will need to drill for your installation.,



 Drilling through porcelain ceramic tile with a glass bit.,

Keep the drill cool while drilling through the tile by dipping it into water frequently.,

Drill all of the holes needed, then tap an anchor into each hole, driving it flush to the surface.,



 Driving the screws will lock the anchors so they won't spin when installing your accessory.,

Hold the accessory in position and fit the screws through their mounting holes, then use a screwdriver or screw gun to tighten them.
,
Check the appearance of the mounted accessory to make sure it looks right, and that it is level/plumb.

,
Clean up dust and debris from the floor and wall.,
Remove protective films or coatings when you are satisfied that it looks good.

",How to Install Bathroom Accessories on Ceramic Tile," These will often include information such as their location, mounting height, and a template for drilling holes to anchor them.;
,, Make sure the layout is level and plumb, so the fixture will look pleasing when it is installed.

,

Drill the holes you need for mounting the device. Typical drive-in plastic anchors require a 1⁄4 or 5⁄16 inch (0.6 or 0.8 cm) hole, molly anchors, and other expansion anchors may require larger holes to allow them to expand properly., This will also decrease the amount of debris that may collect on the drill bit, allowing it to drill more efficiently., Be careful to strike the anchor cleanly with your hammer, since a miss may crack the tile. Hammering softly will decrease the chance the tile will be vibrated enough to crack the tile's joints.,

Pre-drive the screws into the anchors so they will be expanded and the anchor will hold securely without slipping when the accessory is mounted.
,,, Do this immediately, since this dust can stain surfaces if it becomes damp or wet before it is removed.

Install cement board first if you're dealing with just a subfloor.,
The cement in mortar and grout is a serious chemical and you need proper safety gear.,
Lay down some latex-modified thinset mortar onto the subfloor.,
Press down the cement board onto the subfloor and attach with cement board screws.,
Continue laying mortar and cement board onto the subfloor, staggering the end joints so that they don't line up.,
Cut the cement board with a jigsaw or a carbide-tipped scoring tool.,
Finish up by mudding and taping the joints of the cement board.,
If you need to, clean the existing floor thoroughly with a non-toxic floor cleaner.,
Decide where you want to start your tile.,
Find the center of the room by snapping a chalk line in the center of the room widthwise and lengthwise.,
Line up your boxes of tile and open each one.,
Lay down tile cement or thinset mortar where your first section of tile will be.,

Put a grout spacer at each corner of your tiles.,
Continue laying all but the tiles on the outer edges of your room.,
Allow the tile adhesive to dry overnight, then remove the grout spacers, if necessary.,
Mix your grout according to the directions on the package; usually grout is mixed with water in a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket.,
Use a masonry float to spread the grout into the spaces between the tiles, creating a smooth surface.,
Remove the excess grout you get on the tiles with a sponge.,
Seal the grout after it has set for 72 hours.",How to Install Floor Tile," While it's possible to lay tile directly on plywood subfloor, it's certainly not recommended. Plywood subfloor won't bond as surely with thinset as cement board will; neither will it provide as even and stable of a surface for the tile.


Cement board will probably be a bit more expensive and will add time to your project, but the investment is totally worth it. Tile done right requires a solid substrate.;
, Cement can cause first degree burns, eye injury from dust or wet cement getting into your eyes and also can sometimes cause lifelong chromium sensitization, so be safe EVERY time and wear alkali-resistant waterproof gloves, long sleeves and long pants (unlike the pictures in this article, which don't follow proper safety guidelines!) and waterproof or thick shoes. Wear goggles with side protectors and a ventilator at LEAST when pouring mortar to mix it, preferably throughout the project - remember, if mortar gets into your eyes, even once, you'll have to flush with water for 20 minutes and may need a trip to the hospital. Don't wash mortar off with normal soap (special pH neutral soap can be used). Make sure there's nowhere mortar can get inside and get trapped against your skin. Rinse any mortar that touches your skin off right away, and keep vinegar on hand to neutralize., If you're mixing mortar from scratch, add enough water to the dry mortar so that the final consistency resembles peanut butter. Then, let the mortar slake, or rest, for 10 minutes.Use a trowel with notches about the same size as the cement board thickness to lay down the mortar.


Lay only enough mortar that you can safely cover in about 10 minutes. This is the time it will take the mortar to start hardening.

, Starting in one corner, press the cement board down to the subfloor using your own weight. Drill the cement board screws into the board to fasten the board to the subfloor. Screw about every 8 inches (20.3 cm) around the edge of the board and every 10–12 inches (25.4–30.5 cm) in the center of the board.

, For added strength, make sure that the end joints don't form one continuous line. This means that you might need to lay one line of cement board starting on one side of the room, and then start the next line on the opposite side of the room.

, If you need to cut non-linear shapes out of your cement board, use a jigsaw and a carbide-tipped blade. If, however, you're only cutting straight lines out of the cement board, use a carbide-tipped scoring tool (it costs $10) and a straight edge., This process is almost exactly like mudding and taping drywall, except you're using mortar instead of compound and fiberglass mesh tape instead of joint tape.


Lay down a bit of mortar with your trowel, then press the fiberglass mesh tape into the joint. Then go over the mesh tape with your trowel, pressing it into the seams and locking it firmly in the mortar. Smooth out the resulting joints so that they don't bulge out, feathering the edges.

, You'll want to remove all glue, dirt and existing mortar before you start laying your new tile floor. The floor should be completely clean in order for maximum bonding between the tile and the thinset.


TSP, or trisodium phosphate, is a great all-purpose cleaner if you need to use it. It cleans extremely effectively, but is no longer as widely used today as it was before because of environmental concerns.

, Most people decide to lay tile from the center of the room outward, which is important if you're dealing with even-sized tiles. This method will create a nice effect in the center of the room, but tiles in the edges of the room will need to be cut. You may decide to start tiling from another spot in the room, especially if you're using irregular-sized tiles. You may choose to have uncut tiles on the sides of the room and work from there if cabinets, sofas, or other furniture is covering tiles on one side of the room. This article will assume that you want to start from the center of the room and work outward.


Make sure you do a dry layout with your tile and spacers directly on the cement board before you lay down the mortar. A dry layout will allow you to visualize the room as it might be when everything is finished. Experiment with different layouts until the right one catches your eye.

, Set up your chalk string in the center of each wall by measuring the wall and putting the string exactly in the middle. Leave the string in place after you snap it to use as a guide for your first few tiles.


Lay down some floor tiles along one of the center lines to make sure you marked the center of the room properly. If you realize that your chalk lines aren't square, redo them now.

, When you're laying the tile, alternate which box you're pulling from to account for any variation in color among the boxes. If you're making a design or pattern with the tile, put the tiles in order so you know which ones you need at any specific time.


If you end with a very small or very large space in comparison with the size of the tile you're using, move everything down so the extra space is about the width of a half a piece of tile and snap new chalk lines to use when placing the tiles. You don't want to have to cut your tile into small pieces to finish a row along the wall.

, Use the flat side of the trowel to key in the thinset, and then comb with the notched side of the trowel with even horizontal lines. The goal is to have a nice even application of cement or mortar for the tile to hold onto, and even horizontal lines grip the tile better than random curved lines. Only lay down as much mortar as you can work with in 10 minutes; otherwise it will begin to harden and become difficult to work with.


If you're using tile cement, give it about 15 minutes to become tacky so the tile will stick properly.
Use tile cement with linoleum and vinyl tiles, and thinset mortar with ceramic or porcelain tiles.

, Press each tile gently into the cement or mortar; you can also use a rubber mallet to do this after you complete each section.

, Butt each new tile up to these, taking care not to slide the tiles through the adhesive material. Wipe up the thinset that squishes up between the tiles.

, Then, measure the space between the last tile and the wall and mark the tiles you need to cut. Use a wet saw to make these cuts and install the cut tiles like you installed the others.


If you lay all the tile in the middle of the room first and then mark and cut your tile afterward, you only need to rent the wet saw for one day, saving you tile and money.
As you lay down smaller pieces of tile in the corners of rooms, back-butter the individual tiles instead of messily trying to get mortar into the small nooks and crannies of your room.

, Some can be left in place so check with the manufacturer to be sure.

, It should have a peanut butter-like consistency. Like the thinset mortar, it should slake for 10 minutes and then briefly be mixed again before application.

, Float your grout in several different directions to make sure you're working the grout into the grout lines effectively and evenly.


Work quickly here. The grout sets up fast — considerably faster than the mortar does. For this reason work only in small areas before branching out.

, Again, give yourself a small area to work on so that the grout doesn't set up before you have time to wipe it off the tiles. You can also use a damp cloth after this time to rub away any haze left over on the tile. Let the grout set for at least a few hours.

, Use a grout sealer with an applicator brush and take care not to get any on the tile itself.

Determine the maximum practical thickness that is possible for the combination of tile, underlayment and setting materials in your project.,

Complete the installation.",How to Install Ceramic Tile on Sub Floor," It is necessary to consider adjoining floors (e.g. carpet or wood), height of toe kicks (beneath cabinets) and even the aesthetics of the base molding where the walls meet the floor.

Example:     An adjoining wood floor may have 5/8 inch thick material (~16mm). If you use 1/2 inch underlayment and 3/8 inch tile with 1/8 inch of setting material, your tile floor will have a total of 1 inch (~26mm) of thickness. This means that your finished floor will be 3/8 inch (10mm) taller that the adjoining wood floor. Transition strips may be available to accommodate this height difference, but you may be able to compensate with your underlayment by choosing 1/4 inch thick cement board instead.;
, If you can feel the subfloor flex as you walk or bounce on it then you will need to use a thicker cement board. If it flexes too much you may want to consult a professional. Assuming the subfloor is relatively stable you may use a 1/4 thick cement board safely. If there is some flexing then you will need 1/2 inch concrete board., To cut the board you can either use the side grinder with diamond blade, or you can score and break the material. The tile department personnel can show you the available scoring knives. Your joints between sheets should not exceed 1/8 inch. It is also advisable to install the sheets perpendicular to the direction of the subfloor. This adds additional strength and stability., Mix your thinset according to the instructions on the bag. Lift one sheet (leave the rest in place) and spread thinset directly onto the subfloor filling the area left by the sheet (use a 1/4"" x 1/4"" notch trowel). Once you have filled the space place the sheet down onto the thinset. Secure the cement board with the screws using the pattern directed by the board manufacturer. Repeat with the remaining sheets of cement board until finished., You will use the flat trowel to apply a thin layer according to the manufacturers specifications. (e.g. 6-18"" width across the joint). This will distributed the stress caused by movement of the subfloor and prevent cracking in your tile. If greater protection is desired you can cover the entire floor with the membrane. Let dry for 24 hours., The remaining steps are identical to installing tile on a concrete slab, less one tip: Use a damp sponge to wipe the cement board prior to applying thinset. This will keep the cement board from drying the thinset too fast and allow proper adhesion to the tile."

Check that the siding is in good condition before considering painting.,
Check for defects.,
Brush down the siding first.,

Apply a primer to the sidings.,
Apply an acrylic finishing coat.,
Place tarpaulins, old sheets or other covers underneath your work areas.,
Apply the paint.,
Work your way around the house in sections.,
Check your work afterward.",How to Paint Vinyl Siding," Painting over sidings that have existing defects simply delays future work to remedy the problems. Moreover, painting over defects will worsen the problem if the sidings actually need to be replaced or mended first. Fix the problems first, to avoid wasting time and money.;
, Some of the typical things to note and deal with include:


Look for any loose, lifting or missing parts of the siding. Use this check to re-fix or repair the problems.
Check the positioning of nail heads and fixings. Each of these items should be flush to the sidings. If they are not, either remove and reposition or replace them with new ones.
Remove any rotted parts of the siding or anything that could impact the siding.
If there is any excess moisture under the siding, it needs to be treated promptly, as it will only get worse and can encourage the growth of mold or mildew or buckling of the siding.
As well as checking underneath the siding, check the surfaces. Treat appropriately to remove and prevent further regrowth of the mold or mildew.

, Use a soft outdoor brush or broom with a long handle and a smaller one for corners and difficult areas. Run the brush or broom over the siding to collect spiderwebs, insect remains, dead leaves, etc. Regularly clean off the broom so that you don't inadvertently scratch the siding surface when reapplying it in a new area.

, Use a mixture of water and standard washing detergent to remove all the grease and grime. If you add chlorine bleach to this mixture, it will also remove any mold and mildew that might be growing on the surface of the sidings.


While it is possible to use a power washer to clean the sidings, be aware that the intensity of the pressure can cause the sidings to lift up, especially if you are not careful around the edges or wherever there are sidings placed at unusual angles. Moreover, the pressure risks pushing water up behind the siding, seeping into the wood and other material behind the sidings, which can encourage mildew growth or rotting. Your best bet is to wash by hand, using sponges and rags, with the mixture suggested. Although this takes longer, it's a more thorough and gentler clean and won't result in damage to the siding or the walls.

, Once one section of the siding is clean, rinse off the residue from the cleaning agents before moving to a new section. Before painting, allow plenty of drying time, so that the surface is suitable for painting.

, When painting an aluminum or vinyl siding, primer must be used to ensure that the paint sticks to the surface. Use an acrylic bonding primer. This will ensure that the finishing coat stays on properly, and even better, it will help the paintwork to last for longer. The last thing you want is for your paint to start peeling after a few months and having to start again. Apply that primer!

, Choose the best quality you can afford; your house is your showcase after all. When choosing the paint, you'll find that you have an array of finishes to choose from; however, be aware that high gloss finishes can reflect too much sun. For the best effect, an eggshell finish is recommended. Eggshell finishes still contain some gloss, but in much reduced amounts and therefore won't reflect the sun as much as the high gloss finish. As an added bonus, this surface tends to be easier to keep clean.


Take care when choosing the color for your vinyl sidings. Some of the darker colors can cause sidings to warp. The best approach is to talk to the retailer first, to get an idea of which paints are preferable. You should find that light colors are generally fine for vinyl sidings. The color of the paint is usually not a problem for aluminum sidings, so choose any color you want.

, Paint will end up splashing on the ground surface, making more work for you if it spoils other surfaces. Cover all things that you don't want painted and that cannot be moved, such as downpipes, gate posts, taps/faucets, etc. Use old sheets or rags and rubber bands or twine to cover these items.


It is best to transfer small amounts of paint to a separate small container, such as a plastic honey or yogurt pot, (or the rolling pad if rolling), and using that to hold and work from. This makes for ease of use and prevents the paint from drying out as you work with it.
Be aware at all times where the paint pot is. Always replace the lid tightly after dipping in your brush; spills are expensive and messy, and it's no fun putting your foot into the pot either.

, There are three possible methods for applying the paint: Spray-painting, brushes, or rollers. While the method chosen depends on your painting skill and personal preference, spraying is best left to somebody with experience. If this is your first time, you'll find it easier to work with either a brush or a roller. Even here, you need to make a choice between the faster and easier height application of the roller or the more time-consuming yet neater finish of the brush.


It is recommended that your avoid sponge rollers and use a lamb’s wool roller. These last longer and have a neater finish; they also tend to hold less gunk on them.
A short roller will be needed as well as a long one; the short one is easier for fitting into the siding folds. Indeed, even if you're brushing most of the time, a small roller helps with tight corners.
Brushes tend to give a better finish. They're also easy to use and you'll find that you improve quickly with the repeated practice. It's recommended that you choose a synthetic bristle for acrylic paint. In terms of size, a wider, larger brush will cover more ground than a smaller one but keep a small one handy for the tight corners and fussy bits.
Have plenty of rags with you, for spills and drip clean-ups.

, Allow each section layer to dry, then reapply another layer. Two layers is usually sufficient but you'll need to judge that with your own eye, depending on your location, climate, the paint used and its final color when dried.


If using a brush, always smooth in the last brush strokes with the new lot of brush strokes and fresh paint.
Painting from top to bottom is the best approach. That way, you can fix drips that occur as you move down, rather than ruining already painted surfaces.
Keep brushes and rollers clean by washing after each use, without fail. Follow the suggested washing method offered by the paint manufacturer.

, There will always be some areas that need a touch-up. Also remember to check areas you ""left for later"" because they were awkward, such as siding behind piping, lamps, plants or taps.

Measure the total area of the walls to be insulated.,
Choose fiberglass insulation batting.,
Consider “greener” alternatives.,
Get other tools necessary to complete the job.,
Cut batts to the appropriate height.,
Push each batt into the gap between each stud.,
Secure the lip of the batting to each stud.,
Apply vapor-retardant poly film over batting for exterior walls.",How to Insulate Walls1," Before you buy fiberglass insulation batting, you need to find out how much you'll need. To do this, you'll need to take measurements of the total area of the individual walls to be insulated, and also the width of the space between the studs. Count up the number of wall gaps you have that need insulation and buy insulation batts accordingly.


For the most part, studs will be built at uniform spacing, and batting is manufactured to fill those gaps. It should be the perfect width. Still, it's a good idea to count up the number of spaces you have and take a measurement to make sure you don't come home with the wrong size.;
, The grade of batting will vary, depending on the wall that you’re insulating. There are various grades of insulating batting for different locations in the house, so you'll need a different insulation for interior, exterior, attic or basement walls.


The R-value of the batt measures the thermal resistance, so the higher the R-value, the more effectively the batt insulates. Typically, for interior walls, R-13 batts are used for 2 x 4 studs and R-19 batts are used for 2 x 6 studs.

Note their are two R-value scales; US customary and metric. The US scale is approximately 5.68 times the metric scale, so R-13 in the US is equivalent to R-2.3 elsewhere.


You'll also need to choose between faced batts, which have a paper ""face"" on one side that will cover the insulation to the outside, and un-faced batts, which are just the fiberglass.

, While fiberglass is actually up to 40 percent recycled material, there’s still a common complaint about the health-risks regarding airborne fibers of spun glass in your living space. Fiberglass is safe and the most inexpensive form of insulation, but it’s certainly not the only kind.You might consider alternatives, like:


Cotton. Recycled denim is regularly turned into a kind of insulation that's quite effective, and without the microfiber air problems that some people complain about with fiberglass.
Mineral and sheep wool, cementitious, and cellulose-based insulation's are also common alternatives to fiberglass.
You need to only use materials that have a thermal resistance rating. Insulating with things like egg crates and other recycled materials is a dangerous practice that can result in a fire.

, To install fiberglass or other insulating strips into your walls, you'll just need a few basic tools and the proper safety equipment. Make sure you've got:


A staple gun
Utility knife
Protective gear (gloves, mask, long sleeves and pants)

, You should have purchased insulation of the appropriate width, but you'll have to cut it to size for every space you want to fill, in terms of height. Lay the insulation out, then carefully use your utility knife to cut through the face (if you've purchased faced insulation). It's kind of hard to cut through the insulation itself, which has the consistency of tenacious cotton candy, but you can pull it apart once you get it started.


When you get your insulation home, keep it wrapped up until you're ready to use it. Cutting fiberglass insulation sends lots of little fiberglass particulate up into the air, which can cause allergic reactions and breathing problems. It's also extremely itchy, and can cause rashes in some people with sensitive skin. Never touch fiberglass batting with your bare hands and always wear breathing equipment when handling it.
If you come into contact with fiberglass insulation, don’t scrub your hands or face with water, which can cause micro-abrasions. Dust yourself off outside and wash your clothes immediately.

, When you get it cut, just shove it in to the space, with the face pointing back outward, if you're using it. Try to handle it by the edges as much as possible, to keep the floating particles down. Gently tug each batt outward so it fills the gap entirely.

, Use your staple gun to secure the paper lining to the stud, roughly every 7 inches (17.8 cm). It's helpful to have an assistant hold the insulation in place, if necessary. Staple each piece securely, then move on to the next row.


If you're looking for sound-dampening, it's a good idea to apply a thin line of caulk between the top plates, at the bottom plate, and around the floor of each batt. This will create a more secure seal that will keep sound from coming through.

, To make external walls extremely insulated, it's common to apply a layer of vapor-retardant film over the insulation, to make it more secure. This will help to maximize the insulating potential of the batting, and you can find this at most home retailers.


To install, you'll simply pull the film tight over the batting, stapling to the studs every foot or so, with the staple gun. Trim the excess with the utility knife.

It is also a favorite for homeowners who don't want the hassle of repainting the outside of their house periodically.


Before you decide to install vinyl siding on your own home, visit some vinyl sided houses and inspect them thoroughly to make sure you like what you see.
Ask a local realtor about how installing vinyl siding on your home might affect the value of the house -- although it will have a positive effect in most places, if your house is the only one with vinyl siding in a neighborhood of restored Victorian homes, it could bring the value down.
Decide what type of vinyl you want -- vinyl siding comes in textured or smooth, high gloss or low gloss finishes. It also comes in a wide array of colors, some with grain-like patterns which closely resemble real wood.;
, Although installing vinyl siding by yourself might save you a lot of money, you should definitely consider hiring a contractor if you've never installed vinyl siding before.


Installing vinyl siding is an involved process which requires a lot of time and skill. In fact, the quality of the installation can have a huge effect the finished result and even determine how long the siding lasts. Even the highest quality siding will buckle and warp if not installed correctly.
If you choose to get a contractor, gather a list of names in your local area and request a price estimate from each of them. Also take the time to inspect some of their previous work and talk to previous clients to make sure they are satisfied with the work done.

, If you decide to go ahead and complete the project yourself, you will need quite an extensive array of tools and materials. Use the following list as a guideline.


In terms of tools, you will need: a folding ruler, a metal square, a claw hammer, a snap-lock punch, tin snips, a power saw, a chalk line, a measuring tape, a level, a utility knife, a pliers, a nail slot punch, a carpenter's saw, a hacksaw, a stepladder, sawhorses and a pry bar.
In terms of materials, you will need: lengths of J-channel, flashing, building paper, corrosion-resistant nails and enough vinyl siding to cover your home. You will also need vinyl corners and trim for windows and doors, as well as a termination trim for where you meet other surfaces such as soffits and masonry work.

, Before you begin, you will need to properly prepare the outside of your home for the siding installation.


One of the major issues with vinyl siding is that it masks moisture problems and other structural defects. Therefore it's important to fix any existing issues before you install the siding. Tighten any loose boards and replace any rotting ones. Scrape away any old caulk from around doors and windows.
Clear your work area by removing any fixtures such as exterior lights, down-spouts, moulding, mailboxes and house numbering. Also tie back any plants, trees or flowers from the exterior of the house to give you more room and prevent them from becoming damaged.

, 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) plywood or OSB are common substrates, and these are generally covered with roofing felt or another moisture barrier prior to siding the walls.

, When installing vinyl siding, there are a number of important rules to follow with regards to fitting and nailing.


Vinyl siding expands and contracts with temperature changes, therefore it is important to allow extra room for expansion in order to prevent the siding from buckling. Leave an extra 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) gap between siding panels and any accessories.
You should also refrain from driving the nails too tightly, restricting the movement of the panels.You should leave about 1⁄16 inch (0.2 cm) between the nail head and the siding, to allow for movement and prevent waves from forming in the panels.
In addition, you need to center each nail in the appropriate slot, making sure to drive the nails in straight rather than crooked. You should never face nail (drive nails through the panels) when installing siding, as this may cause the panels to buckle.

, Install lengths of J-channel along the inner edge of the fascia. The J-channel will conceal the cut edges of the soffit lengths and will provide a watertight seal.


Your nails should be centered in the channel slots and the nail heads should remain 1/32-to-1/16 inches (0.7938-to-1.6 mm) out.
Boxed-type soffits will need a second J Channel strip, running from the fascia to the edge of the house.

, If the soffit on your house wraps around a corner, you will need to make provisions for the change of direction.


You can do this by installing two J-channels diagonally where the corners of the roof and house meet.
You will have to cut a number of soffit and vent pieces at an angle to accommodate the diagonal pieces of J-channel.

, Vinyl siding usually comes in 12-foot (3.66-meter) lengths. Therefore, you will need to cut these long pieces of siding to fit the measurements of your soffit.


Keep in mind that the soffit pieces should measure 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) shorter than the actual length of the soffit.
This 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) gap allows for the expansion of vinyl siding in warm weather.

, Once the J-channel is installed and the soffit pieces are cut, you will be able install them.


You can do this by pressing the soffit pieces into the channel, bending them to fit if necessary (vinyl siding is quite flexible).
If you're having difficulty just pressing them in, you may need to pull the channel lip back with a pry bar or locking tool to get the siding panels to fit .

, Once the soffit pieces are installed, remove the gutter/downspout and slide the lengths of fascia siding under the gutter apron.


Secure the top edge of the fascia pieces with galvanized or painted nails placed every couple of feet.
Reattach the gutters.

, Measure the length of the walls from the eaves to the bottom of any existing siding. This will help you to figure out how many panels of siding you'll need per wall.


Divide the length of each wall by 8 inches (the width of a piece of siding). If the result is a whole number, you're in luck: you'll be able to install the pieces of siding without leaving any gaps or needing to cut any pieces to size.
But if the result is not a whole number, you will need to cut the final piece of siding (lengthwise) in order to fill in the remaining space.
If you have to cut the last row of siding, you'll need to use a length of J-channel on the top edge of the siding (instead of utility trim).
You will also need to nail a strip of 1/2-inch (12.7-mm) plywood, 3 inches (76.2 mm) wide to the channel to support it.

, Once you've decided where you want the siding to begin, drive a nail through a point on your chosen starting height and snap a chalk line around the perimeter of the house.


Nail a piece of plywood about 3.5 inches (89 mm) thick along the top of the chalk line -- this will hold out the bottom of the first row of siding.
Attach the starter strip to the plywood, but don't nail it so tightly that it will restrict the strip's movement.
Remember to leave 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) between each starter strip to allow room for expansion.

, Install 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) foam sheathing strips on both sides of each corner, then install your corner siding pieces to these strips.


The corner posts should run from 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) below the bottom of the starter strip to just beneath the eaves, after the soffit pieces have been installed.
Make sure the corner siding pieces are completely straight before you secure them. Once you're satisfied, nail them to the adjoining walls, working from top to bottom.

, The next step is to install J-channel around all four sides of exterior doors and windows.


Place the J-channel snugly against the casing and nail it to the wall -- remembering not to nail too tightly, to allow for movement.

, Apply any necessary insulation materials to the walls before you begin to install the siding.


Measure and cut the lengths of siding, so that each panel ends 1/4 inch (12.7 mm) shy of the vertical trim pieces, to allow for expansion. If you are installing the siding in freezing conditions, you should leave 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) instead.
Slide the bottom row of panels into place, making sure to hook the bottom lip of each panel under the starting strip. Secure the panels with a nail every 16 inches (40.6 cm) or so -- remembering to center the nail in slot and leave 1/16 of the nail head above the vinyl siding, to allow for movement and expansion.

, When joining two lengths of siding together, overlap them by about 1 inch (25.40 mm).


When deciding which side to overlap on, choose the side that will be least obvious from the front or most used area of your house.
For example, if your driveway is located to the right of your house, then a right over left overlap will be least noticeable.

, When you get to a window, you will need to cut sections from the panels directly above and below it to fit.


Measure the width of the piece you need to cut by holding the length of siding against the window and marking the edge points on the panel with a pencil. Leave on extra 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of clearance on either side of these marks.
Measure the height of the piece you need to cut by butting a scrap piece of siding beneath (and above) the window and marking the necessary height, leaving an additional 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of clearance. Transfer this measurement onto the piece of siding.
Make the vertical cuts on the siding panel with a saw and make the horizontal cut with a utility knife, then snap out the piece.
Install the cut pieces of siding above and below the windows, as normal.

, When you reach the top row of siding, you will need to measure and cut it to fit.


To determine how much you will need to cut from the top of the panel, measure the distance between the top of the under-sill trim and the lock on the next panel down, then subtract 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).
When you cut the top siding panel to the appropriate height you will be removing the nailing strip. Use a snap-lock punch tool to punch the top edge of the panel along 6 inch (15.2 cm) intervals, making sure the raised material is on the outside.
Slot the bottom edge of the panel into the panel below and slide the top edge under the under-sill trim. The raised slots you made with the snap-lock punch will catch onto the trim and hold the top siding panel firmly in place -- so there is no need to face nail it to secure.

Allow the paint to dry.",How to Paint an Interior Wall," Before you start painting, you will need to cover your floor with a painter's canvas. Move and/or cover any furniture or other valuables in the room using painter's plastic. You can move your furniture to the center of the room and place a tarp or canvas cloth under the wall that you will be painting.


Place your painting materials on the tarp and keep them there at all times. Do not put brushes, paint buckets, or paint trays on your bare floors or on other bare surfaces.;
, Painting in a straight line can be difficult, so if this is your first time painting, then you will probably need to apply blue painter’s tape to the edges of your walls and any molding or fixtures. Apply the painter’s tape so that it is even with the edges of the walls, molding, and fixtures.









Keep in mind that you do not need to press hard on the tape when you apply it. Using a bit of gentle pressure will be enough to keep it in place.

, Before you use your primer or paint, take a moment to mix them well with a mixing stick. This will help to ensure that the pigments in the primer and paint are evenly distributed.


Never shake your paint cans. This can cause dry paint chips from the lid to mix into the paint. Always stir it with a mixing stick.

, A smooth even surface will make it easier to achieve professional quality results, so take the time to check your wall for imperfections and fix them up before you get started.For example, you can.



Patch cracks or holes using patching compound for plaster walls and joint compound for drywall surfaces. Spackle works well for both. Apply the compound with a putty knife and allow it to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Sand patched and/or rough surfaces smooth using 220-grit sandpaper. Vacuum or wipe away dust when you are done.

, Do not overfill the tray to the point that the angled part of the tray with ridges is covered with primer. You will only need an inch or two or primer in the tray.You can use a cheap tray liner to line the tray so that you do not need to use multiple trays.
Be sure to pour the primer into your tray over the tarp or you may drip primer onto your floors.
You only need to apply primer on walls made out of fresh drywall or bare wood. Keep in mind that primer will take up to a day to dry before you can paint.

, Dip your paintbrush in the primer bucket and then begin painting a straight line along the outer edge of one side of your wall. Paint along the edges in small sections and go slowly.








Try to make the line as straight and even as possible. You may need to go over the line a couple of times to ensure that the primer is even.
Using your paintbrush, try to cover about three to four inches of the outer edge of the wall with primer. This will make it easier to cover the rest of the wall with primer.
You will need a stepladder to reach the edges along the top parts of your wall. Make sure that the step ladder is sturdy and consider asking someone to spot you.

, Place the paint roller into the primer and roll the roller back and forth a few times. The roller should be coated evenly with a thick layer of primer, but not dripping primer when you pick it up.








Consider using a roller with an extension rather than a step ladder for this part. A roller with an extension is safer and it will also make your job a bit easier., When you are ready to begin covering the wall with primer, take your roller and apply primer in a large “W” shape. Then, begin using smooth up and down motions to filling the area around the “W.” Keep painting until the area is completely and evenly covered with primer.








Repeat the process on another section. Keep applying your primer in a “W” shape and filling in the areas around the “W” shapes until you have applied primer to the entire wall or room. Work on one portion of the wall at a time to ensure the best coverage.
Do not apply too much pressure when you apply the primer. Pressing hard on the roller may result in primer running down your wall and this can leave lines.

, Before you start to apply your paint, you will need to let the primer dry completely. Leaving it to dry for about one day is a safe amount of time. However, if the primer still seems wet after one day, give it another day.







, When you are ready to begin painting the walls, change your tray liner in the tray or get a new tray. Then, pour about one to two inches of paint into your tray.


Use your paintbrush to wipe off any excess paint that runs down the sides and into the rim of the paint bucket.

, When you are ready to begin painting, dip your paintbrush into the paint. It should be well-coated in paint, but not dripping. When you are ready, start painting along the edges of your walls and fixtures. Try to create straight even lines.








Keep in mind that you may need to go over the paint a few times to ensure that it is even. Take your time and do one small area at a time.
Remember that you can always apply painter’s tape to the fixtures and edges if you are worried about not being able to paint in a straight line.
Continue to line the edges and fixtures until they are all covered in an even layer of paint.

, When you have finished painting around the edges and fixtures, you can start to fill in the center of your walls. Start by dipping your roller in the paint and covering the wall by making up and down motions, making sure to overlap the painted edges. Your roller should be covered in an even layer of paint, but it should not be dripping with paint.Do not lift the roller until you finish covering the area.

, The paint will need at least one day to dry, so leave it be. Do not try to replace pictures, furniture, or other items until the paint is totally dry. You may also want to block entrance to the room to ensure that no small children or pets can come into the room and touch the walls.








Most walls will need two coats of paint, and some darker colors may need three. Wait until the first coat is dry before applying the second coat.
If the room is not well ventilated, then placing a fan in the room and cracking a window will help to keep the air circulating and help the paint to dry faster.

",How to Install Sill Plates," If the framing for the building will be 2x6, allowing fewer members and deeper insulation, you will need a 2x6 sill plate. Since sill plates have an indoor application, 'pressure treated' wood is not necessary. For almost half the cost you can get a termite-treated board called 'borate'. It's apple-green, but will eventually weather to gray.;
, The sun will warp and twist your boards all over the place - especially something as wet as borate.

,,, Typically, sill plates are laid flush with the outside edge of the stem wall or slab. This is so water will not collect on an exposed lip of concrete and migrates into the dwelling. However, if it seems counterintuitive to you to put the full weight of the building on the outside of the stem wall, rather than the center of it, just make sure the sheathing and siding that goes on above will fully overlap the foundation.

, Marker is better than pen, because it's awkward to draw around the bolt at this angle, and a marker will give you a nice line to follow.

, Go a little bigger with the holes. If the bolts are 1/2"", drill a 5/8"" hole. This will make it far easier to get the board down over the bolts. Washers beneath the nuts will cover any gaps.

, This is a strip of foam that goes down beneath the sill plate. It makes a better seal and provides insulation, and further protects the board. The foam is cut to fit and pressed down over the bolts. 'Seam sealer' is inexpensive - a 50' roll will be around $4 - $5.

, As long as you left exposed at least 2 1/2"" of J bolt above the block, or your boards happen to be perfectly flat, the bolts should stick up beyond the sill plate enough to get the washer and nut on. However, if your boards are warped, you're going to have to weigh down the board on either side of the bolt.

, A flathead screwdriver will do the job.

, Since treated wood is wet, don't over tighten. It's easy to start grinding down into the board. Tighten it so it's hard to screw down any further, but it's not driving down into the wood.

Prepare the surface.,
Apply a moisture vapor barrier if you're doing an exterior application.,
Create a barrier of 18-gauge metal lath after you've placed your water vapor barrier.,
Create a scratch coat with mortar.,
Before the scratch coat dries, scrape horizontal grooves into the scratch coat.,
Mix the mortar, following the same ratio you used for the scratch coat.,
Determine the layout of the stones.,
Use a chipping hammer, trowel edge, or other blunt tool, to trim the stones to shape.,
Wash the stones until they are completely free of any dirt, sand or other loose particles.,
Dry the stones to assure that the surfaces of the stones are damp.If necessary, use a masonry brush to lightly moisten the stone, but do not saturate it.,
Backbutter the mortar onto the stone pieces one by one.,
Start installing the stones, beginning in the bottom corners.,
Continue backbuttering and laying stone until the entire wall is finished.,
When finished placing all the stones, fill the joints with a grout bag.,
Clean away any excess particles with plain water and a whisk broom.,
Apply a sealer, following the manufacturer's instructions.",How to Install Stone Veneer," Stone veneer can be applied to any masonry surface such as concrete, existing brick, or foundation cinder block. If you're working with wood or any other non-masonry surface, you can create an appropriate surface by surrounding the non-masonry surface with a water barrier.;
, Moisture vapor barriers usually come with a self-sealing membrane. Peel back the outer layer to expose the sticky backside of the membrane and simply stick it onto your surface.


Be careful about only applying the membrane where you want it. The membrane's unpeeled surface is extremely sticky; if it accidentally sticks somewhere it shouldn't, you're going to have a hell of a time trying to get it off.
If you're working inside, you shouldn't need to set down a water vapor barrier, unless you're adding stone veneer to a wood surface, like plywood.

, Use 1 1/2 to 2 inch (3.81 cm to 5.08 cm) nails, and space them out at 6 inch (15.24 cm) intervals.

, You can make mortar by mixing 2 or 3 parts washed sand with 1 part cement and adding water, according to the manufacturer's instructions. With a trowel, cover the entire surface of the lath with this mixture, about 1/2 to 3/4 inches (1.27 cm to 1.905 cm) thick. The lath should not stick out from the scratch coat.


Directions for mixing mortar will vary. Follow manufacturer's directions, but most of all, be consistent with whatever recipe you choose. If you decide to use 2:1 sand to cement, stick with 2:1 each time you use mortar elsewhere.

, Use a metal scraper or a scrap piece of the lath material. Allow the scratch coat to set up, or cure, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Now, you are ready to apply your stone veneer.

, Mix for a minimum of 5 minutes, until you've achieved the consistency of mashed potatoes. Too wet and your mortar will lose strength. Too dry and your mortar will seize up too quickly.

, It's helpful to do a dry run and think about the layout of the stones as they will appear on the wall. Spending a little extra time configuring their placement now will save you the headache of excessive trimming later.


If it's helpful, do the dry run on the ground instead of trying to hold the stones up against the wall. The basic arrangement of the stones should transfer.

, The stones themselves should be fairly easy to shape. You will be able to hide the trimmed edges later, using grout, so don't worry if the edges aren't perfectly rounded.

, The grout adheres much better to completely clean surfaces.

, This will prevent the stones from drawing moisture away from the mortar, which will allow it to set up with a naturally stronger bond.

, Try to keep the backbuttered mortar about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) thick. If you happen to get any mortar on the face of the stone, wipe it away with a damp towel before it dries.

, Turn any trimmed edges either directly up or down, away from the focal point. Press the stones into the mortar, twisting them slightly to squeeze out some of the excess and strengthen the bond. Use a trowel, joint tool, or brush to remove any excess mortar that has been forced beyond the finished joint, or onto the surface of the stone itself.Keep the joints consistent to achieve the most appealing result. You probably want your joints to be between 1 and 3 inches (2.5 and 7.5 cm) long.

, Take period breaks; step back and prospect your work every so often. If you are installing veneer across more than one face of a wall, consider getting cornerstone pieces. Most stone veneer manufacturers make them, and they add an easy naturalness to the project.

, Best results come from using a grout bag. During this step, conceal any trimmed edges. Use a striking tool to get the joints to the desired depth as the mortar stiffens.

, Be sure to remove any stray mortar from the face of the stone within 30 minutes — mortar will be impossible to remove after 24 hours.


Use a paint brush to clean up the mortared joints before the mortar sets completely.Do this especially if working inside, as inside stone wants a more polished look.

, Sealed stone will be easier to clean and maintain, and some sealers will repel stains. Reapply the sealer periodically to maximize the advantages. be advised some sealers will change the color of the stone or create a ""wet"" glossy look.

Nail the molding in place.",How to Install New Baseboard,"


Pry off the old baseboard carefully with a small pry bar so you can use it to mark and cut the new molding.






Protect the wall as you pry off old molding so it won’t be damaged. Use a piece of scrap wood between the wall and the pry bar.






You may be able to cut off damaged areas of molding and re-use part of the old molding.






Remove any nails that pull through the old molding and are left in the wall.





;
,


Using the old molding to make a template for corner cuts and cuts around outlets or other obstructions is ideal.






Make a template out of stiff paper or cardboard for difficult cuts if there is no old molding.






Molding pieces should end at a wall stud. Try to cut pieces so that you join two pieces at a wall stud.






Allow for the depth of both pieces of the molding when butting two pieces together at a corner.






If you have a miter box you can miter the corners (cut at an angle) so they fit together neatly.






Make sure cuts where molding will meet another piece in a line are perfectly straight to avoid gaps between pieces.







,


Make sure any flooring and wall coverings such as wallpaper or paneling are in place and any painting is done before installing the molding.






Work with one wall at a time. Start at one corner and fit all the pieces in place. Mark the backs of molding pieces if there are several for that wall in the order they will be installed.






While you are fitting the molding, look for studs to nail it into and lightly mark them in the area just above where the molding will sit.






The molding should sit right on top of the flooring.

Make sure you have a suitable space for spray foam.,
Get a low-pressure sprayer.,
Choose between open and closed-cell insulation spray.,
Prepare the area for insulation.,
Apply the spray from about two feet away.,
Fire-sheath spray-insulated walls.",How to Insulate Walls2," If you want to insulate an area in your crawl space, attic, or basement, spray foam insulation might be appropriate for the job, using a low-pressure sprayer and the proper safety equipment.


For the most part, roofs and other major renovation jobs require a lot of spray foam to insulate, meaning that it would probably be more cost effective to hire professional insulators with a spray rig, high-pressure applicators, and safety gear.
Use spray cans of insulation for small jobs, like gaps between windows and doors, around dryer vents, fan outlets, and other plumbing. Spray cans are good for fixing small leaks, but not cost effective for insulating a wall.

, Generally, disposable and refillable spray insulation tanks are sold as part of a spray foam insulation kit. It's not cheap, but you'll be able to quickly and easily insulate a small area. Each manufacturer will vary slightly in its


You'll also need protective equipment. This means you'll need eye protection and a respirator. A full work suit would be ideal, but long sleeves and pants will also do in a pinch.

, Closed-cell insulation is rigid and dense, with a higher R-Value than open-cell. Most closed-cell spray is rated around 6.6, with open-cell insulation rated around 3.9. The advantage of open-cell is that it's super-fast and cheap, included in most individual small spray cans of foam.


In wall-insulation, small holes are usually made in the drywall, into which the sprayer nozzle is inserted to fill the cavity with the spray inside the wall. For this method, open-cell is most often used, especially for ceilings and interior walls. It's sound-proof and used in the same locations as fiberglass. Closed-cell is usually used on external walls.

, Remove exposed nails, debris, and other impediments from the walls to be insulated. Identify drafting areas–seams where you feel air leaking, see daylight, or see a gap. Mark these areas with tape, or a pen to make sure you address them with the insulation.


It's a good idea to cover nearby furniture or finished flooring with plastic tarp to avoid getting any of the insulation on it. It's difficult to get out.
It's best to apply spray insulation when the temperature is between 60 and 80 degrees F.

, Attach your sprayer to the canister or bucket of insulation and start spraying, as if you were washing a window or car. Don't get too close, but stand a few feet back and spray as evenly as you can, back and forth across the area to be insulated. If you're spraying inside a wall, count to three, then stop and examine your progress to make sure that you aren't over-filling the wall.


Insulation needs to be kept in a layer no deeper than an inch. Over-applying foam insulation can stress the walls and can also clump up and fall off the surface.
If you miss, or get insulation somewhere you don't want it, don't panic. Stop and allow the insulation to dry and scrape it off the surface with a putty knife later. Trying to smear it now will make it worse.
If you need to add multiple layers, because you're spraying an external wall or want extra sound-proofing, wait until the first layer has dried before going back over it as you did before. This will build up the R-Value of the insulation accordingly, and should stick perfectly well.

, Spray foam is not a finished surface and will ignite quickly in the event of a fire. After applying, it's common to drywall over the insulated area to finish the job.

, As you knock through the drywall, pull the drywall off of the studs.

, Cut through the studs with a reciprocating saw to remove them. A reciprocating saw is a portable power saw with a blade that moves up and down very fast to cut through the wood studs.

, This can include nails sticking out where the studs were, or squaring up the edges and corners of where the wall used to be.

Select an appropriate product for your project.,
Figure the amount of materials you will need to complete your application.,

Complete the construction of the foundation and wall to be waterproofed, and allow all materials used to dry and cure sufficiently for the waterproofing to adhere and perform properly.,

Excavate excess soil around the perimeter of the foundation if the waterproofing will turn down on its edges.,

Clean the foundation of loose materials, dust, and any sharp objects that may damage the waterproofing or prevent it from bonding.,

Clean the walls, as well, removing any splatters of mortar or concrete, and fill any voids.
,
Sweep the entire area to be covered with waterproofing one last time to be sure no dust or debris remains on it.,
Check the materials you have purchased to do the project, to make sure all components are compatible, and that you have enough to complete it.,

Use a moisture meter to insure the wall is dry before beginning application of waterproofing.
,

Paint on primer according to container instructions if a primer is required.,
Allow primer to dry until tacky, but do not allow to completely dry, or it will not bond as well.,

Cut a length of the membrane material to a length you are comfortable working with.,
Lay the membrane on a flat surface (if available) and peel the paper away from the adhesive side to half the width of the sheet.,
Lift the sheet of membrane so the covered section is in your hands with the folded protective paper in your grip as well, and carry it to the location you are installing it at.,Always work from the lowest point or elevation upward, so that subsequent laps allow the upper membrane to lap over the lower, reducing the chance of leakage.,
Press the adhesive side of the membrane against the primed surface to seal it on the edge you have positioned, and when you are confident it is right, begin peeling the remaining protective sheeting off the membrane, pressing the adhesive against the primed surface as you go.,

Allow the membrane to wrap corners.,

Seal any protruding items such as embedded bolts, pipes, or fittings with a suitable mastic, then cut a flashing piece of membrane to fit over the mastic to keep it in place.,Smooth or roll out any wrinkles and air pockets, pressing the entire surface so it is bonded well to the primed surface you are applying the material to.,

Place a protective, non biodegradable material over the finished membrane so rocks or other sharp objects won't damage it when the wall or foundation is back-filled.,
Back-fill the excavated area with suitable fill material, compacting it in lifts (6 to 12 inch layers) so that settling doesn't occur later.",How to Install Sheet Applied Waterproof Membrane," Sheet applied waterproofing differs from fluid applied systems, which are usually sprayed on and can cover irregular surfaces quickly and easily. For large projects with embedded appurtenances, fluid applied materials may be more suitable, but for a simple, flat wall, sheet applied material can be applied and back-filled in less time, with less mess. Here are some other things to consider:

Does the contract documents specify a certain type, or even brand of material to be used? If so, you should submit the material you intend to use for review by the project architect or engineer responsible for the waterproofing scope of work.
Does the schedule require fast performance of this work so that the area can be back-filled for other work to begin as quickly as possible? Sheet applied membrane waterproofing can be back-filled the day of application, where fluid applied coatings may require multiple coats, with a curing interval between coats.
Do you have the proper equipment and trained personnel to apply other types of waterproofing? Sheet applied membrane waterproofing can be installed with minimal tools, and the cleanup process is fairly straight-forward and easy.;
, Adding 10% to allow for waste, and for materials that require a primer, it may be a good idea to add 50% more than the recommended amount for very porous surfaces, as the primer may not give equal coverage. An example would be the application rate on cast in place concrete might be 175 square feet per gallon, but concrete block, being more porous, would take much more primer to give good results., For concrete block walls, grout-fill all the cells which require this step, point up mortar joints, and allow complete drying before continuing., Go a few inches below the required depth of the waterproofing so you will have room to work., On a cast concrete footing you may see nails, wires, or sharp pieces of aggregate sticking out, make sure these are removed by chipping or grinding.,, Using compressed air or a leaf blower is very effective for this step, but careful sweeping with an ordinary broom will suffice., Buying your materials from one manufacturer is the best way to insure they will perform as expected. Other things to remember are:

Read the health and safety statement on the containers.
Make sure you have a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) if you are required to, such as when the project is governed by OSHA.




 Read the label (did I already mention it?)

Read the installation/application instructions carefully.
Buy tools and supplies for applying the materials.
Buy safety equipment, including gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator if required.
Buy a suitable solvent to clean up tools if required.

,, Most primers are a contact cement type adhesive, and can be applied with a paint roller or brush. Again, make sure the surface is clean and dry before applying., In very dusty conditions, you want to cover the primer with the sheet material as soon as practice, since the dust will adhere to the primer, reducing its bond strength., Since the adhesive side of the membrane is covered with a wax coated paper sheet for protection, working with long lengths is difficult, so beginning with six to eight foot lengths is suggested., This will be the bottom when you lay or hang the membrane on the surface you are waterproofing., Hold it level or flat on the surface, making sure the edge with the exposed adhesive side is in the correct position before allowing it to contact the primed surface. Once the membrane's adhesive side contacts the primed surface, it will immediately bond, and is very difficult to reposition.,, In some situations, it is better to apply the sheet of material horizontally, at other times, you may find you need to work from the bottom up., This eliminates an unsealed seam, and makes getting a precise fit unnecessary. Smooth, straight corners are much easier to wrap than irregular or crooked ones., Making a tight fitting cut is essential.,, Styrofoam or polyurethane sheet insulation can be a good choice for this step, but not if your back-fill contains large, sharp rocks, because then you may need to use a more durable product., Clean up your tools, and store or dispose of left over materials in a safe manner."

, It's best to nail molding into a stud (the internal, wooden support structure in your walls). Find and mark your studs using a stud finder or other alternative method.

, When placing molding, you want to first glue the edges that will be making contact with the wall or ceiling. Don't use too much glue or get it too close to the edge, as this can cause seepage.

, Once you've added your glue, put the piece in places and adjust it until it fits snugly. Marking where on the wall the piece needs to line up, in pencil, can help a lot here. Use a wall laser-level if your ceiling is uneven. You can use a box cutter or other appropriate tool to shave a bit off the top of your molding to accommodate dips in the ceiling.


If the piece is long, up high, and you don't have someone to give you a hand, just place a nail in the wall at the line where you know the bottom of the molding will be, roughly 1-2' from the end. You can patch this later.

, With the molding fit into place, put a nail (add the thickness of the molding plus the drywall and a 1/2"" for the stud to get the nail length) through the molding into the stud closest to the end of the piece. A nail gun will make this much easier. Try to nail the molding in only at the studs or at frames (such as around a window or door), as nailing elsewhere can lead to accidentally hitting a pipe or wiring!


Wait to nail in the last 1.5-2' of a piece until you've fit in the piece that goes next to it. This will help you fit the pieces together more snugly.

, Use a nail setter to push in nails which are tool exposed. Use wall patching paste or wood putty to fill and mask the holes from the nails. Use caulk around the gaps between the molding and the wall. Caulking is especially important around doors and windows, to help combat moisture issues. Use paint as necessary to hide repairs.

, Measure the distance between the last board end and the corner. Cut a piece of molding to this length. Measure and cut pieces for both sides of the corner.

, Miter the ends of both corner pieces at a 45° angle, with the long point on the back side, where the molding will touch the wall. This should allow the two corner pieces to fit together.


The length on the backside should now be longer than the length on the front side. For inside corners, the back side of the molding should be equal to the length of the wall you need to cover, from the corner to the next piece of molding.

, Add glue to the sides of the molding touching the wall or ceiling (being careful not to add too much) and then fit them into place. Make sure both pieces get a nice, smooth fit.

, Once they've been fit into place, nail the molding into the studs, alternating between the top and bottom of the molding. Make sure not to get too close to any edges, as this can cause cracking.

, Measure the distance between the last board end and the corner. Add twice the thickness of molding plus an inch or two and cut a piece of molding to this length. Measure and cut pieces for both sides of the corner.


Tip: Check the molding against the wall. Dry-fit the molding to the wall and mark the back of the molding as close as you can get to the corner. This may be a more helpful measurement than the one you took. Start with whatever measurement is longer, to be safe.

, Miter the ends of both corner pieces at a 45° angle, with the long point on the front or facing side of the molding. This should allow the two corner pieces to fit together.


The length on the front side should now be longer than the length on the back side.

, Add glue to the sides of the molding touching the wall or ceiling (being careful not to add too much) and then fit them into place. Make sure both pieces get a nice, smooth fit.

, Once they've been fit into place, nail the molding into the studs, alternating between the top and bottom of the molding. Make sure not to get too close to any edges, as this can cause cracking.


With outside corner molding, you should also nail through the end of one piece into the other, if it is thick enough.

, Figure out what the measures of the angles will have to be for the pieces. Take the overall angle of the corner you need to turn (usually 90°)and divide it by the number of ends being used to make the turn (thus 45° for a normal corner). If you are using three pieces of molding to make the turn, you'll usually need to be cutting those at 22.5°.

, Cut your side pieces with 22.5° angled ends, so that the shorter, inside point ends right where the wall begins to curve. Dry fit the pieces and mark where they end on the wall with a pencil.

, Measure the distance been them at their base. This will be your measurement for the transition piece.

, Cut your transition piece with the 22.5° angles on each side, with the long points both on the outside, facing surface of the molding. Err on the side of making the piece to long. You can also cut it down further to get a good fit.

, Place all of the pieces and glue and nail them as normal.

, If you don't like the look of a transitional piece, you can make a regular corner and simply plaster the gap that's formed.

, Door and window molding is essentially the same as wall molding, it simply places the boards in the other direction. Most of the same instructions apply. For doors, keep in mind that there are a number of ways to do the corners. You can miter them as discussed above, you can use decorative corner pieces, or you can construct a lintel. All of these options are likely easier than the mitered corners.


Don't forget to accommodate doors. Make sure there will not be any overlap.

, Windows are much the same as doors. The main difference for installing molding on windows is that you must be careful of the window frame. Do not entirely overlap the window frame and make sure you are only hammering molding into the studs around the window.

, Doing base trim, or the molding at floor level, is mostly the same as installing it anywhere else on a wall. Just be sure to use thin blocks or skims to account for carpeting. You don't want to place the molding directly at the subfloor. Also, don't forget about shoe molding. It is installed exactly the same as wall molding and can make your floor look much cleaner and professional.

, Chair and picture rails are the same as wall molding. Just be sure to use a laser level and measure constantly to make sure you're keeping them straight.

, Shadow boxes are built much like picture frames. Make sure to lay everything out in pencil before you cut your pieces, try to make as many as possible the same size to save time, and make sure you hammer them in at the studs (to avoid hitting wires or pipes). For doing odd angles, such as for stairs, just remember the formula we discussed earlier: take the total angle that needs to be accomplished and divide it by 2 (for the two pieces making the turn).

Since crown molding is generally made of wood, it is prudent to let it sit in the home environment for a few days before installing it. The wood will expand or contract based on the temperature and humidity in the house; it is better to let it adjust before nailing it in so that it will not crack and warp after the fact.





;
, Because the molding will sit against your wall at an angle, each joint (that is, each place where two strips of crown molding meet) will be a compound angle. The molding will need to be mitered to achieve the angle, and beveled to fit snugly against each adjacent piece. Achieving this using 2 separate cuts is very difficult, so this guide will teach you how to cut both of these angles using a single cut. For this, you need a guide fence, which is a piece of plywood glued to your saw table that helps you position the molding in exactly the same place for each piece.


Place a piece of molding upside-down on the miter saw table. The side of the molding that will contact the ceiling should be against the saw table, and the side that will contact the wall should be against the saw's vertical fence. Make sure that the decorative side is facing you, and hold the molding at the same angle at which you will install it. Secure the molding with clamps to the vertical fence.






Get a piece of plywood or dimension lumber that is just as long as your saw table. Apply hot glue to the saw table on both sides, and place the plywood against the glue, pressing it snugly against the molding. When the glue is set, remove the crown molding and use the miter saw to cut away the center portion of the plywood fence at 45º angles.







, If any wall in your room is longer than the pieces of crown molding you have, you will need to join 2 lengths with a scarf joint. Measure the point at which you will need to join the 2 lengths, and then place the first length into the miter saw, upside-down and at an angle as before. Adjust the blade to a 45º angle and cut through the molding. Place the second length into the saw and cut it with the blade in the same position, making sure that the piece you need to keep is on the other side of the blade.

, When 2 walls form an outside corner (making a 270º angle in the room's interior), the joinery is simple. Place the first piece of molding in the miter saw against the guide fences you created, and cut it at a 45º angle. Cut the adjoining piece with the saw in the same position, this time keeping the piece of molding you intend to use on the other side of the blade.

, Inside corner joints are a little more complicated than outside corners. The first length of molding should be cut square, meaning its edge will sit flush against the wall. The second piece will be cut at a 45º angle as before, but then coped so that it fits snugly over the profile of the first piece.


Cut the first piece of crown molding square. Place it in the miter saw and cut with the blade set to 0 degrees.






Cut the second piece at a 45º angle, cutting just as you would for an outside corner.






Use a dark pencil to trace along the edge of the cut (of the second piece) along the molded front of the piece.






Use a coping saw to cut away the bevel of the cut edge. Follow the outline that you drew closely, removing as much of the wood behind the leading edge as you want. Only the front of the molding will be seen when installed, so the cut can be made roughly as long as you follow the outline.

Any stray nails should be hammered flat or removed. Fill any dents or depressions left in the wall with wedges (small pieces of scrap material).
, Foam board is the most commonly recommended underlayment application for aluminum siding. Install each sheet with nails, laying every sheet straight and being sure to leave no gaps between the sheets., At each corner, suspend the posts, using two nails in each of the upper nail slots. If you have to use more than one post (referred to as stacking) in a single corner, be sure that there is an overlap of 1 inch (2.54 cm)., This refers to the piece of trim that is placed at the bottom of each of the exterior walls. This is where the starter strip will be installed., The top sheets of siding will be installed to slide under this piece.,, This is referred to as a J-channel. Measure each piece of trim so that it will be two channel widths longer than the opening itself. Cut notches in the ends of each section of J-channel, so that they will fit together., Nail it at 12 inch (30.48cm), increments.

When installing the trim at the windows, start at the bottom, then move to the sides and install the top portion last. This will help control water flow and prevent leakage.
Each sheet of siding has a nail strip at the top. Attach the siding to the wall with a nail in each section of the nail strip. Siding is intended to hang from the nails, not to be nailed flat.

, Slide the bottom of the siding into the footer, being sure to leave enough space to allow for expansion. Slide the end, that meets the corner, in the same way.,

Always be sure to complete one wall before moving on to the next.
When it is necessary to use more than one sheet of siding to complete a row, be sure to overlap successive panels by 1 inch (2.54 cm). For the best results, try to create seams as far away from the focal point of the wall as possible.

;
, Do this gently to avoid damaging the wall and floor. If necessary, use another object like a screwdriver or a grouping of shims to help the process along.








, Most of the nails should come with it, but if necessary, remove any still sticking into the wall. Scrape and sand away any glue or caulking that may obstruct the new baseboard installation.








, Measure the dimensions of each straight wall, rounding up slightly. Especially for beginners, give yourself leeway and cut slightly more than is necessary for a tight fit. Remember, it's always possible to cut off, but not always possible to add back on.









Measure each wall at least twice to get the most accurate measurements possible.
When measuring outside corners, be sure to add additional room to your measurements to allow for outside corners. You'll want at least the width of your baseboard in extra room, possibly a bit more.

, Buy more trim than your measurements call for to allow for scrap ends and for the inevitable mistake or two in measuring and cutting. Some people use a 10% excess estimate, but usually just buying an extra stock length or two will do. If possible, buy the baseboards and bring them inside one week before installation to allow them to acclimate to their new environment.








There are typically three components to most baseboard installations, depending on the type of project. Moving from top to bottom, they include:

The cap molding. These moldings fit on top of the baseboards to add a detailed and ornamental flourish. They are typically only needed if you have wainscot paneling.
The baseboard. Usually at least 3.5–6 inches (8.9–15.2 cm) high, they are predominantly flat and form the bulk of the baseboard.
The shoe molding. Another ornamental detail at the bottom, between the baseboard and the floor, they complete the look. Shoe molding is typically used when you are retrofitting or putting down new flooring.



, You want to make sure your floors are level, or the floor could peek out of your baseboard at certain points and look off. Use a 4-foot level to establish whether the floor is level.









If the floor is not level, use the level to find the lowest point in the room. Tack a scrap piece of baseboard to the wall at the lowest point. Make horizontal marks every couple of inches in either direction starting at the top of the baseboard, being sure to stay level with this line. Once a few horizontal marks are established, snap a chalk line over the horizontal marks. This will show where the top of the baseboards will stand when they are installed., If you are putting in shoe molding, you should make sure that the top of the baseboards are completely level with your chalk line. To do this, you'll want to scribe them. Tack a piece of baseboard to an inside corner with one or two nails after leveling it. Keep the bottom of the baseboard slightly above the floor. Use a compass to measure the distance between the chalk line (on the bottom) and the top corner of your tacked baseboard.









Keeping your compass spread rigid, hold the point-side of the compass on the floor and the pencil-side on the baseboard. Move the pencil across the entire distance of the baseboard to trace an outline.
Use a table saw or a jigsaw to cut along the scribed line on the baseboard. If you have a circular saw, set a slight (2° - 5°) bevel on the cut. This will make scribe-fitting much easier in the end.
With a block plane, plane down the beveled edge of the baseboard. Then dry-fit the baseboard back onto the floor and make sure it lines up evenly with the chalk line on your wall.

, Cutting miter joints is critical wherever two pieces of trim meet around an outside corner. A power miter saw is the ideal tool for these due to ease of use and efficiency. If your corner forms a 90º angle, cut each piece at a 45º angle and match them to form an outside corner. When in doubt, make the cuts a little longer than you need; you can always shorten it if necessary.









Alternative tools:Miter box and hand saw: a cheap but effective option. Clamp the wood securely to the box. Cheaper models only allow cuts at common angles.Circular saw and speed square: Fast but inaccurate. Not recommended for baseboard.
, For inside corners, the process of mitering is the same as it is for outside corners, except that the angles are reversed. But not all carpenters want to miter inside corners, because the corners are rarely perfectly square and the resulting joint can be sloppy.If you're looking for a tighter fit or you're installing baseboards which won't take paint or additional caulking, learn how to cut a traditional coped joint.









The process is actually fairly simple. Start with a 45° inside cut on the baseboard you want to cope. The other end of the baseboard won't need to be cut at all; the coped joint will simply cover up the remaining piece of baseboard.
Use a coping saw to cut away the angled profile made by your initial 45° cut. The goal here is to leave the paint line intact but cut at a 45° back angle to clear away wood behind the paint line. Go slowly so that you can follow the profile accurately.
Sand away any excess rough patches or debris to smooth out the coped seam.
Alternative tools:Miter saw: coping with a miter saw is fast but difficult. Practice on scrap wood first, and clean up the rough cut with a file.Dremel: a little more difficult to use than a coping saw, but up to the job. Use a carbide cutting or shaping wheel attachment., In theory, most projects involve rooms that have three or four walls and corners that are perfectly square. In practice, this is rarely the case. Here are some important niche cases for you to consider when cutting baseboard:









Odd-corner pieces. Where you encounter corners that don’t form ninety-degree angles, use scrap material for trial-and-error fitting until you find the correct angle cut. Then, use that setting on your saw to cut your trim.
Mid-wall pieces. It’s likely that you will have to use more than one piece of baseboard to cover very long walls. Instead of simply butting flat ends up against one another, which may separate with time as the wood shrinks, cut both pieces at overlapping 45-degree angles (to fit together like so // ) so that the wood shrinkage will be less visible.
End pieces. If the baseboard butts into something and doesn’t need to continue around any corners (ex. it runs into a door casing), simply cut it and scoot it up against the object.

, Once you've scribed and cut your baseboard angles, you may want to sand and prime. If you’ve chosen primed materials, doing your sanding before installation will save you a lot of time on your hands and knees. If you’ve selected bare wood materials, stain or paint them with a primer, allow to dry, and then sand before installing.








, Use a stud finder to locate wall studs to nail into; alternatively, knock on the wall to differentiate the hollow areas from the studs. Sink two nails into every stud below the surface with a downward angle on a nail set, or by using a nail gun. Fill all the nail holes with putty, allow to dry, and sand.









On outside corners, apply a thin bead of wood glue or adhesive to mitered edges to ensure a better bond.
On inside corners, adhesive is not necessary if you've properly coped your baseboards.

, Tack the shoe molding down into the floor with pin nails. If you have concrete floors, you will need to tack it into the baseboard. Tack the cap molding into studs wherever possible.








, Caulk not only along the top edge, but over and corner edges and nail holes. Doing this in the bathroom is a must. If you fear spilling or dripping, you might also consider caulking the baseboards directly below the kitchen sink.








, Cover all the nail holes as well as any scuffs or dings with a bit of Spackle using your finger. The Spackle should dry up very quickly.








, This will allow you to paint the trim quickly without going over the edges. Use something that pulls off easily and doesn’t leave residue, such as blue painter's tape. You can also take your chances and paint freehand.








, Trim is usually finished with a gloss or semi-gloss paint or varnish. This is exacting and slow work, so be sure to have a good kneeling pad on hand. If your baseboards are already painted, you only need to worry about this step if you want to apply varnish. No matter what you are using, always apply two coats of it.

This is important, since a rotting or weak wall can cause your tiling job to warp, crack, or even break and fall down.


Look for signs of mold or damage to the tiling surface. Cracks are often a sign that a wall may be weak and need to be replaced.
Try pressing on the wall, especially at the studs. If it gives way or feels soft, it may require work.
If you are going to be tiling a large area, remember to use tiling board as a backer and not just put the tiles directly onto drywall.Tiling board is installed just like drywall (nailed to the studs) but is made of more water resistant materials which will keep it from warping and cracking your tile work.;
, Now, using a level and measuring tape, measure and mark for the middle lines in the area you will be tiling.You want to find both the vertical and horizontal middle, since you will use these to keep your tiles straight and divide the area into sections for tiling.


Never assume a fixture in the room like the tub or vanity (or even the ceiling) is perfectly level. They rarely are. It is very important to rely on the level.

, Using a chalk snap line, mark the mid-line and vertical lines which you just measured. If you've never used a chalk snap line before, don't worry: it's easy. Simply place a nail at one end of the space you marked, attach the string, pull it taut and snap it down. This will leave a straight line on your wall. You'll still want to check it for level but it's much more accurate than drawing a line.


You can use just regular string and manually chalk it to make a chalk line but using a chalk box, which are easily bought for about $5, will generally be a lot less work.

, Dry fit your tiles to be sure that they will look the way you want them to look. Once you're comfortable with how it looks, figure out how the tiles will meet up with the corners and edges of your wall. You will probably need only a part of a tile when it comes to some of these areas, so it will be necessary to cut the tiles to size. Measure how much space you need for each row with the spaces and cut tiles to size using a diamond tipped wet saw.


So, for example, let's say your wall to tile is five feet long. You're putting up subway tile and the tiles are 6"", with spaces of 1/4"" between each of them. You'll need 9.6 tiles for each row to cover that space, meaning nine full tiles and one cut to 3.6""
If you don't own a diamond tipped wet saw, you can usually rent one from your local major hardware store. You can also use a tile cutter, but this is more likely to end in broken tiles so only take this option if using cheaper tiles. Dry fitting is especially important if your tiles make up a pattern, since you will need to be very comfortable creating that pattern. You don't want to make a mistake or have to spend a lot of time thinking about it once the mortar is up on your wall.
You can test your dry fit pattern by making a layout stick, which can be made from any straight and level piece of spare wood. Lay the tiles on a floor and mark the layout stick with a pencil at the joints between tiles. Use the layout stick to see how the tiles fit on the wall.

, With everything else ready to go, you'll want to install a batten to help keep your tile rows straight. This is a piece of scrap wood, such as a piece of 1x4 lumber, that you use as a long straight-edge, placing the first row of tiles right against the batten. Align the top edge of the wood so that it follows exactly along the mid-level line that you marked, then screw it into the studs. Once the tiles have been placed, simply unscrew and remove the batten.


Double check that everything is level before installing the tiles on the batten. You'll also want to check it all the way across, since there may be dips in the wood you use for your batten.

, You'll need thin set mortar to lay your tiles. While you should always go by the manufacturer's instructions, a general rule of thumb is to start with the powder in a bucket and just add water slowly and mix until the consistency of the mortar becomes like peanut butter.


You should also allow it to ""slake"" after you first mix it up. This means you allow it to rest for 10-15 minutes and then stir it up again. Now it is ready to use.

, Working in a roughly 2x3'area, use a tiling trowel to apply the mortar. Hold the notched trowel at a shallow angle against the wall, so that the notches on one of its long sides dig grooves into the mortar. Use long, sweeping motions to apply the mortar. The direction of the grooves doesn’t matter but the lines should all be roughly parallel.


Your trowel size will depend on the size and type of tile you're using.For the average small wall tiles which are currently popular, you will want to use a 1x4"" square notch trowel.
Test a tile to make sure the mortar is mixed and spread correctly. Mortar a small spot and then place a tile. Pull the tile up and look at the pattern that is create on the back. If you see clear lines, then the mortar is too dry. If you see goopy mounds then the mortar is too wet.

, With the mortar ready to go, you can start placing your tiles. Just twist them into place, sticking to the small area that you prepared for yourself. Place your spacers between each tile as you go. These are usually cross shaped and placed at the corners but if you have unusual tiles you may have to improvise, such as by placing only one arm between tiles and letting the rest of the spacer stick out.


If the mortar rises up between the tiles as you place them, the bed is too thick and you will need a smaller trowel.
Check the tiles for level as you go. This is when a laser level can really come in handy.

, You'll need to choose what grout is appropriate for your project, depending on how large the gaps are between your tiles. Once you've chosen, mix the grout according to the packaging directions, being sure to also mix any additives you want. Usually, you will start with the water in a bowl or bucket and add powder until the consistency is like toothpaste. Mix only what you can spread in about 20 minutes, since mixing any more risks the product drying out.


Sanded grout is used for gaps larger than 3mm.
Unsanded grout is used for gaps smaller than 3mm.
You can find all sorts of additives at your local hardware store. These can do everything from making the grout more water resistant to changing the color to match your tiles.

, Now, spread the grout (using a grout float) in a roughly 3x3' area, or whatever size you can grout in about 20 minutes. Hold the float at a 45° angle and push the grout into the gaps using diagonal swipes.


You do not want to push the grout around parallel to the lines, since this can gouge the grout back out of the gaps.
You can save yourself some time by using the grout float to remove as much of the excess grout off of the tiles as possible.

, After allowing the grout to cure for 20 minutes wipe the tiles with a clean, damp sponge to remove any excess grout from the tiled surface. Wipe just a small area, clean out the sponge, and then wipe some more.


It is best to do this for each small area as you complete it but you can wait until you have done two to four small areas as well. Keep in mind, however, that it will be much harder to get the grout off and the final look may not be as professional.

, Now, allow the grout to cure for three hours or whatever amount of time is recommended on your product directions. Make sure that the area remains dry and that it gets adequate ventilation.


Some additives may cause the grout to cure more slowly. See the included packaging for any addendums to the curing process.
You can clean off any remaining residue after the grout has cured. An old sock or dry rag work well for this.

, Once you have installed all of your tile, you'll want to apply a grout sealer. This will help keep mold from growing in the gaps and will need to be reapplied usually every year (preferably every six months). Though every sealer is different, usually it is a wax which must be applied in a circular motion with a rag.


You can also get brush-on or spray-on tile sealer.
Do not put these sealers on non-glazed, unfinished tile. It will absorb into and possibly stain the tile.

,,  If your board and batten is set in like this, you will need to install angled metal flashing to channel water away.  This requires a roll of coiled metal flashing, a press brake, and shears.  Bend lengths of the metal to slightly greater than 90 degrees with each side being at least 3 inches (7.6 cm).  The side that will be resting on the stone or brick, bend a small 45 degree lip down to further help direct the water away from the house.,  Do not force it down.  Attach with staples.  Where pieces overlap, apply clear silicone caulk on the bottom piece before setting the next piece over top of it., Cut to length and attach one of your wide 1x boards aligning the center of the board to the line you just marked on the wall.  Use a level to make sure the first board is plumb or perpendicular to level.  If you have added flashing as described in the previous steps, make sure to leave a half inch gap between the board and the top of the metal resting on the brick or stone.  This keeps water from siphoning into your boards.,  For example if you are using a 1x8 and a 1x3, your number here will be 10 inches (25.4 cm).  This leaves half an inch overlap on each side for your batten to cover.,  Make sure that they are close to the same measurement.  Also make sure that you will not have a gap in the boards close to where you will be putting your corner trim.  That would put a batten up against or overlapping the trim.  If that is the case, decrease the gap between your boards until you end up with a sufficient distance between them giving you equal separation from the last piece of batten and the corner trim.  You won't have to adjust much.  Small increments add up to great distances across long walls.  Make sure any windows or doors do not have the same issues.,  These will be spacers you put up to the edge of an attached board and wedge your next board up against.  This saves time, keeps the boards level, and keeps the gaps even.,,  In the example in step 6, that number was a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm).  Start at one end of your wall and start marking off that distance on either side of your gaps.  Do this both at the top and bottom.,  Attach them flush with the bottom if there is a small discrepancy.  You can caulk minor gaps in the top.  Make sure the nails are driven all the way in without marking up the batten.,,,"

Nail the first length of molding in place.,
Nail the rest of the molding in place.,
Smooth the crown.,
Paint the crown.",How to Install Crown Molding2," Use finish nails to install the first length of molding. It is a good idea to get a second person to position the molding while you secure it. If you had to make a scarf cut to cover the first length of wall, apply a thin layer of glue to the scarf joint on the first piece of molding. Fit the scarf joint together snugly, and fasten the second piece with finish nails. Wipe away any excess glue.

, Working either clockwise or counterclockwise, affix each piece of molding using the process outlined above. This will be much easier with two people, since one person can hold each piece of molding in place while the other hammers it down, but it can be done alone if necessary. Apply a small amount of glue to each scarf joint before nailing the next piece, and wipe excess glue away with a cloth as you work. Continue until all molding is in place.


If a corner joint doesn't quite fit, use a rasp to quickly and evenly grind down extra wood, testing regularly against the joint until you find a perfect fit.
Boring small holes into the points of each outside corner joint allows you to secure the corners to the wall firmly with an extra finish nail in each hole.

, 100-grit sandpaper is suitable for finishing scarf joints on bald wood. For pre-finished white crown molding, use paint-on white caulk to smooth the joints. Caulk is also appropriate for smoothing over nail holes and any other marks in the molding. Consider caulking in the gap between the top of the crown and the ceiling for a smoother appearance, if there is such a gap.

, This step will require paint and a brush. Enamel paints are generally the best for this kind of work, and fall into two basic categories: acrylic enamel, which dries quickly and is less odorous than its counterpart, but which has a flatter finish, or alkyd enamel, which takes longer to dry and has a stronger smell, but whose deep, lustrous finish cannot be matched by acrylic paint. Whichever style you choose, use an angle sash brush (which is preferred for its ability to paint sharp, clean lines easily), and apply your paint evenly and methodically.


The standard color for crown molding is white, but other colors may be appropriate depending on the effect you desire for the room you are working on.






You can also paint the molding before you install it, but be aware that you'll have to repaint anywhere that gets scuffed during installation.

Measure the wall that you wish to build a brick veneer around and calculate the amount of materials necessary.,
Wet the brick a couple hours before you begin the building process.,
Outline the first course of the brick veneer.,
Screed a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) layer of mortar as a foundation for the first course.,Lay the first course of brick being certain to retain a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joint between each brick.,Screed a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) top joint over the first course and lay the second brick course on top of the first.,
Create a small corner lead on top of the first 2 courses.,
Pull a string line taut from the base of the veneer to the top, along the corner lead of the wall covering.,
Tool the joints between the bricks and courses after every 2 to 3 courses using a concave jointer.,Continue spreading mortar and building each course until you have reached the goal height of your brick veneer.",How to Install Brick Veneer,"

Height: each brick is approximately 2 inches (5.08 cm) in height and you will want to leave about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joint in between each layer of brick laid. Each layer is called a course and a joint is the space between each brick on either side as well as the space between each course. When added together, this will result in a height of about 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm) per course.
Length: each brick is approximately 8 inches (20.32 cm) in length and, again, you will want to leave about a 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joint between each brick in the course.
The following steps will be an example of how to build a 4 foot (1.21 m) tall by 10 foot (3.03 m) wide brick veneer; 4 feet (1.21 m) equals 48 inches (121.92 cm) and 10 feet (3.03 m) equals 120 inches (304.8 cm).
When you divide the height of the wall, 48 inches (121.92 cm), by the height of the brick and the course's joint, 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm), you will get an approximation of how many courses you will need. In this example, the result is about 20 to 21 courses, depending on which measuring system you are using.
When you divide the length of the wall, 120 inches (304.8 cm), by the length of each brick and the joints in between, 8 inches (20.32 cm) per brick plus the 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) joints, you will get approximately 15 bricks per course.
Multiply how many courses necessary for the brick wall cover by how many bricks you will need per course; this will result in how many total bricks you will need to purchase for the entire brick veneer. For this example, round up to 21 courses and multiply by 15 bricks per course; this comes out to 315 bricks.
On average, it takes about 60 pounds (27 kg) of mortar per 120 bricks. Mortar is a thick cement-like paste used to bind the bricks to each other. To calculate the amount of mortar you need, divide the number of bricks you will need times the 120 brick average, then multiply by the 60 pounds (27 kg) of mortar average. For this example, you will divide 315 bricks by 120 bricks and multiply by 60 pounds (27 kg) of mortar; this results in 157.5 pounds (70.88 kg) of mortar.
If veneering more than 1 side of a wall, calculate your total amount of materials by multiplying your total number of bricks and mortar per wall by how many walls you are covering.;
, This will prevent the bricks from soaking up too much mortar during the construction process., If you are veneering more than 1 wall, it is imperative to extend the veneer further than the wall itself. This will establish corners, connect each side of the brick wall to itself, and ensure the wall covering comes out straight., A screed is an aluminum tool used to flatten and smooth out pasty, cement-like materials such as mortar.,,, This ensures your brick courses will all have equal heights throughout construction as well as keeping the wall veneer straight. Do this by starting the next 3 brick courses along the end or corner of the veneer. These courses should only be portions of the next 3 courses, so only build 1/3 (or 5 bricks) into each of these lead courses., This will help you make sure your joints and courses are straight by lining up the corner of each course to the string line., This tool creates a round indent in the mortar making it more stable as well as stylish.,"

Use a pencil and a triangular layout square to draw a line on each side of the brick at the place it will be cut.,
Rest the brick on the ground or in a sand bed.,
Hammer the chisel gently all along the marked line, alternating the chisel's angle from side to side to form a groove 1/16 inch (0.15 cm) deep all the way around the brick.

,
Take a brick set or chisel and place its cutting edge in the chiseled groove.,
Hammer the brick set solidly once with the brick hammer.,
Use the chisel end of the brick hammer to chip off any excess remaining brick.

",How to Cut Brick,";
, Place a chisel on the brick's marked line at about a 60 degree angle. Tap the chisel gently with a brick hammer.

,, The brick set or chisel's straight side should be facing you and the side of the brick that will be used after cutting. Tilt the cutting tool's edge slightly away from the portion of brick to be discarded.

, The brick should split along the chiseled groove line.

Use a hammer and chisel to cut flagstone when accuracy of cut or straight lines are not important.,
Set the flagstone on a solid surface.

,
Measure and draw a line to cut.

,
Leave a distinct bold line, such as that provided by paver chalk or a piece of roofer's slate.,
Hammer sharply, but not heavily, on the chisel as you move it along the drawn line in order to score the line.

,
Continue to score along the line with even pressure.,
Continue to tap the chisel with the hammer along the scored line until stone breaks along the scored line.

",How to Cut Flagstone1,"


A hammer and chisel is best to cut or shape flagstone for small projects that do not require accurate cuts, such as a small garden path or a decorative step or bench top.;
,,,


The measurement must allow for the space made by joint or mortar.

,,


Allow time for this process, or you may crack or break the stone unintentionally.

,"
"
Use a circular saw with masonry blade to make regular cuts in the same size for small projects, such as a fireplace hearth.

,
Clamp the flagstone firmly to a solid surface.

,
Measure and clearly draw the line to cut.

,
Begin to saw along the line.

,
Do not apply pressure to the saw; just allow the weight of the saw to score the stone.,
Prop the stone that has been scored by the circular saw at an angle on a tool or brick along the bottom side of the flagstone parallel to the scored line.

,
Tap chisel with hammer sharply along the scored line until piece breaks away.

",How to Cut Flagstone2,",,,,


The intent is not to saw through the flagstone; rather, the purpose is to create a significant score in the stone along which repeated blows with a hammer and chisel will break the stone.

,,"
"
Cut flagstone with a wet saw if you have a large job or a job that requires accurate cuts or design cuts, such as a patio floor, a pool deck, curves or edging where you want to repeat a color scheme.

,
Buy or rent a water-fed saw with a diamond edged blade.,
Read the assembly and usage directions carefully.

,
Measure and score the line desired.

,
Move the stone steadily along the line against the saw blade because on a wet saw the blade does not move.

,
Push the stone flat, steadily, and slowly through the blade until the cut is complete.

,
Clean and store tools.

, Using appropriate equipment(Ladders, scaffolding, aerial lifts etc.), set up to reach the area safely.

, Joint removal can be done in a variety of ways. A hammer and chisel, a raker bar (a specialized tool for the trade) or with a 4"" angle grinder with a diamond masonry blade.

, Once the joints are removed, the joints will need to be cleaned to remove dirt and debris left over from the joint removal process. This allows for better bonding of new mortar to old brick. Cleaning is done with a masonry brush, a hose or by blowing the joints clean with a leaf blower., Mix premix mortar in wheelbarrow with hoe to specifications on product bag.

, Cleaned joints are ready to tuckpoint. Use a joiner or tuckpointing trowel to push mortar into the wall from a hawk board. Make sure the tool you are using is appropriate for the size of the joints. , Allow the mortar to cure for a short while, enough so that it has little moisture but is still pliable, then Brush excess mortar from the wall for a finished product.

, Apply a masonry cleaner 2-3 weeks after completion of the work to remove any residual haze left over from the tuckpointing

, After 30 days a sealer may be applied but is not necessary.

Phony brickwork will mostly consist of concrete and a fake thin film that's completely worthless and will flake off in a matter of 15 years or slightly longer. Stonemasons actually work with real stone.;
, Wall rock is the type of work stonemasons do the most. Separate the two words ""wall"" and ""rock"", meaning you're putting rock together with ""mortar"" in order to make a wall.

, Usually this is done with two scaffolds and an X-brace and about three planks. Two should be at about hip level and one at the top of the scaffold, so that you can put a bucket full of water up top. This is so that you can create a siphon for your wet saw, should you need it. It's usually safe to assume you'll need it every day.

, Sometimes you won't need all your tools but take out the ones that you'll need with that specific job. If you don't know which tools you'll need, take all of them.

, If it's not smart for you to have a wheelbarrow full of cement, get a mud board. A MUD BOARD can usually be found on every job site. It's just any flat board that you wet down and place cement on.

, You want a good selection to work with, but don't take all the good stones if you have other stonemasons on the job that could use some. Just use those really good ones you might need and leave it at that.

, If it's a pillar or something that has a corner, then you're going to have to string a line or a series of lines. This means you'll need a tightly strung string that is strung from above where you're working and all the way down to the bottom at a specific measurement. So suppose you're wrapping your stone around a pillar and your distance is two and a half inches away from the wall; cut a 2x4 at about a six inch length. Then get some particle board and cut it in a long strip. Drill the six inch long 2x4 to the particle board with two screws so that the tension in the line doesn't cause the 2x4 to pivot. Drill the particle board to the wall. Measure from the two walls two and a half inches and make those measurement marks on the 2x4. Extend those marks with a square to the point to where the measurement marks intersect. Drill a screw into that intersection point, but don't drill it 100% into the wood. Leave some of the screw out a little ways. Now, tie a stiff and durable string to that screw you just drilled. Make sure that the string reaches all the way to the bottom with a little extra remaining.

, If there's not enough of a footing, then you'll have to dig about a foot deep and pile in some stiff cement into that hole in order to make your own footing.

, Make sure it's at two and a half inches out on both ends of both walls. You can do this with a square and a measuring tape to make sure the edge of your stone is at the proper measurement. When working with corners, you'll usually need a natural edge or a chiseled edge. Make sure not to leave a saw cut edge on the rock, unless you're told to do that by your employer... but you're not likely ever to encounter that situation.

, Make sure it's tight enough so that when you tuck it underneath your first cornerstone you'll have tension on the line, but it won't lift your stone up off the ground because the cement is still wet. If this is the first time you're doing this, you'll get frustrated with this process. You'll learn how to do it right in time.

, Measure, measure, measure, re-measure, and measure again. When working with corners, this is the most vital thing. If it's off, then you might have to tear out two to three days of work - if not more - which obviously sucks if you're paid by the square footage and sucks even more when you're being paid the the hour because then you're in danger of losing your job for pay that wasn't delivered to your employer. So make sure you measure as much of everything that seems important and even some of the things you'd usually not consider. Just measure, measure, and measure some more. It's hard to get to the point to where you're measuring too much.

, Sometimes this means you need to undercut some of your stone and not just cut straight down on your rock. Don't undercut at a too dramatic angle but just enough to fit your stones nice and snugly together without having one overlap the other. Make sure every stone is flush - unless your employer wants a Rustic look. (The way to tell if you're a good stonemason is to see if you're organized and that your work meets customers expectations.)

, For example, you'll be picking up this big heavy stone and moving it around and making marks on the stone and cutting it a little bit, then repeating this process in order to finally lay the stone. The more you play with a stone, the more likely it's going to break. So you can either work with lots and lots of small rock, or you can use a template. This is a trick of the trade!


Buy some wire that's not tie wire. (Tie wire is too stiff, you need some wire that you can move and shape easily; usually this means having a thinner caliber of wire. However, if it's too thin it won't hold its shape and it'll sag and waste your time.) Find a brand of wire that you're comfortable with.
Get a good length of wire, cut it, then wrap the two ends together. You should have a circular-looking type of wire. Put it in those difficult to cut places and shape it to the shape the outer portions the shone should be. Shape it so that it's not touching any of the already laid stones. Spend an extra minute or two just to make sure it's right. Working a little longer on a light piece of wire is much faster and easier than having to pick up a heavy stone, mark it a little bit, cut, then mark again, and cut, and repeat this process however many times is necessary to get it right. Hopefully you've shaped the wire properly.
Place it atop your stone. If you have a pencil or Sharpie marker, place the wire onto the stone and mark it from the inside of the wire. (Make sure you don't invert your template, otherwise your stone will be worthless. Sometimes you can salvage it by flipping the stone, but if you undercut it probably won't be; so there are downsides to undercutting, but it does more good than bad). Once you've marked your stone, put your stone to that shape and it should fit perfectly into place.

, Try never to make an X joint. Let me explain. You've seen how bricks are stacked, right? Each layer is staggered. Suppose they weren't staggered. You'd wind up with a bundle of X joints. If they were a map they'd be four-way stops rather than T intersections. These are bad. They look ugly and usually cause a running joint. A running joint is a joint that extends more than three feet. Those are bad. Why? Because as the stonemasonry ages sometimes cracks form. The first places cracks form are in X joints and in the running joints.

, There is always a quirky little thing that you'll have to work around. Hopefully you can work around the problems presented to you with reflection and perseverance.

, Flatwork means working on floors. This is faster, meaning that more gets done in one day and you get paid more for it; but you rarely do it, so worship the employer that gets it.

, I suppose you can use scaffolding, but it's usually smarter to just use a wheelbarrow. With that wheelbarrow, get a particle board that extends the length of the thinner area of the wheelbarrow and lay it down. Get your grinder or wet saw out and place it there. That's your workspace.

, Start laying your stones. Obviously there are going to be some complicated cuts involved.


Get some plastic transparent tarp that's inexpensive. Sometimes it's stuff that's usually used for masking or stuff that you'll just find around, or you can buy . Buy some Sharpie markers, too. Place the tarp around the place that you're going to cut. Be sure to stretch it out. Mark the shape of the stone you're going to cut. Write TOP in the middle of the plastic template so that you don't invert the stone. Find the appropriate stone that's the right size for the template. Put some water on your stone and place the plastic template on the watery surface so that it doesn't blow away or move. Cut the stone to the shape you need it.

You can pick up most of the following at a local hardware store. If you can't find them at a hardware store, look online.You will need a chisel as well as an electric grinder with a diamond cutting blade to cut the stone. If your project is small, it may be less expensive to rent the grinder.
You'll need a stone mason's hammer (these are similar to small sledge hammers).
You will also need safety gear. You'll need protective goggles, a full face shield, and hearing protection. You can get hearing protection, which are ear muffs designed to block out loud sound from machinery, at most hardware stores.;
, If you want all your stones the same size, you may already know the dimensions you're using. However, you may not be using one specific dimension. If you need a piece of stone to fit into a particular space in the wall, measure that space's dimensions with a measuring tape. Make sure you have the proper dimensions in mind before you begin cutting., Mark all the way around the stone where you will make your cut.

, The face side of a stone is the side that will face outward on a wall. The chisel will help achieve a cleaner break than the grinder wheel.You'll want a more even break for the face side, as this gives it a smoother look. Use your chisel and sledgehammer to begin the cut on the face side. Put on eye protection before you start using the hammer and chisel, which can send sharp chips of stone flying.Take your chisel and hold it in a vertical position on the stone, with the blade of the chisel on the line you wish to cut. Take your sledgehammer and hit firmly it on the end of the chisel to make three or four small marks, about an inch apart, running along your line on the stone. Then, fill in the spaces between these marks by once again tapping your chisel with the sledgehammer.
Keep working the line until you have a groove the entire length of the face side. Use single, solid taps against the chisel with the sledgehammer, working back and forth up the line.

, The next step involves working with an electric grinder. Make sure, for your own safety, to put on your safety goggles, hearing protection, and face shield before you begin working with your grinding tool. Small debris may fly off the stone at this point, and the noise from the grinding tool can cause hearing damage., Rotate your stone so that one of the other sides is up.Use your grinder to cut a straight line across one side of the stone. Cut over the line a few times, until you have a small indent. Go slowly to make sure the line is cut evenly across the stone.
Turn the stone over and repeat this process on the next side of the stone. Then, turn the stone over again. You should repeat this process on all of the sides of the stone other than the face until you have a good groove on each side of the stone.

, Once you've cut into all sides of the stone either with your chisel or your grinder, you're ready to finalize the cut.


Start with the face side, and give 3-4 good blows with the hammer along the groove in the face.
Rotate to the next face, and repeat.
Continue this process (it may take a while) until the stone breaks.

, If you want to carve stone into a shape for a project, or carve curves into stone, you have options as well. First, you need to gather some tools. The process of carving and shaping stone is a bit more delicate.You will need a chisel set containing the following types of chisels: a large, heavy chisel, a point chisel, a claw chisel, a flat chisel, and a file. Chisel sets can be purchased online and at most hardware stores, but can get pricey. A set may cost up to $100.
You will need dust masks to wear during the shaping process, as well as safety goggles.
Leather gloves are a good idea as your hands may get sore while carving.

, To start, making a drawing of the object you're trying to carve. This can help guide you during the process. You may be making a fancy shape, like a flower, or just making a curved corner or a tile for a larger project. At any rate, sketch a rough drawing of your shape., You can use found stones, or slabs of stones you purchase at a hardware store, for your project. When selecting a stone to use, especially with found stones, you want to select something close to the shape you want. If a stone has a curved edge, for example, this would be a good option to carve out a curved corner. This will result in less extensive work for you as you shape the stone., From here, draw out your design on the stone itself. If you're carving a curve, draw the direction and shape of the curve along the edge of the stone. If you're drawing a fancy shape, like a flower, for example, draw out the shape of the petals, buds, and so on against the stone. You can use a marker or a pencil to draw on your stone., Now you can begin shaping to stone. Take your largest, heaviest chisel to start. You will use this to carve out the rough shape of the stone. Do not worry, during this process, if the stone does not look much like your desired shape. You will go through several different rounds of carving, and you're just trying to get a very rough outline here.Scrape your chisel along the stone, carving it into the rough shape you want. Carve along the edges of the drawings you've made. Make sure to wear your safety goggles, as bits of stone may fly off during this process.
Do not break off big chunks of the stone. Instead, take out small bits of stone one at a time. Try to make a series of groves in the stone with tiny bits of stone wedged inside. You'll remove these lines later, with other tools. A large chisel can be rough on stone, and is not delicate enough to remove such lines.

, Once you've carved the rough outline, grab your point chisel. You will use this to further carve out the shape. You'll be making small lines in the stone by scraping your chisel along the stone. These lines will be leveled later, with your claw chisel.You should hold the claw chisel at about a 45-degree angle. However, the angle varies slightly depending on the roughness of the stone. For particularly rough stones, you may have to go for a steeper angle as you scrape the chisel along the stone.
Once again, go slowly. Remember, it'll be awhile before your stone truly begins to take shape. Make a series of small lines in the stones running along the exterior of the shape you're carving. Make lines about 1 to 1 and a half inches apart. Then, make a crosshatch pattern by drawing lines the other way. This levels the stone, creating small bumps that can be removed with a claw chisel.
Your stone should look something like the shape you desired, except the exterior of your shape will be bumpy and uneven.

, From here, you can begin to refine the shape by using your claw chisel to smooth out these bumps. Use the claw chisel to remove lines and bumps by gently tapping or scraping the chisel against the bumps and lines. The bumps should come off fairly easily. Keep working until you've smoothed out most of the bumps and lines from the previous chisel. In the process, however, you may create some lines and cracks with your claw chisel. That's okay. These are removed with the flat chisel.

, Your stone should really begin to take shape here. It should look mostly like your desired shape, only a bit rough on the edges. Now, you can take your flat chisel. Gently scrap the chisel along the stone, removing any lines or bumps created by the claw chisel. The flat chisel has a flatter edge, so any lines created here will be less noticeable and can be filed out later., There may be some loose stones and rough edges on your shape now. Take your file and rub it against the stone. Target any sharp edges, rubbing them until they soften, and look for any loose stones or pebbles embedded in your stone. These can be gently dislodged with the file., When working with stone, you should wear safety googles. You can purchase safety goggles at a local hardware store. Safety goggles will help protect your eyes from bits of stone that may fly off the main piece while you're chiseling., You should learn about the materials you're using. When you purchase stone, it will usually come with safety instructions. There are also generally safety instructions on tools you would use from the hardware store. Do not disregard these rules. Read them in their entirety before you begin to cut stone., When you're cutting stone, you should make sure you dress in a way that will help prevent accidents. Take some basic safety precautions before you begin cutting stone.Remove any jewelry before you begin working. If you have long hair, pull it back into a ponytail.
Avoid wearing shorts, as pant legs can protect you from bits of stone that may fly away from the main piece while you're cutting.

, Where you work is also a safety concern. Make sure you work in a space that's clean and well lit. If an area is full of debris, you could trip and hurt yourself. You also want to make sure you have adequate lighting so you can see what you're doing., When deciding on a type of stone, you have to make a decision about stone type. One major factor in the decision-making process is whether your project is for commercial or domestic use.Commercial use implies there will be a lot of traffic on your stone. For example, stone used on a walkway or on the floor of a shopping mall would be commercial use. You should go for a heavier, sturdier type of stone. Limestone, a common stone used for DIY projects, should be avoided.
Domestic use is stone that would be used privately in your home. A stone counter would be domestic use, for example. You can use softer, cheaper stone for a domestic project. Stone types like granite or other natural stones would work well.

, You may not always find your first choice in stone. Depending on your area, certain types of stone may have to be shipped to providers. This can get costly. Write down a variety of stone types you would be okay with and then check with a local provider to see what's readily available. Stone can get expensive, so be willing to work within a budget.

, Many types of stone may require special finishing procedures. If your stone-type is particularly slippery, for example, sanding, finishing, and flaming may be necessary. These types of projects are cost and time intensive and offer require professional assistance. Look into a type of stone that does not need a lot of special finishing."

Choose stucco or textured paint from a hardware or paint store.,
If you want, mix the stucco yourself.,
If you're doing a small job and only need to patch up stucco, consider getting pre-mixed stucco patch.",How to Do Stucco2," If you hope to cover up a lot of blemishes with the stucco finish, then you will need to buy a larger quantity of thick stucco paint. For a thick stucco coat, it will only cover approximately 25 square feet (2.3 square m) per gallon (3.8 l).


Ask the paint associate what they recommend for your particular job specifications. They may be able to recommend the best options for your stucco needs and help to supply you with the tools needed to complete the job, since stucco requires more tools than traditional painting.
When purchasing stucco paint for outdoor surfaces, you can choose fine, medium or coarse sand stucco. Consult the paint specialists about which option would be best for your building.

, Stucco is usually made out of Portland cement, sand, hydrated lime, and water.Although some stucco recipes will differ, you can do pretty well by mixing up a simple ratio of 4:12:1 (cement to sand to lime), and then adding enough water, slowly, to get the stucco to the consistency of wet peanut butter.


If you want to, add some mortar color to the mixed stucco to approximate the color of the surrounding stucco. This will make it easier to color the newly-patched stucco and blend it in to the existing stucco, although you want still need to color the whole wall later on if the colors don't match seamlessly.

, Pre-mix stucco patch can come in either textured or un-textured form, and comes ready to go, for ease of application. If you're only patching up a slight area and don't want to spend a lot of time mixing, this might be the right way to go.

Use only a roller to create a stippled effect. This is not the best option if you need to cover uneven or blemished walls.
Use a trowel to spread on the stucco paint in a thick, uneven pattern. This is commonly used for outside walls. This is the best option if you are trying to cover up a heavily marred surface.
Use a sponge to create a square pattern. You can dip the sponge in the paint and apply it directly to a surface, then repeat in a geometrical or random pattern.
Use a stiff brush or a comb to create ""draw"" onto the stucco or textured paint once it has been applied. You can draw waves, stripes, cross hatches or circles.

, Give your stucco the best chance to adhere to your wall by prepping your surface first. Of course, how you prep your surface depends on what kind of wall you have:


For concrete, brick, or block walls: Apply a coat of concrete bonding agent onto the wall. Allow it to dry completely before moving on to the next step.
For wood walls: Nail roofing felt over the wall, also called ""building wraps"" or ""stucco wraps."" Then, cover with 17-gauge metal netting, which comes in 150-foot (45 m) rolls. Nail the netting to the felt using galvanized roofing nails.

, The scratch coat is the first layer of stucco, usually applied to a wire mesh lath, which is then scraped. These scrapes provide teeth for the next coat of stucco to hold onto. Whether you decide on a scratch coat depends largely on how much wall you want to stucco: Doing a whole wall probably requires a scratch coat, while intermittent patches probably don't.


Shoot for the scratch coat to be about 3/8-inch thick.
Score the scratch coat horizontally with a ½-inch notched trowel when the stucco is firm, but not yet dry.This scoring is what gives the scratch coat its distinctive name, and allows it to bite and hold the next layer of stucco properly.

, Again, try to get it so that it's about 3/8-inch thick. If working out in the sun, be sure to periodically spray the coat with a light mist of water to keep the brown coat workable.

, Wet your darbie first. Next, get your darbie true and plumb to an even point on the wall (use your drip-screen, perhaps), and then use the darbie to smooth out the surface of the brown coat.


Once your brown coat is true and plumb, wait 7 to 10 days for the coat to dry. Any cracks, shrinkage, or imperfections should manifest during this time, giving you the opportunity to correct them before applying the last coat of stucco.

, The finish coat of a stucco wall should be pretty thin, about 1/8-inch thickness. This is where you blend in the texture of the new stucco to the old stucco, if necessary, or create a whole new texture if you're starting from scratch. You have some options about how you want to apply the finish coat:


Mix your finish coat with a little extra water to get it soupy. Then use a ""dash"" brush to spray or flick the watery finishing coat onto the brown coat. This is called a dash finish,
""Float"" the finish coat with a hard rubber float. Move the float in a circular motion, pressing hard against the stucco.
Give the stucco finish a style of your choosing by using a sponge, a towel, a brush, etc., imbuing the coat with your own pattern.

Examine the wall or brick before the attack.,
Find the right tools.,
Keep clean up tools on hand.",How to Create Homemade Brick Cleaner1," If you are dealing with a pile of bricks, you most likely will want to clean the entire brick. However, if you are working from a pre-constructed wall your approach may be a little different in terms of how you clean.


A brick wall can be sprayed and scrubbed depending on the level of build up or mess.






Individual bricks may be submerged in cleaning mixture for a deep down clean.;
, Aside from a new and strong scrub brush, you may want access to a few soft cloths and a toothbrush (for cleaning inside small cracks). Additionally, depending upon your approach, you will need a large bucket and/or empty spray bottle.

, Cleaning bricks is a messy job, no matter how neatly you approach the task. Place a drop cloth on the floor for protection and use work gloves to protect your hands from the rough brick edges. Also, a broom, dustpan and mop are always a good idea as brick debris may spray around the room during the cleaning process.

Measure the roof.,
Order your steel roofing panels.,
Cover the shingles.,
Lay the batten boards.,
Install the eave flashing.,
Apply closure strips.,
Install the first steel roof panel.,
Install the remaining panels.,
Install the gable trim.,
Install the ridge cap.",How to Install a Steel Roof,"


Use a tape measure to determine the distance between the ridge and eave of the roof.
Add the amount of desired overhang to that measurement if you want the roofing to hang over the eaves.
Determine the roof's width.
Divide the roof's width by 3. The result gives you the number of panels that you need. For a roof that is 45 feet (13.7 m) wide, you will need 15 metal panels. Panels come in a width of 3 feet (.91 m) each, but are cut to desired lengths.;
, Give the roof measurements to a metal roofing distributor when ordering your panels.

,


This is a good time to add a radiant barrier insulation for energy efficiency or you can cover the roof with 30-pound (13.6-kg) roofing felt to keep moisture away from the roof. Leave the old shingles on the roof.
Use a staple gun or plastic cap nails to secure the insulation or roofing felt .

, Batten boards help to secure the steel panels to the roof.


Lay 1-by-4-inch (2.5-by-10.2-cm) pine boards over all of the roofing felt. The boards should run parallel with the ridge and the eaves.
Place the boards 24 inches (61 cm) apart from eave to ridge.
Use a drill to screw the boards into the roof.

, Eave flashing helps water to flow off of the roof.


Use a hammer and nails to attach eave flashing to the eaves.
Install the eave flashing along the roof's entire width. If the roof has gutters, the eave flashing should cover over each of the gutter's sides.

, Closure strips help close gaps beneath the steel roofing panels where animals and pests may hide.


Place closure strips onto the eave flashing.
Place a drop of butyl tape sealant over the closure strip.

,


Place the first panel along 1 edge of the roof. The bottom end of the panel should hang 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) over the eave.
Screw the panel onto each 1-by-4-inch (2.5-by-10.2-cm) board.

,


Lay the second panel along the first panel. The high ridges that run the length of the second panel should overlap the ridges on the first panel.
Secure the second panel by screwing it onto the first panel. Place the screws into the overlapping ridges. Insert a screw every foot (30.5 cm) from the eave to the ridge.
Repeat the process with the rest of the panels. Cover the entire roof.

, Gable trim gives the roof's edges a smooth appearance.


Apply a thin line of butyl tape sealant along the side edge of the roof.
Place the gable trim over the side edge of the roof.
Screw the gable trim into the roof.
Install gable trim on all edges of the roof.

, The ridge cap helps water to flow off of the roof.


Apply a thin line of butyl tape sealant along the roof's ridge.
Place outside foam closures along the roof's ridge.
Apply butyl tape sealant in a thin line along the length of the foam closures.
Place the ridge cap over the roof.
Secure the ridge cap on both sides of the peak with evenly spaced screws.

Combine one part vinegar with one part ammonia and one part borax.,
Stir or mix well.",How to Create Homemade Brick Cleaner2," Pour vinegar in first followed by the ammonia and then the borax. Adding the powder last will allow it to dissolve and integrate into the liquid easier and reduce the likelihood it will clump together.

, If you are mixing it in a bucket, use a long spoon to stir until borax has dissolved. For a spray bottle, add the top and shake vigorously until well combined.

Soak brick(s) with solution and allow to set for a few minutes.,
Scrub brick(s) using your scrub brush.,
Re-apply solution to brick area and allow to set for a few more minutes.,
Rinse cleaned brick with warm water.",How to Create Homemade Brick Cleaner3," If you are spraying, get close to the wall and saturate the entire brick area you plan to clean. For individual bricks, add one or two bricks (depending upon the bucket size) to the bucket.

, Move in a counter clock wise motion and then clockwise to lift and remove dirt, debris and stains. If you are cleaning individual bricks, pick up bricks one at a time and scrub. Then return to mixture for further cleaning.


Use toothbrush to get inside small cracks or hard to reach areas.







, This will allow the mixture to soak deeper into the brick following the first scrubbing.


Re-scrub if necessary upon brick inspection.







, For a brick wall, keep a large spray bottle filled with water and hit the wall after its been cleaned. Follow with a clean dry cloth to lift and remove any debris. Individual bricks can be submerged in a bucket of clean water, removed and then allow to dry naturally (or in the sun).

Choose the type of stain or dirt you are dealing with.,
Clean your brick with a solution of chlorine bleach if you have mildew or mold problems.,
Use an acid solution to clean mortar stains, rust from irrigation well water, or soil that a bleach solution doesn't clean to your satisfaction.,
Rinse all surfaces exposed to either of the above mentioned cleaning solutions, using plenty of water to dilute them to prevent damage to surfaces or plants.

,
Consider sealing the brick to prevent future staining or soiling.",How to Clean Bricks2," Mold, mildew, or algae require different methods and chemicals than do rust stains or cement and mortar smears.

,


Mix chlorine bleach with water in a large bucket, using equal proportions.
Pour the solution into a pump type garden sprayer, and pump it up.
Wet a section of wall (or patio, if cleaning pavers) with a water hose.
Spray the bleach solution on the surface, beginning at the top, on a wall, soaking it thoroughly.
Allow the bleach solution to react with the stains for a few minutes, but do not leave it long enough for it to begin to dry.
Rinse a small section of wall to see if the solution is having the desired effect.
For serious stains, scrub the wall with pure bleach, using an acid brush on a broom-type handle.
Rinse the wall thoroughly with water. Be careful not to let the bleach solution dry on the wall before rinsing.

,


Buy an acid based masonry detergent or muriatic acid available at home improvement stores, hardware stores, or building supply centers. (Review the Warnings below before purchasing or using any muriatic acid solution.)
Fill a plastic bucket 2/3 full of clean water. Add acid at a proportion of about 1 part acid to 3 parts water, but do not fill the bucket too full, as you will not want this solution to splash out accidentally.
Wet the wall or other surface with a garden hose.
Brush the diluted acid solution on the wall, scrubbing as you apply it with an acid brush.
After applying and scrubbing with the acid solution, allow the acid to work for 10 to 15 minutes, being careful not to let the wall dry out.
After giving the solution time to work, rinse thoroughly with copious amounts of water.

,, Use a siloxane or silicone sealant, applied following the manufacturer's directions.

"
"
Brush the wall with a broom.,
Hose down the wall from top to bottom.,
Treat weathered brick with a special sealant.",How to Clean Brick Wall1," Use the bristles of the broom to dislodge loose dust, dirt, cobwebs and other debris that’s built up on the surface of the brick. Be sure to reach up to the top of the wall and into any corners or crevices that might be hiding dirt.Brush horizontally away from yourself rather than straight down to keep from covering yourself in dust.
An occasional sweeping will usually be enough to keep brick walls looking good between more detailed cleanings.;
, Turn the hose on full blast and spray off any remaining dirt. Work from one end of the wall to the other, top to bottom, to avoid spreading dirt around. Once the wall dries, it will regain its original quality of finish.Cover the nozzle of the hose partially with one thumb to get more out of your water pressure.
Wipe the wall with a sponge while it’s still wet to clear away hard water stains and mineral deposits.

, If your brick wall is crumbling or shows signs of extensive wear, you can protect it using a clear silane-based sealing product. Brush a thin coating of sealant over the entire wall surface and give it ample time to dry. The sealant will help fill in weak spots, making the brick more resilient to damage and inclement weather conditions.Choose a day with clear, dry weather in the forecast to apply brick sealant. Precipitation and humidity can result in less efficient coverage.
Don’t apply a sealant until brick is totally clean, or you may end up locking in dirt for good.

Combine water and ammonia in a large bucket.,
Dip a long-handled brush in the ammonia solution.,
Scour the dirty areas of the wall.,
Spray the wall with clean water.",How to Clean Brick Wall2," Fill the bucket three quarters of the way full with warm water, then add half a cup of ammonia. The ammonia will help loosen stuck-on dirt and stains, allowing them to be scrubbed away with ease.Be sure to take the proper safety precautions when working with ammonia. Pull on a pair of rubber dish gloves and a facemask to protect you from harsh fumes.

, Use the brush head to stir the solution and soak the bristles in preparation for scrubbing. Shake off the excess solution into the bucket.

Pick a brush with natural or synthetic bristles. Wire brushes can cause scratches when used on brick or leave behind small flakes of metal that will eventually rust.Ammonia gives off noxious vapors, so stand clear of the bucket while mixing and dipping.

, Run the brush across the surface of the wall using short, forceful motions to break down stubborn residue and discoloration. Make sure you scrub the entire wall to prevent any one section from come out with a different degree of coloration. Continue scrubbing until the wall is completely clean, adding fresh solution to the brush every so often.If you’re having difficulty removing dirt, try scrubbing the spot from different angles.
You’ll need to apply quite a bit of pressure to penetrate into the cracks and crevices of the brick., Hose off the brick to rinse away all traces of the ammonia solution, along with whatever debris it helped dissolve. Let the wall drip dry. Try to get in the habit of scrubbing exterior walls with ammonia once or twice a year, or more frequently if you live in an area with a lot of dust or rainfall.If you have a power washer or a hose with a separate pressure nozzle, you can use it on a low pressure setting to knock out dirt that has settled down deep.Ammonia may damage the brick if left to soak into the wall.

"
"
Mix together water and bleach in a spray bottle.,
Spray the wall with the bleach solution.,
Allow the solution to sit overnight.,
Wash off the wall with a hose.",How to Clean Brick Wall3," Use approximately one part bleach for every six parts water to achieve the right concentration. Shake the bottle to make sure the ammonia solution is properly mixed. Keep the spray bottle pointed away from your face at all times.Caution should be observed when handling bleach. It will be a good idea to wear gloves, a facemask and eye protection to defend against potential splatters.Dense buildup caused by moss or mold growth are typically resistant to gentler cleaning methods and will require a more intensive strategy.

, Apply the mixture liberally to the areas of the wall where moss or mold growth is the thickest. Bleach is a potent disinfectant and is mildly caustic—not only will it kill whatever is growing on the brick, it will also eat away at its hold on the wall.Test the bleach solution on an out-of-the-way spot on the wall to confirm that it won’t ruin the appearance of your brick.
Wet the wall down thoroughly before misting it with bleach. This will prevent the bleach from soaking into the brick, where it can create structural weakness.Be careful to avoid inhaling fumes or contacting bleach with your bare skin.

, For best results, give the bleach 8-12 hours to take effect. As it sits on the wall, it will choke the growth of moss or mold and make it easier to remove without the need for a lot of tedious scrubbing.The longer you allow the bleach to remain on the wall, the better job it will do of releasing sludgy grime.

, Once it’s been treated with bleach, the moss and mold should simply rinse off under a forceful stream of water. Pick off any remaining bits by hand using a plastic spatula or scraper, then rinse again. Allow the wall to dry and apply a silane-based sealant to safeguard against future growth if desired.Dust and spray your brick wall regularly after deep-cleaning it with bleach to keep moss and mold from returning.

Use the edge of a trowel to even out the mortar with the wall face.,
Rub off remaining mortar dust with a medium-soft bristle brush.,
Set up a scaffold 2 inches (5.08cm) from the wall to prevent mortar splatter.,
Protect the base of your wall with a drop cloth or plastic sheet.,
Allow larger clumps of mortar to dry before removing them.",How to Clean Mortar Off Bricks1," Use a forward lifting and rolling motion with the short edge of your trowel to even out the mortar with the face of the brick. Continue to do this as you lay new bricks to prevent mortar from bunching up and creating large chunks on the bricks., The goal is to brush away dust on the face of your brick rather than wiping the mortar dust deeper into the brick. Avoid pressing down on the brush and wipe away from the surface of the brick. Use a back and forth motion until the mortar dust on the face of your wall is removed., A scaffold should be set up 2 inches (5.08cm) from the wall to prevent mortar splatter at the base of your wall. Scaffold boards that are closest to the wall should be angled away from the wall., Lay down straw, fabric drop cloths, or plastic sheeting on the base of the wall to prevent mortar drippings from staining the base of your wall. These drop clothes should extend 3 to 4 feet (91.44 cm) from the base of your wall., If you take all of these precautionary measures, but large clumps of mortar still end up on your wall, you should allow them to dry and then attempt to remove them using the chisel or acid method.

Choose soapstone if you are a beginner and have few tools for carving.,
Buy alabaster for the best combination of durability and malleability.,
Avoid very hard stones like granite and marble.,
Pick a slab of stone that is much larger than your intended sculpture.,
Inspect your stone for cracks and fissures.,
Wear respiratory protection while carving.,
Wear protective goggles over your eyes.,
Consider wearing gloves if you are carving a large piece.,
Invest in a hammer, chisels, and files.,
Purchase a sandbag from your local hardware store if you are sculpting a big stone.,
Draw your design on a piece of paper.,
Look at the stone to determine the direction of the bed or grain.,
Use a crayon to draw your design on the actual rock.,
Hold the hammer in your dominant hand and the chisel in the other.,
Strike the end of your chisel with the hammer.,
Place your stone on the sandbag if it is unsteady.,
Carve towards the center of the stone, not towards the edges.,
Chisel along cracks, not across them.,
File your stone moving away from you only.,
Glue large pieces of lost stone back to the sculpture with epoxy.,
Sand your final product with 220 grit paper.",How to Carve Stone," Soapstone's texture resembles a dry bar of soap and is extremely malleable. It will easily form a shape with little force.Soapstone is so soft that you can carve it with harder rocks you find in your backyard; you can even use your fingernail to carve it.It also comes in many colors like grey, green, and black. Use soapstone if you are making a small sculpture that won't be easily damaged if you accidentally scratch or nudge it.
You can find soapstone and other soft rocks at a local stone carving supplies stores. For example, in California there is a store called ""Stone Sculptors Supplies"" that sells soft stones for carving.Alternately, you can acquire your stones from a stone yard. Know, however, that these stones are typically used for construction purposes (building counter tops, for example) and may be harder than artistically provided stones.Know that some soapstone contains asbestos, which can cause lung cancer, asbestosis, and mesothelioma if inhaled.;
, Alabaster comes in a wide range of colors and is available from many suppliers.Alabaster is best if you want a colorful, sturdy sculpture. It can come in variety of colors like white, grey, beige, orange, yellows, reds, and translucent.Although alabaster is generally harder than soapstone, it still carves easily. It is the ideal choice for new sculptors since it will still retain its shape without requiring specialized tools or strenuous effort.
An alternative to alabaster is limestone, which carves easily and regularly but is not available in a wide range of colors (typical limestone comes in different shades of grey). Also, limestone can be difficult to sculpt if you get the wrong piece. Limestone is slightly harder and doesn't polish as well as alabaster.

, Carving these stones requires specialized tools like electric grinders and hammers.Granite and marble are usually sculpted in large quantities since they are most optimal for statues and other large items that require durability.
Working with large slabs of hard stones requires very strenuous effort. Even experienced carvers can spend up to 80 hours working on a relatively simple piece., Carving is a subtractive process, not an additive one. Unlike adding more paint to a portrait, carving involves taking away stone to create the piece's shape.


Limit your stone size to something you will finish in a relatively short time. This is especially important if you are trying your hand at sculpting for the first time and are unsure of whether you will enjoy the process.
The suggested size of stone blocks for sculpting is 15-25 lbs. Blocks that are smaller than 15 lbs will break if carved with a hammer and chisel. Any larger, and completing your sculpture will take much longer than you desire.
If you intend on using soapstone to sculpt a heart-shaped pendant, then you can most likely work with a block well under 15 lbs. Just remember that you will most likely have to use other, less accurate tools like harder rocks or a file to shape it. You will also have fewer chances to correct any mistakes you accidentally make during the carving process.

, Since you're working with natural materials, it won't be unusual to experience structural flaws. Finding a stone with few flaws will reduce the likelihood that your stone will break when carving.


Cracks and fissures are sometimes easiest to see when the stone is wet. Use a spray bottle or sprinkle water over your stone. If you find any cracks, try to follow it to see where it ends. A crack that goes all the way around a stone is in danger of breaking during the carving process.Tap larger stone blocks with a hammer or the back of a chisel. If the block makes a ""ringing"" sound, there is a higher chance that your stone is solid in the area you are hitting it. If it gives off a dead ""thud"" and no ring, chances are there is a crack that is absorbing the energy of the tap.
Ask an experienced carver or a store employee to help you find a sturdy stone to work with. If you are a beginner and do not have experience judging the integrity of a stone, acquire your stone from a stone carving supplier instead of a stone yard.

, Even if you are carving small quantities of stone, the stone itself may contain asbestos or silica. These are both harmful if inhaled.


To help reduce the amount of dust, wet the rock first before carving. Also, work in an outdoor environment (in the yard or on a porch is optimal.If working with a larger block (25 lbs for instance), set up a fan to blow away the dust as you work.
Types of protection:Dust mask: cheap, minimal protection against dust for small jobs.Disposable respirator with N95+ filters: cheap, minimal protection against dust and silica.Half-face or full-face respirator with N95+ filters: good protection against dust and silica. Only some are rated for asbestos.


, If you wear a prescription pair of glasses, cover those with the goggles as well.


Small stone chips can easily enter your eye when using a hammer and chisel. Though this isn't a potentially lethal risk like inhalation of stone dust, it can still be quite painful. It will also impair your vision, making sculpting very difficult to do accurately.
If you're working with a small stone, you can wear protective glasses instead of goggles. Though you won't be able to wear these easily over a pair of prescription glasses, they won't fog up as much as goggles.
Over time, safety goggles become scratched and can obscure your vision. Be prepared with spares to replace them in case significant scratches occur. You can purchase protective eye wear from most hardware stores., Stone can be abrasive and carving it can cause blisters, scrapes, or cuts.


The more experienced you get and the more callouses you develop, the less likely you'll need gloves. Still, it is better to be more protected than less. A good pair of gloves may even prevent accidental cuts from tool usage.
You don't need a fancy pair of gloves for smaller or medium sized stones. Since you won't be working for long periods or with power tools, an everyday pair of gardening gloves may be sufficient., Online retailers like Amazon sell starter carving kits for $30.00. Alternately, local art stores and home gardening companies offer multiple types of carving kits. Although you may not need all these tools for soapstone and other softer stones, they will make your carving quicker and more precise. Here's a quick guide to the tools you may need:


Soft hammer: A hammer with two wide, flat faces for striking chisels. Start with a 1.5 – 2 lb hammer if you have an average build.Chisels: The flat chisel is the most essential tool, with a simple, two-sided tip. Toothed chisels, which have multiple prongs, are optional but will aid in fine shaping and carving.Files: Used for achieving the final shape. Choose a file suited to the size of your carving.
, You will need to rest your sculpted piece on this sandbag as you work on it.


Fill the sandbag with the large, inexpensive cat litter instead of sand. Sand is too heavy and settles too well to provide the necessary support for your stone.Be sure you purchase the larger, cheaper kitty litter. The more expensive kind tends to clump together like sand. The cheaper kitty litter is more lightweight and will allow you to support your stone in many positions.
Tie the sandbags closed with twine, leaving plenty of empty space in the bag. You need that space for resting your stone comfortably.

, It is best to visualize your piece beforehand because sculpting requires abstract and spatial thinking. Although your drawing will be 2D, it will help you better visualize how your 3D item will need to be sculpted.


Alternately, you can work with clay to create a ""rough draft"" of your sculpted piece.This way, you can add and remove clay until your desired shape is achieved. This will not only help better develop your idea, it will prevent you from removing stone that you wish you had kept.
For beginning sculptors, it is recommended that you begin with an abstract shape. Avoid making detailed pieces like human statues. Learning how to use various tools while also trying to make things symmetrical and precise can be frustrating and overwhelming

, Similar to wood, the grain or bed is the direction in which the rock was formed.


Wet the stone to better see the bed lines, which often appear as distinctive color patterns. Carving along these lines will ensure better structural integrity.
Try to keep the grain running with the length of the design. Try to avoid breaking the stone perpendicularly to the bed line, as it will most likely be more difficult to break and will break unpredictably.

, This will be the blueprint for carving your stone.


Though you can also use a pencil or marker, chances are the graphite from the pencil will vanish almost instantly. The ink from the pen or marker can sink into the stone and stain it permanently. Using crayons allows you to wash off the drawing as necessary and also provides a wide variety of colors to use as alternative shapes your sculpture might take.
Be sure you mark your design on all sides of the stone. Maintain the height and width of the form on each side. Remember, your piece will be 3-dimensional and will need to be evenly carved.

, For example, if you are right handed, you will hold the hammer in your right hand.


Grasp the chisel at its midpoint, similar to how you would hold a microphone. Move your thumb to the side of the chisel where your other fingers are situated. This grip will feel weird at first, but it will keep you from striking your thumb with the hammer by accident.
Hold your chisel firmly and keep it touching the stone at all times. Allowing your chisel to bounce and jiggle in your hands while you strike it will result in inaccurate, unpredictable breaks in the stone.
If carving along an edge, use a flat chisel instead of a toothed one. Having only some of your teeth on the rock while striking it can cause the teeth to break off, making your chisel useless and creating a potential hazard.
Angle your chisel at about 45 degrees or lower. Striking the stone head-on will create what is called a ""stone bruise."" This causes the stone to turn white and reflect more light, creating a blemish in your final piece., If your angle is right, chips of stone will come off.


If your chisel simply becomes embedded into the stone and does not produce stone chips, your angle is most likely too steep. Change your position to a shallower angle and consider carving from a different direction. Striking at steep angles can cause a stone bruise.
Carving at too shallow an angle will cause your chisel to skip off the stone, removing nothing. This is more common on harder and smoother stones. To fix this, strike at a deeper angle or use the toothed chisel.

, For smaller stones, keeping the stone in a secure location while carving can be very difficult and will make you more exhausted trying to keep it steady manually.


If the stone is moving - even if it is rocking just a bit - you're still losing energy from your movements, which could be removing more stone. Fix this by placing the stone directly on top of the sandbag.
Carve standing up rather than sitting down. This will help you angle your chisel down towards the floor, which will maximize each hammer blow and reduce stone movement. It is common to have to readjust the stone's position on the sandbag every few minutes.
If you still find your stone moving, lean against it with your body while pushing it against you. Be sure the part you are carving is facing away from you.
If carving on a folding table, place your sandbag and stone over the legs at one end. The table is strongest there, and more of your energy will go into removing the stone instead of making the table flex., Since the stone becomes less thick and less supported towards the edges, it can break in uncontrolled ways.


Carving towards the edges can cause you to lose stone that you want to keep. To avoid this, carve with your chisel facing toward the center. Or, you could work along the corner/edge rather than across it.
If there is absolutely no way to avoid carving over an edge, use slow, gentle hammer blows. Although you can use special glue to repair lost stone, the glue lines themselves will be evident in your final product.

, Remember that even the most optimal stone slab may still have minor cracks along the surface. Reduce the amount of lost stone by working with the cracks, not against them.


Use chisels along the direction of the cracks instead of at a right angle. Any crack, regardless of size, is a place where one side of the stone is not strongly bonded to the other. Carving near it will chip off tiny flakes on either side, making it more difficult to file. This is a significant concern when working with softer stones.
To avoid flaking, use files when your stone is approaching its final form. Chisel use puts more stress on the stone than files do and will make the crack more visible. Filing along the crack will help smooth it out and disguise it better., Filing is best for creating fine detail, smoothing out chisel marks, and refining the final shape of your piece.


Most stone carving files have uni-directional teeth, meaning that they only cut in one direction. The proper way to use this file is to push it away from you rather than grinding it back and forth via the traditional method.
Grinding the file back and forth may be effective, but it will also wear down your files quickly. Instead, push the file away from you and then lift it up. Return the file to its original position and push again. An added benefit of filing this way is that it gets the file out of view after each stroke, letting you see the surface more as you work.
Types of files:Straight steel files: basic, cheap option suitable for soft stone.Riffler files: files in various specialized shapes for detail work. Italian rifflers tend to be the highest quality.Structured carbide or diamond files: Available in all file shapes, these expensive materials are necessary for hard stone.


, Epoxy is a special glue that typically comes in two components that you have to mix before applying.


Gluing stones back together is typically reserved for when you are working with larger stone slabs and losing a significant piece means compromising your entire design (for example, if you lost the ""arm"" portion of your statue sculpture).
For smaller sculptures and carvings, you simply need to rethink your sculpture. Instead of carving a heart, maybe now you will decide to carve an arrow.

, Removing chisel marks and scratches will make your stone look more refined and professional.


The amount of grit refers to how many grains of grit there are per square inch. The higher the grit, the finer the sanded product will be. For sanding the softer stones suggested above, avoid sandpaper with grit 80 and below. These are coarser grits and may damage your final product.
It is recommended that you sand the stone while it is wet. Use the wet/dry brand of sandpaper, since standard sandpaper will fall apart when it gets wet.Sanding dry is helpful because it allows you to see cracks and marks as you work, but it will definitely require the use of a respirator. To avoid spending more as well as creating harmful dust, wait for your stone to dry after each sanding session. Remember the areas where you spot any blemishes, and then re-wet the stone and continue sanding. This technique will require patience but will save you money and ensure your safety.

Wash your brick with a mild (10% or less) solution of muriatic acid, rinse them, and stack them to dry.

",How to Clean Used Brick," You may find these at a construction job site where a building is being torn down, a demolition landfill, or from a building or chimney you are tearing down yourself.;
, Cleaning old brick is a difficult and time consuming project, so make sure you invest the time and energy in usable brick.

, Putting a large piece of 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood on saw horses may suit this purpose.

, You will want to lay the cutting edge of the chisel right on the seam where the mortar meets the clay of your brick, and strike it with your hammer with a cleaving action. Often, the mortar will pop off cleanly, especially from smooth textured brick.

,, Rubbing stones are rectangular blocks made from an abrasive material with a wood or plastic handle fastened to them.

,"
"
Wet down the brick with a garden hose.,
Tap the chisel parallel to the brick to remove excess mortar.,
Wipe off excess mortar with a hard wire brush.",How to Clean Mortar Off Bricks2," Ensure that the mortar has had at least 7 days to dry before trying to remove the dried on mortar. Saturating the wall with water before you chisel will make removing the mortar easier and can protect your bricks from being damaged. Fully saturate the brick before you start working with a garden hose or with buckets of water., Hold the chisel at a 20° to 30° angle against the face of your wall on areas that have built-up mortar. Lightly tap on the end of the chisel and start to break the dried up mortar from off the wall. Start from the top and work your way to the bottom. Continue to work slowly and carefully until most of the mortar is removed from the wall.Break up larger pieces of mortar into smaller more manageable pieces instead of trying to remove it all at once.
Lime mortar is easier to remove than cement based mortar using this method.

, Go in a back and forth motion over the face of the brick to remove any broken up mortar dust. Try to scrape off any stubborn mortar that wasn't removed from chiseling. Do not spend too much time in one area or you may discolor the brick in that area."

Wear the proper safety equipment.,
Read the instructions on the back of the acid.,
Dilute the muriatic acid.,
Wet down the brick with water.,
Apply the acid with an acid-resistant brush.,
Let the acid sit for five minutes.,
Scrub the mortar away with a brush.,
Rinse the acid off with several gallons of water.",How to Clean Mortar Off Bricks3," Wear acid-proof gloves, goggles, and an NIOSH-approved respirator equipped with the appropriate acid-grade filter when working with acid. You can find this safety equipment at the hardware store or online. Lay plastic sheets down at the base of the wall to act as drop cloths for the acid.Keep a box of baking soda around to pour it on yourself if acid splashes onto your skin. Caustic chemicals from the muriatic acid could cause chemical burns.

, Read the information and warnings provided with the product that you've purchased. Follow the dilution amounts and process on the back of the packaging. Typically, you'll want to create a solution that is one part muriatic acid to nine parts water.


Never mix muriatic acid with other chemicals.
Do not use acid for lightly colored or cream-colored bricks. The acid can discolor them and weaken their joints., Fill an acid-resistant bucket up with water first, then add the muriatic acid. This will prevent splashback which could potentially spray acid onto you., Before you apply the acid to the wall, it's important that it's fully saturated with water. Applying the muriatic acid directly on a dry brick may damage your wall., Purchase an acid resistant brush online so that the bristles don't disintegrate while you apply it to the brick. Dip the brush into the acid solution that you created and apply it in a layer over a small portion of the brick that you want to clean. Apply the acid in a small area to make sure that there isn't an adverse reaction with the brick in your wall., Allow the acid to soak into the mortar on the bricks and break it down. If the acid is working, it will start to bubble and fizz when it comes into contact with the mortar. Do not let the acid fully dry on the brick or it could damage them.If you notice that there is discoloration on the brick, stop using the acid.

, Use a medium bristle brush and scrub the face of the brick vigorously. Avoid scrubbing in the joints of the brick or you may weaken the mortar that holds the brick in place. Scrape the sludge that's created from the mortar and acid onto your drop cloth. Continue to scrub until all of the dried on mortar is removed., As you work, make sure that none of the acid dries to the brick. Dried acid can weaken the brick and discolor it. Always keep a garden hose or a bucket filled with water close by and rinse away the acid after you're done scrubbing away the mortar.

Do not use glass blocks to build load-bearing walls.,
Allow for expansion.,
Always use the spacers to maintain the alignment of the blocks.",How to Build With Glass Blocks," A glass block wall with other construction on top must have a suitable and correctly supported lintel above it.


Glass blocks should always be built within a frame so that edges are protected and made neat.You cannot cut the blocks so the framing, ideally timber, must be built to suit the size of the feature. The blocks are 190 x 190 x 80mm and the spacing between each block is 10mm approximately.





;
, When the blocks are to be used in an area affected by temperature changes, for example as a shower enclosure side or a panel alongside the front door, you must allow for the expansion and contraction of the glass. The normal white mortar used to bond the blocks must not be used around the perimeter of the feature against the framing.

You must use Wickes Expansion Foam to infill the gap between the glass and frame. Coat this with white silicone for a neat sealed finish.






If the area of the feature exceeds two square metres or if the glass blocks are being used as a shower enclosure wall or as exterior door side panels which could be broken away by an intruder you must add reinforcing. As you build, bed Wickes Stainless Steel Reinforcing Rods into the mortar between blocks in every third row both horizontally and vertically. Horizontally lay the rods, staggered in pairs, in the mortar with each pair overlapping the next by at least 150mm for continuous strength. Diagram B. The ends of the rods, which reach the framing or sidewalls should be inserted into 15mm deep holes drilled into the framing or walls. Make the holes as the walling is built up to ensure alignment. Vertically simply insert the rods into the mortar as the blocks are built up.






The use of the reinforcing rods will add considerably to the strength of the construction.

, Not only do they ensure alignment, but also prevent the weight of the blocks compressing the mortar before it cures. spacers are not visible when the wall is complete. Chart A gives a guide of how many you will need. Wickes White Mortar be mixed to a stiff consistency for best adhesion to the glass, which is non-absorbent. Fill the voids and remove excess mortar squeezed out of joints with a clean damp cloth as the work proceeds. Diagram E. Each 12.5kg bag of white mortar is sufficient for between 20 and 25 blocks approximately.

Wipe marble surfaces with a wet cloth.,
Wipe countertops dry with a separate cloth.,
Spread a baking soda mixture over the marble polish it.,
Sprinkle crushed chalk over your marble to polish it further.",How to Clean White Marble1," Use only warm tap water, as many household cleaners are too harsh for marble counters. Wipe the length of the counter with a wet cloth. Microfiber cloths are best for this if you have them, they’ll give the counter a better scrub without needing to use a household cleaner.


If you need to clean your counter more thoroughly, you can use commercial cleaners specifically designed for marble.
For marble floors, passing a dust mop on the surface regularly should be enough for regular cleaning.
This kind of cleaning should be done daily to clear crumbs or any dust that may have accumulated on the counter, it won’t clean serious stains.;
, Don’t let the marble just air dry, since marble is easily marked by water spots. Use a microfiber cloth to wipe countertops until they’re dry., Mix three tablespoons (44ml) of baking soda with one quart (946ml) of water. Use a shammy to spread this mixture over your marble surface.


Let the mixture sit on your marble for a few hours before wiping it away with a wet cloth., For best results, you’ll want to use a box of white chalk and use a mortar and pestle to crush it into fine dust. Use a shammy to wipe the counter in circles, buffing it and bringing out the shine.


Wipe the chalk dust away with a dry cloth after buffing it."

Mix paper towel pieces, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide in a bowl.,
Place the paper towel poultice over the stain.,
Seal the poultice with plastic wrap.,
Remove the plastic wrap and wash the area with warm water.",How to Clean White Marble2," Rip up a couple sheets of paper towels and place them in a bowl. Note that the amount of paper towel you use depends on the size of the stain you’re trying to remove. Pour a few drops of ammonia in the bowl, and enough hydrogen peroxide to completely soak the paper towel chunks.


When handling ammonia, you should wear gloves to avoid skin irritation and burns.
If the stain you’re trying to remove is quite large, you may want to fold up a paper towel instead.
Attempt this method if you’re dealing with old or tenacious stains that can’t be removed with more conventional means., Pick the saturated chunks out of the bowl and place them over the stain. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, or the hydrogen peroxide and ammonia might leak out over your marble. If you’re dealing with a vertical surface, the paper towel chunks should be wet enough to just stick on., Stretch a length of plastic wrap over the poultice and stain. Apply pressure to its sides, so that it completely seals the poultice, then use clear adhesive tape to secure the plastic wrap.


Use a toothpick to poke a couple of holes in the plastic wrap to allow airflow.Let the poultice sit for two to three days.

, You should be able to lift the plastic wrap easily with just your fingers. Pick the paper towel poultice off of your surface and throw the chunks away. Then, dampen a cloth with warm water and wipe the area clean.


After washing the marble, use a dry cloth or paper towel to dry the area."

Wipe away spills quickly.,
Choose your cleaners carefully.,
Use coasters and cutting boards on marble countertops.",How to Clean White Marble3," Marble is a sensitive, porous surface, and spilled liquids can stain or etch these surfaces. Acidic substances like coffee, juice, wine or toiletries are especially damaging to marble. Use a microfiber cloth or paper towels to mop up and wipe spills as soon as they happen., Even general purpose cleaners can damage marble surfaces, especially if they contain acids or alkalis. If you’re going to apply a cleaner directly to your marble countertop or floors, make sure it’s specially formulated to clean marble., Condensation rings on marble countertops can etch and stain the surface, so make sure to place coasters under any glass placed on them. When cutting fruits and vegetables, cutting boards will prevent any acids or juices from staining the countertop."

, Divide the total footage by 100 to determine the number of “squares” in the roof.

, It takes 3 bundles to cover a square if you use 3-tab shingles, the most common type.

, Add 10 percent to the shingle estimate to account for waste.


If your roof has hips and valleys, make it 15 percent because of waste in cutting shingles to fit the valleys.

, Measure the length and width of each portion of the roof, multiply length by width for each plane, and add the planes together for the total square footage.

, Roofers measure surfaces in squares of 100 feet (30.75 square meters). Divide the total footage by 100 to find the number of squares in the roof.

, The #15 type is most commonly used, and one roll of #15 underlayment covers 4 squares.


If you’re using #15 underlayment and your roof slope is greater than 4:12, use 1 layer. If the slope is between 3:12 and 4:12, double the amount and put down 2 layers.

, This metal strip, which goes beneath the underlayment, protects the edge of the roof from rot. You'll need the measurements of the rakes and eaves of the roof (side edges and bottom edge).

, At 4 nails per shingle, that’s about 320 nails per square.


For high-wind areas, use 6 nails per shingle, or 480 nails per square.
Inquire at the hardware store regarding the size of nail you’ll need and how many pounds you’ll need of that size; the number of nails per pound differs. The nails should be long enough to go ¾ inch into the roof.
Inquire at the hardware store regarding the amount of underlayment nails required. Use ¾-inch (1.8 cm) nails if the roof deck is ½ inch (1.2 cm) or 1-inch (2.5 cm) nails if the roof deck is 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) or greater. The nails should be 12 inches (30 cm) apart along the edges and 24 inches (60 cm) apart in the middle of the underlayment strip.

, While you can order special hip and ridge cap shingles, you can make your own by cutting a 3-tab shingle into 3 pieces. A bundle of 3-tab shingles will cover 35 lineal feet (9.2 m).

Identify sources of heat.,
Provide equal air flow.,
Add more insulation.,
Seal and Insulate your ducts.,
Check your attic lighting.",How to Get Ice Dams Off Your Roof1," Ice dams are caused by fluctuations in temperature on various parts of the roof. Such fluctuations occur when electrical wiring, exhaust vents, or uneven insulation cause parts of your roof to heat up, but leave the eaves and gutters cold. So be on the lookout for any heat sources in your attic that might be causing ice dams., You can keep your entire roof at an equal temperature by installing a ridge vent and soffit vents around your roof. These vents help to circulate cold air under the entire roof, eliminating the ""hot spots"" and ""cold spots"" that cause ice dams.Make sure you use soffit and ridge vents that have the same size of opening. It is generally accepted that you will need 1 sq. ft. of opening for every 300 sq. ft. of attic space.Make sure you use baffles at all the eaves of your roof to ensure proper airflow from the soffit vents.For instructions on how to install these vents, click here.

, The warm air from your attic space might be the cause of your ice dams. If this is the case, you will want to install new or additional insulation to your attic floor to prevent the hot air from heating your rooftop. For more on how to install insulation, click here., The ducts in your house carry air of varying temperatures all over the place. You want to ensure that warm air is not escaping from these ducts. Try spreading fiber-reinforced mastic on all the joints of your HVAC and exhaust ducts.You will want to cover the joints thoroughly with R-5 or R-6 foil-faced fiberglass., Old-style lighting fixtures in your attic could be generating ambient heat, increasing the temperature huge temperature differences in different areas of your attic. To fix this problem, you should replace all the old lighting fixtures with “IC” fixtures that can be covered in insulation."

Attach yourself to the chimney or another secure point using a safety rope, if necessary. Wear long sleeves and pants to avoid getting the cleaning agent on your skin.Before venturing out onto the roof, let someone know you’ll be doing so. That way, if you suffer an accident or injury on the roof, they’ll be able to find you.;
, Before using a cleaning agent to clean your asphalt shingles use a leaf blower or broom to sweep the shingles clean. Get rid of leaves, branches, and other debris that that may be on the shingles. This will make your efforts more effective and prevent you from dangerous situations like tripping on branches.When using the leaf blower to clear debris, blow from the ridge toward the edge of the roof. This will prevent branches and other debris from lodging beneath the shingles’ edges.There’s no need to wash the shingles before using the chemical cleaner.

, If you clean your roof on a day that is too hot or sunny, the cleaner will not have much time to work before it evaporates. Plus, it is easier to work outdoors on days that are less hot and humid. Therefore, clean asphalt shingles on cloudy days.Additionally, don’t clean your asphalt tiles on days when the cleaning agent could freeze. In other words, only clean your asphalt shingles on days when the temperature will remain above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius).
Stay off the roof during very windy days., Before you get started, place bags over shrubs or plants that might be sprayed indirectly as a result of your cleaning. This will protect them from the potentially lethal chemicals in the cleaning agent., You cannot effectively clean asphalt shingles with just soap and water. Instead, you’ll have to choose a specially-formulated cleaning agent. Whenever possible, choose a noncorrosive and environmentally friendly cleaning product.Commonly used cleaning agents include Roof Shampoo and Shingle Roof Mold Cleaner OX.
If you don’t want to buy a commercial cleaner, you can easily make your own by mixing equal amounts of laundry-strength chlorine bleach and water., Fill a low-pressure agricultural sprayer or a pump-up garden sprayer with the asphalt cleaning agent. For more information regarding how to pour your cleaning agent into the spraying device, consult manufacturer directions.Generally, you’ll need to unscrew the tops of the spraying device and the cleaning agent, fill the spraying device, then screw the tops of the cleaning agent and the spraying device back on.
Don’t use a pressure washer to apply the cleaning agent. Doing so can damage your asphalt shingles. Use a low-pressure sprayer rated about 30 PSI., After clambering out onto your roof, spray the asphalt shingles you wish to clean. Generally, you’ll need to point the nozzle of the spraying device toward the shingle you wish to clean, then depress the handle. After applying the cleaning agent, allow it to work its magic for about 20 minutes.The exact method by which you can spray the asphalt shingles varies slightly depending on the type of spraying device you’ve decided to use. Consult manufacturer directions for more information.
The amount of cleaning agent you’ll need to use depends on the number and size of the asphalt shingles you wish to clean. Generally, the more shingles you want to clean, the more cleaning agent you’ll need.
You can identify asphalt shingles that need to be cleaned by looking for black, green, or blue stains. This indicates the presence of algae or moss.

, After about 20 minutes, spray the asphalt shingles with water from your garden hose. This will rinse away excess cleaning agent. If it’s more convenient, empty the low-pressure sprayer and fill it with water to rinse your asphalt shingles., If moss or algae growth on your asphalt shingles is particularly thick, use a medium-stiff bristled broom or brush to loosen it with a gentle back-and-forth scraping motion. Don’t use too much force, however, or you could loosen the mineral granule from the shingle.If you’re having a hard time getting your asphalt shingles clean, let the roof dry, then spray it with the cleaning agent and rinse it with water again.

, Some asphalt shingles contain copper. Since copper is toxic to algae, this sort of asphalt shingle will naturally stay free of algae. This sort of shingle is especially preferable if you live in an area prone to algae growth.Alternately, you could affix a strip of zinc or copper just below the ridge of your roof. The zinc or copper particles will trickle down the roof when it rains, inhibiting algae growth.

, If your asphalt shingles are beneath tree cover, algae is more likely to grow. Trim back tree branches to let the sunlight naturally discourage the growth of algae., Even when you aren’t preparing to clean your asphalt shingles, it’s a good idea to venture out onto your roof semi-regularly to keep it clear of branches, leaves, and other plant matter. Doing so will discourage algae and moss growth."

Use a snow rake.,
Use a fan.,
Use calcium chloride.,
Place heat tape in the gutter itself.",How to Get Ice Dams Off Your Roof2," Snow rakes are long-handled aluminum “rakes” designed to remove snow from high places without having to climb all the way up to the roof. You may not be able to get rid of the ice dam, but, using this rake, you can get rid of the snow that is accumulating behind the ice dam and brush it away to prevent any further water damage.Purchase a rake with wheels on it to avoid damaging the shingles on your roof., A simple way to stop an ice dam in its tracks is to refreeze it. One way to do this is to bring a box fan up to your attic, point it directly at the areas where water is leaking in and turn it on. The increased airflow will push cold air towards the water, causing the water to refreeze. This is not a permanent solution, but will function as a temporary stop-gap measure., Fill a woman's stocking with calcium chloride, and lay it in position directly over the ice dam in your gutter. If necessary, use a long handled rake or other tool to help get it in position. Over time, the calcium chloride will clear a channel in the ice dam, allowing the water on your roof to escape.Never use rock salt for this, as it will do more damage to your roof than it will to the ice.Alternatively, you can fill paper bags with calcium chloride, and toss them up on to the roof, just above the ice dam. With any luck, the bags, after becoming wet, will rip and spread the calcium chloride into the dam, effectively melting it away.

, Heat tape goes by many different names, but they all perform the same function. They are small strips of material that will prevent ice buildup, allowing the water to flow freely through small channels out of your gutter. You will want to run this material all the way through your gutters to ensure that ice doesn’t form at the end of the gutter. This will allow water to escape through the channels.You can install heat tape yourself, but it is better left to professionals. You really don’t want to be climbing a ladder in the dead of winter.
Heat tape costs anywhere from $30 to $60 per running foot, with installation included."

Go to any RV supply store and tell them you want to clean your EPDM roof.",How to Clean a Rubber Roof," How often should this be done? According to DICOR (A leading manufacturer of EPDM roofing material) all that is necessary to maintain your warranty is a required periodic cleaning at least 3 to 4 times per year.;
, Whether a person goes up on an EPDM roof once a year, or four times a year, a rubber roof will require a good inspection on a regular basis. Keeping it clean will allow you to do a more thorough inspection. If you cannot see the surface of your rubber roof due to dirt and grime, it is time to clean it.

,, This will save you a lot of clean up later.

,, You should work on one 2 to 3 sq ft area at a time.

,, Rinse this dirty mop in a bucket of clean water.

,,, This can occur anywhere there is a penetration like the air conditioner, various vents, etc. Even small pin-holes can be a problem that will allow water penetration.

,, Cut off the tip making an opening of approximately 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).

, Allow time for it to seek its own level.


This is not as complex as it sounds, cleaning and inspecting the roof on a regular bases will allow you to become familiar with the normal condition of your roof. So, the odd things will start to jump out at you.






The black mold spots that grow over time on this roof are not a major concern. Just clean them off with the above mentioned rubber roof cleaner, and if you want, put a coating of UV (ultra-violet) protectant on. The stuff looks like white paint, and give it a nice finish… just make sure that ANY coating applied directly to the EPDM does not contain any petroleum distillates. This stuff really messes with EPDM. EPDM will blister and this will allow water to seep in to the newly exposed wood sub frame.







, They will make sure you have the correct cleaning material. Just make sure that it does not have ANY petroleum distillates in it.

Explore the wide variety of material choices you will find in choosing a new roof.",How to Choose the Color of Roofing Shingles," The color of your shingles will help keep energy bills from skyrocketing.


Your roof color can affect the temperature in your attic by 20 to 40 degrees and make a real difference in heating or cooling your home.
White or light shingles reflect sunlight and help keep the temperature of your home down.
Dark shingles absorb heat and will help homes in colder climates stay warm. They also help melt snow and ice from your roof.;
,


Dark gray or black work well with a gray or blue house.
Use a brown or mix of cream and brown roofing shingles if you have a brown, cream or tan colored house.
Use dark gray or black on a white house. It will give your house a traditional look.
Green, red or yellow-painted homes give you more flexibility in choice with shingle color. You can use brown, gray or black.

, Curb appeal adds to the value of your home.


Neutral colors are safe and will stay in style for many years. They help ensure a good resale value. Tans, creams, brown, blacks, grays and clays are among colors which can be considered neutral.
If you want to be trendier, think about using color combinations such as a palate of various tones of brown or a mixture of blues, blacks and grays. Be sure to consult with a roofing expert to get a professional looking roof.
High-contrast colors highlight features of your home while low-contrast colors tend to hide defects.

, Dark colors tend to make homes look smaller while lighter colors do the reverse.

,


Check with your neighborhood association, if you have one, to make sure your choice of roofing color does not violate any neighborhood rules or covenants.
Even if you don't have set rules to follow, think about how your roof will look alongside your neighbor's house. Try not to duplicate their roof unless that is the norm in your neighborhood. On the other hand, try not to make it clash. Be sure the end result is harmonious.

, Take samples of all permanent colors contained in your home's exterior to your roofer or to the building supply store if you intend to roof your home yourself. Take time to speak to an expert about the best color choice for your new roof.

A Spanish style home might look good with reddish clay-colored roof shingles which would mimic traditional clay roofing tiles, for example. A casual ranch house might look good with a combination of colors while a traditional colonial would not.
Drive around several neighborhoods to get an idea of what color of roofing would look best on your home. Look for houses similar to yours in color scheme and architectural style.

,


Clay tiles are traditionally shades of red or tan. Today the color choices offer a broader spectrum from which to choose. Be sure your tiles have been fired in a kiln so the colors are baked in and will not fade over time.
Natural thin layers of slate can be used for roofing material but this type of material is quite expensive. Although there is variety, colors are limited to those found in nature.
Concrete tiles can be made to look like wood shakes, slate or clay tiles and can come in a wide variety of colors.
Metal roofing usually comes in sheets which give your roof a distinctive look by using long vertical lines. Today, however, metal roofing can be made to look like wood shakes, composite shingles or even clay tiles. Metal roofing is energy efficient, fire resistant and strong.

Wear non-slip shoes with a good tread.,
Wear a safety belt or harness.,
Wait for a cool and sunny day to clean the roof.",How to Clean Copper Roof1," When working on your rooftop, it's important to have the proper footwear so that you can stay steady and keep your balance. Otherwise, there's the potential to slip and injure yourself. Sneakers or boots with a deep tread are typically best for working on rooftops.There are also boots that are made specifically for those who do roofing work. These boots have a special pad on the bottom of the shoe.;
, A harness will keep you from falling off your roof if you slip or lose your balance. Strap the harness on according to the manufacturer instructions and make sure that it's completely secured. Attach the other end of the harness to the chimney or a window on the opposite side of the house. Only leave enough slack on the chord so that you can clean the area.You can purchase a complete roof harness system at department stores or online., Do not try to wash your roof if it's raining, snowing, or windy. These conditions can make you unstable while you wash it, which could be hazardous. If it's recently rained, make sure that the roof is dry before trying to stand on it. You also need to make sure that it's not overly hot outside, or the copper roof could get too hot to clean.The best day to clean a copper roof is a cool and sunny day.

Wear non-slip shoes with good traction.,
Walk where the tiles overlap.,
Keep to the flattest and driest areas of your roof.,
Work with another person.,
Consider hiring a professional to clean your roof.",How to Clean a Tile Roof1," Tiles get slippery, especially once they are wet and covered in a cleaning treatment. Wear shoes with good grip on the soles, such as athletic shoes, to help you maintain your balance as you work.Avoid wearing flip-flops or other slip-on shoes without good traction.
Additionally, it’s a good idea to wear old clothes, rubber gloves and eye protection.;
, The strongest and sturdiest areas on your tile roof are located where the tiles overlap.If for some reason you are forced to step directly on the tiles, always place your feet on the lower portion. The lower part of the tile has the most support beneath it., These are the least slippery areas. Plan out your work so that you are always able to work from a dry location on the roof. Try to stay on the flattest areas, as well. Flat areas make it possible to distribute your weight evenly, allowing for better balance and foot traction., If possible, have a partner help you from the ground. Your partner can pass things up to you, which prevents you from having to go up and down the ladder frequently. A partner will also have a different viewpoint from which to observe the roof, and can help to direct you as needed., Even if you take all of the necessary safety precautions, this can still be a dangerous job. This is especially true if you’ve never cleaned your own roof before. For these reasons, most people prefer to hire a professional for this task. The extra expense will be worth it if it means ensuring your own safety.A professional will also have all of the necessary tools and supplies on hand for this job, which means you won’t have to buy them yourself.

Brush all the leaves and debris off the roof.,
Scrape up any bird droppings on the roof.,
Rinse the roof with buckets of distilled water.,
Dry off the roof with clean rags.",How to Clean Copper Roof2," Use a soft bristled push broom to get dirt, plant matter, and other debris off the roof. Work the broom in a pushing motion to get all loose debris off the rooftop.To prevent buildup on the roof, you can trim low-hanging branches around your house.
The soft bristles on the brush will not scratch your copper.

, Because bird droppings contain acid, they can cause corrosion on your copper roof. Use a plastic or wooden spatula to scrape up the bird droppings. You can use a damp cotton cloth to wipe up the rest of the bird droppings after you scrape., Use buckets of distilled water to rinse off the rest of the roof. Distilled water does not contain the minerals that could discolor the patina or harm the copper in the roof.If you don't have distilled water, you can boil water from your tap.

, Work in circular motions to dry off the roof. This will prevent water streaks and marks when the water on your roof dries.Do not use rags that were washed with fabric softener because it could leave streaks on your copper roof.

Combine 5 cups (125 g) of flour and 1.5 (11.72 g) tablespoons of salt.,
Pour white vinegar into the bucket.,
Mix the solution together until it forms a paste.,
Apply the paste to a portion of your copper roof.,
Let the paste dry for 15 minutes.,
Scrub the paste off with a damp cloth or sponge.,
Rinse off the roof with distilled water.,
Dry off the roof with clean cotton rags.",How to Clean Copper Roof3," Use a 5-gallon bucket to create your deep cleaning paste. Once the dry ingredients are in the bucket, mix the them together until they are well incorporated. , Slowly pour 30 oz. of distilled white vinegar into the bucket and combine it with the flour and salt. You can purchase distilled white vinegar from the grocery store.Vinegar is acidic and will work away any tarnish that's on your copper roof.

, Mix the solution together in the bucket with a paint mixing stick. The consistency of the paste should resemble toothpaste when it's ready. If the paste is too thick, add more vinegar to the bucket., Smear the paste onto your roof with a painter's brush. Make sure that you create even layers of the paste so that the roof cleans uniformly. Test a small portion of the roof with this method before you clean the entire roof to make sure that the paste doesn't have any adverse reaction to your roof., As the paste dries, the acid in the vinegar will pick up some of the copper's old patina and restore the roof to it's original shiny and pink color., Work in small sections to make the cleaning manageable. When cleaning, use large circular motions to remove the rest of the dried paste from the roof.

, Fill buckets up with distilled or boiled water that's been cooled. Pour the buckets over the loosened paste so that it drains off the side of the roof., Pick up all the remaining moisture from the roof with a clean cloth. Completely drying the roof will prevent water marks.

Use a sturdy ladder to get up to the roof.,
Start on one side and work your way to the other side.,
Spray the roof with plain water to dislodge loose dirt and debris.,
Apply a chemical treatment formulated to kill plant life.,
Allow the treatment to soak according to the instructions.,
Rinse the chemical treatment off.",How to Clean a Tile Roof2," Carefully place your ladder against the building, near the area where you want to start cleaning. If there are areas that allow you to work from the ladder without having to get on the roof itself, take advantage of those. If you have to get immediately on the roof, remember to step where the tiles overlap., Starting on one side of the roof and working your way backwards to the other end will make it easy for you to remain in a dry location. The need to walk on wet tiles will virtually be eliminated, or at the very least, dramatically minimized., Using a pressure washer set to a low psi, rinse loose debris off your roof with clean water. Start at the ridge of your roof (the top) and spray down toward the gutters. Doing this ensures that debris is always heading in the right direction – off your roof. Once you finish one small section, move over and work on the next one, always starting at the ridge and working down to the gutters.Allow the roof to dry completely before applying the chemical solution.
If you don’t own one, a pressure washer can be rented for the day from most hardware stores.

, Moss, lichen, algae and other organic growths are the major issues when it comes to cleaning tile roofs, especially moss. Fill your pressure washer with an anti-moss/fungicide cleaning solution, mixing it as the product instructs. Use a low psi to spray the tiles with the treatment, starting on one side and slowly working your way to the opposite side of your roof.There are many products available at hardware stores to treat your tile roof. Make sure it includes a fungicide and advertises that it kills organic growth. Look for words like “anti-moss” “fungicide” “moss killer” and so on.

, Most products will direct you to let the treatment sit on the tiles for several minutes (or longer) so that the tile soaks it up. Allowing the chemical treatment to seep into the pores of the tile ensures that moss and other organic growths are fully eliminated. Follow the product instructions for specific time frames., Using a slightly higher psi, start rinsing the treatment off your roof with clean water. As before, start at one end and work your way to the other. Direct the spray at the top of the ridge and spray downward so that the treatment runs off the roof, taking moss, lichen and dirt along with it. Spend a little extra time on the areas with the most moss and staining; the pressure of the water will loosen any stubborn remains."
"
Perform regular cleanings.,
Repair minor damage as needed.,
Consider resealing, repriming and repainting the tiles.",How to Clean a Tile Roof3," Development of moss and other organic growths will vary, depending on the climate where you live. Once you see these growths start to appear on your roof, go through the cleaning process to remove them as soon as possible. Organic growths multiply quickly, so the faster you nip them in the bud, the better., Damaged tiles invite mold spores and mildew to grow on your roof more quickly than they would otherwise. Minor damage can become major and costly unless dealt with in a timely manner. Routinely inspect your roof for damage, especially after inclement weather. Replace and repair the tiles as needed., Immediately after you clean your tile roof is the perfect opportunity to strengthen it with a fresh coat of sealer, primer and paint. You don’t need to do this each time you clean your roof, but keep this in mind and take the opportunity to do it every few years, immediately after a treatment."
"
Interview potential roofers in person.,
Look for a roofer that is located close to your property.,
Ask to see each roofer's certificate of insurance and make sure the company has general liability and worker's compensation insurance.,
Ask how many workers it will take to finish the job and how experienced they are.

,
Learn what your local laws are regarding the licensing of contractors.,
Ask how long the roofer has been in business.,
Request contact information of 10 previous customers that the roofer has dealt with in the past year.,
Find out if the company has been involved with serious complaints from former clients.,
Read the proposed contract carefully.,
Establish a schedule.",How to Choose a Commercial Roofer,"


Proposals from different roofing businesses will vary greatly in price. This doesn't necessarily mean, though, that roofers submitting low bids will not complete the project as well as roofers submitting high bids. You will need to discuss the project in person with each roofer.
For about an hour, discuss the project and ask questions. The representative (often a salesperson or the owner of the company) should have knowledge of past projects and be well informed about your project.;
, A local business will be more concerned with maintaining a good reputation in your area.

, Also ask each roofer to mail you current certificates from the insurer before they start the job.


Workers' compensation insurance is not required in Texas.

,, Different counties have different requirements on whether contractors need to be licensed, and to what extent. You'll want to make sure your roofer has the necessary credentials.

, A longer history is usually better, although newer businesses can be fine choices as long as they have good references.

,


Call some or all of the previous customers, and take note of whether the customers were satisfied with the work done.
Ask former customers if the roofer stood behind its warranty and if the company seemed to be dedicated to the project.

, It is not unusual for a roofing business to have been involved with some disputes, but you want to make sure they were dealt with in a professional manner.


Licensing departments, as well as the Better Business Bureau, can help you learn more about past complaints that were filed against specific contractors.

,


Make sure the roofer has factored into the proposal every necessary component of the job, such as local ordinances.
Verify the quality of the parts being used. For example, you may want to know the model and manufacturer of the shingles being installed.

, Include a clause in the contract stipulating that the work must be completed by a certain date. These schedules are difficult to predict because of unforeseen obstacles such as bad weather, but there should be a reasonable deadline established.

Ensure you have the correct replacement tile as there are many different roof tiles on the market.,
Get onto the roof.,
Once you have safely gotten to the broken tile, you'll need to slightly lift the tiles that overlap the one to be removed.,
Place your new tile onto the brick trowel and reverse the steps for removing the tile.,
Ensure the tile is securely in place and is not interfering with any other tiles around it.,
Have a quick check across the roof while you're there to survey any other potential damage.",How to Change a Roof Tile," The most common tile types are concrete and terracotta.


You must ensure it is the same type of tile or it may not work and can result in damage even though you've tried to repair it. If you don't know what the tile is, take a tile with you to a roofing supplier and they should be able to match it for you.;
, Only do this if you know it can be done safely, using a stable ladder and perhaps even using climbing ropes to protect you in case of a fall, particularly with a roof that has a steep incline or is slippery. If you don't have a head for heights or you're not sure about how safe it is for you to get on the roof, call in a professional. Falling off a roof can be deadly.

, Do this using two pieces of timber to hold them up. Then, use a brick trowel to lift up the broken over the baton underneath and slide it down and out.

, Be sure to place the overlapping tiles back into position.

, Unless you're in a high wind area, the tile won't need to be nailed or wired into place. Check that all tiles are sitting properly.

, It's a good idea to know how well the roof is holding up in case any other tiles need replacing.

The two major categories of roof are flat and pitched,and one of the main things that will determine the actual style of roof you need is the shape of the building. It will be much more difficult to build a round roof onto a square building, for instance, so allow the shape of the structure to guide you. Some of the most common roof styles are: Gable roof: this looks like an inverted V, and is the easiest and most popular roof style in North America. There are also several variations on the gable roof that are designed for buildings that aren’t simple rectangles, including the saltbox roof, which is suited to join walls that are different heights.
Flat roof: these roofs are mostly flat, but usually have a bit of a slope. As such, they allow for outdoor living gardens or a living space on top.
Hip and pyramid roofs: as the name suggests, a pyramid roof is a roof in the shape of a pyramid and is designed for a square building. A hip roof uses the same basic shape, but is elongated and is designed for a rectangular building. The hip roof is also very popular in North America.
Gambrel roof: this is also known as the barn roof, as this style is often used on barns. This roof style maximizes the amount of usable space in the attic or top floor.
Shed roof: this is a flat roof style with a greater slope, and is most common on sheds, porches, and home additions.;
, Different types of roofs are more suitable for certain climates, so it’s important to know a few of these things before deciding what kind of roof to build. Not only should you consider how hot or how cold it gets, but also how much precipitation you receive.


Gable roofs are not suitable for areas with high winds, while the hip roof is much sturdier in high winds.
Flat roofs are practical in hot, dry climates, but not areas that receive high amounts of precipitation.
There are many types of pitched roofs, and these are more suitable for climates that receive more precipitation. The amount of snow and rain you receive will help you determine the actual pitch of the roof.
In temperate climates that see all four seasons and snow, the simplest pitch roofs are the best, as there are fewer places where leaves and needles can get stuck, and they allow snow and rain to run off easily.

, There are many types of roofs, and each roof can be made in various ways with different materials. However, some styles are more conducive to certain materials, while other styles don’t allow for specific materials.


For pitched roofs, the truss (the framework) can be made of wood or metal, and the outside can have wood or asphalt shingles, clay or concrete tiles, or metal sheeting.The type of truss you build will be suited for different weights, which may help you determine the exterior materials you use.
For flat roofs, you can use asphalt, metal, fiberglass, or poly-vinyl as the exterior,but shingles won’t work.
Algae-resistant asphalt shingles are suitable for humid climates, while clay tiles are popular in arid climates. Areas that receive heavy snowfall must have strong roofs built with durable materials, and metal or asphalt shingles are the most common exterior materials., Building a roof under an old tree may not be ideal if any heavy branches are liable to come down on it. Drainage is another thing to consider, because roofs should be equipped with a way to drain precipitation, and you don’t want the run-off running right into your yard or a neighbor’s yard. If you live in a neighborhood where the houses are built close together, you might need to build a roof with a smaller eave than you would otherwise.

, The pitch of a roof is the rise—the vertical angle of the roof—over the run (the horizontal measurement). Pitch ratios range from 2:12 to 12:12. A low-pitched roof would be 2:12, and it means that over the space of 12 inches, the roof only rises two inches. You can still walk on a 5:12 roof, which means the roof rises five inches over every 12 inches. The steepest pitch for a roof is 12:12, which creates a 45-degree angle, and where the roof vertically rises 12 inches for every 12 inches it goes horizontally., To determine material quantities, you need to do some calculations. Accuracy is key here, because miscalculations could lead to major overspending. The best way is to use a roofing calculator that can help you determine the area you’ll be working with and the material quantities you'll need.

, The plan should consist of a diagram of your roof that includes the style and shape, all the measurements, materials, and truss spacing.

, Once you’ve decided on the pitch for your roof and measured the area, you can purchase your materials. Prefabricated trusses are the quickest and easiest way to create a roof frame, and most new roofs today are built this way.Each roof truss has the rafters and ceiling joist built in. Allow two to three weeks lead time when you order trusses. Materials you may need to build a basic gable roof include:Prefabricated trusses
Sheathing (also known as decking) material, such as plywood or fiberglass
Underlayment, such as tar paper (and possibly an ice barrier in colder climates)
Roof covering, such as tiles, shingles, or metal
Roofing nails

, Once you’ve chosen your style, design, and materials, it’s time to actually build your roof. The process can be broken down into four main steps, and they are:


Framing: this is the construction and installation of the roof frame, which can be done with premade trusses.
Sheathing: this is the layer of material that goes on top of the frame and provides the surface of the roof.
Underlayment installation: this is a protective layer that covers the sheathing. This step may also include the installation of an ice barrier on top of the underlayment.
Roof cover installation: this layer goes on top of the underlayment and protects the roof from the elements.

, To complete this step, the wall frames of the building must already be level, plumb, and square. Use ladders or scaffolding if you are building the roof onto a building that is still a frame. Hoist the trusses onto the roof. This can be done either with many pairs of hands, or with the assistance of a crane.


Trusses are often spaced 12, 16, or 24 inches apart.Your spacing will depend on building codes and how much weight (snow) the roof will have to hold.
Without a crane, it will be easiest to hoist the trusses up onto the roof lying flat, and once there they can be raised into position.

, Before you can install the trusses, you will need to install temporary braces that the trusses can rest on until the sheathing and permanent bracing are installed. At the center of the back wall, nail the bottom half of one two-by-six board that's 16 feet long to the top of the outside wall, making sure you fasten it to a stud. The top half of the brace should extend over the top of the roof so it can be fastened to the first truss. Nail another two-by-six brace of the same length six feet to the left of this center brace, and a third brace six feet to the right of the center brace.Repeat the same steps to install three temporary braces at the front of the building.

, Install the two end trusses at the front and back of the building according to the manufacturer’s instructions, making sure you affix them to the temporary bracing.Take a batten that is slightly longer than the distance that will separate your trusses. Nail the batten to the end truss (at the back of the building) so that it juts out in a perpendicular fashion toward the front of the building. This will be affixed to the next truss as a temporary bracing.

, Working toward the front of the building, install the first standard truss according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nail it to the batten from the first truss as well. Take a new batten, one that’s long enough to attach to four properly spaced trusses, and nail this to the end truss and the first standard truss.


Continue installing the common or standard trusses at regular intervals, depending on your plan. As you reach the end of the batten, install progressively longer batten ties (going by four or so truss lengths), until you can install a batten that spans the length of the roof from one end truss to the other.
Some areas have building codes that dictate a roofing system must be attached to the structure below with steel connector plates or hurricane clips, so be sure you’re building your roof to code.
Once all the trusses are installed, install permanent bracing as per the truss manufacturer’s instructions., Once your trusses are anchored and permanently braced, you can begin sheathing the roof. Sheathing is installed lengthwise, starting at the bottom corner, and moving across the bottom first. When you move up to the next row, begin at the same end with a half sheet of sheathing, so that your sheathing is staggered.Always join panels over supports, and ensure that panels are one-eighth of an inch apart. Repeat for both sides of the roof.


To fasten the sheathing to the frame, use 8D common or deformed shank nails. Fasteners should be three-eighths of an inch from the edges. Fasteners should be spaced six inches apart around the edges of each panel, and 12 inches apart within each panel., This is metal flashing that will protect the bottom of the sheathing from rain and direct it into a gutter or away from the house., The most common underlayment is roofing felt, which is similar to tar paper, but felt uses asphalt instead of tar. The main purpose of the underlayment is waterproofing.


Beginning at the bottom where you started with the sheathing, roll the underlayment out flat, going lengthwise across the sheathing. Staple it into place.
Once the first layer is down, roll out the next layer, working your way up toward the roof ridge. Overlap the layers by about six inches.
Continue laying the underlayment up to the ridge, or within four inches of the ridge.
Repeat the same process for the other side of the roof.
Once you’ve laid the underlayment on both sides, roll out a final layer to go over the ridge like a hat. Make sure this layer overlaps the underlayment on either side of the ridge by at least eight inches., Like the sheathing and underlayment, the roof cover is installed lengthwise from the bottom up. Like sheathing, shingles should be staggered, and like underlayment, they should also overlap. Work your way up to the ridge on either side, and finish the ridge with ridge cap shingles.

Access a rafter.,
Position a level against the underside of the rafter.,
Find the 12 inch mark on the level.,
Measure the vertical distance from level to rafter.,
Find the slope.",How to Calculate Roof Pitch1," Measuring from the underside of the roof is usually the most accurate way to find the slope, since there is no roofing material to make an uneven surface. Any of the following will give you a good measurement:A rafter in the attic.

The overhang of a rafter at the end of the roof.

A barge rafter at the side of the gable.
;
, Place one end of a carpenter's level against the underside of the rafter. Adjust the level until the bubble is centered between the two lines.
, If your level does not have inch marking, measure it with a tape measure and draw on a 12 inch mark.

12 inches is the traditional measurement in the U.S. If you don't have an imperial ruler, however, you can use any units. Just use the same unit for all measurements, and measure a length at least this size (12 inches / 30 cm).


, Extend your tape measure perpendicular to the level. Measure the distance from the 12 inch mark to the underside of the same rafter, directly above it. Make sure the level stays in position during this measurement.
, The slope of your roof is the ratio of vertical distance (rise) to horizontal distance (run). Just write down the measurements you found. There's no need to simplify them.

For example, if you find 4 inches of height with the tape measure at the 12 inch mark on the level, your slope is 4:12 or ""4 in 12.""

Most people looking for ""pitch"" are really interested in this measurement. In technical terms, pitch has a different definition. If you're not sure if you have the right measurement, skip down to find the pitch.

Lay out the 2 x 6-inch (5 x 15 cm) truss materials on a level area, overlapping the joints.,
Assemble the roof trusses using the .5-inch (12 mm) plywood that you cut for straps.",How to Build a Gambrel Roof1,"

Mark the angles to make the peak (ridge). Dogleg that from the sidewalls, the bottom angle where the truss sits on the loft or 2nd floor joist. Another rafter will fit between the doglegs to provide extra support.










 


The peak of the gambrel roof normally is 30 degrees with the doglegs 60 degrees. However, they can be whatever fits your purpose.













Use these pieces as a pattern to mark and cut the rest of the gambrel roof trusses. Cut enough pieces for trusses to be installed on 16-inch centers. Use .5-inch (12 mm) plywood to make brackets for securing the pieces together. Cardboard pieces drawn and cut to size make excellent patterns for the straps.












;
,









Nail the straps at the joints on both sides of the trusses with 6 penny nails.

Identify your chimney type.,
Measure for a square masonry chimney.,
Measure for a round chimney.",How to Cap a Chimney1," You'll need to measure the dimensions of your chimney before buying a cap for it, and you'll need to know which type of chimney you have to do so. Most chimneys can be divided into two basic categories: square masonry chimneys and round chimneys.For square masonry chimneys, you will need to measure the flue—the pipe that carries the flame and smoke outside. Chimneys with one flue can be capped with a single flue chimney cap, but those with multiple flues will usually need a crown mount cap.






Round chimneys are usually made of metal but could also be made with masonry. Either way, you will need to measure the diameter of the chimney pipe before installing a round chimney cap.







, There are three subcategories to consider: single flue chimneys with extended flues, single flue chimneys without extended flues, and multi-flue chimneys. The single flue chimney with an extended flue is the most common.

Single flue chimneys with extended flues have a flue that extend beyond the crown of the chimney, making it easy to attach the cap with screws. Measure the width and length of the flue from the outside of the chimney.






Single flue chimneys without extended flues are flush against the chimney top, so you will need a cap with a bracket that reaches into the flue and grips into the side. Measure the width and length of the opening itself, not the outer portion of the flue.(Note this illustration is not showing this correctly. The measurement should start at the inside of the hole.)






For a multi-flue chimney, measure the total outside width and length of the combined flues. You also need to measure the height of the tallest flue. The cap you choose will need to have a screen height at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) taller than the top of your highest flue.







, Most round chimneys are made of metal, but there are two sub-categories you need to concern yourself with: solid-pack insulated chimney pipes and air-insulated chimney pipes. Note that the measurements you need for the cap will be the same regardless of the pipe type.

Look into the chimney. You should notice a pipe within a pipe (double-wall) or a pipe within two larger pipes (triple-wall). If you see a metal cap or insulation packed in between the pipes, you have a solid-pack chimney pipe. If you see nothing but air, you have an air-insulated pipe.






Measure the diameter of the inner pipe and the diameter of the outer pipe. The inner diameter should be used when selecting the cap, but the bottom ring of the cap should be large enough to cover the diameter of the larger pipe.






If you have a triple-wall pipe, ignore the middle pipe when taking the measurements.

Confirm the roof is safe to walk on.,
Measure 12 inches on a carpenter's level.,
Organize your tools.,
Position the level.,
Measure the vertical distance from roof to level.,
Calculate the roof slope.",How to Calculate Roof Pitch2," Climb up a ladder without your tools to take a look at the roof surface. Do not walk on a wet or icy roof, a very steep roof, or one with obvious structural damage. Even a mild slope can be dangerous to walk on if the roofing material is slippery (slate), gritty (worn composite shingles), or loose (wood shakes or any worn shingles).It's best to walk on a roof when the sun is out and morning dew has evaporated.

Curled shingles or other non-flat roof coverings make this method less accurate.Consider measuring from the rake board at the edge of the roof instead.

Wear clean, dry, basketball shoes or sneakers with soft soles. These have good traction but are less likely to leave footprints on your roof., Mark the length with the marker. Many levels are equipped with a ruler on the side, but this mark is more visible.
, Place the level, a tape measure, paper, and pen in a bucket or tool belt. Make sure you can ascend the ladder and move around easily while carrying the tools.

It may help to lock your tape measure in extended position before you climb. You'll only need about 12 inches.


, Place one end of the level against the roof. Pivot it up or down until the horizontal vial's bubble is between the two lines.

If your roof is particularly bumpy, lay down a flat board over the roof first. Place the end of the level against this board.

Crouch down or sit, as to minimize the potential for slipping.


, Hold the 0-mark of the tape measure against the roof. Extend it upward so it is perpendicular to the level. Move the tape measure along the the roof until it hits the level at exactly the 12-inch mark. Note the vertical distance on the tape measure and write this value down.
, Write the roof slope as the ratio of ""rise over run,"" or vertical distance over horizontal distance. For example, if your tape measure found a 6 inch vertical distance to the 12 inch mark on your level, the slope is 6:12 or ""6 in 12"".

In the United States, slopes are traditionally given with 12 as the second number of the ratio. There's no need to simplify the ratio.


"
"
Define roof slope.,
Understand roof pitch.,
Find the pitch.",How to Calculate Roof Pitch3," Most people interested in roof ""pitch"" are actually measuring the slope, which is the most useful measurement when considering roofing material and rainwater. Slope is the correct term for the ratio of vertical to horizontal distance on a particular plane of the roof. Even carpenters often use the terms slope and pitch interchangeably.

For example, if one side of the roof rises by 8 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal distance, it has a slope of ""8 in 12"" or ""8:12.""


, Technically, roof pitch is the ratio of total vertical roof height (the rise) to total horizontal distance from wall to wall (the span).Although most homeowners do not need to measure pitch, it still pays to understand this term. When you're arranging for repairs or roofing material, your calculations will be way off if you misinterpret ""pitch"" to mean ""slope.""

Again, some carpenters and manufacturers use both terms to mean ""slope."" Just ask if there's any confusion about which measurement they're referring to.

For example, if a roof is 32 feet from wall to wall and the ridge is 8 feet above the walls, the pitch has an 8 to 32 pitch, simplifying to ""1 to 4"" or ""1/4"".


, If you do need to calculate the pitch, an estimate or shortcut is usually more practical than measuring the roof's overall dimensions. Here are a couple examples:

For a simple gable roof, the span (wall to wall) will be twice the size of the run (wall to ridge, horizontally). Divide the slope by two to get the pitch.

For a roof with the ridge above one wall, the span is the same as the run. The slope is the same as the pitch.

For more complex roofs, you may need to calculate it section by section. Carpenters use special conversion charts to estimate the roofing material required based on the slope and shape."

Clear a path first.,
Start from the top if possible and blast downward.,
Work slowly and patiently.,
Mix water and mild detergent for stubborn areas.,
Use a cloth or sponge to clean.,
Scrub problem areas with your detergent solution.,
Repeat with stronger cleaners if necessary.",How to Clean a Metal Roof," Avoid cleaning your roof in direct sunlight. Keep in mind that metal and light-colored paint will reflect sunlight and create glare, which may drastically reduce your vision. If the layout of your roof requires you to climb onto it, do so when it’s dry out to reduce the risk of slipping.Of course, once you start washing your roof, it will get wet and pose a risk. However, it’s still a smart idea to reduce that risk as much as possible.;
, Before you haul all of your gear up, set up your ladder. Climb onto the roof and judge your ability to reach all of its parts. If you feel that certain parts are too precarious for you to safely reach, err on the side of caution and do not attempt to clean it.Keep in mind that your power washer or hose will extend your reach considerably. If any out-of-reach areas look like they need scrubbing afterward, hire a professional to do so.

, Do not attempt to wash your roof alone. Whether you need to mount the roof itself or can do the job from a ladder, play it safe. Ask someone to spot you so they can:Assist you in bringing gear up and down.
Alert you to any hazards that you may not be aware of.
Call for help in the event of an accident.

, Protect yourself from a fall. Wear a safety harness. Attach a safety line between that and a sturdy feature of your roof (like a chimney).If none are available, use either a:Bolt-strap anchor for corrugated roofs.
Ridge clamp for standing-seam roofs.

, Expect clean water alone to get the job done most of the time. Save yourself the time and money and use chemical cleaners only when absolutely necessary.Expect these to leave behind streaks and film if you don’t thoroughly rinse them off.Rinsing your roof with water at least once a year should reduce the need for using chemical cleaners.

, Don’t expect a simple splash of water to accomplish much. Use pressurized water to blast dirt away. For a light job, start by using your garden hose and a wand or spray nozzle attachment and see if its jet setting is strong enough to work. If not, rent or invest in a power washer and use that instead., Avoid stepping directly onto dirt, grime, and debris. Treat any material other than the roof itself as unstable. Before climbing onto or advancing along your roof, use your hose or power washer to clear a path for yourself to reduce the chance of slipping.If you have to first clear a path in order to attach safety lines and other gear to the roof, wait until the washed path has dried before climbing onto the roof.

, Make washing easier by cleaning the highest points first so the dirty runoff flows over yet-to-cleaned sections. Continue blasting dirt and debris by advancing downward along the roof’s slope while steadily pushing dirt and debris down toward its edge. However:Roof designs vary greatly, so don’t treat this as an absolute must. If your roof is particularly steep and/or has sections well out of reach, always opt for safety and hose it down from a lower, safer point.

, Don’t rush the job. Opt for a slow and steady approach to ensure safety. Advance along your roof at a safe pace while minding your footing at all times to minimize the risk of slipping., For any areas that don’t wash away with pressurized water, fill a bucket or other container with water. For every part water, combine 0.05 part mild dish or laundry detergent., Opt for something soft to protect your roof’s paint and parts. Avoid using more abrasive materials like steel wool or wire brushes. Expect these to scratch and otherwise damage your roof., Soak your cloth or sponge in the water/detergent mixture. Scrub from the bottom of the panel upward in a left-to-right, back-and-forth fashion. Once each panel is clean, rinse it immediately with clean water to prevent streaks and film. Then wipe the panel again with a cloth or sponge soaked in plain water.With persistent dirt that refuses to come off, go slow and steady and scrub for longer rather than apply more pressure to speed things up. The more pressure you add, the greater the risk of damaging the panel.

, If stains or other eyesores remain no longer how you scrub with your detergent solution, check with the roof’s manufacturer or installer about using stronger agents, since some may damage the roof, depending on its materials.Whichever cleaner they recommend, follow its directions regarding use. Scrub the dirty panels in question in the same manner that you did with your detergent solution.If the cleaner has bleach as an ingredient, rinse the scrubbed area with clean water immediately afterward. Do not wait until you complete a whole panel as you did with the detergent. Rinse all panels again when the entire job is finished.

Push the cap inside the flue.,
Consider applying caulk to the seam.,
Use pressure screws, if needed.",How to Cap a Chimney2," Position the cap so that it is centered directly over the inner pipe of the chimney. Push down on the cap, using your body weight to apply extra force, until the cap slides into the pipe.Continue pushing until the solid part of the pipe is completely hidden inside the chimney. The netted or cage-like portion should be elevated above the chimney top.
Technically, the installation can stop here. Round chimney caps are primarily held in place by friction and pressure.;
, If your chimney is made of metal, you should not apply caulk. On the other hand, if the pipe is made from another material, like clay tile, you should seal the joint with weather-proof silicone caulk.


Apply a thin, even strip of caulk around the entire perimeter of the cap, filling in the seam.
The caulk helps to secure the cap and further prevents moisture from getting inside.

, While not always necessary, some prefer to secure a chimney cap to a metal pipe using pressure screws. Do not use pressure screws when working with materials other than metal, though.


The manufacturer's instructions that come with your cap will usually specify whether or not you should use pressure screws.
Use pressure screws that are 1/4 inch (0.64 cm) in diameter and 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 inches (3.8 to 4.4 cm) long.
Twist these screws into the holes along the side of the cap until they stop turning.

"
"
Align the cap with the flue.,
Fasten the cap to the foundation.,
Apply silicone caulk.",How to Cap a Chimney3," Position the cap over the flue, centering it as well as you can, before sliding it in place over or inside the flue.


Remember that a single flue chimney with an extended flue will require a cap that slides over the top of the flue. A chimney without an extended flue will require a cap that slides inside the flue, instead.

, Place a sheet metal screw in each hole along the base of the cap and twist each one in place using a drill.


Match the screw size to the size of the holes in your chimney cap. Similarly, use the correct drill bit size for that screw.
Work carefully as you drill the screw in place. You will be drilling into the foundation of the chimney, and if you work too sloppily, you could end up damaging the masonry.
If you are not comfortable drilling into the chimney, use pressure screws or bolts instead of sheet metal screws.
Note that you will only fasten the cap from the outside when capping an extended flue. If capping a flush flue, you will need to fasten the cap to the inside of the chimney flue.

, Apply a thin line of silicone caulk to the entire perimeter of the chimney cap, filling in the seam.


This caulk will help keep more moisture out.

"

Position the cap.,
Bend the flange.,
Trace the perimeter.,
Apply adhesive.,
Press the cap into the adhesive.,
Make pilot holes in the chimney.,
Tighten the screws.",How to Cap a Chimney4," Place the cap over the crown of the chimney, keeping it fairly centered over the top flue.


Since this type of cap essentially ""cages in"" the chimney, you do not need to worry about a perfect fit. Just make sure that the entire chimney is covered.
Note that the ""crown"" of the chimney is the concrete area around the flues.

, Use heavy pliers to bend the flange around the bottom of the chimney cap. Keep bending the flange until it conforms to the outer perimeter of the chimney crown.


The ""flange"" is simply the collar surrounding the bottom of the cap.
You need this flange to lie snug against the sides of the crown.

, Take a dark marker and trace around the lower, bent edge of the flange, making the mark directly on the chimney crown.


After tracing the flange, temporarily remove the cap and set it aside.

, Generously apply weather-proof caulk or a similar adhesive to the crown of the chimney, positioning the adhesive just to the inside of the line you traced.


You can slather this on with a trowel, but the easiest way to apply the adhesive is to use a caulking gun.
Make sure that the bead you apply is 3/8 inch (0.95 cm) thick. Move the caulking gun gently from side to side, creating a wavy line roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.
Leave 1/4 inch (0.64 cm) gap at each corner as you apply the adhesive.

, Place the cap back over the chimney and firmly press the flange down into the adhesive. Let dry.


If desired, you could smooth any adhesive that oozes out using a putty knife, but doing so is not necessary.
Oftentimes, weather-proof adhesive is enough to hold this type of cap in place. Some caps should also be secured further with masonry screws, though. Check the manufacturer's instructions to determine if screws are necessary. If they aren't you can stop at this step.

, Place a screw through each hole in your flange. Use a power drill fitted with an appropriate drill bit to twist the screws roughly halfway in place.


Work carefully. You will be drilling directly into the chimney crown, and if you are too sloppy or hasty, you could damage the masonry.
Use a 3/16 inch (0.5 cm) masonry bit. The masonry screws need to be 1/4 inch (0.64 cm) in diameter and 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 inch (3.8 to 4.4 cm) long.
You need at least one screw per side. Aside from that, the screws should be spaced about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart.

, Go back around the flange and finish drilling the screws in place. The head of each screw should lie flat against the side of the flange.


You should still work carefully to prevent any accidental damage to the masonry as you drill the screws in.

Complete the roof by trimming the edges of the overlap you left in place with your utility knife.,
Finished.








",How to Apply Rolled Roofing,"









Rolled roofing is made from the same material as asphalt shingles. Each roll of roofing takes the place of 3 courses of asphalt shingles. Rolled roofing is more economical to use as a result.;
, Flashing keeps water runoff from working under the roof and causing damage to the roof decking.








,

The edge of the roll is not always straight. Popping a chalk line helps to give you a nice bottom edge. Wrinkles will occur in the roofing material if it's not straight.













Apply a 6-inch (15.3 cm) coat of asphaltic roofing cement along the bottom and sides.














, Begin at one edge and extend a couple of inches more than necessary.








, Come back and trim the side edges later.








, Repeat the process by measuring 34 inches (86.4 cm) from the top of the first course and popping a chalk line.








,, Press down into the asphalt roofing cement. Continue this process until you reach the top.








, Press this final course down. Nail down the top edge, covering the nail heads with asphaltic roofing cement to seal them down, particularly if you live in a windy area.








, Press down firmly.








, Cut 9-inch (15.3 cm) wide strips from the rolled roofing, using it for ridge shingles.








, Now, bend the strips over the top. Press the roofing material firmly into the cement and nail it into place.








, Use the edge of the roof as a guide.

Look up the building code for your area.,
Plan your floor framing layout.,
Cut all the wood members to size.,
Install the sill plate.,
Install the band joist.,
Mark the position of each floor joist.,
Install the floor joists.,
Add the bridging.,
Install the subfloor.",How to Frame a Floor," Your city will have building code, or basic requirements that homes and buildings are required to meet. If your floor isn't up to code, you might get fined and will probably be required to pull up the entire floor. Know what the code is for your area before you start, because it can affect everything from the materials you need to use to the measurements you use. Your area might even require a permit for a floor to be considered up to code!;
, Before installing anything, use a pencil and paper to design your framing plan. Draw the plan to scale and check all your calculations carefully so that you know exactly how many members you need and what length they need to be. Extremely long spans, staircases, or interior load-bearing walls complicate the framing plan by necessitating lapped joints and additional support columns. These complications are best handled by a licensed contractor.


You should space your floor joists at 16"" center-to-center to be as structurally sounds as possible. The length can vary depending on the size of your room and what lumber is available to you, but generally you will at least want support for longer boards from below, such as an extra pillar and horizontal board.

, Once you have formulated your framing plan, use it to determine the length of lumber you will need and what sizes to cut the lumber into. Use a pencil to mark each piece after you cut it, which will help you determine where that pieces needs to be installed later.

, The sill plate (sometimes called the sill, or the mud sill) consists of lengths of dimensional lumber that are laid directly on top of the foundation wall. The boards should be laid horizontally, with one edge flush with the exterior of the foundation wall. Use either 2x6 or 2x8 (50x150 mm or 50x200 mm) lumber for the sill plate. Because the sill plate contacts concrete directly, you must use pressure-treated wood. Drill holes in the boards to accommodate the anchor bolts in the foundation, and secure the boards by fastening nuts and washers onto the bolts.


To avoid problems with moisture and air circulation, you should place a sill gasket before installing the sill.

, The band joist, also called a rim joist, sits vertically on top of the sill plate. Use the same size lumber for the band joist as you will for the main floor joists; 2x10s (50x250 mm) are an appropriate size for most applications. Position each board vertically so that its edge is flush with the outer edge of the sill plate, and then toe-nail the board to the sill plate with framing nails.You can also get a metal brace to keep the sill and band joist extra secure. The brace screws into the wood at one end and the foundation at the other.

, Floor joists should run parallel to each other and be spaced evenly, at no more than 16 inches (40 cm) on center if you want the floor to be properly secure. Use a tape measure to find the position of each joist along the sill plate, and mark the position with a pencil.

, Set the floor joists onto the sill plate and position them over your pencil markings. The joists should fit flush against the band joist. After setting each joist in place, toe-nail it to both the sill plate and the band joist.


If you want to make your joists more stable and make installation a breeze, use joist hangers.

, You'll need to put in X or solid bridging between the joists, if the length of the joist is greater than 9'. There are different schools of thought on which is better, but having it at all is what is really important. If you know you're going to have to run a lot of cables or utilities beneath the floor, then the X bridging is probably better in the long run.

, Once the bridging is in, you can go about installing the rest of the floor. Just be sure that you thoroughly glue the plywood or other subfloor material to the joists. Only apply the glue in one small section at a time. You do not want the glue to have time to start drying before you get the chance to lay down the subfloor.The subfloor panels should be places perpendicular to the line of the joists (across the joists).


Tongue-in-groove subfloor, as well as subfloor which is at least 3/4"" thick, will make a floor much more secure.

",How to Build a Hip Roof,"









Common rafters are those which run from the top of the wall to the top of the roof.
Hip rafters run along the joints where two faces of the roof meet. Measure these according to pitch. The ridge board runs along the top of the roof and where the common rafters and hip rafters meet. Measure this according to the length of your building and the length of the other rafters that will meet it.;
,,









You should have enough common rafters so that there is one every 20 inches (or 50 cm) along the walls. On a simple roof over a rectangular building, there will be four hip rafters and one ridge board.

,,









Jack rafters connect hip rafters to the walls.

,,,,









The common rafters and ridge beam should now stand solidly on their own.

Insert the replacement board into the floor and secure it in place with a nail gun.,
Cover the nail holes with wood putty and sand the replacement board.,
Stain the replacement board.,
Apply the varnish and sand between each coat.",How to Get Permanent Marker Stain out of Hardwood Flooring7," Replacing a board is time consuming and a little tricky. Before embarking on the project, look into services in your area that would replace the board for you. After researching services, receiving quotes, and studying the process, decide if you will replace the board yourself or pay a handyman to do it.If the stain extends across several boards, individually replacing each board may not be worth the effort.

, Measure the depth of the board you are removing. Set your circular saw to cut 1/16 inch deeper than the measured depth of the board.The majority of hardwood floor boards are ¾ inch thick.

, Use the circular saw to cut 1 line down the length of the floorboard. Stop the saw before reaching the end of the damaged board. Move the saw over 1 inch and cut a second line down the length of the floorboard. Stop before you reach the end of the damaged floorboard., Carefully score each end of the damaged board with a utility knife. Do not score the surrounding, undamaged boards., Place the chisel in one of the score lines at a 30° angle. Tap a chisel along the scored line with a hammer. Repeat on the other scored line., Insert a pry bar into the gap at one end of the damaged board. Push down on the pry bar to lift up the damaged board. Remove the damaged board with your hand., Plug in a shop vac. Suction up any debris from the area.


You may also use a hand broom and dustpan to sweep up the debris., Use a measuring tape to determine the width and length of the damaged board. Use these measurements to determine the size of the replacement board. Mark the length and width with a pencil on the replacement board., Remove the bottom grooves from the replacement board. Cut the replacement board to the appropriate length and width. Use the pencil marks as your guide., Tap the replacement board into place with a rubber mallet. Make sure the replacement board is flush with the floor. Use a nail gun to insert 1 finish nail into each end of the board.

, Use a putty knife to fill the nail holes with a small amount of wood putty. Once dry, sand the replacement board with 220-grit sandpaper along the grain. Clean up any dust with a damp rag., Apply a matching stain to the replacement board with a rag. Remove any excess stain with a clean rag. Allow the stain to dry.

, Apply the first coat of varnish with a lambs wool applicator. Once dry, sand the area with 220-grit sandpaper. Remove any dust with a damp rag or shop vac.


Apply 3 coats of oil-based finish or 4 coats of water-based finish. Sand between each coat and clean up any dust.

Wipe the scratched area.,
Dampen a rag with a wood stain marker.,
Rub the stain into the scratch.",How to Fix Scratches on Hardwood Floors1," Use a soft rag dampened with water to gently clean the surface of the hardwood floor from any excess dirt and debris.






;
, Find a wood stain marker that matches the color of your hardwood floor. Fold a clean rag or paper towel in squares, so there are a few layers to the material. Shake the stain marker before opening, and dab the point of the marker into a corner of the folded cloth. Dab the marker approximately 10-15 times to effectively dampen the cloth with the wood stain.








Stain markers come in many colors, and can be found in home department stores, hardware stores, and paint stores., Lightly press the cloth onto the wood, focusing on the scratched area, and rub the wood stain into the scratch, following the grain of the wood.








This application method works best (rather than directly drawing the stain marker over the scratch), because it allows for a gradual addition of stain.
If you use the marker to draw and fill in the stain directly, you can saturate the scratch with stain, and end up making the scratch darker than the surrounding wood.Drawing straight onto the scratch like that can make the scratch mark even more obvious.

Identify the source of the squeak.,
Weight the squeak from above.,
Attach a brace between the joist and the subfloor.,
Install wood shims in between the subfloor and the joist.,
Screw the subfloor into the floor.",How to Fix a Squeaky Floor1," The best way to identify squeaks is to stand in your basement, looking up at the subfloor while someone else walks around looking for the squeak. Listen and watch for the squeaky area, so you can identify the problem area and the best way of remedying it.


Most squeaks are the result of the plywood subfloor rubbing against the floor joists. The subfloor, the structural support below the top floor that you walk on, will sometimes shrink over time as the wood dries out, changing the shape slightly and resulting in high-pitched, irritating squeaks.
It’s also common on hardwood floors that the top floor itself will squeak. To address squeaks in the top floorboards, skip to the next method. All squeaky boards under tile, linoleum, and other flooring surfaces will need to be fixed from under, either in the crawl space or the basement.;
, It’s good to weight down the floor from above to compress the boards and make your repair more effective. Using some furniture, barbell weights, bags of salt, heavy books, or other hefty objects would be perfectly fine. In a pinch, you could also have a helper stand on the spot to keep it compressed for you to work.

, If the floor seems to be squeaking because the subfloor and the joists are loose, the best way to remedy the issue is to install a brace to secure things and eliminate the irritating sound. The Squeak-Ender is a brand of joist-support available at most home repair stores for a couple bucks, a metal brace that connects between the joist and the squeaky subfloor.


To install one of these joist-subfloor braces, screw the mounting plate to the underside of the subfloor, directly under the squeaking spot. Use the provided screws, or use wood screws small enough to fit in the bracket holes.Hook the bracket onto the rod provided and attach it to the joist, tightening the mechanism with a wrench until the subfloor is pulled down flush.

, Shims are small, thin pieces of wood used for filling gaps, squaring up carpentry projects and keeping things from swelling and squeaking. For squeaks that are the result of small gaps that might be more easily and cheaply fixed than by installing a brace, use wooden shims to fill the space of the gap.


If you've found the source of the squeak, but don't see considerable play between the subfloor boards and the joists, buy a package of small shims and insert them into the gaps that create the sound. Coat shims in carpentry glue, then slide them directly into the gap.
Be careful to avoid forcing shims into small spaces and forcing the board back up, making the squeak worse, or translating the squeak to another area. It’s important to always weight the floor from above if you try to do this., In a pinch, you can also use wood screws to tighten things up yourself. It's a more primitive way of solving the issue, but it can work in a pinch to connect the floor and the subfloor more securely with wood screws. Drill a pilot hole with your power drill roughly the length of the screw that you've selected (any carpentry screw will do) to make sure you don't go too far and come up the other side.


It's hard to know how thick the individual layers of the floor are, but you want to be very careful not to drill too far and have a sharp edge sticking out the side of the floor you walk on. To make sure you don't do this, drill a pilot hole the length of the screws you've purchased and make sure your'e safe. Then install the screws normally.

You will need:some talcum powder, a damp cloth,a drill, a screwdriver, possible a 50mm screw.,

, This is your fella.

, And a little extra on the nails. The powder will ease the friction between the boards and nails, hopefully eradicating the squeaking. Don't vacuum, but wipe away the excess with a damp cloth.

, Screw in a 50 mm screw alongside the present nails. You need to put them next to the nails to guarantee they go into a joist and avoiding any pipes and electrics running underneath. The extra fixing will really hold the board in place. No movement, no noise.

Be cautious not to drag furniture across wood floors. Heavy furniture may scuff the hardwood and leave marks.;
, Insert a small piece of wood behind the pry bar to provide leverage, and to prevent damaging the trim pieces.

, Seal all of the openings–electrical outlets, vents, and light switches–with masking tape. Cover the light fixtures with trash bags, and secure them with masking tape. Separate the room from the rest of the house by taping the door shut or hanging plastic sheeting in the doorway.


You may find gaps or gouges in the wood which need to be filled. Apply wood putty according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allow it to dry thoroughly before proceeding with your finishing.

, Any water spots where the wood has turned black can be treated by mixing a 50-50 solution of bleach and water to remove all or nearly all black spots.

,


You can rent a drum sander from any equipment rental facility. Consider renting a floor sander from a local hardware store; consider borrowing a sander from a friend or neighbor.
Get the 180-grit pads (180 grits per inch), if you have a choice. If you are re-finishing old floors, start with the 80 grit pads, and be thorough.

, Gently lower it into contact with the floor once it's begun to spin.


Start with 20- to 60-grit sandpaper. You will end the project with sandpaper between 80- and 120-grit.
Practice sanding an area that won't be visible when the furniture is replaced. This will avoid making any noticeable errors.

, Sand along the grain of the wood, and overlap each pass by an inch (2.54cm) or two (5.08cm) so that you don't miss a spot. The grain is the natural flow of the wood – the fibrous lines that hold the wood together. Planks are usually cut so that the grain lines flow down the length of the board.


Sanding by machine requires that the machine sands with the grain of the wood. Sanding on the bias will destroy the wood's appearance, and you may find yourself shopping for carpet.Finish up the edges with a handheld power sander. Use a smaller, handheld sander to tidy up the areas that the electric sander might have missed--especially the edges of the room, or any part of the floor that's at all obstructed.

, Most hardwood floors can be sanded up to four times. Clean the floor thoroughly before beginning the next round of sanding: vacuum the dust, and wipe down the floor with a dry cloth.

, Vacuum the floor, then wipe it with a dry cloth. If you're going to stain your floor, you'll need to make sure that there's no remaining sawdust that can obstruct the stain.

, Wood stain can highlight the natural hues of the wood or it can give your floor a unique, colorful twist. If you are already happy with the color of the hardwood, you do not need to stain the floor. Move on to waxing and buffing the floor or apply a clear polyurethane finish.

, When picking a stain brand, value quality over quantity; don't be afraid to spend 40 or 50 dollars on a gallon. When choosing a color, keep in mind that the stain will look very different over an entire room than it did on the sample chart. Understand that the color will soak into the wood and fade slightly. Pick a finish that goes well with the room, and pick one that you're willing to live with for a long time.Depending on the brand, you will need 1–2 gallons (3.8–7.6 L) of stain for an average floor. If you are attempting this for the first time, get a water-based stain: it is much easier to work with.
Get a staining pad head with a detachable extension. The cheapest way is to get the replaceable pads. If you're using a semi-transparent stain, be sure to get the soft white fiber for staining, as the paint-specific pads will apply all but the solid color stain unevenly.
A darker stain color can help cover up stains like dog urine that have seeped into the wood and won't come out with sanding.

, This will prevent uneven coverage.Ask at your local hardware store or flooring specialist; they should be able to direct you to the right product.

, After 10-15 minutes, use a rag to wipe away any excess stain. Pour as much stain as you will need to work with into a bucket and stir it thoroughly. This will also help to ensure even coverage. don't let the layer get too thick; you want a thin, even layer that will dry smoothly.


Apply a small amount of stain to a small test area. The color may vary considerably from the display at the store.
Be sure to stir the stain regularly during the application process.
Avoid leaving a stain or water spill on the wood: it will stain and rot if left unattended.

, Allow ample drying time between each coat. Water-based stains need to dry for 2-6 hours, and oil-based stains need to dry for 6-10 hours. As it dries, you will have a better idea of whether you want another coat. You will probably need at least two coats of stain to reach the exact shade that you chose.

, You can get a softer finish for a natural-looking protective barrier, or a semi-gloss finish to make your new floor really shine. Use the same process to apply. Use a paint roller to evenly spread the polyurethane across the floor. Let it dry completely. Consider rolling out an extra coat for added protection and shine. If you do not want to use polyurethane, you can choose to wax and buff the floor instead.


Try to stick to the base you used for the floor: if you chose a water-based stain, then be sure to use a water-based polyurethane clear-coat.
Once you've applied the polyurethane coat, do not walk on the floor for 24 hours (or as long as the urethane packaging says that it needs to dry). If you walk on the floor before the coat is completely dry, you might smudge the gloss and leave unsightly blemishes across your hardwood.
Do not steam-mop the floor for at least a month after finishing.

, This can be tough, time-consuming work, but it will make your hardwood floor last much longer. You can wax and buff your floor before you have stained it, after you have stained it, and whether or not you have stained it. If you have stained the floor, make sure that the stain has completely dried before you try to apply wax.


Wax and buff your floor three or four times to build up plenty of protective layers. Set aside at least a full day for this process, as it can become very time-intensive.
Make sure to clear the floor of all furniture, clutter, and dust before you begin. Consider mopping the floor or wiping it clean with a damp towel beforehand.

, If your floor has never been treated, you can use any wax or finish product that is labeled ""hardwood"". Polyurethane and beeswax are popular choices that you can find in most hardwood stores. Each product will appear slightly different, so do your research and determine which look you want. You can wax a floor whether or not you stain it.


If the floor finished, check whether it is dirty. If the existing top layer is scratched, but not dirty, you can simply apply a new coating of wax on top of the old layer. If the finished floor is dirty, you will need to thoroughly buff the floor before you apply a new coating.
Wax soaks into the wood, so it is hard to fully remove. This makes the floor unsuitable for a synthetic finish, unless you hire a professional to strip the wax fully. You can easily apply new wax after you strip the floor.

, Fill a bucket with floor wax, then use a damp sponge mop or flat wax applicator mop to spread the wax over the floor. Don't wax yourself into a corner: start along the far wall of each room and work your way toward the door. Spread the wax over one section of the floor at a time, and make sure to get an even coat. Apply three or four thin coats, or as many as the wax product packaging recommends. Let each coat of wax dry completely before you lay down another coat.


If your first layer is too thick, the whole process could fail to set properly. Be careful not to drip excess wax onto the floor. Make sure that the mop is damp, but not soaked.
Don't apply too many coats. Stop if the wax starts turning yellow.
Wash all tools immediately when you are done waxing. If you let the wax dry, it will be difficult or nearly impossible to remove.

, This should take about half an hour, but could take longer in areas with high humidity. After ten minutes of natural drying, you can point a fan into the room to make it dry faster. Do not point the fan directly at the waxed floor, or it might interfere with the adhesive.Read the label of your floor wax for a more accurate estimate of the drying time.


Make sure that you've got an even coating, and that you allow it to ""set"" before you move on to buffing. Make sure that your wax needs to be buffed. Many waxes are no-buff, and they will remain glossy with no further effort.
Avoid stepping or placing anything onto the final coat for at least eight hours. Shut the door of the waxed room so that children, pets, and dirt cannot enter.

, Buffing means removing the wax from the floor by wiping it with a clean towel. It is best to buff the floor by hand, but you can also tie the towel around a dry mop head so that you don't have to be on your hands and knees. Get a clean, dry cloth and get to work, moving with the grain of the wood. Rub the wood hard enough that you can see the wax coming off onto the cloth. Make sure that the wax is completely dry before you begin to buff.


Go over the entire floor three or four times, making sure to get as much wax as possible clear of the wood. Your goal here is to ensure that there's no excess wax on the floor, and that the wax that's there is sealing the wood.
You can buff a floor whether or not you have stained it. If you have finished a floor by staining it, buffing ensures that you won't have air bubbles in the finish, and thus that the floor will last longer.

, Once you're sure this is done, repeat the entire process, reapplying the wax and buffing it off at at least three times. Repetition is important, as it builds up resilient layers of wax to protect your floor. Repeated waxing and buffing may seem like a lot of unnecessary work, but it will make your hardwood floor last much longer.

, Call them up. Set up a meeting. Discuss your project. Ask them for an estimate. Do not settle with one hardwood flooring installation contractor. If you can accommodate three bidding contractors the better.

, Do not ever rely on phone-based quotation or Internet-based quotations. As a true contractor, they will insist on seeing your place to see the scale of your house’s flooring. And if they did, then let them evaluate. Seeing the scope of the projects gives the contractor’s estimator an approximate amount of the cost of your hardwood flooring project.

, Knowing how the contractors worked with their previous customer can help your decision on whom to pick on the bidding. Customer service is one of the many essential factors you should consider when hiring a contractor.

, It should contain the following details: the company’s name and particulars; detailed project description; materials list; a statement that “all necessary permits and inspections are the responsibility of the contractor”; starting and completion dates; warranties guaranteed by the contractor; a guarantee that the contractor carries liability insurance and worker’s compensation coverage; a statement that the contractor shall be held responsible for clean-up; total price and payment schedule, if applicable; and the contractor's license number.

, After cleaning the scratched area of the floor, dampen another rag with water, and wipe down the scratched area to remove the cleanser.Let the scratched area dry before moving on.

, When the scratched area is completely dry, use a small tipped brush to apply a thin layer of protective finish to the scratched area of the floor.This protective finish could be a sealant, shellac, or some other kind of polyurethane varnish.Ideally, you would use the same kind of finish that is already on the hardwood floor.


Consult an employee at your local hardware store for advice on what kind of finish you should use on the floor.
If you are an inexperienced wood worker, or if your hardwood floor has a specialty finish (such as a high gloss polyurethane finish), consider hiring a professional to repair and finish the floor.Since hiring a professional will cost more money, it might be most cost-effective to let scratches accumulate, rather than hiring a company to fix one small scratch."

Allow the scratched area to completely dry before proceeding.

, If your hardwood floors are coated with a layer of polyurethane, the layer must be removed before you can fix the scratch. If your floors don't have that coating, you don’t need to worry about removing the top finish of the floor. Dampen a scouring pad with mineral spirits, and gently rub the scratched area of the floor.Wipe over the area with a clean cloth, and let the area dry completely.


If you are inexperienced with woodworking and sealing, it’s advisable to hire a professional to repair the flooring.

, Apply a small amount of wood filler that is similar to the color of your hardwood floor, to your pointer finger. Use your finger to work the wood filler into the scratch or gouge, spreading the filler in all directions to remove air bubbles.You can be generous with the wood filler, because excess filler will be removed later.


Be sure to apply wood filler rather than wood putty. The two substances are different, and using wood putty to fill the scratch can alter the effectiveness of matching the filling to the color of the floor, and affect the filling from properly taking the color of staining, if applied., Drag a putty knife over the wood filler to smooth out the surface, and help push the wood filler into the scratch. Drag the putty knife over the scratch, moving in many directions, to ensure the edges of the scratch and filler are flat and even.Allow the wood filler to completely dry. This may take anywhere from a few hours to an entire day, so consult the information on the package of filler for drying time.

, Use a small pad of fine girt sandpaper, perhaps 180-grit, and gently sand the area surround the scratch where excess wood filler has been spread.You can sand following the direction of the grain of the wood, or sand in small little circles. Whichever way you sand, be sure to sand very lightly.

, Dampen a cloth with water and wring it out. The cloth should be moisten but relatively dry to the touch.Use you finger to precisely wipe away the excess filler surrounding the scratch.


Be sure to wipe the areas where filler has been spread, and avoid wiping over the actual filled scratch.

, Apply a thin layer of the same sealer used on the rest of the hardwood floor to the patched area. Use either a small, natural bristle brush or a lambswool roller to apply the layer of polyurethane, varnish, or sealer. Allow the sealer a complete 24 hours to dry before any traffic is allowed on the surface.


If you use a foam roller, you run the risk of leaving air bubbles in the sealer.

Remove the carpet over the squeaky area, if necessary.,
Locate the joist nearest the squeak.,
Fix the loose board to the joist.,
Fill the hole with wood putty.,
Sand the spot.",How to Fix a Squeaky Floor2," If you've got a hardwood floor, you can obviously skip this step and go straight to finding the joists. If you've got a squeaky and carpeted floor, however, you've got to make the decision to either cut a small strip of it up to install under, or use screws that can be used through carpeting.


Some kits (Squeak-No-More) are available to use over and through carpeting, without having to remove it and risk damage. The process will be essentially the same, whether you pull up the carpet or not.
If you must remove carpeting, pull it up near the squeak and keep it as clean and secure as possible so you can reattach it later with carpet adhesive. If you can pull up a particular segment of carpet along a seam, keeping it secure, that would be the best way of pulling it up, rather than just cutting a segment out from the middle. There's no easy way to cover up your work, and it might always show, unless you work along a natural seam.

, Walk in the squeaky area until you can find your squeaky spot for certain. Then, try to find the closest joist to the squeak using a stud-finder.If you don't have a stud finder, you can use a hammer or another heavy object to tap on the floor and listen. The joists will sound flatter and thinner when you tap on it, while the other side will sound deeper.
To be extra-sure, you can drill a pilot hole using a depth-control bit in your variable speed drill to make sure that you're hitting the joist before you use a screw and come up short.

, Drill through the squeaky boards, the subfloor, and attach both to the joist to securely fix the squeaky board. To do this, you'll need heavy-duty wood screws of the appropriate length. You can get some sense of that length when you drill your pilot hole.


Some kits will come with break-away screws that you can use to make the repair almost undetectable, especially through carpet. This is a very effective way of securing your boards cleanly and efficiently.

, If you're working on a hardwood floor, it's important to keep the spot looking as clean and smooth as possible. Wood putty, also known as plastic wood in some places, is a type of putty made of sawdust and some type of binder, and is very effective at filling the holes left around the nails. It's available at most home repair stores for a few dollars. Apply a small amount and sand the area smooth.


You can match the tone of most wood putty to the wood tone of the floor. try to get it as close as possible. If you're carpeting back over it, don't worry about using wood putty.

, In some cases, it might be a good idea to smooth back over the top of the screw that you installed to smooth things out. If your floor is carefully stained, this would be a bad idea, but you might need to smooth out the wood shards from the screwing job, or smooth out the rough edges of the wood putty you installed. Use extremely fine grain sandpaper, and don't overdo it.

Add the polish to the floor.",How to Clean Linoleum Floors," Sweep, dust mop or vacuum your linoleum floor to remove excess dirt on the floor’s surface.Focus on collecting dirt from areas underneath cabinets, cupboards, and appliances.If you vacuum your linoleum floor, be sure to change the vacuum settings to clean hard surfaces rather than carpet.;
, Fill up a large bucket about ¼ - ½ of the way with lukewarm water. Mix in equal parts of white vinegar.The exact measurements on the water to vinegar ratios are rather loose, because most linoleum floors do not need an entire bucket’s worth of cleaning solution to clean the floor surface.


Besides, standing water can damage linoleum, so you never want to use more water than necessary., Use a cleaning product specifically intended for cleaning linoleum floors. Linoleum-specific cleaning products can be found in most flooring and home department stores. Most linoleum floor cleaners need to be diluted with water, so follow the manufacturer’s instructions by mixing in the appropriate amount of cleaning detergent in a large bucket filled with the correct measurements of water.If using a chemical cleaner, make sure that your cleaning area is well ventilated.


Alternatively, you could mix about 6-7 drops of a mild detergent (such as dish soap) with approximately one gallon of warm water as your cleaning solution.Bear in mind that this solution will clean and disinfect your floors, but a linoleum-specific cleaner might remove dirt a little better.
Chemicals that have high pH levels can be extremely damaging to linoleum flooring, so stay away from cleaning products like ammonia when cleaning your linoleum floors., Dip a mop into your cleaning solution, and thoroughly wring out excess solution. Your mop should be damp, rather than dripping wet.Mop the floor in sections, working in about 4-6 square foot areas for each dip of the mop.If you want to clean you floors more thoroughly, you can use a soft bristled scrub brush instead of a mop.This method would most likely require you to work on your hands and knees.
If you are cleaning your floor with a vinegar and water solution, you don’t need to rinse off your floor. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant, and the vinegar and water will evaporate along with the vinegar smell., After you have mopped the whole floor, dump out the bucket of cleaning solution and water, and thoroughly rinse out the mop with clean water. Refill the bucket of water with cool, clean water.Dip the clean mop into the clean water, wring out any excess water, and rinse the cleaning solution from the floor.Again, work in areas approximately 4-6 square foot areas for each time you dip the mop into the water. When you are finished rinsing the floor, dump out the bucket of water.


If chemical cleaning solutions are not rinsed from the floor, they will attract tiny particles of dust and dirt, that will be harder to remove later., Wipe down the entire floor with a towel, cleaning cloth, or a terry cloth covered mop head.Allow the floor to completely dry being moving back furniture or allow traffic on the floor surface.

, Before you polish your floor, it has to be thoroughly cleaned. Vacuum and wash your floor as you normally would, using the basic cleaning method.Make sure that the floor is completely dry before proceeding to add polish.


Be sure to rinse the floor thoroughly after washing. Any leftover cleaning residue could negatively affect the polish., Do not pour the polish directly on the floor. Instead, use a clean bucket to contain the polish.Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instruction on the back of the polish to know how much you should be using.

, Apply linoleum polish to the floor, using a clean, damp mop.Apply 1-3 coats of polish in approximately 3-4 square foot areas.Allow each coat to thoroughly dry by wait approximately 30 minutes in between coats.Let the final coat of polish dry for approximately an hour before moving back furniture and walking on the floor surface.Try to restrict the number of times you drag your mop over a given area. Moving your mop over an area more than once or twice runs the risk of leaving streaks in the polish."

Measure the installation area and purchase the laminate.,
Allow the new laminate 72 hours to acclimate before you begin.Laminate expands and contracts when exposed to humidity.,
Choose a cutting tool.,
Gather the other necessary tools.",How to Cut Laminate1," Carefully measure the space with a tape measure, then measure it once more for the sake of accuracy. Add one inch to all sides, just in case chipping or splitting occurs when you make your cuts. You will need to buy 5% to 10% more material than what your measurements dictate to account for waste and mistakes.The standard measurement for laminate stock sheets is 48 inches (1.22 meters) by 96 inches (3.66 meters).Purchase the number of laminate sheets you’ll need for the job at any hardware store.;
, Bring your purchased laminate sheets inside your home about 72 hours before you plan to begin the job. Open the boxes and allow the laminate time to acclimate to the humidity level before you start making cuts.


If you don’t allow the sheets a chance to acclimate, you could end up with laminate that pulls apart or buckles after you’ve installed it., There are many efficient cutting tools used for laminate, but no matter which one you choose, the blade needs to be extremely sharp and thin. In general, the thinner the blade, the less likely it will be to cause splits or chips in the laminate. Your options for cutting tools are table saws, circular saws, jigsaws, miter saws, and hand saws.Table saws, circular saws and jigsaws are usually the favored options.


If you choose a jigsaw as your tool, be sure to get special laminate cutting blades to go with it. These blades are quite cheap – they will be efficient to use for one job, but you’ll need to throw them out after that.If you plan to be cutting a lot of laminate flooring, consider purchasing or renting a laminate floor cutter at a hardware store. These are easy to use, create no noise and generate no toxic laminate dust., Aside from cutting tools, you will also need a dust mask, safety glasses, a tape measure and a non-permanent fine-tipped marker for this job. Do not skip the protective glasses and dust mask. The dust generated from cutting laminate is known to cause cancer and other health issues, so you definitely need to avoid breathing it in or getting it into your eyes.If you will be cutting a lot of irregular or curved shapes, consider investing in a forge profile gauge. This tool will make it very easy for you to accurately mark curved lines onto the laminate before you start making the cuts.

Clean tile floors regularly.,
Wipe up spills and messes right away.,
Avoid using chemical cleaners.",How to Clean Tile Floors with Vinegar," For most floors, one or two gallons of water will suffice. If you need to clean a larger area, you can add an extra couple gallons incrementally. The warmer the water, the better it will be for loosening stuck-on dirt and grime.Before you start mopping, make sure you've cleared the floor of all removable furniture, appliances and other objects that might get in the way or be damaged by water.
If the bucket is too big to fit under the sink, try filling it your bathtub.;
, Aim for a ratio of roughly ½ to 1 cup of vinegar for every gallon of water. Swish the vinegar solution gently to make sure it’s blended. Vinegar is mildly acidic, which makes it useful for dissolving hardened residue. Diluting the vinegar will prevent it from bleaching the color or wearing down the finish of your floor tiles.
Other high-potency types of vinegar, such as apple cider vinegar, will also get the job done., Work your way across the tiles, mopping in a circular or side-to-side direction. Make sure to spread the vinegar over the entire surface of the floor. Don’t forget to run the mop beneath nearby furniture and along the baseboards.As you mop, you should be able to see the results of the vinegar right away.Be careful not to saturate bordering wood or carpet flooring with the vinegar solution.

, Empty the bucket and refill it with clean, warm water. Go back over floor once more, wringing out and rewetting the mop every few feet. This will help clear the tiles of loose residue and any remaining traces of vinegar. Soak up excess water with the mop, a squeegee or an absorbent towel, the allow it to air dry completely.If you skip the rinsing step, the dingy water will dry on the floor, leaving behind streaks and splotches.Making sure that the grout has a chance to dry out is essential for preventing the growth of mold and mildew, which thrive in warm, moist spaces., Use equal quantities of both liquids and shake well to mix. The spray bottle will give you greater control over the application of the vinegar, which will be helpful when cleaning narrow spaces like grout lines.A spray bottle of vinegar is a convenient natural cleaning solution to have around in a pinch.

, You won’t need to use much—a thin dusting will be fine. Work the baking soda into the grout using your fingertips or the bristles of a brush. For maximum efficiency, proceed in small squares, following the gridlike pattern of the grout a few feet at a time.For particularly bad stains, you can also mix up a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the grout and leave it to take effect overnight., Together, the two ingredients will start a mild chemical reaction, creating a fizzy foam that will bubble over the grout. Allow the baking soda and vinegar to sit for 5-10 minutes to ensure that it’s had time to eat away at the worst of the buildup.This foaming action will make it much easier for the vinegar and baking soda combination to penetrate down into the tiny pores of the grout.
To get the most out of the mixture’s stain-lifting power, wait until the foaming has died down before you begin scrubbing., Using a stiff-bristled brush, scour the grout and space between the edges of the tiles forcefully. After the vinegar and baking soda treatment, you should be able to lift out even the heaviest stains. Once you’re finished, give the floor a thorough rinse using a wet rag or sponge, then leave it to air dry.Special brushes designed for cleaning grout can be bought cheap at all home improvement stores. Alternatively, you might also use a long-handled kitchen dish scrubber.
Repurpose an old toothbrush and use it to clean grout. The narrow head of the brush coupled with the long handle make it the perfect tool for getting down into the spaces between tiles.
Scrubbing grout by hand can be time-consuming, but it’s without a doubt the most effective means of restoring it to its original color.

, When it comes to maintaining tile, the best solution is prevention. By sweeping, vacuuming and polishing your flooring on a consistent basis, there will be less chance of stain-causing substances accumulating underfoot. Be on the lookout for places where dirt and debris have a tendency to collect, especially in corners, beneath furniture and around the baseboards.Aim to sweep or vacuum your tile floors every couple of days, and to mop or give them a more extensive wipedown about once a week.Neglected tile will quickly begin to advertise itself. If you allow it to get bad enough, it may even negatively affect the value of your home.

, When left untreated, even the smallest spill can become a stubborn stain. As promptly as possible, blot the affected area with a clean cloth dampened with warm water or a small amount of vinegar solution. Tracked-in dirt and food particles should be swept up so they don’t get ground into grout or rough surfaces.Gradually apply more vinegar as need until the stain begins to come out.
Responding to messes quickly is especially important if you have light-colored tile or grout that make discoloration more noticeable., Tile is praised for its durability and ease of cleaning, but it’s not indestructible. Harsh chemicals like bleach can cause natural materials to fade, while astringent cleaners may ruin the smooth finish of porcelain tiles after only a few uses. Whenever possible, opt for mild green alternatives such as vinegar and baking soda instead.Even commercial tile cleaners can take their toll when used frequently, and are usually no more effective than garden variety vinegar, anyway.
Never use anything more abrasive than a stiff-bristled brush or kitchen sponge to scrub your tile floors. Doing so may leave behind small scratches in which dirt and mildew can set up for good.

Buff the wood with a buff sander if the floor becomes dull to restore its luster.",How to Clean Bamboo Floors," Dirt on the floor takes away the shine. Use a fine fiber broom or a dust mop to remove any loose dirt from the floor. Keep the floor dry to ward off areas for dust to collect. Continual traffic on a dirty floor acts like the grit on sandpaper and can put little scratches in the floors finish.;
, A vinegar-water mixture at a 1:4 ratio is a good cleaning agent for your floor. You may also use any hardwood floor cleaner. Use a sponge mop. Do not let the mop get too wet. Dry the floor with a towel immediately. You can harm the wood if too much water sits on the floor.

, Fill a spray bottle with vinegar solution, and spray the area before wiping it up or you can very lightly dampen the cloth. Remember to dry the area with a towel immediately.

, Drying the floor with a towel helps to polish the floor and remove any marks left from the dampness of the mop or cloth. Take care not to use an oil-based cleaner, which will leave your floor cloudy and streaked.

, Make sure you lift items and set them down. Put felt or coasters under furniture to keep the pieces from marring the floor when they shift. Keep pets' nails trimmed. Vacuums with a beater bar should not be used to clean the floor.

, Shoe marks can leave dirt and scuffs on the wood. Be cautious of heeled shoes. Place rugs or runners down in high-traffic areas to protect the floor from dirt build-up, scratches and scuff marks. Also place mats or rugs at each doorway to cut down on some of the dirt entering the room. Be sure to clean or shake out the rugs regularly.

, Only use a damp cloth and appropriate cleaning solution on the floor. Scrubbing or rubbing the floor aggressively will harm the finish and the wood. Stains that are set in will need to be buffed out and the finish reapplied.

, Hang curtains or blinds over windows to keep prolonged exposure from the sun from fading your bamboo flooring. Window tint can also be applied to windows to limit the sun's UV rays and to protect bamboo flooring.

, Do not wax the bamboo or use oil cleaners. Further information about bamboo floor care and refinishing can be received from the manufacturer of the floor.

Choose a jigsaw with a standard blade or one with a laminate flooring jigsaw blade with fine teeth.,
Make a paper pattern to help you make curved cuts and avoid wasting laminate flooring.,
Cut out the curved shape.",How to Cut Laminate Flooring2," The fine teeth will allow you to cut the laminate flooring face up without chipping it.

,


Hold a piece of paper around the pillar or pipes and trace around the objects.
Cut out the paper pattern, and then lay it back down to test for accuracy. This may take a few attempts to get the exact shape you want the laminate to be. Once you can successfully place the pattern around the obstacle, you're ready to draw the shape onto the laminate flooring.

,


With a standard jigsaw blade, flip the laminate plank upside down. Place the pattern on the backside of the laminate, making sure to flip the pattern, so your cut laminate is positioned to come out correctly when the plank is flipped face up. Hold the jigsaw vertical, so the blade runs smoothly from one edge of the laminate to the other.
If cutting the laminate face up, place painter's tape on the laminate along the pattern to keep it from chipping. Mark the cut line on top of the tape and cut with a jigsaw with a special blade.

One end will be coped to fit over the first piece you cut. The other end will either be left square if it ends at an inside corner or left long and cut to fit if it's an outside corner.;
, Bevel the end of the molding to be coped at a 45-degree angle with a miter saw. This will reveal the profile. Darken the edge of the profile with a pencil so it will stand out more when you cut it.

, Angle the coping saw about 30 degrees to remove more wood from the back of the molding than the front. Then slowly and carefully saw along the profile. Concentrate on staying just outside the line. You can always sand or file away extra material.

, Check the fit of the coped piece. Mark any high spots.

, File or sand off high spots. Use rolled-up sandpaper or a rat tail file to fine-tune curved sections. File and sand until the joint fits tightly.

Spread the laminate sheets out.,
Measure the length you need and mark the cut lines.,
Cut the laminate.",How to Cut Laminate2," Be sure to lay the sheets out on a flat work surface to ensure accurate measuring and marking. Since you will be cutting the laminate with the finished side up, you’ll want to lay the sheets out face up, as well. You will be marking the cut lines directly onto the finished surface of the laminate., Use a tape measure to get the length you need, then use a fine-tipped marker with non-permanent ink to mark the lines where the cuts need to be made.Be sure to mark the lines on the finished side of the laminate.


You can easily remove non-permanent ink from the laminate with a damp cloth as long as you do so fairly quickly after you make your cuts.Many people opt to use a wax pencil for marking lines onto laminate, but the wax lines can get dull and difficult to see quickly.

, To make straight cuts like this, a circular saw or a handsaw is usually the best option. Keep the laminate sheet with its finished side up. Use your cutting tool to carefully saw along the line you’ve just measured and marked. After you make the cut, use a damp cloth to wipe away any remaining ink from the laminate’s surface.Be careful when you handle newly cut laminate. After you make the cut, the edge will be extremely sharp.Because the edges are so sharp, you may want to wear protective gloves when you're handling cut laminate. Keep your safety goggles and dust mask on at all times.
Place a bucket beneath your cutting table, so the majority of laminate dust falls into it while you're sawing. Frequently bag up this debris and throw it away.

Take a full sheet of laminate and lay it on top of the second-to-last piece. Line the sheet up so that it fits snugly against the wall.


Leave the sheet there while you create your template.
Carefully measure the amount of overlap with your tape measure.

, Use a scrap piece of laminate to create a template. Make sure to cut the scrap to be the same width as the overlap. Then place the template on top of the laminate sheet you need to cut, which should still be lined up closely against the wall.


Push the template snugly against the wall, as well.If you’re cutting laminate flooring, add ¼ inch to account for possible expansion.

, Use the template to mark your cut line onto the laminate's surface with the non-permanent marker, then put the template aside. Use your cutting tool to saw along the marked line. Since this is another straight cut, a circular saw, jigsaw or handsaw will work best.


After you make the cut, use a damp cloth to wipe away any remaining ink from the laminate’s surface."

Create a paper template to guide your cut.,
Trace the shape onto the laminate and make the cut.Use your paper template to trace the required curved shape onto the piece of laminate with the non-permanent marker.",How to Cut Laminate4," Obstacles usually require irregular or curved cuts to be made. The jigsaw is the ideal cutting tool for this. Use a jigsaw with a standard blade or, if you’re cutting flooring, use one with a laminate flooring jigsaw blade with fine teeth.


The fine teeth will reduce the likelihood of chipping the laminate., Making a template will help you get the curved cut just right and prevent wasted laminate. Hold a piece of paper up against your obstacle and trace around the object. Cut the shape out of the paper. Put the paper template back down next to the obstacle to confirm the accuracy of the shape.


You may need to make several attempts before you get the template exactly right.
Instead of creating a paper template, you can also use a forge profile gauge. Push the gauge up against the obstacle to get the shape, then transfer that shape onto the laminate by tracing it with your marker., Use the jigsaw to carefully cut along the marked line. Hold the jigsaw vertically, which will help the blade make a smooth cut from one side of the laminate to the other.

Decide on an installation method.,
Consider the temperature and humidity of your bathroom.,
Take floor maintenance into consideration.",How to Choose Bathroom Flooring1," Prepare a budget of how much you are willing to spend on new flooring. Having a fixed budget will keep you from going into debt on home repairs. It will also help you make decisions about what types of flooring you will use and how you will install it.Depending on the material, bathroom flooring materials can range in price from a little less than $1 to as much as $100 per square foot ($10.76 to $1,076 per square meter).;
, When considering flooring, it is important to consider the importance of the material’s visual appeal. Some cheaper flooring options are less attractive. However, they will not break your budget. On the other hand, higher-end flooring options will add an extra visual panache to your. Ultimately, you will need to look at your budget and determine which type of flooring meets your financial aesthetic needs.

, Another important factor to consider is whether you want to take a DIY approach to the installation. Installing the bathroom flooring yourself can save you a lot of money. However, some materials are easier to install than others and, unless you are a particularly handy person, you may need to hire professionals., Taking into consideration the climate of your bathroom should help guide you to the correct bathroom flooring. Some materials handle moisture well, holding their original shaping and resisting warping. Others are better at conducting heat and keeping your feet warm. Ultimately, you will want a flooring that is durable and functional.If your floors get particularly cold, you might want to consider installing a radiant floor heating system. This will heat your floors and limit the amount of moisture in your bathroom., Certain types of flooring require less cleaning and maintenance over time. If you are less inclined to clean your bathroom regularly, you should look into a type of flooring that is low maintenance. However, these low maintenance tiles also tend to be more expensive. Cheap flooring tends to need frequent cleaning and is more susceptible to damage.Some types of flooring need to be treated with chemicals regularly to prevent damage from moisture.

Consider vinyl flooring.,
Look into linoleum.,
Consider ceramic or porcelain tiles.,
Look into cork.,
Determine if you want plastic laminate.,
Consider stone tile.",How to Choose Bathroom Flooring2," Vinyl is one of the most popular type of bathroom flooring because of its reasonable price and practicality. You can install it in any type of bathroom and it is easy to clean, waterproof, and stain-proof. Starting at about $1 per square foot ($10.76 per square meter), vinyl will help your renovation money go the furthest.Vinyl tiles are relatively easy to install and are great for DIY projects. Vinyl sheeting is more difficult to install but better at keeping out moisture.
Vinyl flooring is also warmer and softer than ceramic or porcelain tiles.

, This type of flooring has a high visual aesthetic value and is relatively easy to install. Linoleum, which is made from linseed oil, cork powder, wood flour, ground limestone and pigments, is also considered a green flooring option because it is made with renewable and biodegradable materials. It is also pitched as being capable of preventing the growth of microorganisms and repelling dirt and dust. However, it can be rather expensive, with a starting price around $4 per square foot ($43 per square meter).One major drawback to linoleum is that it is susceptible to staining.

, These hardy tiles require little maintenance and are among the most visually appealing flooring options. Both sets of tiles come in multiple sizes and colors and can be installed by a more adventurous do-it-yourselfer. However, these tiles are much colder and harder under your feet. The prices for these types of tiles start at around $1 per square foot ($10.76 per square meter).You may want to consider installing a radiant floor heating system under your tiles.

, Cork is considered a green flooring alternative and can add some panache to your bathroom. The material is mold and mildew resistant and very warm and soft on your feet. Unfortunately, cork floors are more high maintenance, needing to be treated with polyurethane every few years to prevent moisture from seeping to the flooring. Cork flooring starts at $2 per square foot ($21.52 per square meter).In order to prevent water seeping into the flooring, it is best to buy unfinished tiles and treat them once the floor is installed. Because this can be difficult, it is best to let professionals install the floor., This type of flooring is the cheapest option at only $.49 per square foot ($5.27 per square meter) and comparatively low maintenance. It is also easy to lay laminate. However, it does not handle moisture well and can buckle and warp over time.To prevent laminate floors from buckling, you will need to regularly caulk any gaps near the walls, tub, or any other fixtures.

, If you have the resources, stone tiles, made from natural stones like limestone, marble, granite, and slate, offer a variety of unique bathroom styling options. However, stone tiles can be extremely expensive, with prices ranging from $2 to $100 per square foot ($21.52 to $1,076 per square meter). In addition, natural stone tiles are high-maintenance, requiring regular cleaning and sealing.You should consider hiring professionals to stone flooring.

Be sure to buy tiles that are rated for floors.,
Avoid carpet.,
Purchase textured stone.,
Be cautious about using wood flooring.",How to Choose Bathroom Flooring3," If you are purchasing ceramic floor tiles, make sure that they have a grade of 1 or 2 for floors. You should also check the ceramic tiles’ coefficient friction (COF) to make sure that the they will not be too slippery. For ceramic tiles, a good COF is .5 or greater. On the other hand, porcelain tiles have their own rating system established by the Porcelain Enamel Institute (PEI). When buying porcelain, make sure that they are rated at least PEI III.Following these guidelines will ensure that you do not buy tiles that will cause you to slip and hurt yourself.

, You should avoid installing carpet in your bathroom. Carpeting will absorb moisture and quickly become full of mold and mildew. For people with severe allergies, the accumulation of mold and mildew can be hazardous and result in serious illness.If you have carpet in your bathroom, you should consider replacing it as soon as possible.

, Honed and polished marble can be extremely slippery when wet. To prevent accidents, you should choose stone with textured or skid-resistant surfaces. Tumbled stone, which has been mechanically mixed to remove rough edges and soft spots, is a good choice when looking for an aesthetically appealing and safe stone option., Although wood is one of the more attractive flooring options, it may not be the best option for a bathroom. Because it is so absorbent, wood flooring is susceptible to water damage. You will need to regularly treat it with oil or wax every five or six years.Wood flooring is also easily scuffed and scratched.

If you don’t plan to make the top step level with the area where the stairs begin (ex. deck, doorstop, etc.), be sure to account for this gap in your measurement. Be sure to measure from framing to framing.






;
, This will give you the total number of steps on your stairs. The typical rise per step is about 7 inches (17.8 cm), but you'll probably use a different height in your final construction. (See below for a handy rule of thumb.) If your total rise is 95 inches (241 cm), divide it by 7 inches to get 13.53. Round down to get the number of steps: 13.









The rule of thumb for treads and risers is that the sum of each should equal between 16 and 18 inches (40 and 45 cm). So, if your riser is 7 inches (17.8 cm) tall, your tread should be anywhere from 9 to 11 inches (23 to 28 cm) long. This makes the treads long enough to comfortably fit the average foot on and high enough to make stepping easy.

, To continue with our example, divide 95 inches (241 cm) by 13 steps to get 7 and 5/16 inches (18.5 cm). On your stringer, each step will rise 7 and 5/16 inches.








, The run of each step should be no less than 9 inches (23 cm) and realistically at least 10 inches (25 cm). Multiply the total number of steps by the run of each step: 13 total steps x 10 inches = 130 inches (330 cm) total run. The total run is the horizontal distance the stairs will travel from beginning to end. In our theoretical example, the total run is 130 inches.









If you intend to build a long staircase, you may need to install landings every so often. Since the longest boards you will be able to find that are appropriate for this project will probably be 16 feet (4.88 meters), you will probably max out at about every 14 steps; however, you can install landings sooner if you prefer. If your staircase will have landings, considering each section of stairs as its own mini staircase will help you follow the steps below.

, The stringers are the pieces of wood that will run diagonally underneath the length of the steps to hold them up; these are what your steps will eventually be attached to. Determine their length the same way you determine the hypotenuse of a triangle in geometry:









Multiply the horizontal length (run) by itself, multiply the height by itself, and add the two results together. Then, find the square root of this sum.

sqr(130 x 130) + (95 x 95) = 161 inches (409 cm)



, If the stairs will sit flush with the vertical face of the structure, you need only look for places to either directly attach your stringers to the existing framework or add supports that will link the stringers to the existing framework. However, if the stairs won’t sit flush with the existing structure (such as if they will attach to a deck with an overhang), be sure to either create a secondary support system or modify the tops of your stringers accordingly.









If the stairs will mount beneath an overhang, making sure that the top step isn’t level with the top of the structure will simplify the process.

, To prevent your steps from sagging or bowing as you step on them, a wide staircase will need plenty of stringers underneath to keep it evenly supported. For safety reasons, the stringers should be spaced between 16 inches (40.6 cm) and 4 feet (121.9 cm) apart. A very narrow staircase might be able to get away with having only two stringers, but it’s best to start at three and work your way up as necessary.









Wider staircases are almost always preferable to thinner staircases because they are much easier and more comfortable to navigate. If possible, elect a wider space for your staircase and shoot to use at least three or four stringers.

, Don’t cut it down to length just yet; it will sit at an angle that depends on the height and depth of your steps, and the ends will have to be modified.








, In our example, you would need to mark it at 7 and 5/16 inches (18.5 cm) on one side by 10 inches (25 cm) on the other. Be sure you know which side corresponds with the height and which side corresponds with the depth to keep from ruining your measurements.








, This angle will depend on the size of your steps. Be sure to account for any modifications (ex. added length when mounting beneath an overhang) if necessary.









Place the carpenter’s square over one corner of the lumber. Lay the side marking the height along the end of the lumber and the side marking the step depth along the length of the lumber.
Draw a line across the lumber from the step-height to the step-depth mark on the square. This line marks the horizontal top of your stringer.
Mark the line so that its length is equivalent to the depth of one stair. Start from the end of the existing line that is closest to the center of the board, measure outward, and mark the spot.
Use the square to draw a line perpendicular to the spot you just marked. This line marks where your stringer will sit flush with whatever you’re attaching the staircase to.
Cut along these lines. The top end of the stringer will now fit to the attachments at the appropriate angle.

, Using the horizontal top of the stringer as a reference point, measure down a distance equal to the height of one step, across a distance equal to the depth of the step, and so forth until you’ve drawn the necessary number of steps.








, If using a circular power saw, cut to the edge of the marks then use a hand saw or jigsaw to complete the cut. Stop saw cuts 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch short of the opposite lines.








, To cut off the protruding bottom corner, simply mark and cut a line parallel to the top of the last step.








, Make sure the height is accurate.








, Lay the first completed stringer down on a 2x12 and simply trace the outline of the first stringer onto the 2x12. Then cut as necessary.








, How you attach the tops of the stringers to the structure will depend on the structure’s surface, overhang, etc., but one way is to nail metal joist hangers to the floor joists. Only joists made with 2x12s (or bigger) provide enough surface area for mounting brackets. Set the bottoms of the stringers on a firm footing like concrete, wood flooring or concrete blocks if in soil.


If sitting on concrete, set the stringers on tar paper to prevent the rotting of the wood due to moisture.

, Toe boards usually are made from 1x6-inch (2.54x15.4 cm) wood. Though you can do without them, screwing these planks vertically between each step will look nicer, last longer, and protect the end grain of the cut stringers.

, Cut the riser material to length and secure across each stringer with 2 1/2 in. (6 cm) screws.

, Cut the tread material to length and secure it to the steps of the stringers with 2 1/2 in. (6 cm) screws. If you wish, cut the treads so that they overhang the stringer just a bit.


For an extra flourish, measure the necessary depth of each step (plus overhang), divide it by half, and cut each board to this width; you can then install two boards for each step.

, If you want your stairs to have a little bit more class, you can install trim boards cut to length of the tread and install them right underneath.

, If your stairs are outdoors, especially, consider treating the wood against the elements. Even if you're building indoor-use stairs, consider treating them to safeguard against everyday wear and tear.

Add a DIY turndown service ritual.",How to Make a Hotel Bed," To begin achieving that perfect hotel-like bed experience, you’ll want to start from scratch.


Starting with a blank slate will get you in the mindset of creating that perfect, clean, and comfortable bedding experience.
It will also help you make your bed correctly, going step by step.;
, To get the most out of making your bed, and feel your best when it’s complete, use nice clean bedding.


Nothing is quite as relaxing as slipping under crisp clean sheets when it’s time for bed. Clean bedding will not only make your bed look crisp and help you feel refreshed, but it will be easier to lay down and get right.

, Gather up all your bedding and place it together next to your bed.


Try making stacks of similar items keeping everything organized and increasing your workflow.
For example, stack your bedding in order of when you need it. Put all your sheets together first. Keep all your pillow cases together and close to your pillows.
You may also want to iron your bedding like your sheets and pillow cases. Ironing will get rid of any wrinkles and creases, allowing you to experience a smooth crisp flat surface to rest on. When it comes to the type of bedding you need to make a hotel-quality bed, it's largely personal preference. To start, get the right size bedding. If you have a Queen sized bed, get Queen sized bedding. The weight of your duvet and duvet cover are also preference. However, hotels typically use a medium-weight feather down.
Thread count will somewhat factor in how comfortable your sheets are. But the type of material and thread length of thread are the real factors. Sheets with a thread count between 500 and 800 are generally considered to be more of a premium quality.
When looking for sheets, pure 100 percent Egyptian cotton will be the softest and likely most expensive. 100 percent Pima cotton will also be extremely comfortable, though not quite the same quality as Egyptian cotton.
Look for bedding that also has a longer thread. Shorter threads can poke out of the stitching and feel scratchy.

, Since you’re starting with a blank canvas, make sure that your mattress is clean as well. To clean your mattress, use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum. Press down firmly and go over the top and size of your mattress. If you have stains, you can use an upholstery stain remover.
Vacuuming and lifting stains from your mattress will also rid it of dust mites and odors which could otherwise cause allergies and affect your quality of sleep.
You’ll feel a lot better and more comfortable knowing that there’s nothing gross under your fitted sheet.

, Start with your clean and crisp fitted sheet. This is the sheet that has the rounded elastic corners. Place the sheet around your mattress and pull it taught in each corner. The elastic portion of each corner should be tucked in under the corners of your mattress.
The seam at each corner of the sheet should be in the middle of the mattress’ corners.

, The first flat sheet lays down on top of your fitted sheet. Put the first flat sheet on the bed and make sure that your sheet reaches to the edge of the mattress where your headboard is.


Lay the sheet down so that it drapes evenly over each side of the bed. Lay the sheet with the finished side facing down, toward your fitted sheet.
Flatten the sheet and pull it taught on each side so there are no wrinkles.

, Align the blanket to match the sheet. You will want to use a light blanket that is made of cotton or linen.
Flatten the blanket out and pull it at the corners to meet the corners of your sheet. Fold the portion of the blanket toward your headboard down to where your shoulders or chest will be when laying in the bed.

, This is your second actual sheet, but your third layer because you've placed a blanket. The third sheet will go above your light blanket. Lay it with the finished side facing down toward the mattress.


Align the third sheet to match with the placement of the first sheet. Bring the top of this sheet to align perfectly with the edge of your mattress at the headboard.
Flatten the third sheet with your hands and pull it taught at all corners.

, Fold down the top edge of the third sheet over the top edge of your blanket.


Take the portion of your third sheet that extends past the blanket and fold it back so it's now between the blanket and your first sheet.
Fold and flatten the portion of the sheet under the blanket so it rests perfectly flat.

, Now take the top of your first sheet which is still flush with the edge of the mattress’ edge on the headboard side. Fold the portion of this first sheet that extends past the edge of the blanket and the third sheet back over the top of the blanket and third sheet. This portion of your first sheet will now be on top of the other two layers.
Flatten the edge facing the headboard to give your bed a smooth, crisp look.
How far down you fold your sheets will depend on how many pillows you plan to place on your bed. You want your sheets to end where your pillows start.

, Next, you will fold the corners at the foot of the bed. Take all three layers at one corner and pull taught. Flatten the sheets at the foot of the bed.


The excess fabric that still needs to be tucked under the mattress will form a triangle shape. Bring the leftover fabric down and over toward the foot of the bed. It will create an envelope-like look. Then fold the remaining fabric under the mattress.
To get a nice envelope look, run your finger down the side of the bed at a forty-five-degree angle. Do this while pulling the sheets taught with your other hand. This creates an imaginary triangle. Fold the triangle portion of sheets at the bottom under your mattress.
Tuck in the rest of the sheets and smooth to remove wrinkles.
Do this for both sides of the bed.

, Lay the comforter down with the top edge about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the headboard. Without letting go, throw the comforter on your bed and let it float down on top of your sheets. This motion will allow it to retain fluff.
Pull the corners taught and equally distributed on both sides of the bed. Then fold the top of the comforter back in a rectangle to leave room for your pillows.

, Then arrange the pillows to your preference.


The amount of pillows and styles you use is up to you. The only requirement is that you use the same number for each side of the bed. Place the pillows in a symmetrical arrangement on each side.
Once the pillows are laid, you may unfold your duvet cover slightly to meet the pillows.

, You may add a throw blanket over your duvet cover if you wish to accent your bed any further.


Depending on the size of your throw, fold it into a rectangle and gently lay it on the duvet cover toward the bottom third of your bed.
Do not let any of the throw extend over the foot of the bed. It will make your bed look sloppy and uninviting.

, If you want the true hotel experience, invest in high thread count sheets and go all white. White is a symbol of luxury and an all white bed will make you feel luxurious and relaxed. White looks clean and inviting and will alter your mind and body to give you a quality rest.
Sheets that are 300 thread count or higher will have a large impact on how comfortable you are and how well you rest. When you are comfortable you get better sleep.

, Invest in a few different types of pillows. Hotels offer a range of pillow types to give you the freedom to choose and an ultra-plush experience. Don’t overdo it. But create a variety with feather and down, down-alternative, and a boudoir pillow. These options give you variety and allow you to arrange pillows in a way that makes you feel comfortable and swaddled.
Five pillows is a good balance.

, No amount of preparation and attention to precise detail will counter an uncomfortable mattress. To truly get that floating on a cloud hotel bed feeling, invest in a mattress that is right for you. Whether it’s a foam, feather, or adjustable mattress. Find one that provides you with the most comfort.
If you don’t get a sound rest and feel comfortable, you’ll be tossing and turning all night, ruining all your hard work.

, You’ve been diligent and done a lot of hard work to make your bed look perfect and inviting. Make going to bed a ritual that allows you to enjoy your work.


When it’s time for bed, dim the lights. Light a candle, or turn on an aroma diffuser. Then slowly pull back the sheets and enjoy the crisp inviting fabric as you slip into bed.
to further enhance your nighttime ritual, get rid of any blue light sources. Blue light throws off our body’s circadian rhythm and prevents you from sleeping properly. Blue light is often found in screens from our phones, tablets, and computers. Instead of falling asleep to the TV, read a book.

Choose a wood with the hue, grain, and finish that appeals to you and that will enhance the light and décor of your room or home.,
Oak has been the standard for durability, however all solid wood plank flooring is durable.,
Decide on a plank width that suits the size of the room.,
Once you have selected a wood for its appearance and appeal, select a grade that fits your budget.,
Choose a finish that will enhance the brightness and tone of the wood as well as preserve it.,
With these considerations in mind, take a few moments in the room or rooms you are going to re-floor and actively imagine the wonderful transformation you are about to make.,
Next, work with a flooring consultant to confirm or help you with your final selection.",How to Choose Wide Plank Flooring," The appeal of your new flooring is the most important quality to consider. Visualize whether amber, blond, tan or deeper hues would best show in the room’s light and would best blend with or accent your furnishings. Do you prefer the look of clear wood, planks with exuberant grain, the occasional accent of knots, or a lovely burlington pattern? Lighter woods like pine, birch, white and red oak, or hickory can open up a smaller room or give a more airy feeling to a dimly-lit room. Darker woods like walnut, stained or deeply-hued woods such as cherry, can look more elegant and formal. They also suit the quiet seriousness of a study or office.;
, Each of the many beautiful woods available will last generations. Also, if you select wood harder than oak, whether maple, birch, or ash, it is more of a challenge to finish, and you may want to leave it natural. If you want to adjust the hue of your flooring with stain, select oak, a softer hardwood, or pine. If you are seeking a bright, warm Early American look in your home, wide plank heartwood pine exudes the welcoming, rustic appeal of a lodge.

, 5–12 inch (12.7–30.5 cm) or 12–16 inch (30.5–40.6 cm) planks look in proportion with medium or larger rooms or to evoke the Colonial era. The beauty of knots or burling will show to greater effect in wider planks. Narrower-width planks with lots of grain or color variation can exactly complement a smaller room but look busy in a large room.

, You may admire the clearest wood. Or you may have a nostalgic yearning for more or fewer knots. Wood milled for vertical grain is harder than that with open grain. Buy the highest grade you want to afford.

, Tung oil is best and easy to maintain, but there are other finishes, as well as stains to adjust your floor’s hue. Remember that proper finishing of wide plank flooring enables it to function effectively for any usage, including that in your kitchen.

, From a good vantage point, relaxed in a comfortable chair at a time of day when the entire room is in its best light, use a set of printed or actual wood samples to make some comparisons. Look at your first sample and note its characteristics. Is it light or dark? Is it amber, roan, tan, or coffee? Does it have grain, burling, knots, or is it clear? Make a mental picture of the sample, then look out across your room and imagine it covered in that wide plank flooring. By working with each sample and sensing your responses to it, you soon will know the wood or woods that hold the most appeal for you.

, For years to come you will enjoy the glowing warmth, intricate patterns and barefoot comfort of wide plank flooring.

Wear the right pajamas.,
Put a hot water bottle in the bed— there's no easier way of keeping them warm at night.,
Try bed socks if a hot water bottle isn't enough.,
Pull your pillows closer to the duvet or sheet.,
Get blankets.,
Don't turn the heating up too high.",How to Keep Warm in Bed," Ones with shorts or short sleeves are not good for when it's really cold and neither is a short nightdress. Try long-sleeved pajamas with long pajama bottoms. A one-piece pair of pajamas can be a great idea too, especially one with feet.;
, Make sure the water is hot from the tap but not boiling. Do not free-quarters full. Squeeze out any remaining air, put the stopper in, and dry the top and sides. Then put it into its cover, which 1) it protects feet against too much heat, and 2) because it totally transforms something functional and ordinary into something very cute and pretty which the grumpiest of teenagers will love to have in their bed! Put it in the bed for at least 30 minutes before bedtime, so it has enough time to make the bed lovely and warm.

, These aren't like ordinary socks. These are furry and thicker and will keep feet warm in case they get cold. Go to the store and find a fuzzy style in a color you love.

, Then only your head will be sticking out but don't pull the pillow too far so that you're under the duvet or sheet.

, Fleece blankets are recommended as they are soft and warm. Either put them under the duvet or sheet or on top An electric blanket sound a good idea, but you have to remember to turn it off—a hot water bottle is much simpler and doesn't use electricity.

, A better (and greener) solution is to wear an extra layer under your pajamas if it's really cold.


Try scheduling the heat to turn up only 30 minutes before you plan to wake up, so you don't have to wake up to a freezing room. This will make it easier to get up in the morning.

Choose which size to buy.,
Set the mattress up against a wall.,
Place the air mattress on a soft surface.,
Use sleeping bags.,
Make the bed as you would a regular bed.",How to Make a Bed on the Floor1," Air Mattresses, like regular mattresses, come in twin, full, queen, and king sizes. It’s probably best to splurge and get the full or the queen. Even if you only plan on having one person sleep on it, the twin is still quite small and may not offer enough room to spread out comfortably.Make sure to buy one that has an electric air pump. Many come with this built right into the mattress. Blowing up an air mattress yourself is arduous and time consuming.
More expensive doesn’t always mean better when it comes to an air mattress. Much of the comfort will come from how you set it up, so don’t feel like you need to spend an arm and a leg. A decent full sized air mattress can be purchased for anywhere from $45 to $75 dollars.;
, Unless your air mattress has a headboard, you’ll want to be sure there is a wall behind it. This will act in place of a headboard and keep your pillows from falling back behind the bed in the night.You can also put the mattress up against some furniture like a couch or a regular bed.
Keep the mattress away from drafty windows.
Don’t place it too close to a radiator. Not only will this make you too warm at night, too much heat runs the risk of damaging the plastic of the air mattress.

, Most air mattresses have vinyl or plastic underneath to keep them from moving. This can make squeaking noises at night and isn't always the most effective at keeping the mattress in place. Put your mattress on carpet if you can.You can also put a blanket or yoga mat under the mattress to help keep it silent and stationary.

, Unzip a sleeping bag and place it on the mattress. This will act as a cushion to make the bed softer. It will also help you keep warm as the plastic of some air mattresses can become cool at night. Cover it with a fitted sheet to keep it in place., You should treat an air mattress like any other bed when making it up for the night. Start by putting a fitted sheet on it. Then lay out a regular sheet and and a blanket. You can tuck them under the mattress to help them stay put. Finish it off with a warm comforter and some pillows."

Get some old pillowcases.,
Lay one pillowcase on top of another.,
Sew the pillowcases together along the long side that you pinned.,
Repeat with the rest of the cases.,
Attach some velcro to the openings.,
Insert the pillows.",How to Make a Bed on the Floor2," A pillowcase bed is a long mattress-type cushion that you can spread out on the floor to lay on. By sewing some pillowcases together and stuffing them with pillows you should have a cushion long enough to accommodate your whole body. You’ll need at least five pillowcases for this project, but depending on how tall you are and how big the pillowcases are, you may need to add more. Lay them out end to end on the floor and measure them to be sure you are making a pillowcase bed that is big enough.


You can use pillowcases you have around the house or buy new ones from the store. They should be standard size and relatively sturdy.
Consider going to a thrift store if you don’t want to use the pillowcases in your house or buy brand new ones.
Ask family and friends if they have any old pillowcases they would like to get rid of.
You can also use a twin sized bed sheet. This will require a little extra sewing., Line them on all four sides and make sure that the open ends are both facing the same direction. Pin them together on one of the long sides. This will be the side you end up sewing together., Try to stay as close to the edge as you can, sewing the cases together about half a centimeter from the edges. You can do this by hand or use a sewing machine.

, After you have sewed the first two cases together unfold them on a table. Make sure your stitch is straight and close to the edge. Then, take the next pillow case and lay it out on top of one of the two connected ones. Pin it on the long side again like you did the first time and sew.


Repeat this process until all five pillow cases are connected edge to edge.
Make sure all the open sides are facing the same way.
Make sure you are always sewing on the same side. The side with the stitching will be the bottom, leaving the top looking clean.
Always unfold the pillowcase bed after attaching each case. You should only be adding the next case on top of the one preceding. Otherwise you will end up stitching more than two together and ruin your pillowcase bed., You can buy strips of velcro at hardware and craft stores. Sew it into the openings lengthwise all the way across. Since you’ll be putting more pressure on your pillow bed than a normal pillowcase, it will help to have something extra in place to keep the pillows from sliding out.If you are a little craftier you could also sew large buttons at the openings.
Including a zipper would make it even more secure.

, Once everything is assembled, stuff each of the five cases with pillows. Try the pillow bed out. If you are using old pillows, they may not all be even. You can experiment with which pillow feels best in which position.


Some larger or fluffier pillows might make it difficult to close the ends of the pillow cases. This is fine, just keep it in mind."

Get a yoga mat or sleeping pad.,
Lay out your yoga mat or sleeping pad.,
Lay out a sleeping bag on top of the mat.,
Add layers.,
Make the rest of the bed up like normal.",How to Make a Bed on the Floor3," Yoga mats are soft and designed so that they don't slide around when rolled out, especially when used on a wood floor. Using a Yoga mat will keep the upper layers of your bed from moving around and cushion you from the hardness of the floor.A sleeping pad is a good alternative to a yoga mat. Sleeping pads are foam or inflatable pads big enough to accommodate one person and are often used for camping. They are usually easy to roll up and store. You can get them at outdoor and wilderness stores or online.

, This should be the first layer of your floor bed. It will give your bed its shape and provide you with some cushion and support so you are not directly on the floor.


Choose a place away from drafty windows, open doorways, or heaters.

, If you have one, a sleeping bag can add a lot of cushioning to a bed made on the floor. You can choose to put it on top and get in it, but if you have other blankets a sleeping bag makes a great soft base for your bed.

, Since making a bed on a yoga mat doesn’t provide much cushioning, the more layers of blankets you can add the better. Start with some sheets and soft blankets. Avoid using anything knitted or a blanket with a crazy design on it that might have bulging areas that will make the bed feel uneven. Use as many as you can spare., Add some sheets, a blanket, and a quilt. The other blankets are there to create a soft surface for you to sleep on. These should be set aside for last because you will use them to cover yourself while you sleep.

Look for any stains on your mattress.",How to Know if You Should Replace Your Mattress3," Determine whether the mattress is more than seven or eight years old. As a rule of thumb, you should replace your mattress every seven or eight years. Beyond this age, mattresses tend to degrade and become less comfortable.If you are over forty years of age, you should replace your mattress every five to seven years. Typically, people are more sensitive to mattress pressure points after forty years of age., Think about how frequently you have rotated your mattress.

You should regularly clean your mattress and use a mattress encasement such as an allergen resistant cover.If you have mold on your mattress, it will smell very bad. You may also be able to see black discoloration on the mattress. If there is mold, you should get it replaced., Take off the bedding and examine the mattress for stains. If you use a mattress protector, take it off as well to see if any stains have leaked through all of the layers. Although you may have used a mattress protector and taken other precautions, such as not eating in bed, years of wear and tear can result in stains.

Grab the end of each pillow in each hand.,
Hit the pillows.,
Squeeze the pillows.",How to Fluff Pillows1," Push the ends of the pillow in-and-out. Do this in the same way you would play a squeeze box or piano accordion, but much faster.You can then reshape the pillow with your hands to sit correctly on the bed or to fit into the pillowslips. Fluffed up pillows improve the overall look of your bedroom. They will also be more comfortable and help you to sleep better.Make sure you're not allergic to feathers or down before you sleep on, or fluff up pillows containing them, though. Feather and down is a reasonably common allergy, especially in people with asthma or other lung conditions.;
, If the pillows haven't become too moisture laden, you can fluff them by hitting the sides simultaneously with your fists.


Feather pillows are the easiest to fluff, as they have the lightest fill material. For a feather pillow, simply hitting it lightly should do the trick.
Take your pillow, and whack in on your bed a few times to even it out.

, Hold the pillow at the top. Make sure the pillow is going up and down, not side-to-side like you have it when you are sleeping.


Move your hands down to about the center of the pillow, and perhaps a little bit above it. Now quickly squeeze, let go, and catch the pillow.
Do this around five times. After squeezing the pillows, shake them strongly, and put them on your bed again and then beat the pillow with your flat hand on every side.

Put pillows in the dryer with a tennis ball.,
Leave the pillow out in the sun.",How to Fluff Pillows2," You can throw the pillows in a dryer with something like a tennis ball. Even just running the pillow through the dryer should fluff it up. You could put your pillows in the dryer once a month.Put the tennis ball in a sock, tie the sock at the end, and throw them both in a dryer for a few minutes. The pillow will be fluffed and perfect for a good night’s sleep. Try this method only if you haven’t been able to fluff the pillow by hand.For cotton fill pillows, put the pillow in a dryer on low for 20 minutes, as this will take the place of you hitting your pillow repeatedly. The pillows should be completely dry when you remove them, and you can fluff them more by doing the fist blows. Use a low heat or air setting., Usually pillows lose their volume because of moisture, so the sun can help dry them and increase fluffiness.


When fluffing pillows by hand (patting and molding the pillow) doesn’t do the trick, you should leave your pillow out in the sun for a couple of hours. You could hang the pillows outside on a clothes line, if you have one.
About three to four hours should be enough time to make sure the sun absorbs the moisture. By the way, it’s also possible to wash your pillows, depending on the type of pillow."
"
Regularly fluff your pillows.,
Replace your pillow every few years.",How to Fluff Pillows3," Fluff pillows daily to maintain their shape.


By fluffing the pillows daily, air can circulate to keep them from getting permanently deflated. You won’t have to replace them as fast.
Wash your pillowcases regularly too. Who wants to sleep on a dirty pillow case? Washing your pillowcases every week is a good idea., Some pillows cannot be fully restored and should be replaced.


Experts suggest replacing pillows every 4-6 years, primarily for removal of dust mites. Place your pillow on a flat surface. If it has lumps, bumps or dents, it’s probably time to replace it. If you wake up with a sore neck, it’s probably not providing you with enough support.
Once pillows have been repeatedly crushed and the stuffing is flat due to moisture (likely sweat), you probably won't be able to return them to their original fluffiness. If the pillow smells of mildew, replace it. Fold your pillow in half and then see if it pops back into place. If it doesn’t, it’s probably time to replace it.

Rub off dirt and dust.,
Select a cleaning product.,
Follow the safety instructions for your product.,
Rub the product on with a cloth.,
Allow certain products to dry.,
Buff the Bakelite with a dry cloth.,
Use last resort methods.,
Run the item under hot tap water for 15–30 seconds.,
Rub with a test chemical.,
Treat Bakelite and Catalin as described in other sections.,
Dry and clean celluloid.,
Clean Galalith.,
Clean Lucite.",How to Clean Bakelite," If there is dirt or dust on your Bakelite, clean it off by rubbing with a dry cloth. Use a dry toothbrush to reach small crevices, grooves, and cracks.


If you are not 100% certain the material is Bakelite, use the methods in the identification section to confirm it before continuing. If you have a strong nose, you might notice a diagnostic smell while rubbing the plastic.;
, There are several products commonly used to clean Bakelite. While these are often specialized and more expensive than general purpose cleaners, using one of the following is highly recommended. Bakelite requires a slightly abrasive cleaner to remove the deteriorated surface material, but can be permanently ruined if an overly abrasive cleaner eats through to the pulpy filler material inside.Use Magnolia Glayzit or Soft Scrub for slightly faded Bakelite.
Use Brasso, Novus plastic polish, Simichrome metal polish, or an automobile rubbing compound to treat more severe fading and/or light scratches.Brasso is usually the cheapest, but may require more elbow grease.

, It's usually a good idea to wear gloves and work in an area with good ventilation. The warning label on the product you chose will provide more specific information.

, Put a dollop of the cleaning product onto a clean, soft cloth. Rub it over the surface of the Bakelite in circular motions. You might notice some improvement immediately, but you do not need to achieve a fully restored shine in this step. Add more of the product onto the cloth whenever necessary.


Do not apply a lot of pressure to Bakelite objects, especially if they are scratched or cracked, or you may wear through the outer surface and into the pulpy (and potentially toxic) filler material.
Catalin objects, which includes most ""Bakelite"" jewelry and brightly colored Bakelite, do not have filler material and can be scrubbed as hard as you like.

, If you are using Novus, Magnolia Glayzit, or an automobile rubbing compound, leave a thin layer of the material over the Bakelite surface until it dries to a cloudy or hazy film.Skip this step if you are using a different product.

, Use another clean, dry cloth to buff the Bakelite material until the excess cleaning product is removed and a shiny surface is left behind. Do this regardless of the cleaning product you chose.


If necessary, repeat with another layer of cleaning product.

, If several applications of the cleaning product fail to restore the shine or repair damage from scratches, you can use one of the following methods restore protection and an attractive appearance to the Bakelite. This is only recommended as a last resort, due to the possibility of damage:


Use a high speed cloth buffing wheel to lightly smooth the surface. Overuse can permanently remove the Bakelite's outer surface.

Or very lightly and evenly sand the Bakelite with finest grit sandpaper you can find (1000 grit or above). Once sanded, apply the cleaning product again, or cover the surface with paint.Again, over-sanding or using coarse sandpaper can permanently damage the Bakelite.

, This will cause many early plastics to release a distinct smell. This step is not recommended for broken items, or items with delicate non-plastic attachments. If the item is dirty, rub it with a cloth first to remove the dirt. If you have a sensitive nose, you may notice the smell simply from rubbing.


A smell of formaldehyde means the plastic is Bakelite or Catalin. You might recognize the smell from preserved animal specimens in biology labs.A rotten milk smell comes from Galalith (French Bakelite).Camphor smell (a pungent evergreen or old-fashioned mothball odor), comes from celluloid.
If there is no smell, it is probably Lucite, but could be a different plastic protected by a finish or paint.
If the smell doesn't match any of the above descriptions, it's possible the piece is a modern ""Fakelite"" imitation product.

, Use this method if the hot water test was inconclusive. You may use Simichrome, which can also be used for polishing, or Formula 409, which can cause damage but is a more accurate test.Either way, take a tiny dab of the material with a cotton swab, and rub it against an inconspicuous corner of the plastic that has been dried and rubbed clean of dirt. If the cotton swab comes away yellow or yellow-brown, the material is probably Bakelite.Otherwise, you may need to take it to an antique shop for identification.


Wash off the material with mild soap and water, then dry immediately.
Some black Bakelite objects, or Bakelite that has been recently re-worked, may not respond to this test.

, Catalin is essentially the same material as Bakelite, and can be cleaned and polished using the same methods. In fact, since Catalin does not contain the pulpy ""filler"" materials used in Bakelite production, it can generally stand up better to slightly abrasive treatments, such as metal polish or sanding.If your object could use a stronger polish, check whether it is Catalin using these guidelines:


Catalin was often produced in bright colors. Bakelite is usually brown or black unless it has been painted, but there are exceptions.Most ""Bakelite"" jewelry is actually made from Catalin.

, Celluloid is the only common early plastic that can be damaged by water, but if you dry it immediately after the water test, it will likely be unharmed. Use a soft cotton cloth or swab to dry the plastic, since celluloid can be easily scratched. A barely dampened cotton swab can remove small spots of discoloration, if dried immediately afterward, but further cleaning and repair may require an expert., Galalith is a white, glossy plastic made from milk casein and formaldehyde. Dust it with a soft cloth, but avoid using chemical cleaners. If it is severely scratched, take it to an antique expert for repair.

, First, rinse or scrub off dirt on the lucite surface. Use plastic polish to buff or repair scratches in this clear, acrylic plastic. To repair severe damage, you may need to use a polishing wheel.Novus brand plastic polish is likely the best-known. Use Novus 1 for buffing, Novus 2 for light to moderate scratches, and Novus 3 for deep scratches.

Disconnect the hose from the spigot.,
Attach a siphon pump, if you have one.,
Place heavy objects around the valve.,
Roll the mattress toward the valve.,
Carry the mattress outside and empty it completely.",How to Empty a Waterbed," Start by removing all bedding from the waterbed. This includes removing mattress pads, sheets, comforters, pillows, and everything else. Ultimately, you won’t be able to drain the bed without stripping it., After stripping your bed, take a few towels and place them around the waterbed. You may also want to position a few around the ends of the waterbed mattress so they can catch any water that spills.Keep extra towels around in case you have a spill larger than you anticipated.

, Go behind the bed and unplug the waterbed heater and any other plugs that might power some aspect of the bed. Without unplugging the waterbed, you could damage it or put yourself in danger., The fill-and-drain valve is the valve you use to fill or empty your waterbed. This valve is very often located toward the foot of the bed. It may be in the center, or it may be toward one side. After you find the valve, remove the cap from it., Push out as much air as you can from the mattress. Take a light broom and sweep from the top end of the mattress toward the valve. Remove as much air as you can, as air will slow down and complicate draining the bed., By placing the cap back on the valve, you’ll stop air from getting back into the mattress. Make sure you tighten the cap so water doesn’t get out, either., Take the garden hose and place the spigot head out of a window near a spigot on the side of your home. Take the other end and lay it near the fill-and-drain valve of the waterbed.The draining end of the hose should be lower than the waterbed. If it is not, the bed will not drain.
You can choose to empty your waterbed into a sink or a tub, instead of outside. However, if you choose to use this method, make sure that the sink or tub drain quickly and properly. If not, you could wind up flooding your home.

, Put your bucket next to your waterbed and place the end of the hose inside the bucket. The bucket will catch any water that comes out of the hose before you begin the draining process., Allow the hose to run until a steady stream of water spills out into the bucket next to the bed. Running water through the hose will eliminate any remaining air from the hose. This will aid in the draining process.


You might need a second person to be waiting outside by the spigot.
Leave the hose connected to the spigot., Take the cap off the waterbed and attach the waterbed hose adapter to the waterbed. Then, connect the hose to the adapter. Make sure all three parts are tight so that no water can leak out., Once you disconnect the hose from the spigot, water will begin to flow out of the waterbed, into the hose, and onto the ground outside your home.


You can also drain the water into a sink or a tub., If you want to use a siphon pump to speed up the process of draining the bed, you need to hook it up it up to the end of the hose that is outside. This should be done immediately after you disconnect the hose from the spigot. After you connect the pump, quickly power it on.

, By placing heavy objects, like books, around the valve, you’ll depress the valve and lower it in comparison to the rest of the waterbed. This will aid in draining the bed., As the mattress empties, you will need to start rolling the mattress from the head of the bed toward the valve. Do so slowly and methodically. Make sure you force water out of the part of the mattress that you are rolling.


The mattress will probably need to be about 75% empty before you start rolling it.
Be careful as to not put too much pressure on the valve.

, After you’ve emptied the clear majority of the mattress – over 90% -- you may need to carry it outside to help drain more. When you do this, place the mattress on a soft, non-abrasive surface, upside down. Hold the end opposite the valve up and shake any remaining water out of the mattress.

Use a leaf blower to get rid of debris.,
Rinse the turf with a garden hose.,
Brush the grass using a broom or rake.",How to Clean Artificial Grass1," Whether it be fallen leaves in autumn, fallen branches after a storm or some other accumulation of debris, a leaf blower can help you swiftly clear your turf. Designate one corner of your yard and blow all debris towards it. Once all debris is grouped, you can collect it for removal. You should only have to pass over the turf once to completely clear it of larger debris., While a leaf blower is effective for larger debris, it might not clear the grass of dust or spills. Using a garden hose, rinse the entirety of the turf. Make sure to do so lightly; too much water pressure could damage the grass. Start from one end of your yard, moving across and sweeping the hose in a circular motion as you do., Brushing the grass frequently will keep the grass blades pointed upwards, affording your lawn a more natural look. You can use a brush, as long as it has soft bristles. However, you’ll be better served using a broom or a rake; the added reach will make covering the whole yard easier and quicker. Start in one corner of your yard, and move horizontally as you brush. Once you’ve reached the opposite end, take a few steps back, and move across again.You should always brush in the same direction, against the grass’ natural grain.

, Before you take any steps to clean the mattress, you must remove everything from the mattress that is not part of it. This is important, as dirt, grime, and bad scents can accumulate on sheets, mattress liners, mattress protectors, and other things we commonly put on top of our mattresses.


Carefully fold your sheets up as you remove them so more dust or dirt does not fall on to the mattress.
Remove any mattress protectors you may have covered it with.
Take off any pieces of fabric that can be detached., Perhaps the most important way to prepare your mattress is to vacuum it completely. Without vacuuming it properly, there will be a lot of dirt and debris left on the mattress – undermining your effort to clean it.


Use an upholstery attachment with your vacuum.
Systematically go back-and-forth width-wise on the mattress until you vacuum the whole thing.
Use the crevice attachment to vacuum hard-to-reach places like crevices, indentations, and embroidery.
Flip the mattress and vacuum the other side., Sprinkle baking soda or another deodorizer liberally on the mattress. Allow the baking soda to sit for up to 24 hours. Without properly deodorizing the mattress, your mattress will retain smells and won’t be properly cleaned.


It is okay if you wind up using an entire box or even more.
The longer the baking soda sits, the more moisture and odor it will absorb from the mattress.
There are a variety of mattress deodorizer products you can choose to use when cleaning your mattress. Just make sure to follow the directions on the product’s box.
If you live in a dry climate, consider leaving your window open.
If possible, move the mattress into the sunlight., After you’ve allowed the deodorizer to sit on the mattress for an extended period, you need to vacuum the mattress again. Use your upholstery tool and crevice attachment to remove all the deodorizer. After you think you’ve removed all the deodorizing, vacuum the mattress again.


By vacuuming the mattress, you’ll remove not only the deodorizer, but the smell and other debris, too., This is important, as dust mites are known to aggravate allergies, may cause asthma, and may cause rashes. You can eliminate dust mites by lightly spraying a mixture of essential oils on your mattress. Combine:


Two cups of distilled water.
Two teaspoons of essential oils. Some oils may include: clove, rosemary, eucalyptus, caraway, or tea tree.
Spray the mixture lightly over your entire mattress.
Allow the mixture to dry before proceeding., To complete your deep clean, you’ll also have to disinfect your mattress. This is important, as your mattress may accumulate bacteria and other contaminants over time. This is especially important if you’re cleaning the mattress for someone new to use.


Combine a quarter cup of bleach and one gallon of cool or cold water.
Do not add any other ingredients to the mixture.
Spray the mixture lightly over your mattress.
Use safety equipment like gloves, goggles, or even a mask when working with bleach. In addition, make sure you are in a well-ventilated area.
You can also use other products like Lysol spray to disinfect your mattress., Lightly spray the mattress with vinegar and sprinkle a small amount of baking soda on the stain. Allow the mixture to sit for a couple hours. Scrape off the baking soda with a butter knife or flat piece of plastic. Vacuum up the baking soda after it has dried.


Dirt stains are not only unsightly, but they can be a breeding ground for bacteria and other health problems.
For tougher stains, consider using general upholstery cleaner or other solutions intended for use on mattresses. Make sure to follow the directions and do not oversaturate the mattress., Combine 3 tablespoons of baking soda and 8 ounces of hydrogen peroxide with a half teaspoon of dish soap. Lightly dab the solution on the urine stain. Avoid soaking the mattress with your solution. Allow the area to dry.


Urine is one of the most common stains on mattresses – especially on mattresses used by children. Not only does urine stain mattresses, but it leaves a nasty odor that is hard to get rid of.
If the stain is still visible, combine 3 tablespoons of laundry powder and a tablespoon of water. Spread this on the stain and allow it to sit for half an hour. Then, remove the paste with a knife or thin flat piece of plastic. Vacuum to remove any residue., Combine a quarter cup of hydrogen peroxide and a tablespoon each of dish soap and table salt. Spread the concoction over the stain and let it sit. Scape the remaining residue off with a butter knife or thin piece of plastic.


While not as common as urine, blood stains on mattresses are not that rare. But while blood stains lack the odor of urine stains, they’re often harder to remove.
If the stain is still visible, lightly dab it with a clean white cloth that has been moistened with hydrogen peroxide., Moisten a clean white cloth with cleaning ammonia and dab the stain lightly. Wipe the area again with a clean white cloth.


Ventilate the room.
Avoid using too much ammonia or any other liquid on your mattress.
Perhaps the toughest stain to remove are vomit stains, because stomach acid and food products combined create an unpredictable combination that is hard to target with specific cleaning products."

Sprinkle baking soda across the baking sheet.,
Add a layer of hydrogen peroxide.,
Add a second layer of baking soda.,
Let the mixture sit for two hours.,
Wipe down your pan.",How to Clean Baking Sheets1," To start, take some baking soda from your pantry. Sprinkle a light layer on your baking sheet. Make sure the full surface of the sheet is covered in a layer of baking soda to start., After adding your baking soda, pour a layer of hydrogen peroxide over the baking soda. If you don't have hydrogen peroxide, you can purchase it at any drug store., Sprinkle another layer of baking soda on the baking sheet. Makes sure to cover the full surface with a light dusting of baking soda. This will ensure the baking sheet comes clean., The baking soda and hydrogen peroxide needs to soak into the sheet to break down dirt and debris. Let the sheet sit for about two hours. Place in on a flat surface where it will not be disturbed.If you have young children or pets, keep the baking sheet out of their reach.

, Take a coarse sponge or rag. Wipe the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide off the pan. Built up debris should come off easily after the pan was soaked.If there is any lingering baking soda after scrubbing down the pan, you can rinse it off with clean water.

Reinstall internal components.,
Reattach the top cover.,
Refasten the black metal casing screws.,
Replace the bottom cover.,
Reattach the side panel with the access door.,
Reinsert the wireless card and refasten the last side panel.",How to Clean an Xbox 360 Slim," Orient your Xbox on a flat, sturdy surface so the front, where the power button is located, is pointing to your right. The Xbox should stand on its narrow end with the vent facing up.This cleaning process can be somewhat long and tedious, especially the first time. Smear some war paint under your eyes and get ready to wage war on the dirt and dust clogging your Xbox.;
, Gently slide the screwdriver into the farthest right vent slot on the vent. Pry the vent with firm, moderate pressure until it partially pops free. Use your fingers to continue prying the vent up with moderate pressure until it releases.When prying with your screwdriver, use your free hand to assist the screwdriver by pressing upwards on the end of the vent.

, Use your fingernail to lift the lip of the silver or black panel border at the right back corner of the Xbox. In the space on the inside of the border, there will be three release tabs that look like small slots: one on the right, one at the middle, and one on the left.When lifting the border part of the Xbox, you’ll likely need to continue exerting pressure on it with your hand to keep the release tabs accessible.
There are six total release tabs for each side panel, three along each long side. These tabs are positioned similarly for both side panels., Insert your screwdriver into the slot at the right, back corner. Press forward slightly while prying up on the panel with your free hand. When the tab disengages, that corner of the side panel should pull up and out.Disengage the release tabs in sequence. Start with one end, then disengage the middle tab, then finish with the opposite end. Repeat this for the remaining three opposite side release tabs.
As more tabs are disengaged, more of the panel should slide free. When all tabs are released, the side panel will pull free of the Xbox.
To keep parts from getting lost or accidentally damaged, refasten the vent to the side panel by pressing the vent back into place on it. You should feel it click when it is secured.

, In the area under the side panel, you will see a small square shaped part on the left side held into a USB port by a screw. This is the wireless card. Use a Phillips screwdriver to unfasten the screw, then pull the card out of the USB slot., Flip the Xbox so the side with the removed vent/side panel is facing down. Use your finger to pry free the access door on the left side. In the same fashion you removed the first vent, use your screwdriver and free hand to pry free the vent to the right of the access door., The release tabs for this panel are similar to the first side panel you removed, but the tab above the access door will be a little larger and the one below it a little smaller. In the same fashion as the previous side panel, remove this one as well.The small release tab below the access door may be difficult to disengage with a normal screwdriver. Use a smaller screwdriver to make disengaging this tab easier.After the second side panel has been removed, much like with the first panel, keep it and its parts together by pressing the vent back into place and reinserting the access door.

, Reorient the Xbox so its back (which will have ports for ethernet, video output, and more) is facing up. There will be a rectangular, white sticker on the right side. Below this sticker will be the UL listing. Rub your fingernail over the sticker to the right of the UL listing to feel for an indentation. This is where the release is., You should be able to push your screwdriver through the back panel sticker to insert it into the release. Make this process easier by carefully cutting around the inner perimeter of the screw hole with the tip of a utility knife., Orient the Xbox so its back is facing left and it’s standing upright. On the left side, you should see a silver part on the outer border. Beneath this is a small tab. Pry the tab forward slightly., With your screwdriver still inserted in the tab, position your fingers on the metal part of the inner panel and push outward on the case with moderate pressure. You should now be able to release the tab. Push in on the small hole you revealed next to the UL listing to release the second tab.When the second tab is released, the case should separate slightly. Do not try to force the case apart at this point. You still need to disengage the second set of inner release tabs.

, Position the Xbox so the back is facing to the left and the side panel upwards. To the left of the area where the vent was removed, there will be two visible tabs. Hold onto the metal part of the inner panel and apply moderate outward pressure on the plastic case. Gently release the two tabs., At this point, the tabs are disengaged and the case may come off easily. Because of this, you’ll need to carefully reposition the Xbox so it is oriented normally, with the front panel facing forward and the system lying flat., Lift the case with your fingers so it hinges open from the back. When the back is separated, slide the case toward the back of the system and then lift it upwards. Turn the removed case upside down and place the removed outer side panels and wireless card inside it to keep all your parts together.That was an awful lot of work just to get the case off. It's a good thing the vent snap fasteners and release tabs, after being disengaged the first time, will be less stiff the next time you clean your Xbox.

, To do this, you’ll need to remove five black screws. One will be at about the middle of the left side, another at the front left corner, another at about the middle of the front side, one in the center of the casing, and one last screw on in the back right corner.

There are four screws on the outside of an x-shaped piece of metal bordered by a raised metal box. Do not remove these screws ever., Flip the box over. Hold the case as while doing this to prevent it from coming apart. Much like you removed the first part of the case, pivot it so it hinges open at the back. When the case is separated at the back, pull the faceplate out about a half inch (1.3 cm). The casing should now pull free., Position the Xbox so the faceplate faces to the left. The faceplate will be connected to the system with cords and should not be pulled too far away. When the case is removed, the faceplate will be loose. Lay it face down in front of the side it’s connected to.You're almost finished taking apart the Xbox. Soon you'll be able to give it a thorough cleaning. Don't worry, it reassembles easier than it comes apart.

, The drive is a silver, rectangular box. Lift it from the right side while keeping its left side stationary. Reach under the cabling with your index finger and pinch down on the cable with your thumb. Wiggle the cable back and forth until it comes free of the drive. Do this for both connecting cables.Once your drive is disconnected, set it off to the side in a safe place. Never blow air inside your drive, as this can damage it.
Your drive should have a black rubber band around it. You may need to slide this off during removal. Pay attention to the band orientation. The hole in the band is always positioned at the top of the drive., The fan shield is a solid black piece of plastic surrounding the fan. Note its orientation before removing it so you replace it correctly later. The shield is not fastened in place with connectors, and can be pulled free of the Xbox with little effort.

So you don’t forget the proper placement of the fan shield, you may want to take a picture of its original position with your cell phone camera., Dust has a tendency to collect on the fan and its surrounding heat shielding. Scrub these areas very lightly with a soft bristle brush, like a toothbrush. Do the same for any other areas on the inside of the Xbox that have buildup.Unlike your teeth, which should be brushed daily, for your Xbox to run best it should be cleaned with a brush and canned air about three to four times a year.

, In some cases, dust may have built up on and in the black drive area in the back left corner. Remove this drive by pulling it out through its slot on the back of the system. Put this off to the side, and use your brush to break up dirt in the area the drive was removed from., Use canned air or an air compressor to blow the loosened dust out of the inside of the Xbox. When spraying the fan with air, first insert your finger in between the blades so the fan remains stationary.

Spinning the fan will generate electricity. If this happens while your Xbox is disassembled, it could cause damage to motherboard components., Slide the removed part of the black drive back into place. Replace the black rubber band on the drive, if necessary, so the holes in the band are along the top of the drive. Plug both cords back into the silver drive. Set it gently back in place, then lightly push it forward as far as possible.

Double check your cable connections to your silver drive before setting it in place and after replacing the drive. If either of these cords come loose, the drive will not run.
Failing to replace the black rubber band of the drive will cause the drive to be loose and slide around inside your Xbox.
Over time, the rubber of the drive band may degrade and break or not stay in tightly in place. In this situation, fold a business card several times and tuck it in the front left corner of the drive seating., Reorient the Xbox so the faceplate faces you. Set the top of the cover back in place. It should seat firmly. Take the faceplate and align the tabs with their catches. Slide it into place. When you do so, it should audibly click., These should fall into place without resistance, with about a half inch (1.3 cm) of the screw remaining above the surface of the metal casing. When all screws are in their holes, use your screwdriver to fasten them snugly, but not overly tight.

If the black metal casing screws are tight or don’t fall into place easily, it’s likely the case isn’t seated properly. Remove the casing and reattach it, then try to refasten the screws again., Flip the Xbox while keeping the faceplate oriented towards you. Remove the parts you’ve been holding in the bottom part of the case. Align the front of the case with the tabs on the metal internal casing and the sides of the faceplate. It should slide on and the tabs will click into place., Position the Xbox so the side panel where the wireless card was removed is facing down. Take the side panel with the access door and press it back into place. Squeeze the sides of the case with moderate, firm pressure to engage the tabs with a click., Flip the box so the side panel with the access door is facing downwards. Insert the wireless card back into the USB slot. Refasten the screw finger tight. Hold the side panel so the narrow end with two tabs is facing right. In the same fashion as the previous panel, press it into place and squeeze the sides to engage the tabs.Whew! That was a pretty involved process, right? Rest assured, after taking apart your Xbox once in this fashion, it'll come apart more easily next time.

Blot spilled liquids with a paper towel.,
Clean any stains with a solution of water and granular detergent.,
Scrape pasty or sticky residues off with a knife.,
Use mineral spirits to remove signs of solid debris.",How to Clean Artificial Grass2," Paper towels should be enough to clean up most spills. You’ll want to be careful not to rub the liquid into the grass. Blot up liquid spills gently. As long as you act the moment the spill happens, it should be relatively easy to clean up., Mix a teaspoon of water with a pint of detergent in a container you can easily carry around. A bucket is your best bet for this. You can use a sponge or a soft cloth to rub the solution into the stain until it’s dislodged.


Once the stain is dislodged, you can rinse away the detergent with a garden hose.
This mild solution won’t damage your grass, and can clean up a variety of substances, such as coffee, alcohol or ice cream., Whether you’re dealing with gum, lipstick, crayon residue or paint, gently scrape it off the grass. Be careful not to accidentally cut the grass as you scrape. Follow the grass upwards with the knife rather than scrapping across., Soak a soft cloth in mineral spirits, then wipe the soiled blades of grass. Take care when cleaning with mineral spirits; you want to make sure the mineral spirits doesn’t go past the grass and beneath the turf as this could cause serious damage.Wear gloves when using mineral spirits, as it can irritate bare skin.
Wear a respirator when working with mineral spirits, as the fumes can be toxic."
"
Use a half vinegar, half water solution to kill bacteria.,
Hose and brush the turf once a week.,
Avoid treading on artificial grass during winter.",How to Clean Artificial Grass3," Artificial grass is a lot less likely to collect bacterial spores than natural grass; however it’s still possible, especially if you have pets. If you only need to spray a specific spot, just use a spray bottle. If you suspect the bacteria is more widespread, attach a hose-end sprayer to a garden hose and hose down the whole turf.A hose-end sprayer looks like a plastic bottle with a spray bottle nozzle. It screws into a garden hose and is usually used to spray fertilizer., Use a garden hose to spray water on your grass. This will keep it looking fresh as well as ridding it of small spills and odors.After hosing, use a broom or a rake to brush the grass. This will keep the grass blades pointing upwards, helping your lawn look fresh.

, Snow and ice won’t damage the grass by themselves, but walking on the grass too much can cause snow to turn into a layer of ice. If this does happen, avoid the temptation to remove the ice, as this could damage the grass blades. Instead, you should wait until the snow and ice melt naturally.


Avoid using salt to melt snow or ice. The residue can damage the grass’ carpet backing and prevent the lawn from draining properly."

Choose soft brushes.,
Wear latex or nylon gloves.,
Sweep away any dirt or debris.,
Dust your alabaster regularly.",How to Clean Alabaster1," Brushes that are soft to the touch, such as makeup or artists’ paint brushes are great for gently cleaning your alabaster. Make sure these brushes are clean before using them. Even a fingernail has the ability to scratch alabaster's naturally soft surface, so finding a brush that is gentle is pivotal to the cleaning process.


Avoid using rough surfaces, such as plastic cleaning brushes or steel wool pads, as these may scratch the surface and permanently damage the alabaster. ;
, When physically handling alabaster, wear flexible gloves to prevent any moisture or oils from transferring from your hands to the stone, which can cause possible staining. Even the slightest amount of moisture or oil can be harmful to a delicate piece of alabaster, so this preventative measure helps ward off unnecessary staining and damage. , Using your soft brush, gently dust the alabaster. Use sweeping motions to remove dirt. Do not attempt to wipe the alabaster with a dry cloth, as this may push the dirt further into the alabaster’s surface and make cleaning more difficult.


Some sources suggest that even using soft cloth may cause staining, so make sure you are using as little pressure as possible to remove the dust. , It is important to regularly maintain your alabaster, to keep it free of dust that may attract moisture and cause staining. You can dust your alabaster as often as you would like, but be sure you are following the instructions above to not cause any new staining or damage.If a gentle dry cleaning is not enough to get the job done, proceed to the next method for alternative cleaning options.

Scrub down the side of the tank with an algae scrubber.,
Siphon off excess algae.,
Do not replace more than a quarter of tank water.,
Use water treatments for larger bodies of water.",How to Clean Algae1," Remove your fish from the tank before scrubbing down the sides with an algae scrubber. You can buy an algae scrubber online or at a local pet store. You should use this to remove algae from a fish tank rather than simply changing out the water. Use the scrubber to gently scrub the sides and bottom of the tank where you see algae.Work from the top of the tank downward. This way, algae will sink to the bottom. This makes it easier to remove from the water.
If you can't find an algae scrubber, any scrubbing device with a rough surface will work. In rare cases, you may need to use a razor blade to remove very stuck-on algae. If you are using a razor blade, hold it at a 45 degree angle to remove algae from your tank.;
, Once algae has settled at the bottom of the tank, use your aquarium vacuum to siphon up the algae. Get as much algae as possible off the bottom of the tank. You do not want algae to start building up at the bottom of the tank after you removed it from the top of the tank., You should replace some of the water after removing algae, as there may be algae debris floating in your tank. However, only replace about a quarter of the tank each time you clean algae. Replacing any more than that can disrupt the bacteria in the tank, which can hurt your fish., When removing algae from a pond, manual cleaning may be too difficult. Instead of using a scrub brush, buy water treatments from a local greenhouse, department store, or online store. You pour a small amount of the water solution into your pond to effectively remove algae. Refer to the directions to know precisely how much to use, which depends on the size of your pond.Most water treatments will need to be applied over the course of a few days to successfully remove algae.

Find the drain.,
Pour hot water down the drain.,
Buy a commercial drain cleaner.,
Detach the drain.,
Follow the directions on the packaging.",How to Clean a Washing Machine Drain1," Usually the drain of a washing machine is a pipe behind the machine that the hose on the machine pours into. The hose is sometimes attached tightly to the drain or the hose may simply be pushed inside of it.

When identifying where the drain is, you will need to differentiate it from the hot and cold water lines coming into the washer. The hot and cold water lines should be smaller than the drain pipe and they may be marked with the colors red and blue, to show which is hot and which is cold.;
, If your washing machine is draining slowly but it is not completely clogged, you can try simply pouring very hot water down the drain to clear it out. This can release built up soap and scum that is narrowing your drainage pipe.

If you run your washer on hot most of the time, then this may not work for your drainage problem, as you have been doing this repeatedly. However, if you only run cold cycles, then pouring hot water down the drain may be worth a try.
In areas that freeze during the winter, drainage pipes can freeze and get blocked up with ice. If your area is frozen and you think you have a clogged drain, try pouring hot water down the drain to get rid of any ice that may have accumulated.

, If your washing machine drain is clogged, one way to clear it is to use a commercial drain cleaner. In general, these products can be very helpful for minor clogs but have limitations when it comes to unclogging a completely clogged pipe.

When buying a commercial drain cleaner, be sure to get one that is safe to use with your specific type of pipes and your type of drainage system. Some strong products that contain sulfuric acid can actually damage PVC pipes and they are generally not good for the environment as well., To use a commercial drain cleaner, you will need to detach the drain line from the machine and put the cleaner straight into the drain. On some machines you can simply pull the tube coming off the machine out of the drainage pipe. On some, however, you will need to unscrew the drainage tube from the machine at the bottom of the back of the machine.If you are doing this, be prepared for some water to come out of the machine and the hose to the drain.

, This usually begins by pouring the product down your drain with some very hot water. Then you will need to wait a specified amount of time for the product to do its work. Finally, you will need to flush the drain once the product has had time to clear it.Be sure to rinse out the drain cleaner after the specified amount of time. Leaving it on too long can damage the pipes.

Mix water and soap.,
Set up the ladder.,
Remove debris.,
Scrub with a brush.,
Rinse off the awning.",How to Clean an Awning1," Fill up a bucket with cold or lukewarm water. Pour three ounces of a mild laundry soap in the bucket. A soap that is made for delicates or baby clothes will work. Mix the solution in the bucket until it begins to foam.Do not use detergent instead of laundry soap. Detergent is typically too harsh.;
, If your awning is beyond reach, you will need to set up a ladder. The ladder should be an appropriate size for the height of your awning. Position the feet correctly, and set up any safety features that your ladder comes with., Remove as much debris from the awning as you can before you use the cleaning solution. Take off the cobwebs, leaves, and anything else that is on the awning. You can use a broom to “sweep” off the debris., First, you will need to wet the awning with a spray bottle or garden hose. Once you’ve done that, saturate a stiff scrub brush in the cleaning solution. Then use the brush to scrub the awning in a circular motion. Only apply the cleaning solution to the area that you’re working on.You should apply the soap as you work so that it doesn’t dry on other areas of the awning.

, Use a garden hose to rinse off the soap and water mixture. If you don’t have a hose available, you can fill a clean bucket with water, and pour it on the awning. Let the awning air dry once you’ve rinsed it thoroughly."

Blow dirt or dust off the window.,
Use clear water to clean lightly soiled acrylic.,
Use a non-abrasive cleaner on dirtier windows.,
Blot the surface dry.,
Remove scratches using car wax.,
Scrape the surface.,
Sand the surface.",How to Clean Acrylic1," Because acrylic is easily scratched, you don’t want to just wipe away any dirt or dust that is on the surface of the window. Instead, use air or water to remove dirt before you begin to clean. You can use canned air to blow dirt off of the windows, or drip water onto the surface that picks up the dirt and allows you to float it off.If you use water, blot the window dry with a microfiber cloth after the dirt has come up.;
, If your acrylic window still needs a bit of cleaning after you've removed the top layer of dust and dirt, use clear water to clean it. Simply repeat the process of dropping water onto the surface of the acrylic and blot it dry with a microfiber cloth.Don’t rub the window with the microfiber cloth as this can cause scratches in the acrylic.

, If you’re washing particularly dirty or outside-facing windows, mix equal parts non-abrasive cleaner and water to make a cleaning solution. Then dip a microfiber cloth in the solution and gently blot the acrylic surface clean.Good non-abrasive cleaners for this type of cleaning are castile soap, baby shampoo, or Woolite or Dreft.

, Once you’re done cleaning the acrylic window, use a dry microfiber cloth to blot the surface of the window dry. Avoid wiping the cloth across the surface of the window as this can cause scratches., If, once you’ve cleaned the window, you discover scratches in the surface, you can use car wax to remove them. Apply wax to the areas that are scratched and use the buffer that comes with the wax to buff the surface.If you’ve never buffed a surface before, proceed for gently with this step.

, If you have very deep scratches in the acrylic, you scrape the surface of the acrylic. Hold a sharp scarping tool at a 10 degree angle and move it from side to side, evenly and gently scraping off the excess.This technique should only be used for very, very deep scratches.

, Sanding the surface of acrylic gives it a matte finish, which gives it a frosted look. You can perform this technique with sand paper by hand, or with sanding tools. Simply sand the acrylic surface the same way you would with a piece of wood – start with a coarser sand paper and once you’ve worked over the entire surface, move to a finer paper and repeat the process.Using a buffer after you sand acrylic can give your acrylic an extra shiny finish.
This technique should only be used on unfinished acrylic or if your acrylic windows have suffered extreme damage from storms.

Purchase white or mineral spirit.,
Work in a well ventilated area.,
Wear gloves to protect your hands.,
Check your alabaster for painted areas.,
Dab a cotton swab or soft cloth into the spirit.,
Allow the solvent to dry thoroughly before applying more.,
Use a soft cloth and spirit to clean larger areas.,
Allow the solvent to completely dry.",How to Clean Alabaster2," White spirit, or mineral spirit, is a petroleum based solvent most often used in the care and preservation of alabaster. White spirit cleans the stone without removing its natural moisture and without adding new moisture. White and mineral spirits will not cause staining when used to spot clean alabaster, and will not cause damage to the surface, preserving the alabaster’s natural color and luster. White or mineral spirit can be often be found at your local hardware or art supply store. , When using white or mineral spirits, it is important to work in a well ventilated area. Fumes from white or mineral spirits can be dangerous if inhaled for a long period of time. Be sure you are working in an area with easy access to fresh air., Choose a set of nylon or latex gloves to work with. Wearing gloves is not only important to keep your hands safe from the drying effects of working with white spirit, but also to protect your alabaster piece from any moisture or oils on your hands., In rare cases, alabaster may have been painted. White or mineral spirit often used for cleaning alabaster can be harmful to these painted areas, so make sure to only use these spirits to clean unpainted areas. If your alabaster does have painted areas that need to be restored, consulting a restoration expert may be the best option., You will use this to spot clean smaller areas. Pat gently on the surface of the alabaster, especially where dirt or grime appears to have built up. Do not rub the cotton swab along the stain, as this may push the dirt further into the surface and make the stain more difficult to remove.

, If the first attempt does not completely remove the stain, repeat use of the spirit and cotton swab as described in the last step.


Keep in mind that subtle brown or red veining in alabaster is what gives alabaster pieces their unique nature, so some areas that may appear stained may actually just be a part of the stone's natural beauty.

, Douse a soft cloth with spirit and move the cloth along the natural grain of the stone. Be sure to follow the natural grain of the stone when wiping dirt and grime down, so as to not risk damaging the alabaster itself. Make sure that your cloth is fully saturated with white or mineral spirit before using it to clean your alabaster piece, as any areas left dry on the cloth may cause damage to the piece.

, Before determining if another pass is necessary, wait for your alabaster to dry thoroughly. Areas where the spirit has been applied may still appear stained before drying thoroughly, so be patient before determining if more cleaning is necessary.


Remember to be gentle when cleaning your alabaster! Alabaster is a sensitive stone and is easily damaged, so proceed with caution when performing any maintenance on the stone.

Pour one gallon of water into a bucket.,
Make the bleach solution.,
Make the vinegar solution.,
Unplug the water cooler from the wall, and remove the bottle.,
Wet a sponge to clean the inner surface of the water cooler with the cleaning solution.,
Rinse out the remaining cleaning solution.,
Lift off the drip tray and scrub well.,
Wash your hands well, and dry the new bottle with a towel.,
Remove the cap and place the new bottle.,
Check that it works.",How to Clean a Water Dispenser," This step is the same whether you're using a bleach or a vinegar solution. Consider a bucket with a handle, or one that is easy to manage. It's best if none of the bleach solution spills out of the container and onto the floor, or your clothes.






;
, Add 1 tablespoon of bleach to every gallon of water that you choose to use. If possible, use an unscented bleach, as it'll be easier to flush the smell out towards the end.









Mix the solution gently. Use disposable gloves if available (a recommended precaution, but not necessary). Be sure to do this in a space where you can afford to spill some, such as in a large sink., For the mixture, you'll need only undiluted vinegar and a bucket. To ease the scent of the vinegar, you can choose to add a tablespoon or two of lemon juice. Mix in one part white vinegar for every three parts water. So if using a gallon of water, use 1/3 of a gallon (5 1/3 cups) of white vinegar. If including the lemon juice, add it after mixing the water and vinegar.









As a word of caution, using vinegar is only about 80-90 percent as effective as using chlorine bleach to disinfect anything. While bottled water contains a very small amount of bacteria, it's possible for this amount to grow over time if not sanitized totally., Make sure there's no other electronics plugged into the same outlet, or near the area where you've chosen to clean your water cooler. This avoids any possibility, however small, of water meeting live electricity.








, Let it stand for 2-5 minutes (but no more to avoid wear and tear), then drain the solution through the tap (the cool temperature one if there are two) and into a separate container. Drain this container down a sink or toilet.








, Fill the inner reservoir with water four times and pour it out through the (cooler temperature) tap and into a bucket. Be thorough in this to make sure no bleach or vinegar taste is left behind.







, Wash both the tray and the screen (if present) and rinse both in clean tap water before returning them to the dispenser. Be sure to dry thoroughly so as not to leave moisture in any tight spaces.








, Be sure to wash your hands before manipulating the bottle again.








, Ensure a snug fit, and watch for air bubbles rising to the top of the bottle, indicating the bottle has made a seal with the dispenser.








, Fill a glass of water, try both faucets if your dispenser has them. Taste the water to make sure no unpleasant taste has been left behind.

Put on gloves and goggles.,
Mix bleach, algae cleaner, and water in a pump.,
Spray down the infected area.,
Rinse the area with a hose.",How to Clean Algae2," As you'll be working with bleach to remove algae from your roof, sidewalk, or other areas of your home, safety is important. Put on thick, protective gloves, as well as a pair of safety goggles. These will keep you safe from bleach as you work.If there are any plants near where you're removing algae, you should protect them as well. Cover plants in a plastic tarp to keep them safe.

, You can buy algae cleaner online or at a local department store. It should be mixed with bleach and water in a cleaning pump to remove algae from your home. Mix a quart of bleach, a gallon of water, and 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of a heavy duty algae cleaner in your cleaning pump.If you don't have a cleaning pump, you can buy one online, borrow one from a friend, or rent one at a local hardware store. For small algae spots, you can simply place the solution in a spray bottle.

, Spray the area where you see the algae thoroughly. You want to cover the infected area completely with your solution. Once the area is sprayed down, set a timer for 15 minutes to let the solution soak in. You do not need to scrub the solution. It will break down the algae on its own., Take a hose and use this to rinse off the solution. Make sure to rinse the solution off completely, especially if you're cleaning algae from somewhere off your roof. Leftover residue from your cleaner can cause damage. Once hose water runs clear, the algae should be gone."

Use copper or zinc strips on rooftops.,
Add plants to ponds.,
Maintain an aquarium filter.,
Stock your tank with fish that eat algae.",How to Clean Algae3," Rooftops are particularly prone to algae buildup. Stop by a local hardware store and get zinc or copper strips. You can install these strips along each side of your roof. This should help prevent algae.Install the strips along the side of the roof just below your roof's ridge.

, If you have a pond that's prone to algae, adding more plant life can help keep algae away. You can purchase plants that fight algae at your local greenhouse and plant them in or around your pond.Floating plants, like lilies and lotus, provide shade that blocks sunlight. This can slow down algae growth.
Plants that you submerge in water can also help fight algae. Go for plants like anacharis, hornwort and parrot’s feather. You can safely plant one bunch of six to seven submerged plants per two square feet of your pond.

, If you do not already have an aquarium filter in your fish tank, buy one at a local pet store. Installing an aquarium filter will help keep algae and other dangerous and unwanted substances out of your tank., If algae is a major problem in your fish tank, add some fish that eat algae. Catfish tend to eat algae and you can also install coral at the bottom of your tank.Be careful when adding new fish to an existing tank. Ask at the pet store if a particular type of fish is safe for your tank given its existing inhabitants.

Detach the drain hose from the machine.,
Put a snake down the drain.,
Snake the drain until all resistance is gone.,
Reattach the hose.",How to Clean a Washing Machine Drain2," If the clog you are trying to dislodge is not disrupted by chemicals, then you will need to use a snake to get rid of it. This requires that you detach the hose from the machine so you can get the snake down it.The drainage hose meets the machine at the back of your washing machine. There should be a clamp that attaches the two where you can use a screw driver to detach them.
Remember that some water will likely come out of the machine and the hose when you detach the hose, so have a bucket and some towels ready. This is especially true if the drain is so clogged that there is standing water in the machine.

, Once you have the drain pipe free, you can insert the snake down into it. A snake is a tool the consists of a long, sturdy wire that goes down a pipe and a handle at the end that rotates it. The key is to push the snake down the pipe and feel for clogs as you go. Once you feel resistance, you should turn the handle clockwise on the snake to rotate it in the pipe so it grabs any clogging debris.There are several lengths of snakes to choose from. Medium-length snakes that are about 50 to 75 feet (15 to 23 m) long tend to work well for home owners working on a variety of clogs, as they can get clogs pretty far down a pipe but they are easier to work with than longer, bigger snakes.

, It may take several turns of the handle on the snake to get a clogged area attached to the snake. Once you have turned it several times, pull the snake out and clean off all debris. Then insert the snake again to clear out any additional debris. You may also want to push the snake further down the drain after you clear one area, just to make sure there are not other clogged spots.As you turn the handle you may want to move the snake a little in and out of the pipe. This will help the snake to grab onto any debris in the pipe and pull it free.
Once you think you have the drain clear, pull the snake out of the pipe. To check that the clog is gone, you can pour water down it before reattaching it to your washing machine.

, Once you are sure that the clog is gone you should reattach the hose to the machine. Be sure to attach the drainage hose to the machine really well, as this is a spot that tends to leak on a washing machine.Fill the washing machine and drain it with no clothes in it to make sure you fixed the drainage issue. You should also look at the connection point between the machine and the drainage hose for any leaks.

Use a commercial cleaner.,
Scrub with a sponge.,
Spray with a garden hose.",How to Clean an Awning2," Any type of vinyl and fabric cleaner should work. If the cleaner is in a spray bottle, spray the cleaner over the entirety of the awning in an even mist. Begin by applying the cleaner to the bottom of the awning, and work your way up to the top. The cleaner works best if you don’t wet the awning before using it.Depending on the height of the awning, you may need to use a ladder to apply the cleaner.
Do not use an abrasive cleaner. Abrasive cleaners use friction to take off dirt, sand, and other particles.

, You can also use a soft or medium bristled brush. Begin to scrub the awning while the cleaning solution is still wet. Scrub every part of the awning., Use a garden hose or bucket of water to rinse off the cleaner. Make sure you’ve rinsed it off thoroughly. A chalky film will develop on the awning if the cleaner hasn’t been washed off. Allow it to air dry.Do not pressure wash an awning. Pressure washing can cause damage.

Avoid using dusting cloths.,
Use cleaners specifically designed for plastics.,
Clean small areas at a time.",How to Clean Acrylic2," When you’re prepping the surface of your acrylic furniture, avoid using a dusting cloth to remove dirt and dust. These types of cloths can trap particles that won’t seem big to the naked eye, but will scratch your furniture., Even though acrylic furniture is clear, you shouldn’t use the same cleaners that you do on glass windows to clean it. Cleaners specifically made for plastics, like Brillianize cleaner, is the best option for cleaning your acrylic furniture. It prevents scratches and won’t break down the acrylic, giving it a cloudy appearance., Squirt a small amount of cleaner onto the piece of furniture you’re cleaning and then polish that area with your cloth. Once you’re done with that small area, move on to the next. Don’t spray the whole piece of furniture and then wipe it down."

Don’t use aerosol cleaners on acrylic bath tubs.,
Use mild dish soap on acrylic tubs.,
Use lemons to remove hard water stains.",How to Clean Acrylic3," When cleaning an acrylic bath tub, avoid using any aerosol or acetone cleaners. The chemicals in those cleaners can eat through the acrylic of your tub., To clean acrylic bathtubs, use a mild dish soap with warm water. Wet the sides of the tub and a soft sponge with warm water. Apply a small amount of a mild dish soap to the sponge and gently scrub the tub.You should avoid using wire brushes or scrubbing pads as these can scratch the acrylic and ruin it.

, Instead of using cleanser on hard water stains on your bathtub, try rubbing lemons over the stains. Let the lemon juice sit on the stain for a few minutes, and then rinse with water and before drying it with a microfiber cloth."

Hose down the awning.,
Mix water and solvent.,
Scrub the awning.,
Rinse off the cleaning solution.",How to Clean an Awning3," Use a hose to wet all of the awning before you begin to clean. If you don’t have a hose, you can use a bucket of water or spray bottle to do the job. Make sure the awning is still wet before you apply the cleaning solution., Fill a bucket with water. Look for a dissolvable solvent that is made for or will work on aluminum. It is best to buy a solvent that is specifically made for aluminum, because a general cleaner may be too harsh or not work. Pour the solvent into the water. The amount of solvent you use depends on the type you’re using, so check the label for instructions., Submerge a brush into the cleaning solution you’ve created. Begin to scrub the awning. Continue to scrub until you’ve cleaned the entire awning.

, Use a garden hose and rinse off the awning. Make sure you rinse off every part that you used the cleaning solution on. A film will appear on the awning if you haven’t rinsed it off properly.


Rinse off any concrete or wood that the cleaning solution may have gotten on.

Fill the bleach dispenser with bleach.,
Turn the temperature to hot.,
Run the washer.,
Pause the cycle once the machine fills with water.,
Consider running a rinse cycle.",How to Clean a Washer with Bleach1," Most modern washing machines have a bleach dispenser drawer or compartment. Fill the drawer or compartment completely with bleach.Older models may not have a bleach dispenser. If this is the case with your washer, simply add between a half and a full cup of bleach directly into your machine's tub.If your bleach dispenser holds less than a quarter cup of bleach, you may want to consider using concentrated bleach. This will allow you to use the bleach dispenser but get the cleaning power of more bleach.;
, Hot water will help to sanitize and clean the inside of the washer. It will more effectively loosen any oils and grease that has built up over time than cold water would.The hot cycle does require more energy than a cold cycle, but if you only clean your washer every few months, you are not using than much more energy.

, You can either run a regular long cycle or, if your washer has one of these settings, a “Maintenance Cycle” or “Clean Out Cycle.” Both will swirl the bleach and hot water around the washer basin and the agitator, cleaning them thoroughly.Make sure the washer is empty when you run it. Any fabrics that are left in the washer will get bleach on them.

, In order to allow the bleach to really clean the inside of your machine, you should turn the machine off and allow the bleach to soak in the drum. Let it sit for about an hour before turning it back on and finishing up the cycle.You can stop the cycle on most machines by opening the door or pulling on the dial.

, If you are concerned with some residual bleach being present in the tub of your washer, consider running the washer a second time on hot, but without adding bleach. This second wash will get rid of any left over bleach. However, you could just choose to run a cycle of whites after you clean the washer, which would clean out any residual bleach and benefit the white fabrics.

Some people also suggest that you put a little vinegar in with this second wash to really get rid of the bleach. However, mixing bleach and vinegar can cause dangerous chlorine gas to be created, so this should not be done."

Wipe down the inside of the door with diluted bleach water.,
Add bleach to the washer.,
Set the dials on your washer.,
Run the washer.,
Clean your washer regularly.",How to Clean a Washer with Bleach2," The inside of the door on a front-loading washer is especially prone to a buildup of dirt and mildew. Take a cloth that has been dipped in a diluted bleach solution and wipe down all the areas of the door that have dirt buildup and mildew growth.

The bleach solution should be made by mixing ½ cup bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) water.Wiping down the inside of the door before you run a wash cycle will assure that any bleach that remains gets washed away.

, You should fill the bleach compartment on your washer in order to clean the interior of the washer. This should require less than a cup of bleach, but amounts will vary. Modern, front-loading washers all have bleach compartments, so look on the washer's instructions for the location if you can't find it.You may also want to pour a bit of bleach into the laundry detergent dispenser in your washer. Using about a 1/2 cup of bleach in the detergent dispenser will help to clean out the whole washer.

, Turn your washer to hot. It is a good idea to use hot water when cleaning out your washer. This helps to assure that all gunk and grime is removed.You may also want to turn on the ""extra rinse"" function on, if your washer has one. This will make sure that the bleach you use is fully removed at the end of cleaning.

, If you have not cleaned your washer in a long time, or ever, you should pick a long cycle to run. If you clean your washer regularly, a regular cycle wash should suffice.Some machines have a special ""Maintenance Cycle” or “Clean Out Cycle” that you can run. These cycles are designed to be most effective for cleaning out your washer.

, You should clean and sanitize the inside of your washer every few months. This will help to keep excess detergent and grime from building up on the inside of your washer.

Front-loading washers tend to allow dirt and grim to build up easier than traditional top-loading washers because they use less water and their design allows it to happen. Because of this, it's a good idea to sanitize a front-loading washer more often than you would a traditional top-loading washer.

Flush the syringe several times with cool water.,
Clean up your disinfecting area.,
Gather your supplies.,
Fill a clean needle with clean water.,
Drag the needle backwards against the sharpening surface.,
Repeat this motion a couple of times.,
Clean the syringe thoroughly.",How to Clean a Syringe," This may seem like a troublesome routine. However, cleaning syringes right before and after using them will greatly reduce the chances of catching a blood borne disease, like hepatitis or HIV. This will also prevent blood from hardening in the syringe., Kitchens work best for cleaning syringes, though bathrooms are also suitable in a pinch. Clean the entire area where you’ll be disinfecting syringes thoroughly with a strong cleaner, like bleach.









Avoid disinfecting syringes in dirty areas. Doing so could result in your bacteria or viruses being transferred from the work area to disinfected syringes., Wet your hands in cool water. Apply a household soap to them. Rub your hands together to lather up the soap. Pay close attention to the spaces between your fingers and your fingernails. Bacteria often hides in these places. Rinse the soap from your hands with cool water.








Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. A quick rinse will not effectively remove germs from your hands., If you don’t have suitable containers, use a clean cap or cup. The containers should be large enough to hold at least a full syringe of fluid. If your sink is flat bottomed, you may want to place these containers in the sink in case of spillage.








If you don’t have bleach, fill the container with high percentage isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher recommended) or hydrogen peroxide., Place the tip of your needle in the water. Draw back the plunger to fill the barrel of the syringe. Lightly shake the syringe. Position the needle over the drain and press the plunger to eject the water. Do this several times.









Never reuse fluid that has been inside a syringe. Fluid used to rinse or disinfect syringes should be disposed down a drain.Be careful when handling syringes, especially those that have been used before. Pricking yourself with a dirty needle may cause illness or infection.

, Pull the plunger back until it comes free of the syringe. Fill the barrel with cool water from the open plunger end. Reinsert the plunger and press it down to eject water through the needle and down the drain. Do this at least 3 times.









When the barrel is full of water, gently shake the syringe and tap the barrel against the palm of your hand. This will help loosen up hardened blood., Insert your needle into the container with undiluted bleach. Draw enough bleach into the syringe until the barrel is roughly half full. Do not overfill the syringe. Then pull the plunger as far back as possible without removing it.







, Lightly shake the syringe. Tap the barrel lightly against the palm of your hand. Do this for at least 30 seconds. The bleach needs at least this much time to disinfect resilient viruses, like hepatitis C and HIV.







, Position the syringe over a drain and press in the plunger to eject the bleach down the drain. Never reuse bleach when cleaning syringes. Repeat the process of drawing fresh bleach into the syringe, shaking it for 30 seconds, and ejecting the used bleach down the drain two more times.







, The water in your container has been contaminated by the dirty needle. Empty the water down the drain and clean the container with a strong cleaner, like bleach. Rinse the container several times with cool water. Refill it with water. To flush the syringe:








Draw water into the barrel until it is half full.
Remove the needle from the water.
Extend the plunger as far back as possible without detaching it.
Shake the syringe gently.
Press the plunger to eject the water. Do not reuse water. Repeat this at least three times., Empty the contents of both containers down the drain. Use fresh, undiluted bleach to clean the containers and the sink. Rinse bleach thoroughly with cool water. Dry the containers with a towel or allow them to air dry, then put them away.







, A magnifying glass, especially those used by jewelers or cosmetologists, will help you inspect the condition of the needle. Arkansas or carbide sharpening stones work best as a sharpening surface and can be bought at medical supply stores. You’ll also need a clean, small container for water, like a cup.


If a sharpening stone is unavailable, you can use the striking surface of a matchbox as the sharpening surface.
The magnifying glasses used by jewelers and cosmetologists can sometimes be found at flea markets., Only sharpen cleaned needles. Fill your clean, small container with cool water. Insert the tip of your needle into the water and draw back the plunger to fill the barrel halfway. Remove the needle from the water.







, Position the needle at one end of the surface so its angled part is flat against the surface. With extremely light pressure, pull the tip of the needle backwards along the surface until you reach the opposite end.









Take care not to pull the plunger of the syringe while sharpening. Doing so might draw dangerous fragments created by sharpening into the barrel.
Most needles sharpen in 2 to 3 passes when pulled along the entire length of a sharpening stone or the striking strip of a matchbox.
Pressing too hard on the needle when sharpening could damage the needle. Syringes with damaged needles should be disposed of in an appropriate container., After pulling the needle the length of the surface, lift the needle and repeat this process at least 2 more times. Flip the needle so the angled side is facing up and the tip is against the surface. Pull the needle against the surface once like this to finish sharpening.









Use a magnifying glass, if you have one, to inspect the needle point. If you notice roughness, pass the needle a few more times along the sharpening surface., Press the plunger to completely eject the water in the barrel. Wrap an alcohol swab around the base of the needle and pull the needle through the swab. Throw the swab away. Repeat this process with a fresh swab to finish cleaning your sharpened needle.









Sharpening a syringe creates small, sometimes invisible needle fragments. If injected, these can be deadly. Be thorough when cleaning sharpened needles.
Wet sharpened needles with sterilized water before using them. This will lubricate the needle, allowing for better penetration."

, Excess humidity can cause mold to grow on upholstered surfaces, such as curtains or carpets.Run your humidifier on a heat-safe surface away from any fabric.

, Warm mist humidifiers can release mist of varying heats, from lukewarm to hot. To protect your child from possible steam burns, use only cold-mist humidifiers in children’s rooms. Supervise your child whenever they are around your warm-mist humidifier.

Clean any stained areas with bleach.,
Remember to clean out drawers or compartments.,
Rinse areas after cleaning with bleach.",How to Clean a Washer with Bleach3," If you have used your washer to clean especially dirty items or dyed items, it may be getting pretty stained up. Use a mixture of ½ cup bleach to 1 gallon (3.8 L) water to clean areas that are stained. This mixture should reduce, or eliminate, the stains., The drawers or compartments used to deliver detergent into the machine can be cleaned with bleach as well. Even the bleach drawer or compartment can get a scrub down. Take a cloth covered in a diluted bleach and water mixture and wipe down all the surfaces on the drawer or compartment.Even though you run soap and bleach through these areas, they can have dirt and debris build up. This is especially true of the detergent compartment, because of the sticky nature of liquid detergent.

, To avoid getting bleach stains on your clothes in the future, you should rinse areas you have cleaned with bleach or wipe then down again with a cloth covered in warm water. Getting rid of bleach residue after cleaning with it can really minimize the risk of accidental bleaching."

, Fill the flask with a moderate amount of clean water. Add a few drops of dish soap to the water. Cap the flask and shake it well to clean it. Open the flask and inspect its condition. If there is stubborn buildup, you may need to scrub it away.If the water has become dirty, dump it down the drain. Rinse the flask and refill it with clean water and a few drops of dish soap.
For severely dirty flasks, allow the soapy water to sit for a few minutes. This will allow more time for the soap to break up buildup.

, To remove stubborn buildup from the inside of flasks, you may need a scrubbing tool. Because some vacuum flasks may have narrow top openings, small, long handled scrubbers or toothbrushes may work best.

Specialty bottle brushes are available at most grocery stores and drug stores. Look for these in the “baby” or “infant” section of the store.If you don’t have a suitable handled scrubber, wrap or tie a washcloth to a wooden spoon. Scrub the insides of the flask with the cloth wrapped spoon.

, When the inside of the flask looks clean, pour the cleaning solution down the drain. Rinse the flask to remove soap and loosened buildup. Allow the flask to air dry completely before storing it.

Storing a vacuum flask while still wet or capped could cause it to smell musty. To remove mustiness, use the process described for deodorizing and cleaning with baking soda and vinegar."

Use nematodes to kill larvae.,
Chemically remove grubs with insecticides.,
Use organic neem-based insecticides.,
Spray Japanese beetles with insecticidal soap.",How to Kill Japanese Beetles1," Nematodes are parasitic insect-eating round worms that feed on the grubs in the ground, providing an organic pest control method. Common nematode types include Steinernema Feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora.Place nematodes in the soil in late August or early September to begin treating the grubs for the next year.But you can apply nematodes as soon as there is evidence of Japanese beetle activity in your yard.Make sure the nematodes are fresh because they are living organisms. Water the ground before you spread them out, and keep the soil moist after you apply. You can also apply nematodes in mulch. For 50 or 100 million nematodes mix, use 1/2 teaspoon per gallon of water.
Beneficial nematodes only attack soil dwelling pests, such as Japanese beetles, fleas, German cockroaches, termites, and ants. They are not harmful to people, animals, plants, or earthworms.You can purchase nematodes online, at garden centers, or at most major home improvement retailers.
This method is effective for killing the pest in its larvae stage.;
, You can spray the plants with Japanese beetle killer, found in most retailers and online. Sevin dust can also work, but it might kill beneficial insects along with the Japanese beetles.


Some ingredients to look for when purchasing an insecticide are carbaryl, acephate, and permethrin.A Pyrethrin-based insecticide is a safe way to control pests on your plants while getting rid of other beetles in the process.Some insecticides are aimed at high Japanese beetle activity in your yard. Others are designed to be used in the early fall once the eggs have hatched and grubs are present. Make sure you read the label on the insecticide before you purchase it to find out what specific problem it targets.

, Neem oil is a natural pesticide that comes from the seeds of the neem tree, and is considered an anti-feedant because it reduces feeding of Japanese beetles when applied to the plants. Spray plants with neem oil to control the pests.


Azadirachtin, one of the components of neem oil, can also repel and reduce the feeding of nematodes.Use caution using neem oil if you have nematodes in your ground to combat grubs.
You can purchase neem oil insecticides online and at most major retailers with a garden center.

, Soap-detergent sprays are contact pesticides, with no residual effects. They are similar to household detergents, but are specifically designed not to harm plants like household soaps can.When applying insecticidal soaps, you must thoroughly wet the pest. Most pests needs to be sprayed every 4-7 days.
The ingredient you are looking for in a spray is potassium bicarbonate.Even soaps manufactured specifically for insects can harm certain plants. Check the label of the bottle, or do a test on your plant before spraying wide areas or repeatedly.

Keep your grass trimmed short.,
Take care of fallen fruit, pine needles, and mulch.,
Cultivate the soil in your yard or garden.,
Dig sharp materials into their tunnels.,
Add a barrier to trees or a gate to gardens.",How to Kill Voles1," Underbrush and grassy areas are great for voles to create hidden runways. Get rid of tall weeds and grass that can act as perfect cover for voles. Be sure to dispose of grass and leaves when yard cleaning as exposed piles are great for voles, as are piles of wood and debris.Think about what would be good shelter for voles and look to eliminate them from your yard.;
, Voles eat nuts, most fruits, and tree needles. In particular, voles enjoy apples so be sure to properly dispose of fallen fruit and rack pine needles. Also, do not put any mulch within 3 feet (0.91 m) or less of the base of your trees.Taking away any food sources will discourage voles from staying in yard.

, At minimum you will destroy the runway systems created by voles but you may also be able to keep the pests by suffocating them in a collapsed hole with debris and lawn food or by injuring them outright.Use shovels and spades to turn over the soil. Mark off your yard into strips and lift small trenches as you turn over the soil and fill the trenches with the soil from the strip beside it. You want to discourage voles from making tunnels by disrupting the soil. Soil should be cultivated in the autumn and spring., Use sharp material to make digging tunnels uncomfortable. Try a mix of 10% coarse gravel and 90% soil. You may also mix your soil with material like Permatil or Soil Perfector. Use a shovel and spade to penetrate the tunnels and deposit the sharp material. Cultivate your soil once the material has been deposited., Do not girdle your trees. Use ¼ inches wire screen mesh or smaller hardware cloth to wrap your tree trunks. The barrier should be at least a foot deep and 18 inches (45.7 cm) high for warmer climates. For colder climates, make sure the barrier is as tall as your highest snowfall. Clear weeds and brush before installing a fence to protect your yard, garden, or lawn.Use the same principles for installing fence as you would for tree screening choosing materials like wire fencing and digging at least a foot deep. The height of your fence should also be at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) for warmer climates and as tall as your highest snowfall for colder ones.Wire fencing can be both time consuming and labour intensive especially if you own a large plot of line. Wire fencing may be impractical with large gardens or yards so consult your local home and garden store to find the most effective solution for your budget and schedule.Voles continue to thrive during the cold of winter using the snow for cover. Clear away at least 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow from your trees along with providing a sufficient barrier to keep the voles at bay.Hardware cloth can be purchased at your local hardware store.

Combine baking soda and apple cider vinegar in the flask.,
Add boiling water to the solution.,
Shake the flask.,
Dispose of the solution and reapply it as necessary.",How to Clean a Vacuum Flask2," Rinse your flask to remove any loose foreign matter already inside it. Pour out the rinse water and add 1 or 2 tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of baking soda to the flask. Combine a moderate amount of vinegar or hydrogen peroxide with the soda.

Most normal sized flasks will only need about an inch (2½ cm) of vinegar in the bottom of the flask to be effectively cleaned.
Distilled white vinegar can be used in place of apple cider vinegar. However, apple cider vinegar is more acidic, making it more suitable as a cleaner.The reaction between the vinegar and the baking soda should cause fizzing and bubbling. This is completely natural. Wait until this reaction has stopped before going further., Check your vacuum flask user instructions before doing so. Some flasks may only be intended for cool substances and could be damaged by boiling water. Pour boiling water into the flask until it is half to three-quarter’s full.

To boost the cleaning power of the soda/vinegar solution, let it sit in the flask for a few minutes before giving it a thorough shaking., When the foaming of the soda/vinegar solution has stopped, cap the flask firmly. Shake the flask lightly, then remove the cap to release pressure. Recap the flask, then shake it thoroughly for a minute or so to clean and deodorize it.

Capping the flask too soon could cause pressure to build up from the baking soda/vinegar reaction, which may damage your flask or cause the top to suddenly pop free., Remove the cap from the flask and inspect its inside. If the flask is still dirty or musty, repeat this process. Leave the uncapped flask out overnight to air dry. Flasks should be stored uncapped when completely dry."
"
Add water, uncooked rice, and a mild detergent to the flask.,
Shake the flask thoroughly.,
Empty the flask and rinse it.",How to Clean a Vacuum Flask3," Flush the flask with clean water. Dump the water down the drain and refill it with a moderate amount of clean water. Insert a small amount (roughly a handful) of uncooked rice to the water. Add a few drops of a mild detergent, like dish soap.In place of uncooked rice, you can substitute crushed eggshells. Boil an egg to clean the shells. Peel the egg and crush the shells with your clean hands. Add these to the flask in the same fashion and amount as uncooked rice., Cap the flask firmly to prevent leaking. Use a variety of motions while shaking the flask: swirl the solution back and forth, tip the bottle upside down and rightside up. Using firm motions will clean the inside best., Dump the cleaning solution outside or down a drain. Rinse the flask thoroughly to remove any remaining rice (or eggshells) and soap. Inspect the flask for remaining dirtiness. If it is still dirty, repeat this process.

When clean, air dry the flask for about eight hours or overnight, then store the flask uncapped. This will prevent your flask from developing an unpleasant odor."

Brighten discolored flasks with Oxiclean.,
Remove buildup with denture tablets.,
Use a descaling agent to clean the flask.",How to Clean a Vacuum Flask4," Rinse the flask as you would for a normal cleaning, then add roughly a half tsp (5 ml) of Oxiclean to the flask. Pour hot water into the flask until it’s nearly full. After a short while, empty the flask and rinse it thoroughly. Air dry the flask and store it as you would normally.

For the best results, keep the solution in the flask for at least eight hours or let it sit in the flask overnight.
This technique is also especially useful for removing difficult stains and stubborn odors from flasks.
Take care to completely remove the Oxiclean from the flask. Remaining cleaner may cause stomach irritation, sickness, or a bad taste., Check the size of your thermos. For every 2 cups (473 ml) your flask can hold, use a single denture tablet. Put your flask in a sink and fill it with hot water. Let it sit capless for several hours. Dump out the cleaner afterwards and thoroughly rinse the flask.

Denture tablets are formulated to cleanse ingrained stains, making them useful for flask cleaning.
Denture tablets will likely fizz and foam quite a bit. To prevent overflowing solution from making a mess, you clean flasks with this technique over a sink or outside.
Flasks with stubborn buildup may require a little scrubbing action. In the same fashion described for general flask washing, scrub the inside of the flask with a toothbrush, bottle brush, or washcloth., Common descaling cleaners include CLR, Mineral Magic, and Renegite. Apply these to your flask according to the cleaner’s label directions. Rinse the flask several times after cleaning to ensure no cleaner remains.Be careful when using harsh cleaners on your flask. In some cases, these may cause damage to your flask.
Harsh cleaners can be harmful when ingested. To prevent indigestion, sickness, or a bad taste in your flask, be sure to rinse the flask well.

Pick Japanese beetle adults from your plants.,
Choose your plants carefully.,
Cover your plants with a floating row cover.,
Keep your plants healthy.,
Avoid Japanese beetle traps.",How to Kill Japanese Beetles2," Japanese beetles can be easily removed from plants with your hands. After you remove the pest from the plant, drop it into a bucket of soapy water.


Don't squish the beetle to kill it. Beetles attract more beetles through pheromones, which are so powerful they can attract beetles from a few thousand feet.If you squish a Japanese beetle, you run the risk of releasing the female beetle sex pheromone.
This should be done early in the morning. Lay out a drop cloth and shake your plants, then dump the beetles on the cloth into soapy water.

, Japanese beetles are attracted to certain plant species, so when you plan your garden, avoid plants that they will migrate towards. Carefully consult a list of susceptible plants, like this one from the Farmer's Almanac and this one from the Department of Agriculture.

, These covers allow sunlight, air, and water in, but keep beetles out. Make sure to keep the edges of the covers flush with the ground so no beetles can get through. If you already have a grub problem, avoid this method because it could potentially trap beetles inside with your plants.


You can buy floating row covers online or at garden centers.

, Japanese beetles are attracted to overripe and rotting plants.To avoid luring in beetles, harvest your plants regularly and try to keep them healthy.

, These traps use pheromones and scented lures to attract beetles. Most research has found that traps attract more beetles to a yard than it actually traps.This means you are unnecessarily attracting beetles to your yard, resulting in a larger problem. Only use this method if you have a large yard and can place the trap a significant distance away from your garden.

Set a trap.,
Set a trap for live capture.,
Choose the right poison.",How to Kill Voles2," Make sure that it is legal to exterminate or relocate voles as it is prohibited in some states. Set your traps when voles are at their peak reproduction. Choose from a variety of lethal traps depending on your budget. Set your trap so that they are perpendicular to the runways of the vole or near the entrances of tunnels. Check your traps daily and remove dead and captured voles.Mouse snap traps are the cheapest traps that you can employ.
Set your traps in late fall or early spring when voles are at their peak reproduction.
Employ either one-time traps or reusable ones if you’re comfortable dealing the the dead mole carcass. Don’t leave dead pests as other voles or pests may feed on them. They may also attract more dangerous animals.Protect children and pets from your traps by covering your traps in a box. This will also help disguise your trap from the voles. If you do not see any activity for a few days switch locations of your traps to other tunnels or runways.Use apple bits, oatmeal, or peanut butter as effective bait to lure the voles to your traps., If it is illegal to kill voles in your location you can remove them using humane traps. The Havahart or the SNG model of the Sherman traps will capture your voles alive. Remember that you need to relocate the animals once caught with these traps so choose a location away from other homes, and at least a minimum of half a mile away from you own.Humane traps are difficult to use if you have a large population of voles as the cost and labour will rise. You will need a minimum of 12 - 50 traps depending on how large your garden., Note that while poison may be the most effective, it may also be the most dangerous to your own health. Poison can harm children, pets, and even be washed into your water supply. Use poison in the early fall or late winter because the voles with be less finicky with their diet with a scarcity of food. Always obey the safety precautions after you have read the label.The safest and most effective poison baits are Warfarin-based like Rodex, Kaput Mouse Blocks, or D-Con, which can be purchased at your local hardware store. Warfarin acts slowly as it prevents blood from clotting. As such, voles will feel its full effect after about 5 days so rotate your traps every week or set 2 traps every few days.Follow the safety precautions so that the poison doesn’t spread to other animals. Utilize bait containers or place the trap directly at the opening of a vole tunnel. You may also create an open-ended box for your traps.Always handle voles -- dead or alive -- with gloves. They may carry disease organisms associated with the plague and tularemia."
"
Use Ultrasonic pest repellers.,
Set snap traps/live traps.,
Poison voles with special traps.,
Allow your cat to hunt voles.",How to Kill Voles3," Research reviews of specific brands before purchasing ultrasonic repellents. These repellents emit sound at a high-frequency to keep voles and other household pests at bay. Simply plug in this device into a power outlet. You can purchase ultrasonic pest repellers at your local hardware store., Find vole droppings to give you a sense of where the voles have created their runways. Place your traps perpendicular to these runways or at the openings from which the voles enter into your house. Be sure to protect children and pets from these traps. Use live traps if your state prohibits killing voles.Be sure to immediately dispose of both live and dead voles from any traps. Rotate the position and type of trap every few days as voles can be very savvy. Use apple bits, oatmeal, or peanut butter to lure the voles into the traps., Poison is not recommended for homes with pets and small children. Always read the label and obey all the safety recommendations. You may purchase poison traps at your local hardware store. Use apple bits, oatmeal, or peanut butter to disguise the poison.You may get a professional to handle your poison traps but be sure that he is certified and within your budget., Allowing your cat to roam your front yard is mother nature’s best solution. Cats naturally hunt rodents and are effective but may bring you back both dead and alive voles."

The inside of the fireplace should be cleaned anytime ¼’’ or more of soot buildup occurs. For some, this could mean cleaning once a year. The fireplace may need to be cleaned a few times a year if it is used often., Make sure to surround the area around the fireplace with a tarp. You should do this to protect the hearth and floor from the chemicals used in cleaning. You can buy a tarp, or use cheap shower curtains from the dollar store. Seal the tarp down with duct tape., Lay towels or blankets in the area around the tarp. This will catch any dripping or running from the cleaning solution. Only use only towels or blankets that you wouldn’t mind getting stained., Use a broom and dustpan to sweep up what ash and dust you can. Sweep around the hearth and use a smaller brush to dust the fireplace. Then, spray the fireplace with water. This makes it more susceptible to cleaning solutions., Always wear eye protection and rubber gloves when using chemicals. You can choose not to if using a milder solution, but you definitely should when using bleach, strong cleaners, or trisodium phosphate. You should also open a window to bring fresh air in while you’re cleaning., Wash the fireplace down with an all purpose cleaner. Some all purpose cleaners are Mr. Clean Multi-Surface Cleaner and Goo Gone All Purpose Cleaner. Spray on the cleaner and use a sponge to scrub off the buildup., After doing an initial scrubbing, switch to a mild soap. Mix the mild soap with water. Continue to scrub at the stone., Switch back to the all purpose cleaner after you’ve scrubbed for with the mild soap. Scrub for a while and then switch back to the mild soap if necessary. Continue switching back and forth until you are satisfied with the outcome. Allow a few minutes for the stone to dry., Use ½ or 1 cup of the trisodium phosphate (TSP). Put the TSP into a gallon of warm water. This is a very strong chemical so be sure that you have all of your protection on when handing the TSP., Dip a scrub brush into the mixture. Begin to scrub the fireplace. You may have to do some tough scrubbing to remove all the buildup. Make sure to get into the hard-to-reach places and nooks and crannies., If the tough spots aren’t coming off, then you can make a paste out of a small amount of water and TSP.

Locate the insect.,
Find an object to exterminate the pest.,
Hit the insect.,
Clean up insect remains.",How to Kill Household Bugs1," Some bugs stay out in the open and are easy to find. Others, like cockroaches, are nocturnal and prefer dark and enclosed areas. If you know what type of bug you are trying to eliminate, research it to find out where it may be living in your house. A good place to start your search is in the kitchen, as many bugs are attracted to the smell of food. Because bugs are attracted to the smell of food, do your best to keep food out of any living areas for extended periods of time., Once you have found the bug, you need a tool with which to hit it and kill it. For most bugs, a newspaper, a piece of cardboard, a paper-back book or a regular fly swatter are good tools to use. Roll it up or position it in your hand so it is comfortable. Raise it about a foot above the insect. Alternatively, if the insect is on the ground you can stamp on it with your foot. Make sure that you are wearing shoes, preferably with a solid sole.

, Approach the insect and use the newspaper or fly swatter to hit the insect directly and with force. If using your foot, target the insect and stamp on it with the middle part of your shoe. It is important to move quickly and not to hesitate. Many insects like flies are extremely aware of their surroundings, and when they notice a threat they move immediately. Therefore, it's very important to do it quickly!

, You may want to clean up the insect remains after you are done. Using something disposable like a napkin or paper towel to clean up the insect is a great way of getting rid of it for good! After disposing of the insect, wipe down the surface you picked it up from using an all-purpose cleaner or a product like Clorox to ensure a complete clean.

Use a commercial spray.,
Use essential oils to prevent and deter insects.,
Use a natural household pesticide.,
Use boric acid powder.,
Use diatomaceous earth.",How to Kill Household Bugs2," Another effective way of killing a bug on the spot is to use an insect spray. Insect sprays such as Raid target multiple types of bugs and are effective in killing pests. These sprays can be found in major supermarkets and drugstores. Sprays can be used to target the bug directly, or can be sprayed near cracks, around windows and doors, or other points of entry through which bugs have gotten into your house. To use the spray, hold the bottle about a foot and a half from the bug and spray until the bug is weakened or killed.
When killing hardy bugs such as cockroaches, sometimes the spray alone is not enough. After spraying, the most effective way of killing the bug is to hit it with a heavy, flat object like a book to ensure that you have finished the job.

, Although commercial sprays are highly effective, many prefer to use natural sprays which are healthier for humans, especially if you are spraying a large area. Insects such as roaches, termites and ants among others are repelled by strong scents and essential oils.


Tea tree oil, lavender oil and peppermint oil are just a few oils that have been shown to repel and even kill insects.
To make a spray out of these oils, add 6-10 drops of essential oil in a small spray bottle along with two ounces of water and two ounces of white vinegar. Combine and spray areas such as your kitchen or around your windows to target bugs and insects., Natural pesticides are a powerful and safe way of killing insects. Look in the store for a natural pesticide made with orange oil.


To make an orange oil pesticide at home, mix about 5% orange oil with 95% water or 10% orange oil with 90% water (not orange cleaner) in a small spray bottle.
Spray the orange oil pesticide directly on the bug or around the area that the bugs are living. Orange oil pesticides are extremely effective for not only killing solitary bugs, but for killing colonies of insects. , Boric acid is another natural ingredient that is relatively safe for humans but toxic for bugs. It can be found at major pharmacies and home-improvement stores. To use boric acid powder, sprinkle the powder around the refrigerator, stove, or any other places where bugs congregate. Bugs will walk through the powder which they pick up on their legs or bodies. Later, when bugs are grooming or cleaning they ingest the boric acid powder, which kills them., Another organic earth product is food grade diatomaceous earth (uncalcinated - i.e., not heat-treated), a powdered form of an absorbent abrasive that kills insects through dehydration. Sprinkle this substance around the kitchen and other problem areas in your house. "

These allow you to pierce the exoskeleton, then grasp the scorpion and dispose of it. If this tool isn't available in your area, a pair of scissors with long blades, a long knife, or another long, sharp object will work.

, Scorpions aren't typically very fast, but act quickly to make sure you're able to kill the scorpion before it gets away. If necessary, pierce the scorpion again until you're sure it is no longer alive.


You can also use a blunt object, like a heavy book, shoe, or sledgehammer, to crush the scorpion instead of piercing it. However, some scorpions have the ability to flatten themselves as thin as a coin, so just hitting the scorpion with your hard striking surface may not be enough to kill it. You'll need to twist your shoe, rock or other hard object will ensure that the scorpion is crushed and killed. When the scorpion has stopped moving or when its body is in several pieces, it is likely dead.


, If scorpions are becoming a problem in your household, you can get rid of them by methodically killing them at night, when they're active. Get a black lightbulb from the hardware store and place it in a flashlight. Shine the light on walls, in corners, along baseboards, and in other areas where scorpions tend to spend time. Their exoskeletons will glow in the black light.


Don't forget to check outside walls on your property, too. Scorpions can also be found in outdoor rock piles and other sources of shelter.

, If the thought of interacting with scorpions makes you want to run and hide, consider calling a professional to help you out. In some areas you can hire a professional to come to your house and hunt scorpions for you.


Some pest control agencies might suggest using a pesticide application instead of killing the scorpions by hand. It might be worth a try, but many people have found pesticides to be ineffective in getting rid of scorpions.


, Cats are predators of scorpions, and most will be happy to hunt, kill and eat them so you don't have to worry about getting rid of them yourself. If you don't already have a cat, consider adopting one.

, Chickens also enjoy eating scorpions. They keep other pests at bay, too, including insects scorpions eat, making them doubly effective at reducing the scorpion population.

, This natural substance is made from ground up fossils. It's a fine white powder that can be sprinkled in doorways, cracks and crevices both indoors and outdoors. It's completely safe for humans and pets to be around, but the tiny shards of fossil effectively pierce scorpions' exoskeletons when they happen to scuttle over the powder. Diatomaceous earth also kills spiders, roaches and other insects.

, The same traps that can be used to get rid of mice or roaches work for scorpions, too. Set them up in dark corners and near sources of water. If you catch a scorpion, throw the trap away and set out another one in the same area, since it's likely a spot that more scorpions will be attracted to.

, Scorpions like to live in dark places that provide shelter. Check both inside and outside for items that might be acting as convenient hiding places for scorpions.


Make sure your boxes are sealed and stored off the ground on shelves.
Get rid of clutter. Keep your clothes and shoes well organized and off the floor, if possible.
Remove wood and rock piles from your yard.

, Scorpions feed on insects, so if you have other pest problems in your house, it'll be hard to control the scorpion population. Keeping the house clean, sprinkling boric acid or diatomaceous earth along baseboards, and using insecticide are all ways you can eliminate pests.

, Scorpions are able to flatten their bodies to fit through very small holes and cracks. Examine your home's foundation for spots that might be serving as entry points. Fill them with caulk. Check your doors, window frames, vents, chimney, and other spots for areas where scorpions can get in, and make sure they're properly sealed.

, Scorpions are attracted to wet spots. Make sure none of your pipes are leaking, and install a ventilator in your bathroom so it dries quickly after use. Don't leave wet towels on the floor."

Look for signs of mole activity in the spring and fall.,
Check your yard for telltale molehills.,
Choose a trap location by checking for active tunnels.Locate the main active runways in the ground by caving them in and waiting for the mole's response.,
Set a trap.,
Check the trap.,
Remove the mole from the trap.,
Dispose of the mole.,
Set the trap again.",How to Kill a Mole1," These are the seasons during which moles are most active and dig close to the surface. They tend to burrow deeper underground in the winter, making them harder to catch in the colder months. Moles give birth late in the spring, so trapping them before the beginning of summer will help to control the mole population. Plan to set your mole traps during spring or fall for best results.;
, You probably already know what to look for: lumpy, bare spots in your yard that look like tiny dirt volcanoes. You might see one or two, or perhaps your hard is riddled with molehills. No matter how many hills you see in your yard, you probably don't have more than one or two moles about. They are loners who prefer to dig by themselves; they don't travel in packs or live in communities., During the afternoon, crush the molehills with your foot. If the hill is active, it will reappear the next morning. A main runway will be straight, and will connect mounds to each other. Main runways usually run along constructed borders, such as walkways or fences.

, You'll need to buy a trap designed specifically for moles. There are two types of traps to choose from: a harpoon trap and a scissors trap. In either case, the mole will run inside and immediately be killed.


Set a harpoon trap by making a well over an active tunnel. Push your hand down gently over the tunnel so that the tunnel collapses by 50%. Align the spikes of the trap over the tunnel. Press the trap into the ground. The trigger pan of the trap should rest just on top of the depression in the tunnel. Set the trap by following the instructions that come with the trap, then leave it.
Set a scissors trap by first probing near molehills for deep tunnels with a long screwdriver or steel rod. You will hit a tunnel when your probe slides quickly down an inch or two. Dig a hole the same size as the trap where the probe indicated the presence of a tunnel. Insert a packed lump of soil into the tunnel, set the trap according to instructions, and lower the trap into the hole. Ensure that both pairs of jaws are inside of the tunnel, one pair on each side of the lump of soil. Release the safety catch and fill in the hole.

, Once you've set your trap, you'll need to check it every day to see if you have caught a mole. If you do not find a mole in 4 to 5 days, you might have set the trap in a tunnel that is no longer in use. You'll need to move the trap to a different location.


Continue checking the trap and moving it if necessary until you've caught a mole.
If you're having trouble finding a tunnel that's in use, make sure you're setting your traps near freshly raised molehills.

, Once the animal is trapped, follow the instructions for mole removal that come with your trap. Be sure to wear plastic gloves to remove the mole.

, Use a shovel to place the mole inside a plastic bag. Close the bag tightly and put the bag into an outside garbage container. Follow local laws for disposal of dead animals.

, Moles from other yards will move into your yard's tunnels once you've trapped your yard's mole. You'll need the set the trap again and check it every few days, disposing of trapped moles as you find them. Eventually the tunnels will get old and new moles will stop moving in."

Use a sticky trap.,
Use a vinegar trap.,
Use a more specific trap.",How to Kill Household Bugs3," A sticky trap, also known as a glue trap, is a great way of eliminating insects. Sticky trap typically contain an odor that attracts insects, who get stuck to their surface and die. Install the sticky trap in the kitchen or where you have seen the bugs. Leave the trap for a few days and check to see if any bugs have stuck. , A vinegar trap is especially useful for fruit flies. To create a vinegar trap, pour some white or apple cider vinegar into a bottle (even a small amount will do). With the cap of the bottle removed, stretch plastic wrap across the top the bottle and secure it with a rubber band or hair tie. Poke holes through the plastic wrap using a toothpick or similar item. The smell of vinegar attracts flies, who enter through the holes. The flies then either drown in the vinegar or are unable to get back out of the bottle. , Stores like Home Depot and Walmart carry a wide selection of traps, made to target all kinds of insects from hornets to stinkbugs. If you have a bug you can't get rid of, make a trip and select a trap that is made especially to attract and kill the pests in your home.

Target the problem area.,
Clean your house and belongings.,
Use a bug bomb.",How to Kill Household Bugs4," Sometimes, a bug problem can be more than just a few bugs; insects can quite literally take over an article of furniture or an area in your house. In these cases, it is most effective to tackle this specific area, which is where bugs and their larvae are living.


Fleas infestations often occur in carpeting. If there is a flea problem in your house, vacuum the carpet multiple times, disposing of the vacuum bag each time outside of the house. Bed bug infestations occur mostly, as the name suggests, in mattresses. To kill bedbugs in your bed, purchase a mattress cover made specifically for bed bugs. You can find such covers at Walmart and Target. Even though these covers are also intended for prevention of bedbugs, they work by isolating the bedbugs which will eventually kill them. There are several types of insects that target house plants and can cause an infestation. There are many preventative measures to stop this from happening in the first place, such as using sterile soil as opposed to garden soil and immediately removing dead leaves and stems. If the infestation has already happened, the best method of elimination may depend on what kind of insect is afflicting it. Identify the insect with a magnifying glass and do your research. Many insects are killed with insecticidal sprays so if in doubt purchase and use an insecticidal spray to spray your plant. , After you have targeted the area of infestation, it is important to clean the surrounding area as well as anything that may have come into contact with it. Although it is likely that you have killed most of the infestation, it is likely that a few insects have spread to surrounding areas and could cause another wave of infestation.


Vacuum the area around which you've already cleaned. This includes the carpet as well as any cushions or soft objects. After vacuuming, make sure to immediately dispose of the vacuum bag outside of the house, as bugs may be present inside.
Wash and dry clothing. This is an essential step, as many times insects like bed bugs spread and live in your clothing. To kill bedbugs, do a wash of all of your clothes, making sure to dry every item for at least 30 minutes on high heat. Wash your pets. Pets are often the carrier of bugs, especially fleas. Combing your pet with a flea comb as well as washing and drying your pet's bedding can eliminate pests. , A bug bomb, also known as a total release fogger, works by releasing a cloud of pesticide into a single area. This type of treatment should only be a last resort, because bug bombs can pose health risks to humans as well as being toxic to insects. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label, and to only use a bug bomb in an area with adequate ventilation."

Water your yard less.,
Replace your lawn with succulents or low-water plants.Who says your yard has to be filled with grass?,
Flatten your lawn with your feet or a roller.,
Don't buy into old wives' tales about getting rid of moles.,
Consider letting the mole be.",How to Kill a Mole2," Moles are water creatures, and they particularly love to move into lawns that are well-watered. Damp lawns have more worms, which moles eat, and wet soil is easier for the moles to move through. If you have your sprinkler on day in and day out, you're creating the ideal habitat for moles. Try watering it once a week to make it less hospitable for the furry creatures.

, Grass needs to be watered consistently, and earthworms love burrowing beneath it, so grassy lawns typically draw a lot of moles. If you replace your grass with cacti, moss, or another low-water groundcover, you'll save on water bills and make your yard less appealing to moles.


Choose plants native to your area that don't require a lot of watering.You can also plant trees and surround them with gravel, dirt, or appropriate groundcover.

, This is a time-consuming method for getting rid of moles, but many say it really works. Every day, go outside and tamp down the hills with your feet. You can also use a lawn roller to do the same job. Moles will push the hills back up every time you do this for the first few weeks. Eventually, though, you'll tire them out and they'll start digging their tunnels deeper and stop pushing up your grass.

, Poisons, human hair, fumigation, and sound wave machines have not been proven to effectively get rid of moles.Don't waste the time and money required to try to implement these methods, among the many others that frustrated gardeners have attempted.

, Moles aerate yards and eat a lot of insects, making your yard healthier in the long run. If you can stand looking at the tiny volcanoes erupting across your lawn, consider coexisting instead of trying to kill the mole. Moles only live for about 3 years, so eventually the problem will take care of itself."

Lower the humidity.,
Remove waterlogged fungi.,
Repair sources of water leaks.,
Control the amount of water your plants receive.,
Re-pot your plants.,
Remove possible outdoor breeding sites.",How to Kill Collembola1," Collembola are drawn to moisture. If you can improve the air circulation in an infested indoor space, the humidity of that space will drop, and the Collembola living there will move away or die off.Open windows and doors inside the home to permit as much natural ventilation as possible.
Set up fans in problem areas, like kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, to create artificial sources of air movement.
You can also keep conditions drier in a large space by running an air conditioner or a dehumidifier.;
, Mildew and mold grow in areas with a high degree of moisture. Moreover, these fungi will absorb and retain moisture, thereby attracting collembola. You need to remove the fungi and dry out the area to kill the pests living there.Look for fungi in waterlogged areas of the home, like the corners of your basement or your bathtub.
Also look for fungi, moss, and algae on the surface of your soil. Remove this soil completely to dispose of the growth.

, In particular, look for leaky pipes and cracks leading to the outside. These areas could be drawing moisture inside, and drawing Collembola to the spot. Drying out these sources will dry out the springtails thriving on them.Leaky pipes are the most obvious and most common source of excess moisture in the home.
Cracks and gaps in your windows and door frames can be another source. Weather-proof your doors and windows as needed to fill in these spaces. Apply caulk to small cracks and crevices as needed.
If you have wooden windowsills, they may have undergone water damage due to leaky cracks. Change or treat the damaged wood. Then, prevent further problem by applying a waterproof finish to the wood.

, This might be difficult to do with outdoor plants, but if these pests are drawn to your indoor plants, you can usually kill them out by letting the soil of the plant dry out completely before providing more water.It is especially important to let your plants dry out if you are bringing outdoor plants inside.
If you have Collembola outside, they may already be in your potted plants, regardless of whether or not you see them.
Letting the soil dry out for a few days will kill the springtails living in the soil and reduce the risk of bringing them inside. Though soil springtails will stay within the pot.

, In the very unlikely scenario when a potted plant is overrun by Collembola, (even though they won't harm the plant), the simplest thing to do might be to remove it from its current waterlogged container and put it into another container with well-draining soil and better drainage holes. When re-potting a plant overrun by Collembola, or more likely, mites, gently shake off as much of the soil as possible after removing the plant from its old container. Use as much fresh soil as possible. If you drag too much of the old soil into the new pot, the pests may remain.
Consider adding gravel or a similar material to the bottom of the new pot to improve soil drainage. The new container should also have more drainage holes in its bottom than the old container has.

, You can cut the problem off at the source by removing as much decayed organic material from your yard as possible. Collembola like to breed in those areas, so removing them will kills off the young animals already living there and prevent new ones from developing. Alternatively, you could leave the organic material where it is as Collembola are beneficial to soil fertility. When Collembola have made their way inside your home, which will only be the Siara  and Hypogastrura genera, focus on clearing away breeding grounds near the perimeter of your house.
Piles of decaying leaves, mulch, and grass clippings can attract springtails, which is great for your garden and its biodiversity. Mulch, especially, should only be 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep to avoid attracting Collembola.

Place cricket traps.,
Use a beer can to catch the cricket.,
Make a molasses trap.",How to Kill a Cricket that's Loose in Your House1," Purchase a few sticky traps (typically meant for rats or mice) and place them around your home wherever you believe there might be crickets. The crickets will walk over the trap and get stuck.Placing a bit of cornmeal in the center of each trap will help attract the crickets to the traps.;
, Take a can of beer and empty the contents, leaving behind just a few drops. Leave the beer can lying on its side in the area where the crickets are. The crickets will be attracted to the beer and will crawl in the beer to get to the drops left inside, and get stuck inside.If you like to fish, you can take the crickets you’ve caught and use them as fish bait. Alternatively, you can cut the can open outside and release the crickets if you want to.

, This method will allow you to catch crickets without purchasing commercial sticky traps. Take a clean glass jar and place a generous spoonful inside the jar. Add a bit of water to make the molasses just a bit more runny. Place the open jar in the area where you have heard/seen crickets. The crickets will be attracted to the molasses, and will jump into the jar to get to it.The stickiness of the molasses will make it difficult for the crickets to escape.
Be sure to clean out the jar regularly.

Dig out the mushroom from its base.,
Remove the immediate soil.,
Place the bag out for trash collection.,
Spray the area with an environmentally approved fungal killer.",How to Kill a Stinkhorn Fungus1," Don’t simply clip off the above-ground portion of the mushroom; you’ll need to dig beneath it until you’ve scooped out the mushroom’s egg-shaped base. Also dig under any nearby round white egg-shaped growths, as these are going to be new stinkhorns soon.Secure the foul smelling removed material in a plastic bag.


If you don’t want to get your hands dirty (and smelly) from the stinkhorn, put on a pair of cheap latex disposable gloves. Put these in an airtight plastic bag and throw them away immediately after you finish killing the mushrooms.;
, There may be spores or other undeveloped mushrooms in the soil immediately surrounding the mushroom you’ve removed, so dig up the top layer of soil in about a 6-inch radius around the mushroom you’ve removed. If the fungus grew in a medium other than soil—such as tree bark, mulch, or other loose decaying plant material—remove this using the shovel as well.Place the excavated soil (or other material) in the plastic bag along with the stinkhorn fungus. Then, seal the bag firmly shut.

, Do not place the discarded fungal matter with yard waste, since, if the bag were to rupture or open, spores could escape and create new mushrooms.


After these steps, if mushrooms begin to reoccur, you may need to apply a chemical agent.

, This will make sure that the mushroom and surrounding spores are truly dead. After applying the fungal killer spray as directed on the packaging, allow the affected area to receive sunlight and dry out. The spray should also keep recurrence to a minimum.


You should be able to find a safe, nontoxic fungal killer spray at your local plant nursery or gardening center.

Apply an indoor insecticide.,
Apply an outdoor insecticide, though this is unnecessary and not advised.,
Wash them away with soapy water.,
Hire a professional.",How to Kill Collembola2," Look for an aerosol spray formulated for indoor use and apply it to areas where you have seen Collembola and areas you suspect the Collembola might be passing through.Most indoor insecticides used against Collembola contain bifenthrin, carbaryl, or diazinon.
Some insecticides may also contain chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, or prallethrin.

, If the majority of the concentration is outside, purchase a pesticide specifically formulated for outdoor use and apply it to mulch, soil, or other areas housing the Collembola.Most outdoor insecticides used against Collembola contain bifenthrin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, or diazinon. Some may also contain fluvalinate, malathion, prallethrin, or pyrethrins.
You can apply outdoor pesticides as barrier treatments so that the animals will die as they try to enter your house, or you can apply the pesticide as a broadcast treatment to kill the Collembola living in a known source of infestation.
Apply outdoor pesticides in the afternoon and early evenings, when Collembola are the most active.

, For a more natural pesticide, simply mix some liquid soap and water in a spray bottle and get to work. Spray any area where you spot collembola crawling around, as well as any area where you've spotted them in the past. Bear in mind- all the Collembola you will see are harmless and only annoying as a snow flea, when they can appear in their millions. Collembola are so small that you will not have much luck sweeping them away with a broom. Spraying water at these pests is the only way to physically remove them.
If you still want to remove and kill these beautiful animals, you will need to mix in about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of dish soap for every 2 cups (500 ml) of water. The soap coats the animals, causing them to suffocate.

, While it is rare, major collembola infestations may require the help of a professional exterminator who can legally handle stronger chemicals.Be aware that even a professional pest control service won't be able to get rid of your collembola infestation quickly. You'll likely see continue to see signs of the springtails emerging from underground, below concrete slabs, beneath foundations, etc.
Complete eradication may require 2-3 treatments.

Smash the cricket.,
Use an insect spray.,
Vacuum the cricket up.,
Spray the cricket with pepper spray.,
Place a jar over the cricket.",How to Kill a Cricket that's Loose in Your House2," This is the most straightforward way to kill a cricket. If you see a cricket that has snuck into your home, and you don’t want to catch it, then simply use something like a shoe or a broom and smash the cricket.


Try to be as humane as possible when killing the cricket. Give it a few hard smacks so that you can be sure the cricket is dead.

, There are many commercial insecticides readily available. If you have a problem with insects in your home, purchasing a can that you can use to kill a cricket (or any bug that finds its way in) is a good idea.


Be careful when using a bug spray. After you’ve killed the cricket, dispose of the cricket by using a large wad of toilet paper. Flush the dead cricket down the toilet or throw it in a closed trash can. Clean the area where you’ve sprayed the bug spray with a disinfectant, and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.

, If you’ve just got one cricket in your house, all you have to do is suck the cricket up with the nozzle. If you are worried that you may have a cricket infestation, vacuum your home thoroughly, and use the nozzle attachment to vacuum underneath the baseboards all around your home. Hopefully, this will suck up any eggs or crickets that might be hiding.If you have a bagless vacuum cleaner, be sure to empty the contents of the container in a trash can outside your home. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a bag, replace the bag immediately after you finish. Throw away the used bag in a trash can outdoors and away from your home.

, If you have some pepper spray on hand, then you can quickly kill the cricket by using some of it on the cricket. Pepper spray is deadly to crickets.Be careful when using pepper spray. It will be painful for you if you get it near your face. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after using the spray.

, If you’ve only got one cricket in your home, you can catch it easily with a jar. When you find the cricket, place a glass jar quickly over the top of the cricket so that it is trapped inside. Take a thin (but strong) piece of cardboard (a postcard works well, for example) and slide it underneath the opening of the jar. Now you will have a piece of card that you can keep on the top of the jar while you take it outside.


Take the cricket far away from your house. If you just let the cricket out outside your front door, the cricket will probably try to find a way back in.

Get a cat or a dog.,
Make your home less appealing.,
Hire a pest control company.",How to Kill a Cricket that's Loose in Your House3," Cats and dogs are great for taking care of any unwanted insects that might sneak into your home. They are much better at finding insects than humans, so if there is a cricket hiding in your home, let your pet do the hard work.Keep in mind that keeping a pet is a big commitment. You shouldn’t get a cat or dog for the sole purpose of killing crickets.

, If you have lots of damp areas in your home, identify them, and try to reduce them if possible. Crickets love moisture, so fixing any problems that may lead to excess moisture will be important.Crickets are also attracted to bright lights, so replace any outdoor lights (e.g. porch lights) with yellow bulbs or sodium vapor bulbs that will be less appealing.
Look for any points of entry as well. For example, maybe there is a window that doesn’t seal shut. Check your door frames to make sure that there are no spots that a cricket could get through.

, If you live in an area where insects are a common problem, you can probably find a pest control company that will come and spray your home with an insecticide a few times a year. If you are struggling with a cricket infestation, this may be the easiest way to deal with the problem.


Make sure that any pest control company you hire is licensed in your state.
If you have pets, be sure to let the company know, and ask them if their products are safe for humans, children, and pets.

Mix boiling hot water and bleach.,
Pour the mixture onto the fungus.,
Sprinkle lime over the mushrooms and surrounding soil.",How to Kill a Stinkhorn Fungus2," Begin this process in your kitchen by boiling the water in a large saucepan on your stovetop. Then, in your yard or garage, pour in bleach.Add roughly the same amount of bleach as you did of water (e.g. 4 cups of each) so that they’re mixed at a 1:1 ratio.


When working with bleach, make sure to wear clothes that you don’t mind ruining, since the bleach will remove color from any fabric it splashes onto. Also consider wearing eye protection (such as safety goggles) to avoid the risk of splashing bleach into your eyes.
Be aware that removing mushrooms using bleach or lime will likely harm—and possibly kill—other plants in the area. The chemicals will also damage your soil.

, Do this while the water is still hot; do not wait for the solution to cool down.The combination of boiling hot water and potent bleach should be enough to kill any lingering stinkhorns, and prevent new mushrooms from growing in the soil.


If you choose to first dig up the mushrooms before you apply bleach, simply pour the hot bleach solution over the entire area from which you dug up the stinkhorns.

, If you haven’t had success removing stinkhorn mushrooms, lime will help by making the soil uninhabitable for the fungus. Using a shovel or trowel, spread the lime over the patch of soil that has been producing stinkhorn fungi.Lime is a caustic substance, so be careful when handling it.


You should be able to purchase lime at a local hardware store, plant nursery, or gardening center.
Before applying the lime to the soil, read the instructions printed on the package. You may need to first dampen the soil before laying down lime.

Smell the mushroom.,
Look for moist or mulch-covered terrain.,
Inspect the mushroom.,
Identify other types of stinkhorn fungi.",How to Kill a Stinkhorn Fungus3," If you’re dealing with a stinkhorn, this probably won’t take a lot of effort. stinkhorns are known to be a noxious fungus, and their smell can be likened to that of feces or a dead and decaying animal.Although the stinkhorns may smell offensive, they are not poisonous to humans or pets. Stinkhorn fungi will not harm your pets or any other plants in their vicinity.
Stinkhorns use their unpleasant smell to attract flies. Flies land on the mushroom, pick up spores on their legs and bodies, and distribute these sports wherever they fly. So, if you notice a large number of flies around a specific mushroom, you may be dealing with a stinkhorn.

, If you suspect you’re dealing with a stinkhorn, confirm that the environment it’s growing in correlates with a type stinkhorns prefer. Although stinkhorn mushrooms prefer moist areas and patches of ground covered in mulch, they can pop up in many types of terrains.Like all fungus, stinkhorns can also sprout out of the wood of dead and decaying trees.


Varieties of stinkhorn fungus grow naturally throughout nearly all of North America and into Central America. Some varieties prefer subtropical and tropical regions, including parts of Mexico., The most common type of stinkhorn fungus (‘’Phallus ravenelii’’) has a pale white stalk and a phallic shape. The mushroom typically stands between 10–15 cm (4–6 inches) high, and the cap at its tip ranges in diameter from 1–4 cm (0.4–1.6 inches). The cap itself is slimy and dark brown, with a course texture. The mushroom’s long, cream-colored stem has a spongy texture.At the very tip of a stinkhorn mushroom’s brown cap, there is a white ring-like circle with an opening at the tip.

, There are over 25 types of stinkhorn fungi that live in North America. Most, like ‘’Phallus ravenelii’’, have a thin stalk with a bulbous, slimy head which bears the spores. Colors can vary, and many stinkhorns are pink or reddish in color. Shape and size of the mushrooms can also vary. Most mushrooms range from 2–6 cm (0.8–2.4 inches), although some species grow as tall as 15 cm (6 inches)."

Reduce the areas where rabbits like to hide.,
Secure structures.,
Remove access to any water sources.,
Plant as many rabbit-deterring plants as possible.,
Plant trees that deter rabbits.,
Protect shrubs and trees from damage using hardware cloth.",How to Get Rid of Rabbits1," Because rabbits will hide in accumulations of vegetation, a great way to deter rabbits is to keep your grass mowed short, remove any unnecessary vegetation such as tall grasses, and clean up plant debris regularly. Also, be sure to trim off and discard low-hanging bottom branches on bushes and shrubs, which rabbits may use for cover. Finally, fill in any existing burrows you may find on your property.Tour your property regularly to find potential sites of infestation as well as burrows that need covering.
Check sites where you have taken measures to deter rabbits on a regular basis to maintain control over these areas.;
, Make sure no rabbits are hiding in any holes you may find under sheds, decks, stairs, and other places where rabbits may find shelter. Seal these holes with chicken wire or wood.Use chicken wire mesh or wood board spacing of one inch (2.5 cm) or less to reduce the chances rabbits will gain entry.Check places where you have secured the structure on a regular basis to make sure the repairs are intact.
Pest control services that specialize in small animal removal and control may be able to recommend contractors who may be able to help you secure structures.

, Rabbits may be especially prone to making their habitat on property that is close to a water source. If you have a water source on your property—a stream, creek, pond, etc.—you can build fences around them to encourage rabbits to build their habitat elsewhere.As with sealing holes, be sure that the fence you build is made of a mesh that has one-inch holes or smaller. You should also bury the bottom of the fence at least four to eight inches underground and ensure it is at least two feet high.Be sure to maintain your fence over time. Rabbits may find weak spots or dig up sections along the ground to re-gain entry.

, Few plants will be off-limits to rabbits as food, but some are certainly on the lower end of desirability, and planting these might encourage rabbits to go elsewhere in search of food. These undesirables include annuals such as goatweed, impatiens, and verbena, perennials like echinacea and honeysuckle, and groundcover such as big periwinkle and bougainvillea. Combined with perennials and annuals, shrubs like rhododendrons and camellias can offer an extra deterrent.Consult with a landscape designer on ways to incorporate these plants into your garden in an effective and aesthetically pleasing way.

, Like plants, not all trees that rabbits dislike are always off-limits to them, but there are some that seem to be less preferred. These trees may, in turn, be worth planting as a means to making your landscape less desirable to rabbits. These include alder and birch trees.Visit a tree farm to see if you can purchase young trees that can be planted on your property.

, Rabbits can damage and even kill shrubs and trees by gnawing on the bark around the base. Wrap hardware cloth around the bases of shrubs and trees that are susceptible to damage. Rabbits cannot gnaw through hardware cloth and it will effectively protect shrubs and trees. Some people use this technique with great success.


Hardware cloth despite the name is not a cloth, but rather a galvanized wire screen that comes in rolls and is available from your hardware store.

Call a professional exterminator.",How to Get Rid of Wasps," The simplest, most direct way to kill a wasp is to smack it with a flyswatter. This only works if you are trying to get rid of a small number of wasps, though, and comes with its own pros and cons.


Note that this is a very risky tactic, however. Wasps are quick, and if you have slow reflexes, you are likely to get stung when the wasp flies away and tries to defend itself.;
, If the wasps are low on energy and crawling around your floors, you can get rid of them by sweeping them out of the door with a broom or by sucking them up with a vacuum cleaner.It is advisable to do this as soon as spring arrives, and as soon as wasps start coming out of hibernation. They tend to be slow and sluggish, making it easier to catch them and sweep them away.

, Get rid of them by removing their reason for hanging around. Move flowers to the far side of your yard and hide away food and drink.


Move potted flowers away from your house and avoid using sweet or floral perfumes, shampoos, lotions, or soaps.
Hide all animal food and human food, as well as soda and alcohol. Do not let it linger outside, especially in the heat. The protein and sugar can attract the wasps.

, There are natural insecticides you can buy that make use of peppermint oil, but if you cannot find one or want to save a few bucks, you could try making your own at home by diluting a little peppermint oil with water and applying it as a spray.Mix 2 cups (500 ml) of water with 30 drops of peppermint essential oil in a spray bottle. Spray this solution on wasps and nests.
Consider mixing 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of shampoo or dish soap into the spray bottle, as well. The soap will make sure that the peppermint sticks.

, A combination of hot water and dish soap can kill wasps instantly when sprayed directly on them.


Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of liquid dish soap to 2 cups (500 ml) of water in a spray bottle. Spray directly on wasps and on developing nests.
If you use a hose end sprayer, you can attack the nest more directly and more easily.
The soap clings to the wasps and dehydrates them.

, The exact reason why this household chemical proves effective is not always agreed upon, but many believe that the scent alone is powerful enough to suffocate the wasps.


Spray a generous amount of WD-40 in any areas you have seen wasps frequent, especially if the area seems like a small crevice that wasps would like to build a nest in. You should also use the spray to drench any existing nests you spot.
After an hour or so, you should be able to remove any nests you sprayed directly. The wasps inside should be dead, at least for the most part.
Note that some people recommend burning the nests after spraying them with WD-40, but this is unnecessary and can be extremely risky if you cannot control the flame.

, Hang a commercially-bought lure trap in an area the wasps frequent. Check every few days and replace as needed once the trap begins to fill up.Lure traps contain chemicals, such as hepytl butyrate, that smell pleasing to various wasps. Once wasps wander into the traps, they are unable to climb their way back out.
Place these traps as far away from living quarters as possible to draw the wasps away from you.

, A water trap can be made at home with a bucket or 2-L plastic bottle. Fill the container will water and lure the wasps to the sight with an appetizing smell.Cut the neck off a 2 L plastic bottle. With the cap off, turn the neck upside-down and let it rest inside the bottom portion of the bottle. Hold together with strong tape.
Be sure to bait the trap. You can use sugar water, soda, or pieces of meat and other protein.
Wipe a layer of cooking oil around the edges of the trap so that it becomes too slippery for the wasps to stand on.
Hang the trap using a piece of thick string or rope.
Before emptying the trap, freeze it or pour boiling water into it to kill any remaining living wasps.

, A bait station is an enclosed trap that lures wandering wasps inside, at which point the wasps are killed with a chemical insecticide


Most bait stations nowadays use Esfenvalerate, but this poison is not as potent as poisons contained in older bait stations. As such, its effectiveness is limited.

, Glue traps are minimally effective against wasps since they are generally used against pests without wings, but if there is an area in your house or garage that wasps frequently crawl around, you can place one of these traps there.


Place glue traps near wasp nests and near entryways to the nest. This is especially useful in the early stages of nest development, since the wasp population is smaller at this point and more easily controlled.

, This is effective early in the season.

Establish a drinking station by putting a plant pot in a tray and keeping the tray topped up with water. Place it in a sunny position, and the wasps will learn to drink there.
Buy an insecticide powder containing a pyrethroid such as permethrin (a natural product extracted from chrysanthemums).
Mix the powder to a paste and stir water into it. Fill the water tray and keep it topped up.
The insecticide will break down after a day or two, so keep adding fresh water to attract more wasps, and repeat the whole process every three to five days.

, Chase wasps away at their first appearance by hanging a fake nest around your home or around any area you want wasps to stay away from.


You can buy a product designed to look like a real nest, or you can use a paper lantern or brown paper bag.

, If the season is early and the nest is still small, knocking the nest down time after time after time will discourage the wasps, which will eventually look elsewhere to build. Use a broom, stick, or similar tool


Wasps can be persistent, so it may take persistence on your part before you have success. Expect to knock the nest down several times before the wasps give up.

, One way to destroy a nest and the wasps that live there is to seal it inside of a plastic bag. Tying this bag up tightly can prevent wasps from escaping, thereby suffocating and starving them.


Once the activity at the nest quiets down, quickly put a thick plastic bag over it and tie it off at the top. Tear the nest away from its position and tighten the tie.
The plastic must have an airtight seal. Leave it outside in the sun for several days to ensure that the wasps die off, or freeze the bag for a few days in a deep freezer.

, For a faster kill, you can capture the nest in a cloth bag and dunk it into a large tub of water, drowning the wasps instantly.


When the activity of the nest quiets at night, place a cloth bag over it and quickly tie the top. Yank the nest away from its fixed position and quickly dunk it in a tub or bucket of cold water.
Keep the nest submerged by dropping a weight, large rock, or multiple medium-size rocks on top of it.

, Depending on the insecticide you purchase, it should either be applied directly to any individual wasps you see or to the entire nest.


Insecticides are most effective when used in enclosed spaces with closed windows and doors.
Try a freeze-type insecticide. These products freeze the nest on contact, which can dramatically slow wasps down and limit their ability to attack and defend.
Wasps attack when they sense a threat to themselves or to the nest, however, so you need to work fast and work at a time when the wasps are less active, like at night.
Some insecticide hoses can shoot a stream as far away as 20 feet (6 m).
Spray cracks and crevices early in the season. At the first signs of a problem, you should apply insecticides and repellents to kill the early-comers and discourage others from showing up.

, When dealing when chemical insecticides, professional exterminators might be a safer alternative than DIY tactics, especially if the nest or wasp infestation is inside a structure instead of outside.


If a nest is in the walls of your home, an exterminator might carefully drill a hole in the window frame, floor, or wall near the nest's location. The exterminator can pump insecticides through this hole to reach the nest.
Another advantage of hiring a professional exterminator is that he or she will have access to stronger chemicals, so the wasps might die quicker.

Fence your garden to keep the rabbits out.,
Install automatic, motion-activated sprinklers.,
Use commercially available repellents.,
Use household repellents.",How to Get Rid of Rabbits2," Chicken wire works fine as long as the mesh is 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less. Bury the bottom of the fence 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm) into the ground to prevent rabbits from digging under it. Extend it at least three feet (one meter) above ground. Be sure to install flashing along the bottom of gates to ensure rabbits can't squeeze underneath to gain access to the garden.Fencing and chicken wire can be purchased at hardware stores, usually in a wide variety of styles and colors to compliment the décor of your yard.


Consult a landscape designer to see if they have any suggestions as to fencing that can be effective at protecting your garden as well as aesthetically pleasing.

, Automatic, motion-activated sprinklers condition rabbits to stay out of the area by spraying them with water every time they move into the sensor's range. Some of these sprinklers not only spray a burst of water to deter rabbits, but also emit a sound that is annoying to rabbits. This option is also environmentally friendly and humane because it does not use any chemicals—only water and sound. These sprinkler systems are available in hardware stores and online and they are fairly easy to set up, generally staking into the ground much like a standard sprinkler used for watering your lawn.Many different brands and styles of motion-sensitive sprinklers are available.
Consider the path of the water as you set up the sprinkler so as not to overwater or damage your plants.

, Many different repellents may be available, but no repellent will work on all rabbits, so you may have to try several before finding one that works for you. Remember that some repellents may have to be applied more than once per season.Some repellents include:


Blood or bone meal fertilizer. Blood or bone meal fertilizer repels rabbits because they are natural herbivores, and, as an added bonus, these fertilizers are great for your garden.Chemical repellents. Some chemical repellents like ammonium soaps can help deter rabbits, but they may not be safe for the more delicate plants in the garden, so be sure to read the label. A solution containing the bitter Bitrex can also be sprayed to deter rabbits, but generally only if the garden is made up of flowers because Bitrex will alter the taste of vegetables.

, Cayenne pepper, human hair, dog hair, or manure on the ground near the garden or mixed with fertilizer can help deter rabbits. You can also spray vegetables with a mixture of vinegar and water with a small amount of hot sauce mixed in as well. This mixture sprayed on vegetables make the are unattractive to rabbits and may make the vegetables distasteful as well.


Dried sulfur and onions can also be effective repellents against rabbits."

Hunt the rabbits to keep the population down.,
Use live traps.,
Use a pest control service.",How to Get Rid of Rabbits3," Use a shotgun to hunt rabbits, or, alternatively, a .22 rifle, a pistol, or a bow and arrow.When hunting, be sure to follow licensing and hunting season laws in your area. If you live in a densely populated city, you may not be able to discharge weapons in your yard. Check your local laws to ensure you are able to hunt rabbits on your property. Also, be sure to practice gun safety when hunting. Always keep the barrel of your gun pointed in a safe direction, such as toward the ground, and do not put your finger inside the trigger guard on your gun until you are ready to shoot. Also, treat every weapon as though it were loaded, wear a bright orange vest to keep yourself visible, and always be aware of what is in front of and behind your target.Gun safety courses may be available in your community.
Hunting with an expert may help you with hunting safety and effectiveness at thinning the rabbit population on your property.
You may be able to find people who want to hunt on your property if you do not want to do so yourself. The game is often compensation enough, and some hunters may even pay you for allowing them to hunt on your property.

, Live traps can allow you to capture rabbits and remove them from your property. Traps are available at many stores and online. This is an excellent alternative to shooting rabbits. Bait traps with apples, brussels sprouts, carrots, or lettuce. Monitor the traps regularly and release rabbits as quickly as possible after they are captured. Wear protective gloves when handling traps and releasing the rabbits. Drive the rabbit at least a mile from your property to release to ensure they won't come back.Contact your local animal control officer or parks and recreation department to learn about release laws in your area.

, Find a pest control company in your area that can deal with your rabbit problem. They can help you confirm that rabbits are responsible for any damage you may have found. They can also help implement techniques for repelling rabbits and protecting property, including fencing, traps, tree guards, etc. A pest control service will generally schedule follow-up or maintenance appointments and they will ensure any removal or control techniques are consistent with local wildlife laws.If you have been confounded by rabbits and are ready to use a pest control service, look for pest control services in your area that specialize in small animals like rabbits—not all pest control services are experienced in rabbit control. Ask them over the phone if they have dealt with rabbit infestations before and what measures they took to control the problem.

Remove nuts, berries, and other natural food sources.,
Protect your waste.,
Close off hiding places.,
Install lights in your yard.,
Use chemicals that repel skunks.,
Install motion-activated sprinklers.,
Set a trap.,
Make a garbage can and ramp trap.,
Call Animal Control.",How to Get Rid of Skunks," Skunks are scavengers, so they'll eat anything nutritious they can find. If you have trees that produce nuts, berries, crabapples, or other fruits, clean them up by raking your yard as often as necessary.


Other vegetation, like piles of grass clippings, should also be discarded, since it may contain seeds or other sources of food for skunks.
If you have a garden, harvest ripe fruit and vegetables as soon as you can, to prevent a hungry skunk from feasting on them.
Use a tray under your bird feeder to catch most of the seeds, and clean up stray seeds dropped by birds often.;
, Similarly to raccoons and other stray animals, skunks can survive on garbage alone. It's important to keep your trash cans properly sealed. Sometimes regular garbage cans simply won't do. To defend against scavenging animals, you can buy locking garbage cans at a fairly cheap price at your local home improvement store.


If possible, store your trash bins in a shed or in your garage at night, so their smell doesn't attract skunks.
Use an enclosed compost bin, since skunks like to eat old fruit and vegetable peels, eggshells, and other items that you may be composting.

, Skunks like to make their homes under decks, porches, and in other sheltered areas. Close off spaces that may be appealing to skunks using rocks, fencing, or plywood.


Log piles and piles of lumber or building materials can serve as shelters for skunks. Store the materials in a shed or bin to prevent skunks from moving in.
Large bushes are also good shelters for skunks. If you see skunks hanging out in bushes or low vegetation, you might want to trim back the branches so it's not quite as appealing.

, Skunks are nocturnal, and they shy away from bright lights. If you light your yard at night it will be a lot less appealing to skunks. However, you risk attracting insects that like bright light, such as crickets and moths.









Since the lights will be shining all night long, consider using solar lighting or energy-saving lighting to avoid paying high electrical bills.
You could also install a motion sensor that gets tripped when a skunk or another creature comes close. In this case, the skunk will have to enter your property for the light to work as a deterrent.

, There are a few different chemicals known to be offensive to skunks. If you place them around the edges of your yard and in areas where you suspect skunks like to spend time, the skunks will start avoiding those areas. Chemical repellents have to be reapplied every few days, especially after a heavy rain.









Fox and dog urine deters skunks, since foxes and dogs are skunks' natural predators. If you can figure out how to collect dog urine, that's fine to use. You can also buy products containing fox or dog urine at hardware stores. Spray it around the perimeter of your yard.
Pepper sprays, also sold to repel squirrels and other wild creatures, are effective skunk repellents. Spray them on trees and other areas where you've seen skunks.
Ammonia also deters skunks. Soak old rags in ammonia and place them under your deck or porch to keep skunks from coming in.
Citrus peels have natural repellent qualities. Scatter orange or lemon peels around your property and under your deck or porch.

, These automatically turn on when an animal wanders too close, and are a safe and natural way to keep skunks away from your property. Place them strategically close to areas where you suspect skunks might want to shelter.








, Spring-loaded skunk traps lure the skunk inside with bait, then close the door behind them so they can't escape. The skunk is then carried away from your property and set free in the woods or another open, wild area.


Bait the skunk trap with peanut butter, canned sardines, cat food, or another strong-smelling food. Set it near the skunk's den or its route of access to your property.
Traps designed for raccoons, feral cats and other wild animals also work well for skunks.
When you releasing the skunk in the woods, wear heavy clothes and gloves, and make sure your face is positioned well away from the door where the skunk will exit the trap. Most of the time, skunks leave traps calmly, but you should take precautions just in case you get sprayed.

, Get a 30 gallon (113.6 L) metal garbage can and a long stick of wood.









Just before dark, place the garbage can upright where you want to trap the skunk. Have it against something strong, such as a wall, so that the skunk cannot tip it over. Bait it with cat food.
Get a long, sturdy piece of wood (it must be thick and heavy enough to hold skunk, maybe a 2 x 4). Use it as a ramp to allow the skunk to get from the ground to inside the garbage can.
The skunk will not be able to get out of the garbage can. If handled carefully, it will hopefully not spray.
After the skunk is inside, put lid on the garbage can. Put it in your truck and carry the skunk away to a wooded area. Release by tying (or clamping) a twenty foot or longer cord to the lid handle. This will allow you to take off the lid and letting the skunk make its own way back into nature without danger of getting sprayed.

, If you'd rather leave the skunk handling to an expert, have the animal control center in your region dispatch someone to take care of removal. He or she will have the tools and knowledge to trap and release the skunk.

Inspect the exterior of your home.,
Fix holes in your roof.,
Install vent covers.,
Install a chimney cap.,
Trim or remove tree limbs and branches.,
Set up traps for the animals in your attic.",How to Keep Animals out of Your Attic1," Most animals enter attics through small holes or man-made openings such as vents and chimney pipes. Larger animals will even bite and claw through weak spots in the exterior to create an entrance to the attic. The most effective way to keep animals out of your attic is to walk the perimeter of your home and find and eliminate any vulnerable areas in your home's exterior., Look for any holes in the roofing or between the roof and the siding or brick.Lift up the damaged shingle and the ones surrounding it. Remove the nails that are underneath with a pry bar then slide the damaged shingles out. After patching the hole in the roof, replace the shingles with new ones, hammer the nails back in, and secure everything by covering the nail heads in roof cement.Keep in mind that even small holes can be a potential problem because squirrels can fit through holes 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter, and bats can get through gaps as small as .38 inches (.95 cm).

, Get ½ inch (1.27 cm) or ¼ (0.64 cm) inch hardware cloth from a box or hardware store. Make sure that the hardware cloth is made of wire, not mesh. Securely fasten the cloth over any vents on the roof that may provide access to the attic.Don’t forget to install covers on your soffit vents as well. Your soffit vents are located on the underside part of the roof that hangs over the sides of your home.

, First, inspect the chimney with a flashlight and look for any signs of animal inhabitation. Once you’re sure there are no longer animals inside the chimney, install an animal-proof chimney cap that will allow smoke to escape without giving animals an entrance., If you have trees that extend over your roof, you may want to trim back the branches to restrict access to the roof. Remove larger branches with a pruning saw or chain saw. Make sure that you trim any branches that are within 8 feet of your home to keep squirrels from being able to jump to the roof., There are many ways that you can trap animals, but live catch and release traps are the best because they’re humane and they’re available in a wide range of sizes. Set up the traps with a desirable piece of food and the animals will be drawn to it. If there’s an opening somewhere, doing this will give you an idea about where it is and keep animals from getting into your home until you can find and fix the opening.


Make sure to check your traps frequently to keep any trapped animals from dying of thirst or starvation. Release any animals that you trap in a park or natural environment away from your home."

Remove any food sources.,
Protect your pets.,
Remove decaying organic materials from your yard.,
Buy a guard dog or rooster.,
Recognize a fisher cat’s attack.",How to Keep a Fisher Cat Away1," One of the best approaches to keeping fisher cats at bay is to remove food that will draw them to your property. Fisher cats are predators that will be drawn by food sources if you leave them in your yard.Fisher cats will eat berries and fruit when it’s available, but they also like to eat dead fish. They are carnivores for the most part, though, and feast on rabbits, squirrels, raccoons, mice, reptiles, insects, and dead and decaying animal flesh.
This means you should get rid of rats and mice infestations before fisher cats come running to target them. Seal all garbage cans, and don’t put food out for animals. Don’t leave out cat food, for example.
Although they favor meat, fisher cats might still be attracted to wild bird feeders, seed beneath the feeders, or water sources in your yard.;
, Fisher cats are vicious predators, so don't assume that small pets will be any match for them. Protect them to ensure they are safe. Fisher cats have been known to stalk and kill house pets.Occasionally, fisher cats go after and kill house cats, so if you’re having a fisher cat problem, keep the house cat inside, as well as any small dogs.
Larger dogs may actually keep fisher cats at bay. If you're not sure, it's best to keep your pets inside the home until the fisher cat problem is solved.
There have been accounts of fisher cats attacking human children, but this is rare, as they usually go after very small mammals.

, Fisher cats like to find places to nest. Thus, they might be drawn to your lawn if it has a lot of decaying, organic material around it. Get rid of the organic materials, and they will make a den somewhere else.


That means things like logs, stumps and brush. Getting rid of such items and clearing the lawn will keep the fisher cat more at bay.Trim brushes and trees. Mow the lawn regularly so that they have fewer hiding places. Locate your coop away from woodlands.
If your chicken coop is situated right next to the fisher cats’ natural habitat, they will find it more easily. Woodlands contain many predators that will target chickens, not just fisher cats.

, One way to protect your yard from fisher cats is to have a large guard dog to keep them at bay. Some larger dogs will scare off fisher cats, although make sure to get the right breed because fisher cats prey on smaller pets.A large farm dog will spot many predators, bark, and chase them off. Make sure, though, that you don’t choose a dog that itself might attack the chickens instead of guarding them (terriers and greyhounds).
Good choices for guard dogs for chickens are Old English Sheepdogs, Bernese Mountain Dogs and Great Pyrenees.
Roosters are also aggressive and provide some protection. They will sound alarm calls, and will even sacrifice their own lives for a flock of laying hens. They won’t be a match for a fisher cat, but they do help sound alarm.

, Fisher cats are not pleasant creatures. They are vicious predators. Chicken owners especially need to be very vigilant about fisher cats because chickens are probably the fisher cat's favorite food.


They will often raid chicken coops and are capable of killing many chickens at once. They might try to drag them away. The neck and head will be gone, and the breast might be open too. They might reach through a fence, if they can, to grab a chicken.
There are many predators that can kill chickens. Determine whether you live in an area where fisher cats exist before taking steps to prevent them. The habitat of fisher cats is in North America, especially on the East Coast. You won’t find them on other continents. They usually operate within 10 square mile areas for females and 30 for males.
They are found in the United States as well as in Canada. The males will usually move through their chosen area about once every two weeks. They usually go in a straight line when traveling.

Identify the type of cutworm.,
Check your garden in late afternoon or evening when the worms are active.,
Inspect your garden first thing in the morning.,
Turn over the soil slightly.",How to Identify Cutworm Damage," By looking for specific feeding characteristics of a type of cutworm, you can better identify plant damage.


Look for black cutworm damage. The largest black cutworms, 1 1/4 inch (32 mm) in length, will cut the stems at the base of plants. The smallest (less than 1/2 inch or 12 mm in length) will feed on the leaves of garden plants. If these worms cut the plants, they will do so above ground if the soil is dry and below the ground if the soil is moist or saturated. Black cutworms are black with sandpaper-like skin.
Identify dingy cutworm damage. Although the dingy cutworm feeds similarly to the black cutworm, it eats mostly on the leaves of plants--either those cut by another worm or leaves that grow at the base of garden plants. They also may cut stems that grow below the soil surface. If you can see the worm, it will look similar to a black cutworm, but its skin will be smooth. The dingy is about the same size in length as the black cutworm.
Look for glassy cutworm damage. Glassy cutworms, so named because their skin is transparent, feed and cut on young seedlings. Mature larvae are 1 1/8 inches (30 mm) in length. They spend most of their time underground, where they can cut the newly grown stems of the seedling.
Assess damage from sandhill cutworms. Look for the appearance of wilted leaves, and then dead plants. The sandhill cutworm is light tan with long stripes, and feeds under the surface of the soil. It is found in sandy, loamy soils. Mature larvae can be up to 2 inches (50.8 mm) in length.
Identify seedling damage from bronzed cutworms. These worms feed only on seedlings, and primarily those of grasses. Garden vegetables that are planted in sod fields or other grassy patches are at risk of damage from bronzed cutworms. The actual worms can be identified by their brown and yellow stripes. Adult larvae can reach up to 1 1/2 inches (38 mm).
Look for variegated cutworm damage. These worms cause similar damage to that of black cutworms. They cut at the surface and below the surface, and can feed on leaves. They have been particularly devastating to soybean crops in some areas. The worms have pale yellow spots on their backs and the females deposit eggs in grassy, weeded areas. Variegated cutworms can be as large as 2 inches (50.9 mm) in length.;
, They will begin to emerge at this time to start feeding. You may see the worms in action if they are above soil.

, Now, damage from worms will be fresh and easiest to assess because they eat overnight into the early morning. Look for wilted plants, which indicate the worms have begun to chew through a cut, but haven't made it all the way through yet.

, You may see the worms present in the soil. They will usually curl up when exposed.

Remove food sources.,
Skip the mothballs, ammonia, and noise machines.,
Put up a squirrel nesting box on your property.",How to Keep Animals out of Your Attic2," You can help make your attic less inviting by removing easily accessible food sources from the exterior of your home and your yard. Keep your trash cans secured, avoid keeping any pet food accessible outside, and pick up any fruit or nuts that have fallen from trees in your yard., Contrary to what many think, these methods won’t get rid of animals living in your attic or keep them away, especially raccoons and mice.Additionally, mothballs are carcinogens that can cause a potentially harmful environment for humans when not handled properly., It may be impossible to eliminate squirrels from your property, especially if you live in a wooded area or value your trees, but you can provide a comfy alternative to your attic in hopes that they choose the nest that’s easier to reach.

Don't use pesticide treatments inside your house.,
Don't use topical pesticides in your yard.,
Consider using a perimeter treatment outside.,
Call a professional exterminator.",How to Get Rid of Stink Bugs1," When stink bugs die in your attic or walls, they continue to stink as they decompose.;
, Adult stink bugs have tough outer shells that are hard to penetrate, and using an insecticide will only kill the other bugs in your yard. Don't spray your garden, trees, or other foliage with the intention of killing stink bugs.








, Pesticide treatments sprayed around the perimeter of your property and house are said to block migrating insects like stink bugs from coming in.Research treatments that will work best for your home.









Choose from liquid, powder or granule pesticides. Be sure to read the warnings so you know what other bugs and creatures will be affected by the type of pesticide you choose.
The pesticide should be applied before the stink bugs migrate to your area.

, A professional local to your area will have ideas for how to eliminate the stink bug population near you. Consider contacting an exterminator before applying a pesticide on your own.

Elevate the chicken coop.,
Put hardware cloth over openings.,
Cover your coop’s windows.,
Build a roof on the coop.,
Make sure chicken coop latches are secure.,
Keep chicken feed in sealed containers.",How to Keep a Fisher Cat Away2," It’s a bad idea to have a chicken coop that sits directly on the ground. This will provide easier access for predators like fisher cats, who are very sneaky.


Having your chicken coop sit directly on the ground will also result in poor air circulation and rot. Instead, raise the chicken coop up about 1 foot or more off the ground.
This should make it harder for small predators to get into the coop.The other advantage of the elevated coop is that it can provide protection from hawks for free-ranging chickens.
Remember that the fisher cat can climb, though, so, although the elevated coop will make it harder for the fisher cat to access the coop, you will still need to make sure there are no openings or rotting wood for the fisher to exploit., Don’t think chicken or poultry wire will protect chickens from fisher cats and other predators. It won’t. Fisher cats can tear through regular chicken wire pretty easily, but they won't be able to get through hardware cloth.


Choose hardware cloth with small mesh of 1/2 or 1/4 an inch. Use similar hardware cloth to protect rabbit hutches. Fisher cats easily rip through regular chicken wire. Hardware cloth, which is available at many hardware stores, is really welded wire.Dig a trench around the entire coop to bury the hardware cloth. The small openings in hardware cloth made it hard for a fisher cat to get through it. It’s very durable and won’t tear easily, and it can be placed over any opening a fisher cat could exploit.
Put the hardware cloth over windows, vents, and use it to make a chicken run that is safe from fisher cats. Create a skirt of hardware cloth around the run. Make sure to dig down at least 6 inches when erecting it. Line the bottom of the run with the hardware cloth, so fisher cats can’t dig underneath.

, Cover any and all openings that a fisher cat could possibly sneak through to get inside a chicken coop. Fisher cats are able to get through very small spaces due to their size and dexterity.


This means you should fit hardware cloth over windows in your chicken coops as well as over any ventilation holes. Study the area and cover any opening, even if it looks very small.
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that fisher cats can’t get into a hole that’s high up. They are able to climb, and thus they are very good at climbing and wriggling through small openings that are positioned high up.
Make sure the top of the run is also covered. This is also important to keep away predators, like hawks, that might swoop into the coop to grab a chicken. It will also protect the chickens from fisher cats.

, The chicken coop must also have a roof in order to protect it from predators, including fisher cats, who can get on top of it due to their climbing abilities. You must protect all areas of the coop.


You could use a traditional roof made out of tar or shingles or a metal roof. Some people use hardware cloth as a roof in case the fisher cat climbs up.
Adding electrified netting can provide extra protection for your chickens, deterring even the hardiest and sneakiest fisher cats. It's more expensive, but the best protection.Ensure that the chicken coop doesn’t have any openings, however small, or weakened areas because fisher cats will seize these openings to wriggle through. Fisher cats can get through openings as small as 1 inch in diameter.

, Predators are sometimes sneaky enough that they can lift up simple latches, so you need to secure the coop with latches that only humans can manipulate.A hook through an eye bolt is probably not a secure enough latch to protect a chicken coop from fisher cats. Instead, choose a door latch system that contains a carabiner that is threaded through the latch hole. Choose a latch system that requires two hands to open.
Consider adding automatic coop doors. Automatic doors shut and lock the chickens inside the coop, often by using a timer system. Some automatic doors use light sensors or solar options if you don’t have electricity nearby.
Automatic chicken doors should run you about $200, but they can be worth it because it’s very traumatic to lose chickens to fisher cats.

, Preferably, use metal containers because other predators, like rats and mice, will chew through plastic containers easily. Fisher cats will come around any place with a lot of mice or rats.


If you leave feed around, you will attract more fisher cats, but also other predators and pests. Don't leave anything in your lawn that will be a draw for hungry creatures.
You’re going to draw mice and rats, and that will draw fisher cats who feed on them. Mice are one of the fisher cat's favorite foods. Mice and rats are also unpleasant creatures to have around your yard on their own.
Hang your chicken feeders outside the coop to also prevent mice and rats from getting into the feed meant for the chickens.

Buy devices for deterring predators.,
Spot the culprit.,
Check with local laws before shooting or trapping a fisher cat.,
Trap a fisher cat.,
Pick the right bait.",How to Keep a Fisher Cat Away3," There are certain chemicals and man-made devices that are advertised for their abilities to keep predators away. They can help you ward off fisher cats.


One option is to purchase predator urine. For example, coyotes, wolves, eagles, owls, bobcats, and mountain lions secrete smells that might scare a fisher cat off. You can purchase the urine of stronger predators than the fisher cat online or in many hunting or outdoors stores. You can usually buy a bottle of it for under $20. Sometimes it comes in scent tags.
Apply the predator urine near your chicken coop to help keep the fisher cat and other nuisances away. They will smell the urine, fear there is a stronger predator in the area, and leave. Create a perimeter with the scent tags or bottled scent.
A similar device you can buy online and in some stores is a night guard black box with a solar panel at the top. It flashes a single blinking red light which is designed to simulate a red predator eye and you should hang it above the coop door.

, What exactly is a fisher cat, and how does it differ from, say, a house cat or a raccoon? They are relatives of the marten.They aren’t really cats at all.


Fisher cats are also called pecan cats or black cats. They are large, dark colored, and furry. Technically, they belong to the weasel family.The adult males weigh 7 to 12 pounds. They can grow to 40 inches long. Their tails are very long and distinctive, stretching out 13 to 15 inches. Fisher cats have short legs. Their ears are small, and their tails are furry. Some are dark brown, but others are black. One way to recognize them is through their long fur.
Fisher cats have large feet with five sharp toes. They use these toes to climb tries, kill prey, or navigate across snow. They make frightening screaming sounds that people sometimes mistake for human beings being harmed., These actions may be outlawed in some states, and you don't want to do anything that's not allowed. Laws will vary from state-to-state.


Consider contacting a pest management professional. Such professionals are trained in how to find and get rid of the fisher cats before they do greater damage.
These are nasty, vicious little creatures, and it can be dangerous to try to trap a fisher cat on your own if you don't know what you are doing, especially when it comes to removing it.
Contact your local government or wildlife conservation office. They will be familiar with all of the rules and regulations specific to your area.

, Fisher cats are smart and they will learn from failed attempts. They have more escape routes to avoid traps because they can climb trees, which is part of what makes them so dangerous.


As a trap location, set your trap outside a hollow tree, crevice or bush where they den. Or set it along their trails. Fisher cats require a cage trap that is 32 X 10 X 12.75 (in inches) with a door size that is 10 X 12. When using a coil spring, they require a 4 ½-inch door.
When using a body grip trap, they need to be 4 ¼ by 7 inches (17.8 cm) in width and length, and 4 ¼ by 7 ¼.Use cage and foothold traps along their trails. In the winter, they are more likely to be in trees, so use a leaning pole set. Body grip traps have rotating jaws that capture the animals. Foothold traps capture them and hold them alive.

, When trapping the fisher cat, it’s important to remember they like meat. Thus, trapping the fisher cat can be a rather unpleasant process because of the bait you need to use.


A skinned but whole beaver carcass is good bait. Other meat – rabbits, mice and squirrels - can also work as bait to draw in a fisher cat.
Fishers also like skunk and fish oil, and, thus, they may be lured into a trap that has it. Live bait is also something to consider. Cover the trap with small leafy branches so they don’t see it when they go for the bait.

Know the signs.,
Set out moth traps.,
Wash your clothes.,
Clean the closet.",How to Get Rid of Moths1," If you've seen a moth or two fluttering around but aren't sure if you have an all-out infestation, look for these signs:


Tiny holes in your sweaters or other items of clothing. If you see holes in one sweater, you'll probably find more. Check all of your clothes made with wool, feathers, fur, and silk.
Clothing that looks dusty or discolored, or has a musty smell.
Webbing in corners of the closet or on clothing.
;
, To take care of the immediate problem of moths in your closet, trap them with pheromone moth traps, which attract and kill them with a sticky substance that they can't escape once they touch.


You can make your own moth traps with flypaper and fish oil, which attracts moths. Dab a bit on some flypaper and hang it in your closet.
Traps designed to catch mice are also effective for catching moths.

, It's important to wash every item of clothing to get rid of eggs the moths may have laid.


Wash the items according to their care instructions. If possible, put them through a hot dryer. Items that cannot be dried on high heat can be placed in the freezer for a few days to kill any eggs.
Wash linens, towels, and any other cloth items stored in your closet.
Remove suitcases, bags and other containers, and wash these as well.


, Now that everything has been removed from your closet, it's time to scour it from top to bottom to get rid of moth eggs that might still be lurking there.


Use soapy water or a vinegar and water solution to clean the closet floor and walls. Dip a sponge scrubber into the solution and scrub the walls to scratch off all the eggs. Clean especially well in cracks and crevices.
Vacuum well. Use a high-powered vacuum to clean the carpet in your closet. While you're at it, vacuum the bedroom area, too, since moths may have laid eggs there.

, This removes the dust and debris. Make sure your vacuum cleaner doesn’t have any rough plastic parts near the bottom or edges. Vacuum cleaners with faulty wheels can scratch floors. If you don’t have a good model, use a broom to get rid of the dust and debris.

, Polyurethaned floors have a hard finish. You can clean them with a small amount of water. On the other hand, shellac or lacquered floors can’t have any water on them and may need to be waxed regularly.If your floor has been shellacked or lacquered, you’ll have to strip and wax it yearly.You can use denatured alcohol and lacquer thinner to test your floor finish. Test a small area of the floor you normally cover with furniture or a rug.

Apply two or three drops of the alcohol. After a few seconds, touch the spot with an old cloth. If it feels soft, it’s shellac.
If the alcohol doesn’t soften the finish, apply two or three drops of lacquer thinner to a nearby spot. If it softens to the touch, the finish is lacquer. If it feels tacky, it’s likely water-based., Mix a few drops of dishwashing liquid with a bucket of water. Wring out the mop until it’s damp. Run the mop along the grain.Use smooth strokes. Start at the interior corner and work outward toward a doorway. This motion will keep you from stepping on your wet floors.

Never mop floors that have been waxed. Clean them by vacuuming and sweeping., Get on your hands and knees to buff with a microfiber cloth. If you prefer to stand, use a dry microfiber mop. Move in a circular motion until it shines.


You could also rent a buffing machine if you prefer. Move the machine in the direction of the wood grain., Use water-based (urethane) polish on floors with a polyurethane finish.

Apply the polish. Wipe it with a microfiber cloth. If no damage appears, you can polish the entire floor. If you see discoloration, seek advice from a professional contractor.

, Depending on the directions, either spray the polish directly to the floor or apply it to a cloth first.Use a “feathering” technique (wiping the polish in a semi-circle). Overlap your feathering strokes for a streak-free finish.

, Cover 3 by 3 feet (0.91 by 0.91 m) sections at a time. Move gradually across the width of the room to the next corner. Continue along the length of the room to the third corner. Polish to the last corner. Begin to move inward to polish the center of the room. Polish the area by the doorway last to avoid ruining your hard work.


If your floor has been waxed, apply two to three thin layers of polish instead of one thick layer. Wait for each coat to dry completely (about 24 hours) before applying the next one., Your floor will feel tacky or sticky until it’s completely dry. For good measure, wait six to 24 hours before walking on the floor with socks. Don’t wear shoes for at least 24 hours. You can replace your furniture after two days.

Seal your house.,
Buy high quality screens.,
Get rid of stink bug eggs.,
Use the color yellow to your advantage.",How to Get Rid of Stink Bugs2," Stink bugs are likely to come into your house by way of cracks or holes on its exterior. Go outside and give the outside of your house a thorough check for possible entry points.









Pay special attention to areas near doors and windows. Are there gaps under the doors or between the windows and the walls?
Seal cracks with caulk or another hardy, impenetrable material.

, If you like to feel the summer breeze when the weather is warm, keep stink bugs (and other creatures) out using screens. Make sure the screens are fitted into the frames properly so that the stink bugs can't squeeze around gaps or holes.









If you have older screens, take a look to see if they need repairing or updating. Metal or fiber screens often get holes, and it only takes one to let a stink bug inside.
Windows aren't the only openings that need to be screened. Screen the opening of your chimney, pipe or gutter openings, drains, vents, and any other opening through which stink bugs can make their way inside your home.

, Stink bugs eat fruit and vegetables, and they lay their barrel-shaped eggs in clumps on the undersides of leaves. Look for the eggs when temperatures warm up in the spring, and take measures to get rid of them.









The soapy water method works as well outside as it does inside. Use a stick to knock the eggs - and any nearby stink bugs - from the leaves into a bucket of soapy water.
If you have a garden or a fruit tree that you think may be a home to stink bugs, consider trimming it back or getting rid of it. It's difficult to completely eliminate stink bugs from an area if they still have a food source around.
Trim back bushes, weeds, and areas of overgrown foliage to prevent stink bugs from laying their eggs in your yard.

, Stink bugs are attracted to yellow, a weakness you can use against them by placing yellow sticky traps around your garden. The stink bugs land on the traps and aren't able to fly away.









This color can work to your disadvantage, too, if you love yellow daisies or sunflowers. Remove yellow flowers from your yard, or plant them well away from your house, to avoid attracting stink bugs.
Yellow sticky traps will attract and trap beneficial pollinators in addition to stinkbugs. If your garden is dependent upon bees/other pollinators, you may want to consider another method.

Catch them on a piece of 2 inch wide masking tape.,
Catch them with a plastic bag or paper towel.,
Place them into soapy water.,
Vacuum them from your floors and walls.Vacuuming stink bugs is an effective method that prevents you from having to touch them.,
Spray them with an insecticide.",How to Get Rid of Stink Bugs3," Pull off a piece of tape around 6 inches long, and place it over the stink bug, pressing just firmly enough to stick the bug to the tape. Quickly pick up the tape and fold it over, trapping the bug inside the tape. It will not have time to get off a blast of odor. Sometimes the bug doesn't stick to the tape on the first try, in that case apply the tape again and press a little harder. They stick to the tape much easier when they are upside down.








, If you see a stink bug in the house, cover your hand with a plastic bag or paper towel, carefully pick it up, and dispose of it immediately. The bugs release their noxious smell when they sense danger, and you risk getting it on your hands if you touch them.









Don't squeeze the stink bug when you catch it. You'll have a difficult time clearing the smell out of your house.
If you catch a stink bug during the winter, you can place it outside. Stink bugs freeze if they're outside in cold weather, so it won't be making its way back in.
You could also flush the stink bug down the toilet or enclose it in a bottle with a top and discard it.

, Stink bugs quickly drown when they are knocked into soapy water, and if you use a scented soap it will mask the smell. Fill a bucket or other container with water and dish soap, then place stink bugs in the solution after you catch them.









If you have stink bugs on your walls or curtains, you can knock them directly into the bucket. Place the bucket under the the stink bug and use a broom or brush to knock it off the wall into the bucket.
When you're ready to discard the bugs you collected, strain them out of the soapy water and throw them away or flush them down the toilet.

, When you vacuum stink bugs, make sure you change the bag right away, since the vacuum will otherwise smell like the bugs.









Don't use a central vacuum that doesn't require a bag. The smell of the stink bugs will permeate your home.
If you're dealing with a constant stream of stink bugs in your home, consider buying a vacuum specifically for the purpose of cleaning up stink bugs.

, Find an insecticide meant for on-the-spot treatment - rather than one designed for spraying your house's corners and killing bugs over time - and spray the stink bugs as you see them.









Once the stink bug has stopped moving, sweep it up and discard it in the trash can, or flush it down the toilet.
This method is effective, but insecticide may have an effect on the people and pets in your house, too. Try the soapy water or vacuuming method first.

For extreme cases, call an exterminator.",How to Get Rid of Moths2," Moth eggs usually enter closest by way of clothing that has been worn outside.

, Moths are attracted to wool, but they're especially apt to enter your closet if your clothing has stains from food and other items that they like to eat. Make sure you wash your clothes before hanging them up. Dry clean wool items before storing them.

, Clothes you don't wear often, especially wool winter clothing, should be stored in an airtight place.


Protect wool coats and sweaters with plastic bags.
Store winter clothing in plastic storage bags, plastic bins, or airtight metal containers.

, Moths are attracted to humid spaces, so it's important to keep the air circulating and on the cool side so they don't decide to nest there.

, Let your wool items get some sun, especially if you're taking them out at the beginning of fall or winter after they've been in storage.

, Moths are repelled by cedar, so it's a good idea to hang wool items on cedar hangers.


You can also purchase ball-shaped pieces of cedar to hang in your closet, or fill a sachet bag with cedar chips and hang it up.
Try placing cedar-scented items in the pockets of your wool items for extra protection.


, Placing moth balls in your closet is an effective way to kill moths, but the chemicals moth balls are made with are toxic to humans, and they leave a strong scent in your closet and on your clothes. Try these alternatives:


Sachets made with dried rosemary, thyme, cloves, lavender, or bay leaves. Simply fill a small cloth bag with these ingredients, tie it with a string, and hang it up.
Essential oils made from these herbs can be sprinkled in your closet or on your clothing as an effective moth deterrent.

, Moth problems can usually be solved with these simple solutions, but if you find that moths keep returning, they may be laying eggs in a place you can't reach with a vacuum or sponge. Call a pest control professional to fumigate the area and kill the moth eggs.

Consider calling a pest control professional.",How to Get Rid of Moths3," Moths leave behind secretions, webbing and other signs of their presence. You probably have an infestation if you notice these signs:


Food items that are stuck together or seem slightly sticky. This could be caused by moth secretions.
Food items that smell musty or ""off,"" even if they haven't reached their expiration date or been exposed to conditions that would make them stale.
Light webbing around boxes or bags in your pantry.
The presence of caterpillars or full grown moths in your pantry is a sure sign that it's time to take action.

, Don't try to save it; it's not healthy to eat food infested by moths. Toss out the following items:


Bulk food items, such as grains, nuts, and rice, should be thrown away, since moths eat and lay their eggs in these foods.
Moths can eat through cardboard boxes. If you see tiny holes in your pantry items, throw them out.
Moths can also get into tiny spaces. Anything that has been opened before, even a plastic bag of chocolate chips or nuts, should probably be tossed.
Dispose of food in a sealed garbage bag, and remove it from your house immediately.

, If there are still moths left in your kitchen after you've thrown away their food sources, set out pheromone moth traps to attract and kill them with a sticky substance that they can't escape once they touch. Throw away the traps in a sealed container once you've caught all the moths in your kitchen.

, Now that you've addressed the immediate problem, it's time to clean the kitchen from top to bottom, focusing on the pantry, to get rid of any eggs the moths may have left behind.


Use soapy water or a vinegar and water solution as your detergent. You can also use a stronger chemical cleaner.
Dip a sponge scrubber or steel wool into the solution and scour the cabinets, pantry, and other corners and cracks in your kitchen. Make sure you really scrub the surfaces to make sure the moth eggs are removed.

, If moths reappear after you've taken these measures, they may be laying eggs in the walls or other place you can't get to with a sponge. Make an appointment with an exterminator, who will use heavy-duty products to get rid of the problem.

Place items in the freezer when you bring them home.,
Store food in air-tight containers.,
Control temperature and humidity in the kitchen.,
Seal cracks and crevices.",How to Get Rid of Moths4," Moths usually enter kitchens by way of food that is already infested. Bulk items like oatmeal, dried grains or nuts may have eggs on them when you bring them home. However, even food that has been packaged and sealed can bring in moth eggs.

, You don't have to stop buying bulk food items; try putting them in the freezer to kill any eggs they might contain before placing them in your pantry. Simply clear a place in the freezer and store the food there for 3-4 days before using it as usual.

, Proper food storage is probably the best preventative measure you can take.


Choose glass or plastic containers for bulk food items. Make sure they have tight-fitting lids.
Instead of putting half-used boxes and bags of nonperishable items back into the pantry, pour the remaining food into sealable containers. Moths can eat right through cardboard and light plastic.

, Moths thrive in warm, humid temperatures, so if your kitchen is often on the muggy side, you may be creating an inviting home for moths.


Keep windows and doors closed when your air conditioner is running.
Make sure the pantry and food storage areas are well ventilated.

, There are a lot of great hiding places for moths in a kitchen. Do your best to seal off the places you aren't able to regularly clean, like cracks in the back of the pantry, spaces between shelving and the wall, and cracks where cabinets attach to the wall.

Don’t move lit candles.,
Remove rugs before using hair removal wax.",How to Get Wax out of Fabrics and Carpet," When you knock over a candle or get wax on the carpet, your clothes, or another piece of fabric, you must give the wax time to dry before you can clean it. Otherwise, you risk pushing the wax deeper into the fibers if you try to wipe it up when it’s wet.


Wax doesn’t take long to dry. For small amounts, the wax will be dry in a couple of minutes. For larger spills, you may have to way 15 to 20 minutes.
To speed up the process, apply an ice cube to the affected area to dry the wax faster.;
, When the wax is dry, use a butter knife or spoon to scrape the wax and break it up. Pick up any large pieces that flake off and throw them in the garbage.Avoid spreading the loose wax flakes around as much as possible, as this could make cleanup more difficult.


On fabric, peel the fabric away from the back of the wax to dislodge the larger pieces.

, When you're removing wax from a rug or carpet, vacuum the area thoroughly to suck up any pieces or flakes of wax that you scraped off. This will prevent wax from melting into the carpet in a larger area when you go to remove it.Instead of vacuuming fabrics, take the material outside and shake it out to remove loose wax pieces.

, The easiest way to remove wax from fabrics and carpeting is with an iron, but only if the material can withstand the heat. Set an iron to low and let it preheat. Once hot, apply the iron to an inconspicuous area of the fabric or carpet for 30 seconds. Remove the iron and inspect for damage, melting, or warping.During the test, remove the iron immediately if the carpet or material starts to smoke, smells like burning, or begins to melt.

, Grab two pieces of paper towel and lay the double layer on top of the wax spill. For moveable carpets, rugs, and fabrics, place two sheets of paper towel on the underside of the spill as well. When you heat the wax, the paper towels will absorb it.


You can also use a single layer of a white or brown paper bag if you don’t have paper towel. Just make sure there's no ink, wax, or printing on the bag.
You can also use blotting paper, which is an absorbent material meant to soak up oil and other liquids., Turn an iron on to the low temperature setting and wait for it to heat up. When the iron is hot, press it gently into the paper towel where the wax is. Move the iron slowly from side to side to warm the area. As the wax heats and re-melts, the paper towel will absorb it.Don’t use steam settings to heat the wax, as it will soak the paper towel and prevent it from absorbing the wax.
You can use this method to remove wax from carpeting, leather, faux leather, denim, suede, micro suede, and other materials.

, For materials that didn’t pass the heat test, use a blow dryer on the hot setting to heat the wax. Hold the blow dryer 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) from the carpet.Direct the hot air at the wax spill and apply gentle pressure to the paper towel with your other hand.


You may have to use the blow dryer instead of the iron for materials that can melt, such as synthetics like polyester, faux fur materials, and other polymer-based fabrics.

, As the paper towels becomes saturated with wax, replace the sheets above and below the material with fresh sheets. This will allow the wax to continue absorbing, and prevent it from spreading to a larger area.Continue heating the wax with the iron, saturating the paper towels, and replacing the paper towels until the towels stop absorbing wax.

, For machine washable fabrics like clothing and table cloths, treat the area with a stain remover and then launder it in the washing machine. For non-washable materials like carpeting, spray the area with carpet cleaner and blot it with a clean cloth until the area is clean and dry.After you remove the wax from the area, there may still be colorant or residue left on the material, and that’s why washing is necessary.

, Wax spills often occur when lit candles aren't secured properly and fall over. You can prevent this from happening by using candle holders that are the appropriate size for the candle you're burning.


Holders are especially important with taper candles, the tall skinny candles, that aren't designed to stand up on their own.
If you're burning a taper candle that’s slightly small for the holder, wrap the base of the candle with aluminum foil before inserting it into the holder.

, This will protect the table and tablecloth underneath from wax spills and runoff. You can use a ceramic plate, aluminum pie plate, or other flat dish.


This is especially important with votive and pillar candles that don’t necessarily need candle holders.
A protective base is also important with taper candles, because wax can drip off the side of the candle holder and onto the surface below.

, Candles that are too close to a table edge or ledge are a risk for being knocked over. Not only will this spill wax on carpeting and other materials, but it’s also a fire hazard. When burning candles, place them in the center of a large table to prevent accidents.

, A lit or recently lit candle will have liquid wax on the top of the candle, and this is very easy to spill. To prevent this from happening, never move a candle once it’s lit, and always give candles plenty of time to cool down after you blow them out.


Choose your candle placement wisely before you light it to avoid having to move it when the wax is hot.

, Hot hair removal wax is another type of wax that can cause spills on fabrics and carpets. To prevent this, always use the wax in an uncarpeted area of the house, such as a bathroom. If there are any area rugs in the bathroom, move them out of the room before you melt the wax.

Alternatively, you can also vacuum the floor, but be sure to use the hard floor attachment to avoid scratching the laminate. Don’t use a vacuum that has a beater bar, as this can also scratch the floor., The haze that forms on many laminate floors is often caused by the wrong cleaners, including soap- and oil-based ones.To remove this, your best bet will be a floor cleaner that’s specially formulated for laminate floors. However, you can also try a homemade cleaner for laminate. To do this, combine in a spray bottle:½ cup (118 ml) of water
½ cup (118 ml) of white vinegar
½ cup (118 ml) of rubbing alcohol

, Apply a thin and even layer of cleaner. Start with a section that’s small enough that you can reach the entire area with your mop without walking on the wet floor.Laminate is not meant to get wet, so you should never apply large amounts of liquid to the floor.


Never clean laminate with a mop and bucket, as this will get the floor too wet.

, Use a clean, flat-head microfiber mop and wipe the entire section of floor in the direction of the grain. The surface of the floor should look slightly damp, but not overly wet.


Don’t use a sponge or string mop on laminate, as it can leave streaks, and leave too much moisture on the floor., Take a few steps back and spray the next section of floor with your cleaner. Wipe the section with the microfiber mop. Continue spraying and mopping in small sections until the entire floor is clean.Once the entire floor has been cleaned, leave it to air dry for up to half an hour. Don’t let anybody walk on the floor while it’s still wet, or this could diminish the shine.

, When the floor is dry, look at it in the light and check for spots that may still be dull. Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to rub and buff these areas to restore the shine., Dust and dirt can make your floor look dirty, and they can also cause scratches. Sweep or vacuum the floor at least once a week, and more often if you have kids, pets, or a particularly active house.When you vacuum, always use the hard floor attachment.

, Mop the floor at least once a week after you vacuum. Work in small sections by spraying cleaner directly onto the floor and wiping with a microfiber mop. To maintain the shine, use a commercial or homemade cleaner that’s specifically formulated for laminate.

As soon as food spills on the floor, pick up solid waste with a spoon or a towel. Wipe up any liquids, puddles, or spills that end up on the floor with a cloth or towel.


Laminate that stays wet for too long can warp or be otherwise damaged., Laminate floor is designed to be shiny, so you never have to wax or polish it. In fact, these substances can damage and dull the floor rather than making it shine.To keep the floor shiny, mop it regularly with a laminate-formulated cleaner.

, Laminate floor can scratch easily, so don’t use scrubbing pads or abrasive cleaners to maintain the floor. The best cleaning material for the floor is a soft, lint-free cloth or microfiber.Abrasive scrubbers include steel wool, scrubbing pads, and scrubbing sponges.

, Steam and other liquids will damage and warp the laminate. Avoid any type of water-based cleaning system on your laminate floor, including steamers, mop-and-bucket, or even spray mops., To prevent scratches caused by chair legs, table legs, and other furniture, install felt pads on the bottom of all furniture that touches the laminate. For chair and table legs, you can use small round pads. For larger and heavier furniture, use wider pads to protect the floor."

While there are many ""all purpose"" removers to choose from, read the label to determine if a particular cleaner is right for your stain and carpet type. Keep in mind that stains caused by bodily fluids will often need special attention.


If you're dealing with a fresh blood stain, blot it with cold water or hydrogen peroxide. Do not use warm water, as this will set the stain. For a dry stain, first blot with hydrogen peroxide and follow up with an enzyme-based detergent.
For pet urine, use an enzyme-based cleaner specifically designed for this type of stain. If you are unable to find such a cleaner, blot fresh stains with an ammonia solution followed by a detergent and warm water. Set stains can be lifted with a 1/3 vinegar in water solution. Like fresh stains, follow up with a detergent and finish with water., Following the directions on the bottle, try it out in a discreet place. Some products may be inappropriate for your carpet, so it is best to test it first. A scrap of carpet or a rarely seen place such as the interior of a closet are good places for testing cleaners.









Do not do this test on the stain itself. Its purpose is to check for the carpet's colorfastness. If any dye comes off of your carpet or the cleaner itself leaves behind a stain, try a different one.

, Apply a small amount of product to a clean white cloth and gently blot the stain. Use only enough product to treat the stain.









When it comes to carpets, more product is not better. If soap is left in the carpet it will attract dirt and leave a larger stain than before.
Avoid scrubbing the carpet. Pressing hard or rubbing vigorously can drive the stain deeper into the fibers., Using a fresh clean white cloth and water, soak up any remaining soap by blotting the treated area. Do not soak the carpet with water as it may be absorbed into the pad beneath, leading to problems with mold and mildew.


Allow the area to air dry completely. If it is a large stain or you used a large amount of water, run a fan or specialty carpet dryer next to the carpet to make it dry more quickly."

Protect yourself.,
Wipe up any large chunks immediately.,
Scrub the spot with an enzyme cleaner and water.,
Soak up any lingering vomit.",How to Clean Vomit from Wood Floors1," If the sick person has any kind of virus, you don't want to expose yourself to it. Put on some disposable gloves. If necessary, use extra protection, like a hygienic mask.;
, Vomit often has large chunks of food in it. These should be wiped up immediately using paper towels. Transfer as many large chunks as you can to a garbage bag right away., Vomit is often acidic and requires a enzyme-containing cleaner. You should be able to find enzyme cleaners online or at department stores. Spritz some of the cleaner on the vomit. Then, use a damp rag or paper towel to gently scrub the vomit off the floor.If you don't have an enzyme cleaner on hand, you can use dish soap. While it's generally best to use a stronger cleaner, dish soap in your kitchen can work in a pinch.

, If there's any bits of vomit remaining on the floor, soak them up. Liquid residue may linger after cleaning, for example. Press a paper towel or clean rag over the spot to remove any lingering traces of vomit."

Spot test rubbing alcohol.,
Dab the stain with rubbing alcohol.,
Let the rubbing alcohol sit for several minutes.,
Dab at the stain.",How to Get Hair Dye Stain out of Linoleum2," Rubbing alcohol runs the risk of staining your linoleum surface, so before applying rubbing alcohol on the stain, it’s important to test it first on your linoleum. Add rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball, then dab the cotton ball on an inconspicuous area of your linoleum surface, such as in a corner.Wait about 10 minutes, then check on the area. If the linoleum has lightened considerably or has turned a different color, do not use the rubbing alcohol on the stain.

, Apply rubbing alcohol liberally to a clean cloth, then dab at the stain with the cloth so that the rubbing alcohol transfers to the stain., After dabbing the stain and coating it in rubbing alcohol, let the stain sit for several minutes to allow the rubbing alcohol to sink in and start dislodging the dye stain., After letting the rubbing alcohol soak in for a few minutes, start dabbing again at the hair dye stain with the damp cloth. Dab until the stain is completely removed or you are no longer lifting any more stain.

"

Spot test acetone.,
Rub at the stain with acetone.,
Wipe the area with water.",How to Get Hair Dye Stain out of Linoleum3," Apply a small amount of nail polish remover, also called acetone, to a cotton ball and dab at an inconspicuous spot on your linoleum surface. Wait several minutes and check the spot. If the acetone hasn’t damaged the surface or changed the color of the linoleum, it is safe to use.Acetone is slightly more abrasive than rubbing alcohol, so try to use it only if the rubbing alcohol did not work.

, Apply acetone to a cotton ball, making sure it’s fully saturated, then rub the cotton ball in circular motions over the stained portion of the linoleum. Rub the stained area until the stain stops lifting or comes out completely.If dye starts coming out, discard the cotton ball, saturate another cotton ball with acetone, and use it so that you don’t rub the dye back into the linoleum.

, Once the stain has been removed or isn’t lifting anymore, dampen a clean cotton ball in water and rub over the area you were cleaning to wipe away any acetone residue.


Since acetone is a somewhat caustic substance, it’s not a good idea to leave any excess or residue on the linoleum.

"
"
Spot test hairspray.,
Spray the hairspray over the stain.,
Dab at the hairspray with a clean cloth.,
Clean the excess hairspray.",How to Get Hair Dye Stain out of Linoleum4," Spray a small amount of alcohol- based hairspray on an inconspicuous area of the linoleum surface and let it sit for several minutes. If the linoleum looks unchanged, go ahead and use the hairspray to tackle the hair dye stain.Make sure to use alcohol-based hairspray, as the alcohol is the agent that will work to lift the stain. Alcohol is typically an ingredient in cheaper brands of hairspray.

, Hold the bottle of hairspray about a foot (30.48 cm) from the stain and spray thoroughly so that the stain is wet with hairspray but not soaked. Let the hairspray sit on the stain for several minutes., Use a clean cloth to dab at the stain using patting motions. Dab until the stain is completely lifted or until dabbing no longer has any effect., Wet a clean towel with water and wipe at the stain to remove any excess hairspray.

Rent or buy a carpet cleaner.,
Fill the machine.,
Clean a test spot.,
Begin away from the door.,
Open doors and windows to let the room dry.,
Dispose of the water.",How to Deep Clean Carpet2," A carpet cleaner is a special machine that looks like a vacuum, but it uses steam and special cleaning solution to deep clean your carpets. If you have many rugs and carpets in your home or if you deep clean your carpets more than once or twice a year, you may want to invest in a carpet cleaner. If you’re not ready to commit, you can rent these machines for a day from grocery stores, hardware stores, or even pet stores.


Make sure you get a cleaner that you can easily lift or move. Remember that once you fill it with water, the machine will weigh even more.No matter if you buy or rent a steam cleaner, you will have to purchase the cleaning solution yourself. The cleaning solution is often sold next to the machine itself. You may also be able to find it in the cleaning aisle of the store.

, You will need to put both water and cleaning solution in the tank. Each brand of carpet cleaner has slightly instructions for this, so be sure to read the manual before you begin. Generally, however, you will add a certain amount of formula to a small tank before adding water to the tank. Some carpet cleaners may also have a separate tank for just water.


Once you have filled the tank, you can plug the machine in. Do not plug in the machine before adding the water and cleaning solution.
If someone in your home has respiratory issues or if you are uncomfortable with the use of chemicals in your home, you can use a cup of white vinegar instead of cleaning solution in the tank.Be aware that this may void the warranty on the machine, and you may need to do a second cleaning for the best results.

, You should make sure that the cleaning solution will not change the color of your carpet or leave stains behind. Find a patch of carpet that is usually covered by furniture. Try using the carpet cleaner on that small part. If you notice any discoloration, you may not want to use it on your entire carpet., When you start cleaning, position yourself as far away from the door as possible. As you move the cleaner over the carpet, slowly go across the room. You want to end at the door, so that you can leave when you are finished without stepping on the clean and wet carpet.If the carpet is still visibly dirty, let it dry for a few hours, and go over it a second time.
If you start by the door, you may find yourself trapped in a corner. You will have to walk over your clean carpet in order to leave.

, The carpet will take several hours or even overnight to dry. During this time, make sure that there is as much air circulating as possible. Open all of the windows in the room, and keep the doors open as well. This will prevent mold and mildew from developing in the damp carpet while it dries.If you have pets or children, use baby gates to keep them out of the room while the carpet dries.
Use fans and dehumidifiers in the room to help the drying process. These can also help reduce mildew., The water you used is full of chemicals, and you should not pour it down the drain unless told to do so by the manufacturer or store.


If you rented your carpet cleaner, the store may ask you to return the cleaner full of the water you used to clean. This is so that they can dispose of the water responsibly.
If you own your steam cleaner or if the store does not want you to return the machine full, call your local water treatment facility to ask how you should dispose of the water."
"
Purchase a dry carpet cleaning solution.,
Sprinkle the cleaning solution over the carpet.,
Vacuum the carpet.",How to Deep Clean Carpet3," There are many commercial dry carpet cleaning solutions available. These are typically powders that contain a detergent and a solution. Some may contain a very small amount of water. You can buy these at a grocery or hardware store.Some popular brands include Love my Carpet, Arm and Hammer, Host, and Carpet Fresh.
Dry cleaning will not help remove stains from your carpet. If your carpet is visibly soiled, you may want to use a carpet cleaner instead., Measure out the correct amount of solution according to the instructions on the label. Spread it out over your carpet. Make sure that there is an even amount over all parts of the carpet.


Be careful not to use too much. If you do, you may get fine white powder residue on your clothing and furniture, even after you vacuum it up.

, Once you have worked the solution into the carpet, you should vacuum it up. You may want to go over the carpet a few times with your vacuum just to make sure that you have removed all of the powder.If you find that you have white powder on your furniture or clothing after vacuuming, you may need to vacuum again.
There is no need to wait for the carpet to dry. Once it is vacuumed, you are done cleaning.

Rub the area with a sponge and blot it dry with paper towels.

, Special water-soluble stains include those from blood, chocolate, coffee, wine, tea, vomit and mustard.Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of ammonia with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Use a mild detergent instead of ammonia for a wool or wool-blend carpet.Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray onto the dried stain.
Rub the area with a sponge and blot it dry with paper towels.
Pay attention even to clear-colored stains such as white wine. The sugars actually caramelize over time causing discolored patches., Lay a paper towel over the spill and iron it on a warm setting. The heat should cause the spill to lift off the carpet and stick to the paper towel.

, Rub a cotton ball moistened with rubbing alcohol on the glue. Gently wipe off the glue residue and continue rubbing until it is gone.

, Apply an ice cube to the gum or wax for around 30 seconds.If a large area is affected, hit the frozen area with a blunt object until it shatters. Vacuum up the pieces and blot the area with a towel.For smaller pieces of gum, use a spoon to lift the frozen gum and cut the carpet underneath. Go as close to the frozen gum as possible and only cut a small amount.,

If professional plastic is not available, cut squares of aluminum foil or wax paper and slide them beneath the feet of the furniture.Carpet shampooing is sometimes called ""steam cleaning."" However, this is a misnomer, as these machines actually use hot water and detergent, not steam., Vacuum thoroughly, first in forward and back then left to right. Be sure to avoid neglecting corners and crannies.Spot-treat major stains in the carpet. The shampooer will remove grime, but it can also set stains more deeply., Many grocery or hardware stores offer rentals of cleaners with the appropriate detergent available for purchase.


If you are renting the cleaner, prepare the room in advance so you do not need to pay for a longer rental while you complete that step.
Ideally the cleaner should have a built-in heating core that will keep the water hot. Read the product description or consult a salesperson prior to renting or purchasing a carpet shampooer.

, Once the carpet has been cleaned no one should walk on it until it has dried. Be careful not clean yourself into a corner! Begin at the area farthest from the door and work your way out.

, Some cleaners come with shampoo included or recommend a certain detergent usually purchasable from the same store. In general, you will fill the water container on the machine with water and a small amount of detergent.


Do not add too much soap as it can damage both the machine and your carpets. Some professionals actually advise to use slightly less detergent than what your machine recommends., The damp carpet will attract further dirt and your work will be undone if you wear dirty shoes while cleaning. Instead, wear socks or put plastic bags over your feet or shoes. Specialty booties are also available to place over shoes while cleaning.



Some detergents may be harmful after immediate application. Going completely barefoot is not advised., In general, cleaners are designed to lay down water as you push the machine forward and suck it up as you pull it back. You should pull back very slowly, allowing the machine to pull up as much water as possible.


If the carpet stays too damp, or if water soaks through to the carpet pad, it can lead to mold and mildew., Leave windows and doors open to allow for free air circulation. Make sure that the carpet dries completely within 24 hours for mold prevention.If open windows are not an option, set the air conditioner to a moderate setting (72-78 degrees) and leave the room door open.
Any combination of carpet dryers, fans, blowers, dehumidifiers, and air movers may also be use to encourage fast drying.
Drying may take 6-12 hours and during that period you should not walk on the carpet or replace the furniture.Plastic protectors on the feet of bulky furniture may be removed when the carpet has dried completely.

, If soap remains in the carpet after you have steamed it, it will attract more dirt. To thoroughly remove the soap, put a 50-50 mix of white vinegar and water in the machine and repeat the cleaning process. The vinegar will help remove any lingering detergent residue.It is recommended that carpets in high-traffic areas should be shampooed twice a year, while infrequently used spaces can be done as little as once every 18 months. If you have a light-colored carpet that begins to look dirty, clean it sooner."

Keep mess-making substances away from your carpet.,
Remove footwear before walking on your carpet.,
Properly train your pets.,
Contain any messes that do occur as soon as possible.",How to Clean Your Carpets4," Textiles, such as carpet, are generally much more difficult to clean compared to hard surfaces like tile. It is partly for this reason that many forgo wall-to-wall carpet in kitchens and dining rooms. Relegate as much eating and drinking to non-carpeted areas as possible. , In many countries, such as Canada and Japan, it is customary to remove your shoes when entering a dwelling. This is typically to prevent dirt from being tracked inside.Consider taking off your shoes and placing them in a designated spot in your foyer. Doing so will remove a major cause of soiled carpets., Make sure your cat, dog, or other small animal does not have any ""accidents"" on your carpet. If your pet uses a litter box, place it in an area with an easier to clean flooring, such as tile or laminate. If you must put the box in a room with carpeting, place it on a rubber litter mat. These mats will both prevent spills and keep litter from being tracked onto the carpet., Remove any excess staining agents immediately. The longer a stain is left to set, the more difficult it will be to remove.


If you spill a colored liquid, mop it up by dabbing it with a clean white cloth. Be sure to use up and down pressing motions rather than scrubbing side-to-side. The latter will make a stain worse by spreading it over a greater area.
Vacuum up small particulate matter like dirt.

Spot test the bleach.,
Dab at the stain with bleach.,
Wipe away excess bleach.",How to Get Hair Dye Stain out of Linoleum5," Pour a small amount of chlorine bleach onto a clean rag and dab it into the linoleum in an inconspicuous area. Bleach has a lightening effect if not used on an already light surface, so if the linoleum looks discolored or markedly lighter, do not use bleach to clean the stain.Bleach should only be used as a last resort. Some advise never to use bleach on linoleum, while others report success in removing hair dye stains. This is why spot testing bleach is essential; if it discolors the surface of the linoleum, it should not be used since it can cause even more damage.
Wear gloves when using bleach.

, If the bleach is safe to use on your linoleum surface, apply the bleach to a cotton ball, then rub at the dye stain, taking care to not rub outside the stained area.As you are cleaning, you may find it helpful to rub the area clean with water to get a better idea of your progress before blotting again with bleach.

, Once you have finished removing the stain, damped a clean rag with water and rub the area you were cleaning to get rid of any excess bleach or other cleaners.

Clean the metal if necessary.,
Hold the metal under white light.,
Identify copper's reddish color.,
Inspect yellow brass.,
Learn about red or orange brass.,
Identify other brass.",How to Tell Brass from Copper1," Both brass and copper develop a patina with age, usually green but sometimes other colors.If none of the original metal is visible, try brass cleaning techniques. These typically work for both metals, but to be safe you could use a commercial brass and copper cleaning product.;
, If the metal is highly polished, you may see false colors due to reflected light.Look at it in sunlight or under a white fluorescent light bulb, not under a yellow incandescent bulb.

, Copper is a pure metal, and always has a reddish brown appearance. A modern US penny is plated in copper (and was almost entirely copper from 1962 to 1981), so this is a good point of comparison., The word brass refers to any alloy that contains copper and zinc. Different proportions of these metals produce different colors, but the most common types of brass have a muted yellow color, or a yellow-brown appearance similar to bronze. These brass alloys are widely used in machined parts and screws.Some brass has a greenish-yellow appearance, but this alloy, called ""gilding metal,"" is only used for a few specialized purposes in decoration and ammunition., Many other common brass alloys can look orange or reddish brown, when they contain at least 85% copper.These types of brass are usually found in jewelry, decorative fasteners, or plumbing.Any hint or orange, yellow, or gold means the item is brass, not copper. If the brass alloy is almost entirely copper, you may need to compare it side by side with a copper pipe or item of jewelry. If you're still not sure, it's either copper or brass with such a high copper content that the distinction may not be important.

, Brass with high zinc content can look bright gold, yellowish white, and even white or grey.These alloys are not common, since they are not machine workable, but you may find them in jewelry."
"
Vacuum as often as possible.,
Remove shoes before walking on the carpet.,
Dry pets’ paws when they come inside.",How to Clean White Carpet2," This is especially important in high traffic areas where the carpet gets a lot of wear. Vacuuming gets rid of any surface dirt on the carpet before it has a chance to get pressed in.Try for once or twice a week at a minimum, but daily is even better, especially if you have children or pets.
Use a high quality vacuum, experts recommend a top-loading machine with HEPA filters to catch the maximum amount of dirt. Remember to the change the filters often.Set the vacuum height level so that it gives slight resistance when you push it over the carpet. This will ensure it is operating optimally.Change the vacuum bag often. When the bag is above half full the vacuum is less effective., Take your shoes off when you come in the door and have your guests do the same. This is key to maintaining your white carpet and keeping it clean.


Leave socks on though, as bare feet give off natural oils that are then deposited on the carpet, causing it to attract dirt.Place a shoe rack by the door to remind you to remove your shoes when you come in.
Have slippers, which are strictly for indoor use and don't walk outside in them. You could even have a few spare pairs to offer guests, who may be uncomfortable removing their shoes.If you don’t want to ask guests to remove their shoes, place a mat in the entryway to catch dirt.

, Keep a towel by the door to wipe dirt off your pet's paws as soon as they get in. This prevents them trampling dirt into the carpet.


While many pets will not like this, some may eventually learn that they shouldn't come into the house before you have cleaned off their paws."
"
Clean using the hot-water extraction method.,
Select a reputable professional.,
Rent a steam cleaner and do it yourself.",How to Clean White Carpet3," While you can do a lot to prevent your white carpet getting dirty, it is recommended that you get your carpet more thoroughly cleaned by professionals every 12 to 18 months.This method, also known as steam cleaning, involves pre-spraying the carpet with soap, then applying a fine spray of hot water to rinse the soap. Finally, the waste water should be extracted so that no soapy film remains on the carpet.It is also beneficial for health reasons as the hot temperatures kill any mould, bacteria and pollutants stuck in the soft surface of the carpet. As many as one hundred times more pollutants are found indoors than outdoors., There are lots of businesses offering to clean carpets, but make sure to select one with insurance (in case something happens to your carpet during cleaning) and a valid certification.


Ensure that the company has the necessary qualifications from the IICRC (Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification). You can find further information on their website.Get multiple quotes from different companies and beware of ""discount"" carpet cleaners., Professionals will likely do a more thorough job but they can be expensive. You can rent a steam cleaner from a hardware store and give it a go yourself.


Vacuum before you begin to get the top layer of dirt off as steam-cleaners are designed to wash the carpet and get at ground in dirt.Remove furniture and pick up all items lying around the floor.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific device you are using.
Most carpet steam cleaners lay the water down when you push the machine forward and extract it when you pull back.
If this is the case, be sure to slowly pull the machine over the carpet to extract as much water as possible.
Excess water left behind may soak the carpet padding and cause mould or mildew issues.Use in the summer months when you can keep windows open for ventilation and to speed up drying.

Strike the metal and listen to the sound.,
Look for stamped codes.,
Check how hard the metal is.",How to Tell Brass from Copper2," Since copper is quite soft, it should produce a muted, round sound.A test way back in 1867 described copper's sound as ""dead,"" while brass emitted a ""clear ringing note.""This might be tough to judge without experience, but learning it could prove useful for an antiquing or scrap collection hobby.


This works best for thick, solid metal objects.

, Brass objects made for industrial purposes often have a code stamped on them to identify the exact alloy. In both the North American and European systems, the codes for brass begin with a C and are followed by several numbers. Copper is often left unlabeled, but if you want to be sure, double check the code with this quick guide:


The UNS system in North America uses brass labels beginning with C2, C3, or C4, or fall between C83300 and C89999. Copper, if labeled, can use codes from C10100 to C15999, and C80000–C81399.The last two digits are often dropped.
In the current European system, both copper and brass begin with C. Brass ends with the letter L, M, N, P, or R, while copper ends with A, B, C, or D.Older brass may not conform to these systems. Some older European standards (which were used quite recently) list the element symbols followed by a percentage. Anything that contains ""Cu"" and ""Zn"" is considered brass.

, This test is usually not too helpful, since brass is only slightly harder than copper.Some types of treated copper are particularly soft, so you may be able to scratch them with a US penny (which is never true of brass).However, in many cases there is no convenient object that will scratch one object but not the other.


Copper is easier to bend than brass as well, but it's difficult to draw exact conclusions from that test (especially without damaging the object).

Use your fingers to hold the zipper by the pull and tug up and down. Try using needle nose pliers to hold the zipper by the slider or “car” and try to move that up and down.


Don't be too rough with it so that the zipper doesn’t break or get off track.;
, If the zipper is stuck, try rubbing it with beeswax or a block of paraffin wax before cleaning it. You can find such items at health stores, hardware stores, and some supermarkets.If you’re outdoors without access to additional supplies, try using a bar of soap or candle wax to loosen the zipper, if you have one of those on hand.

, Sometimes salt will dissolve in freshwater. Wash the zipper under a tap or hose. Alternately, you can use a bucket of warm water.Try using a small wire brush to scrub the zipper with water. Make sure that the brush is small enough or positioned so that the brush does not damage the material the zipper is attached to.

, Use a non-detergent soap solution in a bucket of warm water. Use a stiff brush to scrub the zipper.Make a fresh soapy water solution by adding five tablespoons of soap powder to 20 liters of water. Stir it in a bucket until it’s sudsy. Dispose of any leftover solution once finished."

Shake several times to get as much tissue removed as possible.Use a fabric brush to dislodge any pieces that are still stuck to your clothes.;
, Sweep up all the bits that fall on the floor and dispose of them. This can get rid of the initial easy-to-remove pieces. Collect the pieces off the ground if doing this outside. Many tissues are dyed and the chemicals should not be allowed to leach out into the environment., The lint collector will remove most, if not all, of the tissue pieces for you.

Wash and dry the clothing.,
Apply strips of Scotch or masking tape to the fabric.,
Use a lint roller.",How to Remove Glitter from Your Clothes1," You don’t have to do this first, but if you’re dealing with a significant amount of glitter, you probably should – otherwise you may find yourself going through a lot of tape or lint roller sheets. Run the glittery clothing through your typical washing and drying cycle. Make sure you wash these items by themselves. Adding other items into the same load with them will transfer the glitter to those garments, as well.;
, Lay the clothing out flat on a hard surface. Pull a large piece of tape off the tape roll. Place the tape strip, sticky side down, directly onto the fabric. Press down firmly. Then pull the tape up from the fabric. The glitter will stick to the tape. Repeat this as many times as necessary to remove all the glitter.After using a single piece of tape several times, the sticky side will start to lose its adhesive properties. Throw it away and start with a new piece.
Avoid using duct tape, which will not work as well as Scotch or masking tape and may damage some fabrics.

, Lint rollers are a little more user-friendly and work better than tape strips on large surface areas. Remove the outer wrapping from the roller to expose the sticky surface. Roll it up and down over the fabric. After you make several passes, the adhesive properties will lessen. Pull the sticky sheet from the roller along the perforated line, which will reveal a fresh sticky side. Make as many passes as it takes to remove the glitter from the clothing.


For stubborn glitter, use the roller vertically, then go across the same area with horizontal motions.
Lint rollers can be purchased at any grocery store. They are usually found on the same as aisle as laundry detergent and other related laundry items.

Buy a lint roller.,
Roll the lint roller over your black clothing.,
Store the lint roller in an easy to find place.",How to Remove Lint from Black Pants1," You can remove lint effectively from black clothing by using a lint roller. A lint roller is a product designed to remove lint by running a sticky paper or adhesive pad over the clothing. You can find a lint roller at your local drugstore or online.You may decide to buy a large lint roller that will cover a large surface area of your clothing so you can remove a lot of lint at once. You may also invest in smaller lint rollers that you can use when you are on the go to remove any small patches of lint you notice on your clothing.;
, Once you have purchased a lint roller, you can use it on your clothing to get rid of any lint. Lay the black clothing on a flat, raised surface, such as a table. Then, roll the lint roller over the clothing in long strokes to remove the lint. Roll the lint roller over the clothing in sections so you can remove all the lint on the clothing.

Assess your label.,
Check for multiple tags or labels.,
Inspect the label and seam closely.,
Push the tip of the seam ripper under one stitch.,
Rip out several more stitches in a row.,
Wrap your finger around the tag to expose the stitches underneath.Your label will be loosened at this point, and you can get your seam ripper through the threads underneath it quickly and easily.,
Use tweezers to pull out any loose or remaining thread.,
Keep the label for referencing garment care information.",How to Remove Clothing Labels1," Labels are made of diverse materials and sewn into clothing in a variety of ways. You must remove them with care, or you risk accidentally tearing your clothing with the seam ripper.


Look for the best approach and point of entry to begin removal.
Make a mental note about the type of material the label is made of – is it made of soft fabric or something a little more rigid and paper-like?;
, They could be sewn into your garment side by side, or one on top of the other. If they are stacked, are they sewn in separately, or are the same stitches holding them both on?


Either way, you should start with the top tag when you begin the removal process, but now you know whether or not you’ll need to be doing additional stich removal on the second tag.

, Is the label sewn into the same seam that holds the garment together? Look closely at the threads – if you pull out the tag stitching, will it cause the seam to loosen and unravel?


If so, avoid using a seam ripper, since doing so will damage your clothing.
Instead, cut the label off close to the seam, leaving behind the stitching of the label. Don’t cut into the seam.

, Make sure the seam ripper is resting on top of the label rather than underneath it when you begin.Gently pull up and your seam ripper will cut through the thread easily.


Pulling the top stitches out first lessens the chance of an accidental tear in your clothing.
You can start anywhere, but it’s generally best to begin pulling stitches at the top right corner of the label.

, Move right to left as you work and pull the stitches out consecutively. Continue this process until all of the stitching is removed.


Be sure to be very gentle as you cut through the stitches so that you won’t damage your clothing with the sharp tip of your seam ripper.
For a slightly faster removal, stop at about the halfway mark and pull the label up so you can see underneath.

, Rip through those stitches and continue alternating until all of the stitching is removed.


Make sure to cut through each stitch. Don’t cut through a few of them until the label is loosened and then attempt to pull the rest of the stitches out.

, There will probably be a few stray threads embedded in your garment after you remove the label. Carefully tweeze them out, making sure the threads are totally loose before attempting to yank them out.

, One downside to removing a label is that most of them include care instructions for that particular item. Hang on to it if you think you’ll need it in the future.


Otherwise, you can either make a mental note or write the information down and keep it in a safe place.

Wash your clothing less often.,
Allow your clothing to air dry.,
Clean lint out of your dryer before you use it.",How to Remove Lint from Black Pants3," Washing your clothes too often can lead to more lint on your clothes, as each washing causes the threads on your clothing to loosen and build up. Try to wash clothing you know is prone to lint less often. Overwashing your clothing can damage it in other ways so less washing is best.For example, you may have a black sweater that you wear with a tank top underneath. You may try wearing the sweater one to two times before you wash it.
However, if you notice you sweat when you wear it, you may need to wash it more often to get rid of the smell. You can also try hanging up your clothing to air out smells so you can wear it again without washing it.

, Putting your clothing through the dryer too often can cause it to become covered with lint. Try to hang and air dry your black clothing rather than try them in the dryer. This will minimize the amount of lint that accumulates on them., If you do use a dryer to dry your clothing, make sure you clean lint out of the machine before using it. You should check the lint trap in the dryer and empty it.You should also make sure there is no lint in any other parts of the inside of the dryer. Cleaning the lint out of the dryer will prevent your clothing from coming out of the dryer covered in lint.

Use two more pieces of hemming tape on the label (optional).,
Go tagless.Some companies have stopped sewing tags and labels into their clothing completely to create more comfortable garments for their customers.",How to Remove Clothing Labels2," Use a sharp pair of scissors for this and take care that you don’t cut into the seam of your garment. A small strip of the label will remain behind, stitched into the seam.


It’s possible that the freshly cut label may be itchy or irritating on the back of your neck. Some of the stiffer, more papery labels can cause this.
After a few washings, that edge will probably soften and no longer bother you. However, if you’re worried about this, avoid cutting the label off.

, You want it to be approximately the width of your label. You need to use iron-on, no-sew hemming tape for this. It can be obtained in any fabric store or department.

, Once it's in place, iron the tape down. Now the label is no longer hanging loose or flapping from the seam of your garment.


This will definitely help you out when you have an itchy label that can’t be removed from your garment without causing any damage.
Do not attempt this if your garment is made of a delicate fabric. The heat from the iron can damage your item.

, If you are working with a super itchy label, try completely attaching the tag to your garment with the hemming tape. Place the two pieces of hemming tape along the two remaining sides of the label. Iron down two additional pieces along the other two sides of your label.


Now your label has no loose edges and is completely fastened to your garment.
Do not attempt this if your garment is made of a delicate fabric. The heat from the iron can damage your item.

, Instead of a tag, the label information is ironed or stamped on the inside of the garment, in the general area where a tag would normally appear.


This info is only visible on the inside of a garment, and it is invisible on the outside of the garment.

Jeans also frequently feature an outside tag, generally in the form of a tiny patch that features the brand logo. These are not meant to be removed, so you will need to take extra caution when doing it, but these can be removed using this method.Another common example of an outside tag is one that you see sewn into an outside seam on a garment. Use tiny cuticle scissors to cut these off, since they are normally quite easy to get rid of.

, Make sure the seam ripper or the cuticle scissors are resting on top of the label when you begin. Gently pull up and your seam ripper will cut through the thread easily. If you’re using cuticle scissors, make a tiny snip to easily cut through the stitch.You can start anywhere, but it’s generally best to begin pulling stitches at the top right corner of the label.

, Pull them out consecutively. Be very gentle as you cut through the stitches so that you won’t damage your clothing with the sharp tip of your seam ripper or scissors.


Make sure to cut cleanly through each stitch. Don’t cut through a few of them until the label is loosened and then attempt to pull the rest of the stitches out.

, There will probably be a few stray threads embedded in your garment after you remove the label. Make sure the threads are totally loose before attempting to tweeze them out.

, Occasionally, you will have garments with outside labels that simply can’t be removed, because doing so would damage the garment or because the label is part of the garment itself. In these cases, there isn’t a lot you can do yourself, but there are a few options:


Check with a tailor or dry cleaning professional to see if they are able to do it for you.
Hiding outside labels is an option, but there is rarely a graceful way to do this. If the label is on your sleeve cuff, you can roll up your sleeves. Most outside labels on a shirt can be hidden with a jacket.
Outside labels on the back pockets of jeans can be covered with a long shirt or jacket.
Try using an iron-on patch to cover the label.

Soak the gum in the oil.,
Wipe the sticky gum area clean with an old sock or rag.,
Re-apply the cooking oil spray.",How to Remove Chewing Gum from a Dryer Drum1," It’s similar to WD-40 in that it lubricates areas and erodes sticky substances, but it’s a natural alternative. If you don’t have PAM or a spray version of a cooking oil, you can use a bottled version of canola oil. Wipe some canola oil on a cloth and rub it on the gum., Apply or spray a generous amount of oil. Then, let it sit so that the gum can absorb it. Letting it soak softens the gum and makes it easier to remove.

, If you’re not able to remove it by wiping it away, then apply a little elbow grease and scrape it off with a nylon scraper. You can even use your fingernail if you don’t mind., This is just to make sure you removed everything. Let it soak again. Scrape off any gum residue and wipe clean with a cloth. You’re done.

Spritz your clothes with water.",How to Reduce Laundry Wrinkles," Your clothes need room to move around. Stuffing too many clothes into the washer is bad for your clothes for a few reasons. If your clothes don’t have room to move around, they are more likely to come out crumpled and wrinkled. Make sure to separate colors from whites and separate fabric types to reduce the size of your laundry load.They are also more likely to come out less clean than desired.;
, This cycle is best for preventing wrinkles in your clothing. The steam cycle provides a deeper clean and can smooth out wrinkles and creases. Not every washer, however, has a steam cycle. You can create something like a steam cycle during the drying process.Clothes can shrink during this cycle. Make sure you don’t put in fabric that is likely to shrink during a steam wash.

, It is best to wash your clothes in water that is 60 degrees Fahrenheit and above. Laundry detergents are typically formulated to work in water that is 60 degrees or warmer. Water that is colder than that can decrease stain removal, and increase pilling and wrinkling. Wash your clothes in warm water to reduce and remove wrinkles.Wash your clothes in cold water if the instructions specify to do so.

, Use one cup of white, distilled vinegar into your washing machine to reduce wrinkles. Pour the cup directly into the laundry before staring the washing cycle. Before doing this, you should read your washing machine’s instruction manual to see if anything is said about the use of vinegar.Apple cider vinegar can also be used.

, Fabric softeners make your clothes softer, smell better, and they help reduce wrinkles. Add the specified amount of fabric softener to your load before you start the washer. Fabric softeners can be bought at most super markets. If you don’t want to add too many different products to your laundry, you can buy a detergent that has fabric softener in it.You can also make your own fabric softener out of ingredients like, essential oils, vinegar, salt, and hair conditioner.

, A heavy washing cycle can be too tough on clothes, especially cotton and delicate fabrics. Clothes that have been tossed around in the washer too much can can come out wrinkled and tangles. Instead, opt for the gentle cycle, or a cycle that is specifically for cottons or delicates.








Separate your denims and heavier fabrics from your lighter fabrics. Wash your lighter fabrics on a gentler cycle.

, Tangled and crumpled clothing can lead to wrinkles. First, remove the clothes from the washing machine. Then, untangle each piece of clothing. It doesn’t have to be smoothed out yet. Each piece of clothing should be able to lie flat.







, The untangled article of clothing may have some wrinkles and creases. Hold each piece of clothing from the shoulders and shake it out. Shake it until the piece of clothing appears smoother than it did before.







, The clothing may still be wet, so wring out any excess water. After you shake and wring out the article of clothing, fluff it using your hands. Then, you can put the clothing into the dryer. You can fluff your clothing by holding the shoulders of the article or clothing and shaking it a few times in an up and down motion.







, If you use a dryer, make sure not to load the dryer with too many clothes. Clothes need their space in the dryer. Stuffing in too many clothes can wrinkle and tangle them. You should wash a small load of laundry beforehand, but if the load was large, divide the load into two drying sessions.








Many dryers, especially newer models, have a wrinkle-free and permanent press setting made specifically to reduce wrinkles. Choose one of those settings when drying if it is available to you.
Hang the clothes that are waiting to go in for the second load of drying.

, This step should be done with clothes that were put on a line or hung up to dry. Check the clothes when they have been drying for a while. Take them down when they are still damp. Ironing them while they are still damp will make your clothes appear nicely pressed.







, Throwing your clothes into a pile after drying can lead to wrinkling. Fold each piece of clothing as soon as you remove them from the dryer. Put them away into their usual places to avoid the pile of folded clothing being knocked over and undone.







, If the article of clothing is not quite as smooth as you’d hoped, throw it back into the dryer with a damp washcloth. Doing this creates a steam cycle that many models of dryers do not have. Use the steam setting on the dryer if it is available to you.








Do not put clothes in the dryer that aren’t meant to be dried.

, If you can’t or don’t have time to put the clothing into the dryer, spritz the clothes with water. Spritz the clothing lightly with a water bottle. Then, smooth it out with your hands until the wrinkles are gone.








You can also purchase wrinkle reducing sprays to use on your clothing instead of water. You can buy wrinkle releasing sprays from big brands, like Downy, or make your own from a cup of distilled water and a cup of vinegar."

Spray distilled water on your clothes after they come out of the dryer.",How to Prevent Static in Laundry1," Simply pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup of white vinegar to the laundry load during the rinse cycle and your clothes should come out clean and static free. This is an especially good choice for cotton clothing or sheets, but it doesn’t do as well with fleece or polyester.The vinegar will also keep soap residue off the clothes as they’re rinsed.;
, A popular product known as Static Guard is one such product which can eliminate static charge in clothes after they dry. Sprays contain special compounds which discharge static electricity in clothes. They can be applied to freshly cleaned clothes to make them static-free. Simply point the nozzle at the article of clothing in question and squeeze the top. A mist of aerosolized liquid will eject from the can.


If you don't want to purchase a spray, you can create one at home by mixing fabric softener and water in a spray bottle. Approximately one bottle cap of fabric softener mixed into a standard-size spray bottle will create an effective homemade substitute for Static Guard and similar products., Fabric softeners are liquid concoctions of chemicals used to make fabric softer. They impart a pleasant odor to your clothes and are capable of preventing static cling in laundry as well. Popular brands include Downy, Bounce, and Snuggle. Each softener has directions on the back of the container. Generally, you must pour them into your washing machine during the rinse cycle, then allow the cycle to run as normal.Check your washing machine for a built-in fabric softener dispenser. If it has one, pour the fabric softener into it so that the fabric softener will be automatically dispensed into the washing machine at the right time. If there’s no such dispenser, you can simply add the liquid to the washing machine itself after adding the clothes.
You can also purchase laundry detergent with fabric softener added to it. This type of detergent provides the same results that a fabric softener does, without adding the extra step of having to manually pour fabric softener into your machine.

, Spraying a fine mist of distilled water across the surface of the clothes as they come out of the dryer will prevent them from being too dry and sticking to each other or other surfaces, which can lead to the buildup of static charge. Fill a standard size spray bottle with distilled water and give the handle one good pump across the surface of your clothes from a distance of approximately two feet.

Wear clothes more than once before washing.,
Spot clean stains as soon as you notice them.,
Shower before bed.,
Wear an apron while performing housework or cooking.,
Change out of dress clothes once you get home to reduce laundry and dry-cleaning.",How to Reduce Laundry," It requires a similar amount of energy to wash a small to medium sized load as a larger load, and multiple small loads create more work for you than a single full load.;
,


Hang towels on towel bars or hooks immediately after use.
Put your towels in the dryer briefly after each use to keep them feeling fresh and fluffy while reducing laundry.
Wash towels once a week.

,


Check clothes for stains or dirt before throwing them in the laundry basket. If you did not perform any strenuous activities and the clothes are not dirty, wear them again before washing. This will extend the life of your clothes as well as reduce laundry as the fibers will gradually break down through repeated washing and drying.
Hang up clothes immediately after you take them off if you can wear them again. Certain items of clothing, especially outer layers such as cardigans, sweaters or suit jackets may not get very dirty, but you may need to wash or dry clean them frequently because they become wrinkly.

, Use a detergent stick if you are on the go, or you can choose to use a little bit of liquid detergent to remove the stain before it sets. Gently rub in the detergent, rinse with warm water, and pat the material dry.

, Washing before you sleep will reduce the amount of dirt and oils that you leave on your sheets. This will allow you to wash your sheets and bed linens less frequently.

, An apron can protect your clothing from dirt, cleaning products and kitchen messes. Wash 1 to 2 times per week depending on how soiled the apron becomes.

, For example, if you have certain outfits that you designate as ""church clothes,"" wear a formal outfit to church and change into a casual outfit once you get home. Since you will only be wearing your formal outfits for a few hours at a time, you can wash them much less frequently.

Rub an ice cube over the chewing gum.,
Scrape off the chewing gum with a spatula or plastic knife.,
Wipe the inside of the dryer with vinegar.",How to Remove Chewing Gum from a Dryer Drum2," Put an ice cube in a ziplock bag and rub it over the gum. Or, if you prefer, hold it in your hands. Continue to rub the gum over the ice until it hardens., Apply only the necessary pressure because if you scrape too hard, you could damage the surface of the dryer. This is also the reason why a plastic knife is preferred over a metal knife; the metal knife will scrape the finish off.

, Moisten a rag with some water, and then add some white vinegar. Rub it over the remnants of the gum to remove any traces of it. But if you find that there is still gum that needs removing, then repeat steps one and two."

The exact amount of water to apply will vary depending on the type of the detergent.
This is a good method to use if the ice cube method does not completely remove the gum residue. However, you’ll need to let the gum warm back up to room temperature before trying this method though.

, Apply the mixture to a clean rag. Then, rub the paste on the gum area in the dryer. Continue scrubbing the gum with the paste until it is completely removed.

, Simply wet a clean rag and wipe down the inside of the dryer drum. Make sure to wipe down the entire drum so that all the paste is gone. You don’t want the detergent to dry up and clump inside of your dryer.

, Don’t do this with your clean clothes though. Dampen some old rags and put them in the dryer. Then, run a cycle. This will help to remove any remaining gum residue and make sure that none ends up on your clothes.

They should stick to the gum area. But if they don’t, you’ll have to hold the dryer sheet on the affected areas., So, if you are holding the drying sheets, you’ll have to hold them on the area for 15 minutes. Holding them on the area gives them time to loosen the gum. Eventually, you should see the gum sticking to the dryer sheet, and in extreme cases you may need to hold it there for longer than 15 minutes.

, Once the gum residue starts to loosen, use the dryer sheet to wipe the gum off. Rub and scrub, if necessary, with the dryer sheet until the gum is completely removed.Then, wipe the drum down with a wet rag.

This should be the last resort if the other methods don't work, since it involves introducing chemicals that could potentially rub off on your clothes.

, You can continue to use the rag that you applied the Goo Gone to remove the gum. Rub, wipe and scrub the area until the gum comes off. If necessary, apply a little more WD-40 or Goo Gone and continue to rub if it’s not coming off as easily as you’d like.

, Wet a rag and apply dish detergent to it. Then, wipe down the dryer and make sure to wipe off all traces of WD-40 or Goo Gone completely. Allow the dryer to air out before you use it again.

, To make sure that all traces of the WD-40 and the GooGone have been removed, wet some rags, put them in the dryer and run a cycle. Now, the next time that you dry your clothes, you can be fairly certain that no cleaning chemicals will end up on your clothes.

Line-dry your clothes.,
Separate clothes by material.,
Use a humidifier.A damp environment prevents clothes from sticking to each other as much as they do when they are very dry.,
Limit the amount of time your clothes spend in the dryer.",How to Prevent Static in Laundry2," Air-drying can prevent static cling altogether. If you have to use a dryer, take your clothes out of it as soon as they are sufficiently dry or while they are still slightly damp. Over-drying your clothes can lead to static cling.


Static electricity is a product of friction between two electrically insulating materials. The ideal environment for static electricity to emerge is one in which conditions are dry with little humidity. In other words, the dryer is the ideal place for static energy to emerge., Some materials are morel likely to build up static electricity than others.Synthetic materials like polyester, nylon, rayon, and acetate tend to develop high levels of static cling after washing. Natural fabrics like cotton, wool, linen, and silk, on the other hand, tend to stay relatively static-free. Washing and drying natural and synthetic fibers in the same cycles can result in static cling on all your clothes, so it’s a good idea to wash them separately.


Alternately, you could choose to dry the natural materials in the machine and dry the synthetic materials on the line., While letting your clothes dry on the rack or on the line, run a humidifier. A humid atmosphere makes the air more conductive than the clothes for the buildup of static charges, which essentially makes the clothes a less attractive target. Running a humidifier during especially dry seasons like winter will also prevent buildup of static electricity on your clothes and body.


A drying rack is a small rack of wood or plastic with several parallel rungs upon which clothing can be set to dry.

, Instead of letting them run the full hour-long cycle, let them run only 45 minutes. Remove them and hang them on hangers or a washing line to dry the rest of the way. You’ll save money by running the machine for a shorter period and reduce your carbon footprint in addition to limiting the static cling of your clothes.

Place a dryer sheet in your dryer.,
Attach some safety pins to your clothes before putting them in the dryer.,
Consider using dryer balls.,
Use an aluminum foil ball.,
Wash your laundry with soap nuts.",How to Prevent Static in Laundry3," Dryer sheets contain positively-charged ingredients which are released only when in the presence of static electricity. Their presence ensures electrical charges will be neutralized. To use dryer sheets, simply place one (or two for large loads) on top of wet clothes in the dryer before running it.


Dryer sheets do more than just remove static. They also lend a pleasant, fresh fragrance your laundry.
You can also use laundry sheets to “wipe away” static after your clothes come out of the dryer. You can rub them on your clothes after you’ve dressed if you’re still experiencing static cling., Adding two safety pins to a sock will channel the static electricity into the pins. Think of them as a lightning rod for static charges in the dryer.Attach the safety pins to the sock when the clothes are wet and being transferred from the washer to the dryer.


A similar method which operates on the same principle is to rub a metal hanger across the surface of each item of clothing after removing it from the dryer. While this is time consuming, it will effectively discharge static charges which accumulate during the drying cycle.

, These are small balls of foil, plastic, or wool which, when placed in a dryer with your clothes, reduce static cling. Since static develops from the friction of clothes rubbing against each other, adding an object like a dryer ball to the mix can add a layer between clothes which prevents them from accumulating the electrical charge which causes static. Other benefits of dryer balls include keeping your clothes separated and fluffy.


You could, instead of using a commercial or homemade dryer ball, use a tennis ball or even some clean, soft sneakers., While similar to the dryer ball, the aluminum foil ball actually works on a different principle, and causes the static to accumulate in the aluminum foil ball, not in the clothes. Using regular aluminum foil of the variety commonly found in kitchens, cut about three or four square feet of aluminum. Crunch it loosely into a rough ball, then smooth it in your hands by rolling it between your palms until it becomes rounded. Each should be two to three inches across when finished. Toss three or four balls in the dryer along with your clothes., Soap nuts are a type of berry which possesses anti-static properties. To use soap nuts, drop a handful (5-6) in a muslin bag. Tie it off and drop it into the regular laundry load before starting the washing machine.


When using soap nuts, you can eliminate or reduce the volume of detergent used since the soap nuts (as their name suggests) also act as an effective laundry soap in addition to being an excellent static eliminator. Be sure to use them with hot water for best results."

, You should hand wash your garment if the label contains a washing symbol with a hand in it. You should not put items with this symbol in the washing machine, as the fabric may be too delicate.Generally, you should not hand wash items at a temperature higher than 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).

, Do not wash your garment if it contains the washing symbol with an X through it. This goes for both machine washing and hand washing. Instead, take the garment to the dry cleaner to ensure the fabric is cleaned appropriately., Though the triangle doesn’t really resemble a bottle of bleach, try to remember that it represents one. You may bleach as needed, using either chlorine or oxygen-based bleach on the garment., Use non-chlorine bleach only if the symbol of a triangle has diagonal lines in it. Chlorine bleach leaches dye out of fabrics, so it is typically only used for white fabric. Non-chlorine bleach is oxygen based and shouldn’t stain or ruin your clothes., That goes for both chlorine and oxygen-based bleach.

You can iron as usual, without any special considerations.If this symbol contains one dot, iron at a low temperature.If this symbol contains two dots, iron at a medium temperature.If this symbol contains three dots, iron at a high temperature., Do not iron with steam if the garment contains a label with a symbol of an iron with an X over lines coming out of the bottom. Think of the lines coming out of the iron as steam or water to help you remember the symbol. Use only dry heat, as the steam may damage or ruin the fabric., Do not iron the garment if the label contains a symbol of an iron with an X through it. If the item has wrinkles, tumble-dry it if the label allows. You could also hang it in the bathroom while taking a steamy shower, which will help the wrinkles disappear., Take the garment to the dry cleaner rather than washing or drying it at home. Usually, fabrics with this symbol cannot get wet. Water as well as high heat could damage or ruin the fabric., Dry clean with a particular solvent if the label contains a circle with a letter in it. The letter tells the dry cleaner which solvent to use for this particular fabric. The letter A means any solvent can be used, the letter F means only a petroleum solvent may be used, and the letter P means any solvent except trichloroethylene may be used., This means the item cannot be dry cleaned. Check the label to see if you can wash and dry the garment at home."

Rest garments between wears.,
Don’t carry backpacks.,
Don’t carry purses on your shoulder.,
Limit friction.,
Don’t rub stains.,
Keep fabrics away from Velcro.",How to Prevent Pilling1," Excessive wear can cause pilling, especially if the garment doesn’t have time to rest in between. To prevent this from happening, give clothes at least 24 hours to rest and return to their original shapes before putting them on again. This includes sweaters, shirts, pajamas, and other garments.


Wearing garments too often can cause pilling because when you wear an article of clothing, the fibers tend to stretch. This can cause the shorter threads in the yarns to come loose, and then they tangle and pill.;
, Backpacks cause pilling because they cause friction when you move. Anywhere that the backpack has contact with your clothes or body is likely to pill, such as the back, shoulders, and under the arms.Instead of a backpack, use a handbag that you can carry, a suitcase, or a wheeled carry-on bag.

, Purses can also cause friction and pilling, especially in the shoulder area. When you carry a purse, carry it in your hand instead of on your shoulder if you're worried about pilling.


Over-the-shoulder bags, messenger bags, and other accessories that you wear against your body can all cause pilling too., Fabrics that tend to pill should never be rubbed against each other, other fabrics, or other materials. There are a number of actions that can cause rubbing and friction, and all of them should be avoided, including:


Resting elbows against a table when you're working or eating
Sliding around on the floor (can cause pilling on socks or the seat of your pants)
Crawling on your knees when you're wearing pants
Sitting on rough surfaces

, Many times, the first reaction upon finding a stain is to squirt some stain remover on it and rub the fabric together until the stain disappears. But this is another instance of rubbing that can cause pilling, and it should be avoided.To treat stains on fabrics that pill, place the stained fabric on top of an old towel or clean rag. Apply a stain remover of your choice, and then blot the area with a clean towel. The stain will transfer to the towel below without causing friction.

, Velcro is very sticky, and it can attach itself to the yarns in clothes and other fabrics. When this happens, the Velcro can pull shorter threads loose, and then they're at risk of pilling.If you have clothes with Velcro on them, always keep the Velcro tabs closed, especially when you wash the garment.

Finished.

",How to Fit Wall Tiles," To prepare the walls, repair any large holes with plaster filler and brush on a coat of plaster stabilizing solution if the surface is powdery.;
, To help you work out where to place your tiles, make a tiling gauge from a piece of straight wooden batten. Use this to estimate how many tiles you’ll need – starting at the top of the skirting board, move the batten up the wall one tile width at a time.


If a narrow strip is left at the top, move the bottom row up by half a tile width to give an even finish.
Mark out the horizontal rows with pencil – be sure to use a spirit level to ensure they’re horizontal.
Tack the batten along first pencil line so that the tiles can be positioned against it.
Do the same to identify where to place the vertical lines – start at a corner and use a plumb line to fix the position accurately.

, Spread the adhesive/grout over about half a square metre of the wall, starting in the corner made by the two battens. Use the notched side of the spreader to form even ribbons of adhesive.

,, Press spacers into each corner and hold a spirit level across the tiles to see if they form a flat surface. Continue to tile, working on about a square metre at a time until you have fixed all the whole tiles.

, Leave to dry fully before removing the timber battens. Cut the tiles to fit into any gaps. For hard ceramic tiles, the glazed surface must be scored and the tile broken along this line. Tile cutting jigs are inexpensive and are much easier to use than freehand tile cutters. Use a saw tile to cut a tile to fit around an awkward shape such as a pipe or architrave.

, Check that all the spacers are removed and wipe off all tile adhesive from the tiles before starting the grout work. Select a grout colour that matches the tiles (it can be a slightly different colour) and mix as instructed by the manufacturer. Smooth the grout into all the gaps around the tiles. Wipe off excess using a damp cloth. Leave to dry completely before showering or bathing.

Turn items inside out before washing.,
Hand wash pill-prone items.,
Use liquid detergent with enzymes.,
Use the delicate cycle.,
Hang laundry to dry.,
Use a low heat setting if you have to use the dryer.",How to Prevent Pilling2," The swishing motion inside a washing machine causes garments and fabrics to rub against each other, and this leads to pilling. To prevent unsightly pilling on the outside of garments, turn them inside out before throwing them into the washing machine and before handwashing.Pills may still form if the garments are inside out, but they will be on the inside of the garment, so they won’t be visible.
To prevent pilling on the inside and outside of the garment, place pill-prone items into a garment bag before washing.

, An alternative to the delicate cycle is hand washing, which may be best for items that are very pill-prone.Wash items one at a time. To hand wash clothes and other materials:


Fill a sink or bucket with water that’s the right temperature for the fabric
Add detergent and agitate the water to create suds
Soak the item for at least five minutes
Swish the item around in the water, but do not rub the material together
Remove the item from the sink and squeeze out excess water

, Enzyme-based cleaners and detergents break down organic matter such as grass and blood stains, and they also break down proteins and sugars found in natural fibers. When you wash clothes in these detergents, the enzymes dissolve the small weak fibers that pills might form on.


When looking for enzyme detergents, look for ingredients like cellulase, amylase, pectinase, and protease, which break down sugars and carbohydrates, proteins, and other molecules.Powder detergents can be abrasive. Liquid detergents will cause less rubbing, and reduce pilling that occurs in the wash., The delicate or hand wash cycle on a washing machine will create less rubbing, and this will help to prevent pills. The delicate cycle uses less agitation and a slower spin cycle, both of which mean less friction in the wash., The dryer is another place where clothes and fabrics tumble around rubbing against each other, so drying clothes in the dryer can cause pilling as well. Instead, hang clothes, bedsheets, and other laundry items to air dry.During the warmer months, hang clothes on an outdoor line for the fastest drying time.
In winter, you can hang clothes to dry inside, but keep a window slightly open and the room well ventilated to avoid moisture buildup in the air.

, Sometimes it’s necessary to tumble dry pill-prone items. When you find yourself in that situation, set the dryer to a lower heat setting. This will prevent shrinking and minimize stress on the fibers.


Remove items as soon as they're dry to reduce the amount of friction the items are exposed to."
"
Steer clear of the worst offenders.,
Opt for fabrics with tight weaves.,
Choose fabrics with higher thread counts.",How to Prevent Pilling3," Any fabric can pill, but there are some fabrics that are more prone to developing pills than others. If you find you're often battling with pilled garments, avoid fabrics that pill the most:


Synthetic materials tend to pill more often than those made from natural fibers. Synthetics that are known to pill include polyester, acrylic, and nylon.Blended materials that are made of both synthetic and natural fibers are also prone to pilling.
Wool is one of the natural fibers that is known to pill.

, The looser the weave or knit of a fabric, the more prone it will be to pilling. This is because loose fibers will move around more and rub against each other, leading to pilling. Loose-knit fabrics tend to be more pill-prone, while tightly woven fabrics will have the lease trouble with pills.The harder it is to see through a fabric, the tighter the weave is.
Denim, for instance, has a very tight weave, and almost never pills., Some fabric items, such as bed sheets, is measured by thread count. Typically, the higher the thread count the better the quality, and the longer the threads will be. Longer threads mean less pilling, because there aren't any short threads to come loose, get tangled, and form pills.


While garments aren't usually graded by thread count, the same holds true for higher-quality clothes with longer threads.

Ask if the installer has a current project underway that you can stop by to see the quality of the work.

, You should do this even if you have a referral, just to compare pricing. Ask the following questions during this meeting:


How much tile should you order?
How soon can the work be done?
How many days will the project take?
How many workers will be on the project?
Can you get a copy of their insurance certificate?

, Do it on the floor or another hard surface to make sure your fold is neat. Lay them out flat and smooth out any crease or folds so that you can easily fold them neatly.

, Bring one leg over the other to fold them in half. Make sure the fold is right down the middle over the seam at the crotch of the pants. Straighten the legs to remove any creases at this time.


If you're folding dress pants that have a crease or pleat down the middle, fold the pants in half along the crotch so that the crease is preserved.

, Bring the cuffs up to the waist. Again, straighten the pants so that no creases make it into the fold. Run your hands over the fabric to make sure the folds are nice and flat.

, Bring the edges of the pants, the waist and the cuffs, down to meet the bottom of the fold. Your pants are now ready to pack. When you fold pants in half this way, you will end up with a crease across the knees, and other across the thighs. Strategically placing a crease there is better than having lots of wrinkles, but looking perfectly neat is of utmost importance, you might have to iron them."

Fold a washcloth into quarters.,
Fold a hand towel in half.,
Fold a bath towel into thirds or quarters.,
Rolls towels for storage purposes.",How to Fold Towels1," Washcloths are usually folded into quarters, by folding them in half one way and then into half the other way. They usually go unfolded or only folded in half if they are going to be hung up.;
, Hand towels are usually hung up, and so they are only folded in half lengthwise. If you do not want the side seams to show, fold the long sides in so that they meet at the center and place the nice side facing outwards.

, It is best to fold bath towels as little as possible, so that they can properly dry (this will reduce the mold smell). If bath towels will be lain flat, such as on a shelf, they are usually folded into quarters, to preserve space. If they are going to be hung, they should generally be folded in half or into thirds.

, If you're wanting to store towels in a linen closet or suitcase, your best best is to roll them. This takes up the least amount of space. Simply start at one end and roll tightly all the way to the other.

Place items in a dry cleaner bag to prevent wrinkling.",How to Pack Pants3," If you’re concerned about damaging pants, or you need to show up to your destination and wear them without time to iron them, use a suit bag that will allow you to pack them vertically without folding them in half. This is the best way to keep your pants wrinkle-free.


Affix the pants to a pants hanger that won't damage the fabric. Some pants hangers require folding the pants in half at the knee and draping them over the top of the hanger.
Store them neatly in your suit bag, making sure they’re completely straight so they'll remain wrinkle-free.

, If you end up with a few pairs of rolled pants, pack these casual items below items that need to stay wrinkle-free. Tuck them in toward the bottom of the suitcase since it doesn't matter as much if they get a little crushed.

, This way they won’t get crushed and wrinkled as you travel. Lay them over the top of the other items you've packed when your suitcase is mostly full. Don’t pack shoes or other heavy items on top of your folded pants., This extra layer of protection will keep them from shifting in transit. It's a good way to keep freshly-ironed pants from picking up a lot of little creases while they're in the suitcase.

, Focus on areas with particularly strong buildup. Make sure to coat the steam vents as well. Don’t lay the paste on too thick, just enough to evenly coat the soleplate.








, Don’t hesitate to scrub at more tenacious spots. Wipe until no paste remains and the grimy buildups have been removed.








, Dip a cotton swab into water and insert it into the steam holes. Scrub to remove mineral deposits and the baking soda paste.








After cleaning the steam vents, bring the iron to your sink. Pour out any water that may have entered the steam holes.

, Make sure to scrub the steam vents as well, as these are a typical spot for buildups. You can also wipe the rest of the iron to deal with any grime.








This kind of gentle cleaning is ideal for Teflon-coated soleplates which, just like Teflon-coated cookware, keep substances from sticking but are very vulnerable to scratches.

, Wipe until all traces of the soap are gone. Place the iron upright on a counter or table and let it dry; you can place a towel under the iron to catch any dripping water.








, Make sure you use white toothpaste rather than gel; the former has a foaming effect that the latter lacks. Use an amount no larger than a quarter.







, Pay particular attention to the steam vents, as various kinds of residue tend to build up there.If your iron’s soleplate is particularly dirty, you can also use a kitchen sponge or scrubber to dislodge the grime. Avoid using a metal scrubber, as this will scratch the soleplate.








, Rub thoroughly to ensure that none of the toothpaste remains. Otherwise you might stain your clothes when trying to use your iron.








, Make sure to use a cloth you’re not too attached to, as some tenacious residues may end up staining it. Turn the iron to its highest setting and iron for a few minutes; the clean water will flush out any toothpaste that might have been rubbed into the steam vents.

, Use the iron’s high heat setting. Let the iron steam until the vinegar has completely evaporated. This should take between 5 and 10 minutes.









Alternatively, you can lay a piece of cloth on an ironing board and iron it until the reservoir empties. You’ll then be able to see all the filth removed from the iron.
Make sure you use cloth you’re fine with throwing out. It will likely get stained and marked from this process.

, Make sure you fill the reservoir completely, and turn on the iron. Let it steam until the reservoir is empty. This will simultaneously remove any remaining gunk in the steam vents and clear the iron of any leftover vinegar.








After steaming, make sure to wipe the soleplate with a rag to clean off any remaining residue.

, Dip a cotton swab into a solution that’s equal parts vinegar and water. Rub the cotton swab over and in each steam vent in turn. This will remove more resilient buildups.

Buy wrinkle-free clothes.,
Divide the ironing chores.,
Invest in a garment steamer.,
A last ditch option.",How to Avoid or Lessen Your Ironing," This cycle was invented to reduce the creasing of clothes and other items.;
, Don't jam the clothes into your washing machine. They need room to spin around; the closer the clothes are compacted during the washing cycle, the more they are likely to come out creased, squashed and probably inadequately cleaned.

, Don't mix heavy and light clothing and fabrics. The heavy ones will press onto the light ones and crease them. So keep dainty blouses away from denim overalls.

, Taking away all the moisture encourages wrinkling. Stop the dryer cycle a little earlier if necessary and bring clothes in from outside while they are still slightly damp. Or, if your dryer has a permanent-press option, use it because it is injecting a cooler air flow through the clothing towards the end of the cycle, thus cooling down the clothes and reducing the possibility of wrinkles.

, Don't overload your dryer, leave it about 1/3 to 1/4 empty. This will result in evenly dried clothing, as well as less wrinkling.

, If you use a dryer, fold clothes as soon as the cycle ends, while the clothes are still warm. This is a neat trick that will act almost like the warmth of an iron in preventing creases. Even if you only fold them into the clothes basket for ironing later, this will massively reduce the time spent ironing as creases will be few and far between.

, Whether you dry using a clothesline, a dryer, or a line in your laundry, use plastic hangers to hang the wet clothes up. Give the clothes a good shake first to remove water and budding wrinkles. Hanging allows the wrinkles to drop out and reduces the need for a thorough iron should you still have to iron the item.

, There are some things that really do not need to be ironed unless you're a fanatic. Think of which things you don't really mind un-ironed: underpants, socks, sheets (you can still do the pillowcases if you must for show), bras, throw rugs, etc.

, Nowadays many different fabrics are wrinkle-free. However, be careful of what method makes the clothing wrinkle-free - avoid those that are chemically treated.

, Each person in a household should be responsible for ironing his or her own clothes after the age of twelve. This lessens the load on the chief ironer and is a fair approach to household chores. It also teaches non-ironing spouses, partners and children about self-responsibility and they soon learn how to lessen the load!

, A trick of the trade among fashion retailers, steamers give a clean, crisp look in about a quarter of the time with no damage to any fabric what-so-ever. A cheaper alternative is to use a plant mister to spray any wrinkled areas you find with water, and hang the clothing until it is dry.

, Give your clothes a very brief run through the shower, put on hangers, shake well and hang until dry (useful while traveling).

Reflect heat onto the fabric you are ironing with a metallic cover.,
Ensure your item stays in place with a non-slip ironing board cover.,
Use natural unbleached cotton ironing board covers for everyday ironing.,
Choose a cover with a heavy felt lining.,
Get rid of any old ironing board covers which may be made with asbestos.,
Measure the width of your ironing board.,
Find the length of your ironing board.,
Determine the shape of the nose of your ironing board.,
Take your measurements to the store when you shop for a cover.,
Attach the cover to your ironing board with a drawstring.,
Slip the cover over your board easily with elastic edging.,
Choose a cover which meets your aesthetic.",How to Choose the Right Ironing Board Cover," Metallic covers are made of fabric, but the exposed surface is woven with copper. This allows the heat of the iron to be reflected back into the fabric you are ironing as opposed to the heat being absorbed by both the fabric of your garment and the fabric of the ironing board cover.Reflecting the heat back onto your garment will speed up your ironing process. It can also be an energy saver as more heat is created using less electricity and time.;
, The non-slip cover is especially useful for sewing and quilting projects. Making sure that your project stays in place on the board can be essential to creating straight seams., This is also a practical option for sewing and quilting. Your clothes and fabrics will stay put and not slide around or off of your ironing board. These are usually a thicker material like canvas or duck cloth, very durable and washable.Cotton will scorch if you get your iron too hot or lay it down on the surface for a long period of time. Although scorch marks on your cover will not damage your clothes, they do not look nice and are almost impossible to wash out.
Some manufacturers have designed their heavy duty cotton covers with a steam repellent layer underneath the cover to give you the best of both styles - no slip surface, with reflected heat for ease of ironing.

, Some ironing board covers are lined with a foam pad. The foam pad often loses its shape or becomes damaged easily. Felt lining is more durable and will maintain its shape.Be sure that the lining is thick enough to create a buffer between your garment and the perforated ironing board so that the mesh of the board does not transfer to your garment. Most pads are between four and eight millimeters thick.
If you find the perfect cover, but do not like the padding, you can always add your own. Fabric stores sell upholstery foam and felt by the yard. You can cut this to fit on top of your board, then place your cover on top.
Some people keep the old cover as padding and place the new one on top.
Felt is an organic material and does not contain the chemicals which may be used in foam padding.

, Asbestos was widely used up until the 1960s. It was considered a miracle material in that it was fire-resistant and durable. For this reason, white chrysotile, a form of asbestos, was commonly used in the production of ironing board covers. Since the 60s, though, the dangers of exposure to asbestos and its link to disease, has made asbestos obsolete and dangerous.If you are using a cover made after 1960, it likely does not contain asbestos.
If you are disposing of asbestos, you should contact your local council for instructions on specified disposal sites for hazardous materials.

, Using a measuring tape, measure the width of your ironing board. Be sure to measure the board at it’s widest point, which should be near the middle of the board.Only measure the top of the board. Do not wrap your measuring tape around the sides of the board.

, Measure the board from nose to tail using a measuring tape. Do not include any accessories like an iron rest plate when you are measuring the length of your board.Knowing the length of your board is going to be the most helpful. Some covers can fit various widths using elastic or drawstrings, but the cover must reach both ends of the board.

, Different ironing boards are created with a variety of noses for different purposes. You will want to know whether your board has a rounded, tapered, or blunt nose in order to find a cover with the correct fit.

, Many covers come in a standard size which fits most ironing boards, but it is helpful to have your measurements handy to be sure your cover fits your board. This is especially useful for ironing boards which are an odd shape or size.The size of the cover should be listed on the packaging. Match the size listed to your measurements.

, If you have measured the board correctly and found a perfect fitting cover, it should fit snug on your board and not pucker. Some covers will also come with a drawstring to assist in cinching the cover perfectly to your board.Drawstrings can be easier to use than an elastic cover if you have an iron rest attached to you ironing board. The drawstrings can be worked between the board and the iron rest more easily than elastic edging.

, As opposed to drawstrings, which tie and hang off the bottom of the board, some covers are made with an elastic band around the edge. This ensures that the cover fits snug, while keeping the edges neat and clean.If you have an iron rest, remove the iron rest before slipping the cover on, then reattach the iron rest with the cover in place.

, Many cotton ironing board covers are coming in a variety of colors and design. This may appeal to you, especially if you use your ironing board regularly and leave it set up.Some people find the designs distracting. They can make it more difficult to see seams in the garment or to determine if the wrinkles have been removed.

Make sure that the garment is meant to be ironed.,
Set up the ironing area.,
Fill the water reservoir of the iron.,
Lay out the garment.",How to Use an Iron1," Check the tags for ironing instructions. If the tags don't tell you which setting to put your iron, then look to see if they indicate what material the fabric is made of. Many irons order their settings by the type of material: e.g. wool, cotton, polyester.;
, Use an ironing board, if possible. If you don't have access to an ironing board, then use a flat, sturdy surface like a table or a counter. The ironing board is designed to absorb heat and moisture without taking damage. Make sure that you don't iron on a highly flammable surface.

, If your iron features a steam function, then you may need to add water. Look for a large, detachable water chamber on the top of the tool. Add filtered water nearly to the brim.








Make sure that you use filtered water! This may help you avoid calcium build-up in your iron, which could clog the steam spouts.

, Arrange the item of clothing so that it lies perfectly flat on the board. Make sure that there are no wrinkles! If you iron over a wrinkle, then you will press a creased line into the fabric.

Rub off the buildup.",How to Clean a Sticky Iron1," If the stickiness on your iron is minimal, opt for this gentle method first. Heat your iron slightly on a low setting. Wet a rag with water so that it’s damp, not dripping. Unplug the iron before scrubbing it with the rag.








Bunch up the damp rag a bit and make sure not to touch the iron directly with your hand.;
, If plain water doesn’t do the trick, allow your unplugged iron to cool until it’s room temperature. Put a squirt of liquid dish soap in the bottom of a bowl. Fill the bowl with warm water.







, Dip a sponge or rag into the soap solution. Squeeze out any excess water so that the sponge or rag is damp, not dripping. Scrub the soleplate of the cool, dry iron. Use a dry rag to wipe away the moisture.








For stubborn gunk, try using a nylon mesh pad."

Let your garment dry.,
Decide how you will primarily use your steamer.,
Use an upright steamer.,
Use a handheld steamer if you want something more portable.",How to Use a Clothes Steamer," Steamers work wonderfully for most fabrics, as steaming is a delicate method of de-wrinkling. Fabrics that can be steamed include most cottons, silks, wools, and polyesters. However, some fabrics should not be steamed. These fabrics include waxed jackets, suede, or materials that may melt, such as plastic.


If you’re unsure if your fabric can be steamed, carefully test the steamer on a small corner of the fabric before using it on the entire garment.
Always check fabric care labels for advice prior to steaming.;
, Fabrics made from silk, chiffon, sheer, or velvet should be treated with care. Keep a few inches of distance between the steamer and the fabric, and don't steam in one place of fabric for too long. To avoid damaging embellishments or prints, steam the garment inside out to get rid of the wrinkles., Irons and steamers are both meant to take the wrinkles out of clothing, though they each have their own perks. Irons are typically best on less delicate fabrics (like cotton or denim), and are ideal for pressing creases into clothing. Steamers work on a larger variety of fabrics, as they are less likely to damage fabrics. Steamers are typically used on fabric while it is hanging, so they don't work well if you want to press or crease your clothing.


Steamers are more portable than irons, so they are ideal for those who travel a lot., Pour cold water into the water tank of your clothing steamer. Make sure that all of the parts of the steamer are secured properly, you don't want to leak water all over the place.


Plug the steamer in. Steamers usually heat up fairly quickly (2-3 minutes). Allow your steamer to heat until steam begins to form. Be sure to let your steamer warm up all of the way to get the best results.
Make sure it is steaming nicely before you use it. You can check how well it is steaming by pulling the trigger on the handle / pressing the button, and seeing how much steam issues when you release it. This is the same button you will use while steaming your clothes., It's easiest to steam a garment when it is hanging. Upright steamers typically have a hanging pole attached. If you're using a handheld steamer, hang your garment on a hanger and place it on a shower rod, the back of a chair, a door knob, or anything of that nature., You don't need to press hard or push the fabric against anything, the steam will gently remove the wrinkles on its own. As you slide the steamer down your garment, press the steam button every so often to apply steam to the fabric.You have the option to use a handheld pad as surface to steam your clothes on, though it is not necessary. It may be helpful when you are steaming extremely dense or wrinkly fabrics. If you decide to use a pad, slip it over one hand and use your other hand to hold the steamer.
With extremely wrinkly clothing, you should steam from the inside of the garment, or underneath the garment. The weight of the fabric against the steam will help to get the wrinkles out more quickly.When steaming fabrics with embellishments such as pleats, ruffles, etc., hold the steamer at a distance of 1-2 inches from the fabric. This will allow the fabric to keep its shape while the steam de-wrinkles it. If the garment is extremely wrinkled, you can also turn the garment inside out to steam the fabric without damaging the embellishments.

, After a fresh steaming, your garment will feel damp. There may also be some small water spots. Do not be alarmed, this is completely normal and your garment will dry. Let the garment sit for 5-10 minutes after steaming it before you put it on or hang it in your closet. This will give the garment ample time to dry.

, Are you looking for a steamer that will stay in your laundry room, or are you looking for a steamer to carry around with you? Some steamers are easier to transport than others, and some take up more space than others. Some steamers are handheld, others stand upright., Upright steamer are sometimes referred to as floor steamers, as their base sits on the floor. These steamers typically include a base where the water tank sits, a hose attached to a nozzle, and a pole with a clothing hanger at the top. These steamers typically sit on wheels so that they can be moved more easily.


If you plan on keeping your steamer in one location, upright steamers are the ideal choice. They are larger than other steamers, but are very convenient because of their features (the clothing hanger, nozzle, etc.). However, they can be transported if you don't mind moving something that's a bit larger.
These steamers are ideal if you are steaming numerous pieces of clothing. Their water base is large and usually won't need to be refilled.
Most upright steamers come with attachments, such as different types of brushes for different kinds of fabrics.
Upright steamers are typically the most expensive of all steamers, ranging from $50-$200., These steamers are much smaller than upright steamers, and can be easily packed in luggage or kept in the car. If you tend to need a steamer while traveling, a handheld steamer would be the ideal choice.


Handheld steamers combine the water tank and nozzle into one device. They typically weight a couple pounds.
Some handheld steamers come with attachments, like different nozzles and lint rollers.
Some steamers come with a small padded square with a strap that slips over your hand (similar to a large oven mitt). This pad can be helpful when you're steaming your clothing, as it can prevent you from burning your hands.
Handheld steamers typically range in price from $30-$100."

Heat up the iron.,
Iron the first side.,
Smooth out the other side.,
Hang the clothing immediately after ironing.",How to Use an Iron2," Turn the heat dial to the setting that is most appropriate for your fabric. Once you've selected a heat level, the metal will begin to grow warm. Let the iron become hot. You shouldn't need to wait more than a matter of seconds.The heat levels are often listed in relation to a certain type of fabric. For instance, cotton responds well to high heat and steam, but some synthetic fabrics might melt or fuse if they're exposed to such temperatures.Do not use an inappropriate setting!
Start with a low heat and work up. If you are ironing more than one item, start with the one that uses the lowest setting on the iron. This way, you won't need to let the iron cool down before you continue., Run the hot flat side of the iron firmly and slowly across the fabric. Smooth out the wrinkles. For the best results, work with the natural folds and creases of the garment.








Iron each individual part of the garment separately. For instance, if you're ironing a dress shirt, smooth out the collar, then the cuffs, then the sleeves, then the shoulders, then the placket – and, finally, the main body of the shirt.Do not let the iron rest directly on the garment, lest the fabric overheats. If you are careless with the iron, you might start a fire!

, Now, flip the piece of clothing over and iron the other side. Make sure not to flatten any wrinkles or creases into the new side.








, If you bunch up the garment or leave it laying out, then there's a good chance that it will dry with wrinkles. Hang the fabric on a clothes hanger and let it air-dry.

Place the iron on the ironing stand.",How to Use a Charcoal Iron," First, you need to get all of the following materials together:

A piece of clothing to iron, such as jeans or a t-shirt



 


A charcoal iron and stand






A pack of charcoal






A box of matches






A bottle of kerosene






A spray bottle






An ironing table






A manual blower such as a silver plate, fan, or BBQ blower






A small stick






Two pieces of wrapper or old bed sheets






An outdoor location/ apartment balcony
A bottle of water/ bucket of water





;
, Preferably, in the backyard of your house, or balcony of your apartment.

, Use an old bed sheet if you don’t have one. This is to protect your clothing from soot, and/or smoke.

, Make sure to add enough charcoal to reach the brim.

, You should do this because small pieces of charcoal may fall out during ironing and will dirty your fabric. You can also use your stick to mix the charcoal so that small pieces can fall out. Using your mouth, blow out excess particles.

, Only pour droplets of kerosene, or else all of your clothes will smell like it. You can also use the spray bottle instead.

, A small fire should catch right where the kerosene was poured. Allow it to burn for a little bit.

,, You can also fan the flame using the silver plate when you are tired. Use your small stick to mix the charcoal around to make sure all the pieces are getting hot. You can also close the lid, secure the small rooster, and then swing it from side to side, allowing the breeze to help blow it.

, When you open it up again you should see glowing embers of charcoal. At that point, you can close it up, wipe the bottom on the wrapper/ sheet on the ironing table.

, Wash your hands properly, and then start ironing. Run the iron back and forth along your clothes until they are crisp and wrinkle-free.

Refill the iron with water and set it to high.",How to Clean a Teflon Iron," Pick a mild household detergent, like a dish detergent, and mix it with water to create a cleaning solution. This solution should help cut through some of the grime and other dirt on the bottom of your iron.


Depending on the type of detergent, mix 1 or 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) with 1 or 2 cups (.23 to .47 l) of water.
Use warm water if you can.;
, After you create your solution, take a clean white cloth or rag and wipe the soleplate with the solution. Make sure the iron is cool.









Pay special attention to areas with extra dirt, grime, and stains.
You may consider a microfiber cloth if you are worried about scratching the Teflon. However, you may need some of the abrasive power of cotton cloth to remove some stains.
Switch dirty cloths out for clean ones as needed., Dip a Q-tip in your soap solution and rub it along the sides of groves and holes on your soleplate. You may need to go through a good number of Q-tips to get every hole and grove clean.









If you come across stains or spots that are hard to clean, you can use a toothpick to (very lightly) loosen the grime., Take another clean cloth, wet it, and use it to wipe down the soleplate. You may need to do this two times to remove all soap residue. In addition, take wet Q-tips and use them to remove any residue from the holes or groves of the soleplate.









If you can, carefully rinse the soleplate under your sink's faucet., If you’re unable to remove stains with soap, you can soak paper towels with vinegar and then place your iron on them. By leaving your iron on the vinegar-soaked paper towel, the stains and other grime will be loosened and may come off.









Make sure there is a towel another absorbent item on whatever surface you place the paper towels and iron on.
Allow the iron to sit on the paper towel for 5 to 15 minutes., After loosening tough stains with vinegar, you can sprinkle baking soda on the same paper towels and place the iron on them again.









Make sure you use enough baking soda so that the entire surface (soleplate) of your iron will be exposed to it.
If you need to re-dampen the paper towels with vinegar, feel free to do so.
Allow the iron to sit for 5 to 15 minutes., Lightly wet your cloth and wipe the entire surface of the iron. You may need to use 2 or 3 fresh cloths to remove all the baking soda.









If you can, you may want to lightly rinse the iron in the sink.
Make sure you remove all baking soda from the iron before using it again., To remove hard water stains, mineral deposits, and other buildup from in the reservoir and elsewhere in the iron, you’ll need to use a water and vinegar mixture.









Fill the reservoir 1/4ths of the way with vinegar.
Fil the remaining 3/4ths of the reservoir with water., Place the iron in a vertical position so the steam can rise easier, and so you don’t burn any surface underneath. Allow the iron to steam until the vinegar solution is completely gone.









If your iron has an auto-off setting, you may need to make sure it stays on., Take Q-tips or a damp cloth to wipe down the holes or grooves of the soleplate. You may also need to stick Q-tips into the holes to dig out gunk and grime. This is important, as your vinegar solution would likely have forced hard water or mineral buildup out of the holes.









You may find a lot of loosened gunk. Use as many Q-tips as you need to remove it all., Before using your iron for clothes again, you’ll need to run pure water through it. This will have the effect of helping remove any residual vinegar from the reservoir and elsewhere in the iron.









You may be able to set your iron to auto clean, if it has this option.
Allow the iron to steam until the reservoir is almost empty. This could take up to 15 minutes. "

Think carefully about whether you'll be able to keep up, and be sure you have enough time to meet the demand of a work from home ironing service.;
, If customers will be coming to your home for pickup, there may be zoning issues with parking and traffic. Unless you are doing a very high volume, this shouldn't be a problem.

, Find out how to start an ironing service, and decide whether you need to apply for a Federal Tax ID. They can also show you how to handle taxes and set up your business.

, Get the best iron you can, as well as a backup in case it breaks. Get a clean, wide, sturdy ironing board. You'll need a clothing rack and tags to keep clothes sorted and organized. A steamer and a dryer with a wrinkle removing setting can help to remove heavy wrinkles from clothing before you iron it. Invest in starch, wire hangers and plastic clothes bags to cover the finished clothes. Look into having hanger covers or bags printed with your business name.

, This is a job that can be done as a home business, but you could also consider ironing at your clients' homes, or renting a space at a dry cleaner or laundromat. Find a space in your home or office where you can keep the ironing board and supplies set up and ready to avoid taking extra time for preparation.

, If you choose this option, you'll need a clean car that has enough space to transport ironed clothes without wrinkling them. Allow time in your schedule for dropping off clothes. It might be helpful to drop off several clients' clothes at once on a predetermined route.

, This will cover the cost to replace customers' clothing if they get lost or damaged.

Learn about your iron's functions.,
Turn on the iron.,
Place the item to be pressed on the ironing board.,
Apply the pressing cloth.,
Iron the fabric.",How to Iron Taffeta,"


Before using your home iron to press taffeta, it is important to familiarize yourself with its functions. Most irons will have an easy-to-decipher knob that indicates the available settings. If your iron is older or does not have easily read labels, an owner's manual may provide you with the guidance you need.;
,


Once you have familiarized yourself with the iron, adjust its settings. When ironing taffeta fabrics, it is essential to adjust your iron to a setting that is low, as high temperatures are notorious for scorching this fabric. If, however, you plan to use a pressing cloth, medium heat is acceptable. A pressing cloth is a piece of fabric, typically cotton, that is applied over delicate fabrics during ironing to prevent possible damage.

,


If you are pressing a small item, such as a child's dress or short curtains, the ironing board should be able to support the entirety of the product. If you are ironing a much longer evening dress or formal drapes, consider using dining room chairs or bar stools to support the fabric. This will prevent it from slipping and sliding during the ironing process.
Place the part of the fabric which is wrinkled over the narrow part of the ironing board. Be aware that you will most likely have to work with small sections of fabric at a time to ensure the best results.

,


If you plan to use this item, place it over the area to be pressed at this time in the process.

,


With light pressure, gently move the iron over the wrinkled portion of the fabric. Avoid letting the iron sit on one spot for an extended period of time, as this can cause scorching or discoloration.
If using a pressing cloth, remove the product from time to time to evaluate the taffeta. If further ironing is required, replace the cloth, and continue pressing.
When one area of the taffeta appears to be wrinkle-free, adjust the product being ironed so that another wrinkled section is on the narrow part of the ironing board.
Repeat this process until you've finished pressing the entire item.

Buy starch.,
Mix starch.,
Start with a clean shirt.,
Position the clean shirt on an ironing board.,
Spray the starch on the front of the shirt.,
Repeat on the back of the shirt.,
Hang the shirt immediately.",How to Starch a Shirt1," You can buy starch from the store rather than making your own mixture. Most grocery stores will have starch in the laundry aisle. You can purchase it in liquid or powder form. A few good brands of starches are Niagra Spray Starch, Sta-flo, Dr. Beckmann, and Easy on Double Starch. , If using powdered starch, you will need to mix it with water before use. Take four tablespoons of starch and add it to one pint of hot water in a bowl or jug. Stir until the mixture resembles milk. Then, pour the mixture into a spray bottle for use.You can use the amount of water and starch recommended above, but you should check with the directions on the starch label before creating the mixture.

, Prepare the shirt by unbuttoning any buttons on the shirt, including the sleeve and collar buttons. Remove stains before washing by working a little detergent into them with a cloth, or by using a stain remover pen. Then, wash it on the delicate or normal cycle, depending on the instructions, amount of stains, and durability of the fabric. Next, put the shirt on a hanger to air dry.








Avoid putting the shirt into the dryer unless necessary. If you do put it in the dryer, use a low heat setting.

, Lay the garment on the board so that the two halves of the front are hanging over the sides, while the back of the shirt is flat on the surface of the board. You will start by starching the front of the shirt.







, Apply the starch in a light and even coat across the expanse of the shirt. Wait a couple of seconds to allow the product to seep into the material of the garment. Then, press lightly using an iron set to the recommended heat level for the material.









If a heat level is not recommended, use a high heat setting so that you will cook the starch.

, Turn the garment so that the back of the shirt is facing up on the ironing board, and then apply an even coating of starch. Iron carefully the back of the shirt. Continue the process by starching and ironing each arm, finishing the job with an application of the starch to the collar.








, Place the garment on a shirt hanger, and allow the garment to be exposed to fresh air for a couple of moments before placing it in a closet. This will provide time for the starch to finishing adhering to the fibers of the garment and provide a superior hold, creating the crisp texture and look that you want.

Check to see if your item can take the heat.,
Cover the patch.,
Iron the patch.,
Peel the patch off.",How to Remove Iron On Patches1," Unless you added the patch yourself, you will first need to make sure your item won't be damaged by ironing it. Not all ""iron on"" patches are actually applied with heat.


Pick a small, inconspicuous part of the item not easily visible during normal use.
Place wax paper or a thin dish towel on top of the area.
Press down with a pre-heated iron on the small area you're testing. Hold it for about 15 seconds.
Remove the iron and check for damage or discoloration on your item.
If you are treating a delicate item, make sure the iron is on the proper setting. If you don't have experience ironing this type of fabric, the adhesive remover method is probably a better idea.;
, Position your item so that the cloth part of the patch is exposed. Place either wax paper or a thin cloth towel directly over the patch. Make sure the covering is completely clean and free from any substance that could melt into the fabric of your item.

, Pre-heat your iron to its highest setting before use. Press your iron down on top of the paper/cloth where the patch would be. Hold it there for about 15 seconds. Remove the iron and the covering from your item.


If the glue does not appear to have softened, apply the iron again. Keep adding heat until the adhesive melts.

, The heat from the iron should be enough to melt the glue and temporarily make it sticky. Lift the edge of the patch up and peel it off of your item.


Hold onto the item with one hand and peel with your other.
You can use your fingers to do this, but be cautious, as the adhesive will be hot.
If you have trouble lifting up the first part of the patch, try using tweezers or a butter knife. Tweezers will be able to slide between the patch and your item and grip the patch well. If you don't have tweezers, slip a butter knife between the patch and your item. Lift up to start the patch and remove the rest of it with your fingers.
If the patch is large, you may have to make a few passes with the iron. Peel up large patches section by section."

Create the mixture.,
Immerse the shirt into the bowl.,
Put the shirt into the washing machine.,
Hang the shirt to dry.",How to Starch a Shirt2," You can make your own starch mixture out of cornstarch and water. Mix 1 ½ tablespoons of cornstarch with with 2 cups of water. Stir it until it looks milky. Pour the mixture into a bowl or into the sink. Add warm water until the sink or bowl is nearly filled.








You should have enough water in the bowl or sink so that the shirt can move freely. Not enough water can result in a board stiff shirt.
Use distilled water if you have hard tap water. If not, tap water should be fine to use.

, If the shirt is colored, turn it inside out. Then, immerse the shirt into the water. Work it through and then squeeze out the excess water. You should only immerse one shirt into the water at a time., You can also choose to starch the shirt in the washing machine rather than soaking it with your own hands. Allow the shirt to run through one regular wash cycle and then pause it as it reaches the final rinse through the drum. Then, pour the mixture into the fabric softener dispenser, or directly into the flow of water.








Do not pour the mixture in and allow it to sit in the dispenser throughout the entire washing cycle, or it may cause clogging.

, Put the shirt on a hanger and allow it to dry until it is damp. Once it is damp, remove it from the hanger. Iron it while it is still slightly damp. This will make the shirt crisp and wrinkle free.Make sure not to use too high of a heat setting if your shirt is made of a delicate fabric.

Prepare the shirt in advance.,
Make a mixture.,
Lay the shirt on an ironing board.,
Hang it up.",How to Starch a Shirt3," In order to get the best results, wash and thoroughly dry the shirt before attempting to apply any type of starch to the garment. Washing removes any dirt or grime that could interfere with the stiffening properties of the starch, as well as inhibit the ability of the product to protect the fibers in the weave of the shirt.

, Vodka is great for cleaning, disinfecting, and freshening rooms. It can also be used to make fabric crisper. Use 1








Any type of non-flavored vodka will work.

, Lay it with the front side up on the ironing board. Turn on the iron onto the highest heat setting possible for the type of fabric. Spray the mixture evenly throughout the shirt. Iron the inside of the shirt first. Then, iron the collar, cuffs, sleeves, and the rest of the shirt. Repeat the process on the back side of the shirt.The back of the shirt creases easier than the front of the shirt. Make sure the back is flattened out completely on the ironing board.

, Carefully put the shirt onto a hanger. Hang it in a place where it will not be touched by anything or too close to other clothes. Let it hang overnight and then hang it in its usual place in the closet."

Learn how to use your steam iron.,
Select the right settings.,
Start with the pockets.,
Move on to the upper pants.,
Find your creases.Lay the pants lengthwise along your ironing board.,
Start by pressing the front crease of one leg.,
Move on to the back crease and second leg.,
Let the pants cool down.,
Apply a vinegar solution.,
Smack them dry.,
Hang your pants up.",How to Press Pants," Although the exact instructions on how to use an iron vary from model to model, the general concept is the same. First, fill the water reservoir before plugging it in to avoid any mishaps or electrical shocks. Next, plug it in and select your desired settings. Give it a couple minutes to heat the water. Always keep it sitting on its heel, rather than flat on a surface, to avoid scorching the surface.Once you’re ready to begin pressing your pants, keep this in mind:


When pressing pants, all you need to do with the iron is gently press downward for a second or two and give the fabric a squirt of steam as you do so, with none of the back-and-forth movement that comes with regular ironing.;
, First, check the inside tag to your pants. Read the care label. Note the recommendations it gives for which temperatures and settings to use on your iron. Adjust your iron’s settings accordingly.If the care label is missing, check the tags to any matching articles if it came as part of a set with a jacket or vest.
If you are unsure of what setting to use, practice on the inside of the pants first, where no one will see any marks (such the waistband or the pockets).Start with the lowest temperature possible if you don’t know which one to use., With the fly unzipped, fold the waist of your pants so you can draw the pocket liners clear of the pants’ “wrong side” and into the open. Lay one pocket flat on the ironing board. Use your iron to press it flat. Move on to the next pocket and repeat.With each press, give the fabric a squirt of steam.


The “wrong side” is whichever part of your clothing doesn’t see the light of day.In the case of pants, that means the inside of the waist and legs.
Since pockets are so small, this is a good place to begin practicing “pressing” as opposed to “ironing.”

, Draw the pants over the ironing board so the edge of the board slips inside the waist, as though you were helping the board to get dressed. Press along the waistband first. Reposition the pants as you go until you complete the full circuit around the band. From there, press the rest of the upper pants (hips, butt, and front) above the crotch seam, repositioning the pants on the board as needed.Keep your presses short and sweet. Pressing too hard for too long can result in an imprint of the zipper, seams, or pockets underneath. To be safe, adjust the pockets and fly as needed to keep them out your iron’s way.
If your pants are pleated, don’t attempt to press the pleats out of existence. Keep them folded as they were originally stitched and press them as is.
To protect the fabric and prevent it from shining afterward, cover the area that you are about to press with a thin layer of cloth. Make sure that it is clean and free of lint and fluff., Lay them on one side, with one leg lying flat on top of the other.Look for the original creases along the front and back of each leg. Make sure the front creases of both legs line up perfectly with each other, then do the same with the back. If the original creases have faded from view:


Look inside the bottom of each leg to find its seams.
Pinch the inseam and outseam of one leg together at its hem.
Lay the leg back down just like that.
Smooth the hem out while holding the seams together.
The two farthest points from the seams should mark the bottom of your creases.
Do the same with the outseams in the waist of your pants to find the tops of your creases.

, First, neatly fold whichever leg is on top up and over the waist so you can press the leg underneath.Give the very bottom of the front crease a short press. Then move to the very top of the crease and give that a quick press, too. Now that both ends are clearly marked, go back to the bottom and work your way up the crease to its top.Don’t go all the way up to the waistband. For pleated pants, keep the top of your crease just below the very bottom of the pleats. For non-pleated pants, keep the top of your crease six inches below the waistband.
Remember to lift the iron off the pants after each press. Don’t drag it up along the seam as if you were ironing. Doing so can stretch the material and create an odd fit and/or appearance.
Unless the care label says otherwise, don’t spare the steam, since this helps your creases to remain sharp.
Be mindful of the pockets as you near the top. Fold them out of your iron’s path to keep them out the way so you don’t end up with their imprint on the front of your pants.

, Once you have finished your front crease, repeat the process with the back, if desired. Then flip the top leg back down, into its original position. Flip your pants over, so that the leg you just pressed is now lying on top of the other. Carefully fold the top leg up and over the waist, being mindful to not ruin those sharp creases. Repeat the process with the second leg, starting with the front crease and ending with the back.If needed, press each leg in between its creases to get rid of any wrinkles there.Just be careful around the seams running up the middle of the leg, since these might create imprints when pressed.
To keep its creases sharp, give the first leg a chance to cool off before flipping the pants over and pressing the second leg.

, After you finish the second leg, flip the first leg back into its proper position so that it lies full on top of the leg underneath. Then let the pants sit on the ironing board for a little while before removing them. Give them a chance to cool down so that the creases have a chance to stiffen up before being moved., Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Pour this into a spray bottle so you can mist and dampen a clean, lint-free cloth. Before removing the pants from the ironing board, cover a portion of one crease with this dampened cloth until the crease absorbs all the moisture. Spray the cloth with enough solution to dampen it again, and apply the cloth to the next portion. Repeat until all the creases have been treated.Use a spray bottle and cloth to avoid soaking your pants accidentally.
Keep the pants on the ironing board until they are dry.

, Use a flat piece of unvarnished wood (such as the handle-end of a bristle brush) to draw out lingering steam. With the pants still on the ironing board, smack the bottom of one crease. When you do, hold the wood there for a second, on top of the ironing board, pinching the crease between the two. Then raise the wood again and repeat this process up the length of each crease.The wood needs to be unvarnished to absorb moisture left by the steam.

, Use hangers specifically designed to secure pants in place so they don’t slip off and ruin their creases or become wrinkled. Hang your pants in the same manner that you laid them out on the ironing board. Drape the outside of one leg over the bar with the other leg lying flat on top of it.Your pants may still contain some moisture even after smacking them dry. Allow them to hang for a few hours and air-dry before putting them on."

Gently steam the velvet.,
Leave to hang and dry.",How to Press Velvet," This will need to be near where you are going to hold the kettle. If you can't find something to hang it from, improvise as shown in the photo.;
, Do this by holding a half-filled kettle of boiling water in one hand and passing the steam from it over the surface of the garment. (The kettle needs to remain plugged in, so use with care so as not to burn yourself with the steam.)

Purchase a fabric-safe adhesive remover.,
Patch test your clothing.,
Expose the area underneath the patch.,
Apply your adhesive remover.,
Peel off the patch.,
Repeat on any stubborn areas.",How to Remove Iron On Patches2," Glue removers that are xylene or orange oil-based work well. Pick a liquid-based product able to soak through fabric. An adhesive remover that comes in a spray bottle will be much easier to work with for this purpose. Common brands are Goo Gone, De-Solv-It, and Goof Off.


Rubbing alcohol can also be an effective alternative., Even if the adhesive remover is advertised as fabric safe, it is still possible that it may stain your particular item. You will need to test it out first before using the remover on a patch. Do this over a clean sink to avoid making a mess.


Find a small, inconspicuous area on your item that is not easily visible during normal use. For example, the inside back bottom edge of a hat or jacket would be a good choice.
Dab a small amount of adhesive remover onto this spot.
Work the adhesive remover into the fabric using your fingers or a clean rag.
Rinse off the adhesive remover and check for discoloration.

, If your item is a T-shirt, a hat, or a pair of paints, turn it inside out. You will need to access the fabric that is bonded to the patch. If your item is a canvas bag, simply lay it out flat upside-down.

, Squirt or pour the glue remover liberally on the back of the cloth. Use enough that is soaks through your item completely. Make sure you cover the whole area behind the patch. Work the remover into the fabric using either your fingers or a clean rag. Wait about one minute for the remover to loosen the patch.

, The adhesive remover should successfully soften the glue, making it sticky. The patch should now easily come off your item.


Turn the item right-side-out. Hold it with one hand.
Grip the edge of the patch between the index finger and thumb of your other hand.
Pull back to lift the edge of the patch up and off your item.
Work your way around the patch until it has been entirely peeled away.

, If part of the patch is still stuck to your item, try repeating the process, focusing on the spots where the adhesive did not soften properly.


Reapply the adhesive remover however many times it takes to completely remove the patch. However, if the glue remover you used has not softened the adhesive at all, you will likely need to try a different one.
If you don't plan on keeping the patch, trim off what you've already peeled off with a pair of scissors. This will make it much easier to work with and keep the patch from sticking back onto your item.

"
"
Check for stains.,
Apply adhesive remover directly to the residue.,
Launder your item as usual.,
Use white vinegar for especially tough stains.White vinegar often works to loosen glue enough for water to rinse it away.",How to Remove Iron On Patches3," The glue from your patch will likely leave a residue behind. If the area where your patch was is now discolored or sticky, you will need to take further action to make your item looking clean and like new again.


If you used the adhesive remover method, launder your item first. This may remove the adhesive completely on its own.

, Squirt or pour more adhesive remover onto the patch. Massage it in using your fingers or a clean rag. Allow it to work for approximately one minute.


You can also make your own adhesive remover at home. Just mix two parts baking soda with one part coconut oil and a few drops of orange essential oil.This all natural adhesive remover works well at removing residue but not for removing the patch itself. It is a thick paste that is unable to easily soak through fabrics.

, Simply wash your item using whatever method you normally would. Do this as soon as possible to remove the solvent in case it may damage your item over time.


If the item is machine wash safe, go ahead and throw it into your washing machine with a normal load of laundry.
Hand soak delicate items using cold or room temperature water with a small amount of detergent.
If the glue seems especially stuck-on, try scrubbing it with a soft toothbrush after the adhesive remover has been worked in.
Apply some liquid laundry detergent directly to the residue patch as a pre-treatment.
If there is still some residue left after you've washed your item, try repeating the process with more adhesive remover. It may take a few tries to totally remove the stain.
Do not place the item in the dryer until the stain has been completely removed. Doing so may set the stain and make it harder to clean.,


Before soaking, first try saturating the spot with white vinegar and wash as normal. This works well for delicate items with caked-on glue from the iron method.
If spot treatment doesn't work, try soaking your item overnight. For white items, you may use undiluted vinegar. To keep colored fabric from bleeding, dilute the vinegar in water using one cup of vinegar per gallon of water.
While white vinegar is generally safe to use on clothing, always be sure to do a patch test first to be sure.Use white vinegar only. Other types may stain clothing.

If your foam underneath is ripped or scruffy, you should replace that as well.,
Untie the cord from underneath the existing cover (it is probably wrapped around a plastic toggle.,
Zig zag stitch the raw edge.,
Sew about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) from the edge to make a channel for the string.,
Assuming your cord is synthetic (most are) singe the end with a lighter, then attach a small safety pin.,
Either tie off the ends, or use a piece of plastic with slits taken out of the sides (either make your own or use the toggle from the old cover) to secure the cord underneath.

",How to Make an Ironing Board Cover from Scratch," One thing that you can try is upholstery wadding underneath.;
, If it is, good, you have half of your materials already). Pull all the string out, and stretch the cover out flat. Lay the old cover on top of your fabric and cut around it, leaving about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) seam allowance (or more if you prefer a bigger allowance, or are adding extra padding).

, Then fold the edge over 2 centimeters (0.8 in) and pin.

, Start at the flat end and back stitch a few stitches to secure. When you get round to the same point, leave a gap of about 2cms (back stitching again) so you can slip your thread in and out. You don't need to be too precise, because it's all going to be underneath.Make sure you leave enough space to pass a safety pin through the channel.

, The reason we singe it is because they fray so easily and it's mighty annoying to get halfway round and find you've become detached. When you have threaded your cord all the way through (hurray!), secure the cover over the board and tighten the cord as much as it will go, smoothing the surface and tucking under as necessary.

Hand wash silk in lukewarm water.,
Allow the silk to soak for three to five minutes.,
Squeeze the silk very gently to release excess water.,
Check your hand iron to see if the plate is dirty or stained with red.,
Plug in your iron.,
Lay a large, clean cotton sheet across your ironing board.,
Turn the silk inside out.,
Smooth out the silk fabric so there are no wrinkles.,
Press the iron plate to the surface of the cloth.,
Lift the press cloth up and replace it on the next section that needs to be iron.",How to Iron Silk," Add a few drops of mild detergent to a bucket or sink of water. Rub it very gently to release stains.;
, Then, rinse the garment in fresh lukewarm water until the bubbles disappear.

, Wrap it in a thick towel to absorb the rest of the water. Now you are ready to iron the silk.Never wring silk fabric out or it can stretch or tear.
If you don’t want to wash it before you iron it. Spray the whole surface of the silk with a spray bottle to dampen it.

, Clean it with a paste of one tbsp. (14.8 ml) of water and two tbsp. (13.8 g) of baking soda. Spread it on the iron, scrub lightly and wipe it off with a damp cloth., Heat it up on the silk setting or the lowest setting if your iron doesn’t have a delicate/silk setting. Wait at least five minutes while it heats up.

, Creating a cotton barrier will prevent colors from other fabrics from leaching onto your silk. Both the cotton barrier and your cotton press cloth should be pure cotton and white or natural color.

, You will always want to iron on the backside of the fabric. This is the side that has the matte finish., Lay a small cotton press cloth on top of the area you are going to start ironing. Some moisture from the damp silk may leak through the press cloth.

, Move the iron around the fabric. Never leave it in one place too long, or you risk burning the fabric.

, When you have completed ironing the whole surface, hang the silk on a hanger and allow it to dry for a few minutes before wearing it or storing it.

Figure out what type of patch you have.,
Examine the fabric of your clothing or accessory.,
Think about design and placement.,
Lay the base item on a flat, heat-resistant surface.,
Place the patch in the position you chose.,
Heat up an iron.,
Place a thin towel over the patch.,
Position the heated iron over the patch and press down.,
Remove the iron and allow the patch to to cool.,
Consider sewing around the edges.,
Don't wash the article more than necessary.",How to Iron on a Patch," Some patches come with glue on the back, and others simply have a cloth backing. Take a close look at your patch and decide whether you may need additional materials.









Decorative embroidered fabric patches are usually thick, stiff, and have what looks like plastic glue on one side. These can be used to cover ripped or discolored fabric.
Transfer paper patches are prints on one side of special paper, with a non-glossy paper side. These can't hold ripped fabric together and usually the fabric underneath will show through if it's not applied to something white.
Patches that have a simple cloth backing can be attached using fusible web.
Patches that are meant to cover up holes or stains and are designed to blend in with fabric often come with a paper backing that is pulled off before the patch is applied.
Consider custom designing your own patch if you can't find one you like.;
, Fabrics like denim and cotton provide the best base for iron-on patches. As a general rule the fabric you choose should be at least as heavy as the patch.









Look at the fabric care label to see whether it can be ironed (if not, there will be a crossed-out icon of an iron). If there's no label, try to figure out what material it's made of.
Be very careful with polyester fabrics, since applying the high heat necessary for ironing on patches can burn the fabric or cause it to get discolored.
Silk and other delicate fabrics are not good candidates for patches.

, Before you heat up the iron, lay out your jacket, sash or backpack and decide where exactly you want the patch to be placed.









If this is the only patch you intend to iron on this piece, put it in a tastefully prominent position. Make the placement look intentional.
If you're planning on ironing on more patches, like you would for a girl scout's sash or any other type of collection, plan ahead to make sure there will be room for additional patches.
If you are using a printable paper patch, remember that letters and other asymmetrical items will appear reversed.

, An ironing board is useful, but if you don't have one, you may also lay your item across a doubled-up bath towel on a sturdy table.









To ensure the item will provide a good surface for the patch, iron it first. If it's a backpack or another item that's difficult to iron, do your best to arrange it so that the part of the fabric that will be receiving the patch is flat against a hard surface.

, The adhesive side should be flat against the base fabric. Make sure that the patch isn't crooked.









On embroidered patches, the adhesive side is the underside.
On transfer paper patches, the adhesive side is the side where the image is printed. Place the image face down on the fabric. The paper backing will be peeled once the patch is ironed on.
If you're using a fusible webbing, the fusible web backing should be against the fabric.
If you're using a patch meant to blend in with fabric, you may need to apply it to the reverse side of the article of clothing. Follow the instructions that came with the packaging.

, Turn it to the hottest setting your fabric can tolerate. Make sure the ""steam"" option is turned off, and that your iron isn't full of water.








, Take care not to disturb the position of the patch. The towel will protect the patch itself and the surrounding fabric.








, Hold the iron there for about 15 seconds. Apply as much pressure as you can by pressing down firmly.








, Lift the towel and check to see whether the patch is fixed on securely by gently rubbing at the edge with a finger, trying to lift it. If it lifts up a bit, replace the towel and press it with the iron again for 10 seconds.









If you're working with a paper transfer patch, wait until it is fully cool (leave it for 10 minutes), then carefully peel off the paper.

, For a completely secure patch, use a sewing machine or a needle and thread to secure the patch to the fabric. This greatly reduces the chances that the patch will fall off.









Choose a thread that matches the patch.
Don't attempt to sew around the edge of printable paper patches.

, Iron-on patches are meant to be permanent, but they do become loosened over time. Take care not to let the article get too dirty, since washing it may cause the patch to start coming off.









If you do need to wash the item, hand wash it using cold water. Allow it to air dry.

Stir 1 tablespoon (7.5 grams) of cornstarch into ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of cold water.,
Boil 3¾ cups (480 milliliters) of water.,
Pour the cornstarch water into the boiling water.,
Add 2 to 3 drops of essential oil, if desired.,
Cook the mixture for 1 minute.,
Allow the cornstarch to cool before pouring it into a spray bottle.,
Use the spray starch.",How to Make Liquid Starch2," Pour the water a cup, then add the cornstarch. Stir the two together until the cornstarch dissolves, then set the cup aside.If you can't find cornstarch where you live, use cornflour instead (not cornmeal).

, Pour the water into a saucepan, then set the saucepan on the stove. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high to high heat., Keep stirring while you pour the cornstarch water into the boiling water. Do not remove the saucepan from the burner yet., You don't need to do this, but it will give your starch a nice fragrance.Choose something that smells refreshing, such as lavender or lemon.

, Keep stirring the mixture as it cooks.Boiling the cornstarch will help keep it suspended in the water and reducing settling/clogging., Once the cooking time is up, take the saucepan off the burner. Let the mixture cool down to room temperature before pouring it into a spray bottle.If you added any essential oils, you must use a glass spray bottle, as the oils will degrade a plastic one.

, Lightly spray the fabric after washing it, then let it air dry. You can also spray the fabric just before ironing it for a crisp finish. You want the fabric to be wet, but not dripping or soaking.If you need to starch a lot of fabric, pour the starch into a bucket, tub, or sink. Dunk the fabric into it, wring it out, then iron it. You may need to double or triple the recipe.

Spray the garment with water.,
Turn the garment inside out.,
Put a press cloth between the iron and rayon if you iron it right side out.,
Turn the iron to a low setting.,
Iron in small portions.,
Keep the iron moving as you go over the rayon.,
Use steam if there’s a tough crease.,
Let the fabric cool before moving it.,
Hang the garment on a non-metal hanger.,
Store the rayon in a sealed tub when not regularly wearing it.",How to Iron Rayon," You can iron rayon when it is dry, but it’s easier to do it while the fabric is damp. If your garment is already damp from the wash, then you don’t have to do anything. If it is dry, spray it with a bottle filled with clean water. The rayon doesn’t have to be very wet. It should just be slightly wet to the touch., The rayon can be damaged if you iron it right side out. At the very least, the fabric will become shiny if it makes direct contact with the iron. Always turn the fabric inside out unless you have a pressing cloth between the iron and rayon.If you are starting with a dry garment, you can use a spray bottle to dampen it.

, If you must iron the fabric right side out, you will need to have something on top of the rayon. You can buy a pressing cloth, or simply use a piece of unbleached or white cotton muslin. Always use the pressing cloth when ironing rayon right side out., Rayon is a sensitive fabric, so it can’t handle high heat. Use a low heat setting when ironing your garment. The wool setting is usually a good option for rayon fabric., Rayon is easily stretched out, especially when the fabric is hot. Ironing the rayon in large portions can contribute to the rayon stretching out. Iron one small portion of the rayon at time until you have ironed the entire garment., Because rayon is easy to iron, you don’t have to press down for a long time. You should gently press the iron on the fabric and move it in a smooth, steady motion., As mentioned, rayon is sensitive and pretty easy to iron. You can use steam when doing a routine ironing, but it isn’t necessary. Ideally, you should only use steam if there’s a tough crease you’re trying to work out., Since rayon can easily be stretched out, you shouldn’t move it while it is still hot from the iron. Give the fabric a few minutes to completely cool down. Then, you can hang it up or store it away., Metal hangers can leave rust spots on the fabric over time. Plus, the rayon will probably slip off of a metal hanger. Instead, hang the garment up on any type of non-metal hanger with a solid grip., Rayon is an edible fabric that easily attracts bugs. If you won’t be wearing your rayon for a while, store it in your closet in a sealed, plastic tub or space-saving bag. Use cedar bags or lavender sachets to keep the fabric fresh."

;
, Fill the iron with distilled or bottled water, if you can. Tap water contains small amounts of minerals which build up in your iron over time. This leads to clogging. If you notice that your iron occasionally spits too much water out, it is because it is clogged.


, A shirt that is wrinkle-free takes a cooler setting than the hot setting for cotton. Be careful not to burn the shirt. See manufacturer's settings.

, If you are ironing more than one item, you will want to either fold those items as you complete them or hang them. This will prevent them from wrinkling again while you finish the other items.

, Lightly spray the hanging shirt with sizing or spray starch (optional) then remove the shirt from hanger. Unbutton the top button.

You can even use iron-on appliqués! Listed below are the types of transfers that work with heat presses and t-shirts:Ink jet transfers are translucent and work best on white or light-colored shirts. You can print your own using an ink jet printer and special transfer paper. This won't work with a laser printer.
Laser copier/printer transfers are also translucent. You can create them on a laser copier or printer using special transfer paper.
Supplier and store-bought transfers are pre-printed. They are opaque and suitable for colored shirts, including dark colors (unless otherwise noted).
Embroidered appliqués and patches also work with heat presses. They must have a heat activated adhesive on the back, however.
Die cut vinyl lettering also work. You can layer them on top of each other to create different designs. This is especially common on sports apparel.;
, Choose an image that you like, then reverse it using an image editing program. Print it out on special transfer paper using an ink jet printer. Make sure that you are printing on the film side of the paper.


If you only have a laser printer, you will need to use transfer paper labeled for laser printers.

, This is only necessary for printed, supplier, and store-bought transfers. When you use the transfer, the film coating will be printed onto the shirt—including the parts that are not colored. You will need to trim around your image so that the blank parts of the film are not transferred.


Focus on the main shape. You don't necessarily have to trim inside the shapes, like the holes in ""O"" and ""D"".
You can leave a small border around the shape.

, Lift up the handle to open the press. Move the heat platen away from the silicone pad. Keep the press open while it heats up during the next step. The following instructions should work for most models of heat presses.

, Read the instructions on your transfer paper to find out what temperature you should be using. Turn the thermostat knob clockwise. Wait for the press to heat up; a light will flash on. Once the desired temperature is reached, turn the knob counterclockwise until the light turns off.In most cases, you will need to set the temperature to 350 to 375°F (177 to 191°C)., Twist the pressure knob clockwise to increase pressure, and counterclockwise to decrease pressure. The pressure will be based on the thickness of your project; the thicker it is, the less pressure you will need. Be careful not to twist it too far, or the swivel arm may come off.In most cases, you will need to use medium to high pressure.

, Hold down the minute and second buttons to increase or decrease the times. When you press the start button, the timer will start—but don't press it yet! Listed below are the recommended times based on the type of transfer you may be using. If your paper lists a different time, use that instead:Ink-Jet transfer paper: 14 to 18 seconds
Laser copier/printer transfer paper: 18 to 25 seconds
Sublimation transfer: 25 to 30 seconds
Embroidered appliqués: 20 to 30 seconds
Die cut vinyl lettering: 45 to 60 seconds

, Make sure that the side you want to be printed on is facing up. Most transfers are translucent, so it would be best to use a white, solid-colored shirt. If your transfer is labeled as ""opaque"" or suitable for colored shirts, you can use any color of shirt you want.

, Make sure that the transfer paper is inside the pressing area, including the silicone pad and heat pad.


If you are pressing an embroidered appliqué, set it down embroidered-side-up, adhesive-side-down.
If you are pressing heat transfer vinyl, set it matte-side down, shiny-side-up.

, Some types of heat presses already have a protective silicone pad. If yours does not, or if you are pressing an appliqué or heat transfer vinyl, you will need to lay down a thin cloth on top of your shirt and transfer. This will protect the transfer. A handkerchief, tea towel, or thin piece of cotton fabric will work great for this.

, Pull down on the handle, clamping the press shut. You may need to adjust the pressure, especially if you are pressing an embroidered appliqué or patch.

, The handle will most likely lock into place, depending on the specific model you have. When the timer goes off, press the start button again. This will stop the press and reset the timer.

, Peel the paper off of the fabric while the paper is still hot.The image should now be printed onto the shirt.

, If you need to press another design onto the back of your shirt, insert a piece of cardboard inside the shirt first. Adjust the plate height so that there is less pressure, then press the shirt again. This way, you won't accidentally reheat the first image."

, Read the fabric content label and set the iron to match, err on the cool side. For cotton/poly blend use a polyester setting.


If your garment label does not forbid steam, use steam. It will make ironing much easier.

, With the rest of the shirt off to the side, lay out the sleeve on the ironing board. The cuff should be at the narrow end of the board. Lay it as flat as possible, button-side of the cuff down, and smooth it out by hand.

, Starting with the seam on the underside of the sleeve (the one that leads into the armpit), flatten the sleeve from the point until another ""seam"" is created on the other side.








, Get some spray starch or sizing and spray it onto the whole sleeve, following the directions on the can.








, Iron the sleeve, starting from the shoulder and working down until about 3"" from the beginning of the cuff. Be careful to avoid ironing over the buttons underneath.









If you want to avoid the seamed look, stop just short of the edges. Do a quarter turn on the sleeve before doing the other side and iron the new center to avoid wrinkles that you would have missed at the edge.

, There are a number of different ways to do this. Because off the little gathers and pleats at the cuff of dress shirts, this can be a very difficult area to iron. How you do it will depend on how much effort you want to put in and how dramatic the gathers and pleats on the cuff are.









You can simply iron the bottom of the sleeve and the cuff in small sections, if you want to save time and don't care too much about how it looks. Spread the pleats and gathers by hand and iron
You can roll up the hand towel into a tight roll (toughly the same size as your wrist) and place it in the cuff. Iron with this in place to avoid much of the difficulty of ironing this area.
If the pleats and gathers are very badly wrinkled, ball up the hand towel and stuff in down the sleeve so that it fills out the area as much as possible. Use the steam function to ease most of the wrinkles and then iron it as much as you can.

If none of the above steps work, you can contact a local dry cleaner to help you.",How to Get Wrinkles Out of a Wedding Veil," The material will burn easily as it is usually made of 100 percent nylon. Ironing the veil will cause damage to your veil that may not be repairable.;
, You can also hang the veil on the bathroom door and let a hot shower run for 15 minutes. The steam from the shower will help release the wrinkles from your veil.






Allow your veil to dry and check for wrinkles. If they still exist, you can repeat this step or try another method. Sometimes this steam method is not totally effective for heavily wrinkled veils.







Note: Do not put the veil directly in the shower or on the shower door - it is to be put on the bathroom door, not the shower door.







,


Using a spray bottle filled with warm water (or a product such as a brand name Wrinkle Releaser), lightly mist your veil keeping the veil about 10 inches/25cm away from the mister. Make sure that the veil does not get wet, just lightly misted.






Shake the veil gently to release the wrinkles and hang to dry.

Set up the ironing board.,
Check the fabric.,
Fill the steam compartment.,
Turn on the iron and set it to the desired temperature.,
Iron the pockets.,
Press the waistband.,
Work down each pant leg.,
Iron in a crease.,
Allow everything to cool.",How to Iron Pants," You can iron trousers on just about any flat surface, but for best results (and to avoid scorching your dining table) use an ironing board. Adjust the ironing board to a comfortable height and make sure the legs are locked.






;
, Before you jump into ironing, make sure you know what material your pants are made out of. Not all fabrics can be ironed (the tag will tell you), but most require different heat and steam settings. Most trouser pants are made from wool, cotton, polyester, flannel, or a blend.









Wool and blend fabrics require lower heat settings, while cotton can be ironed at the hottest temperature.

, Many irons these days come with a built-in steam compartment. If it isn’t full, add some water to it.








, Adjust the temperature and steam settings based on the type of fabric you’re ironing. When you’re unsure what temperature to choose, it is better to be safe than sorry by going with a lower heat setting.








You can tell when the iron is hot and ready by flicking a few drops of water on the metal plate. If it sizzles and steams, then the iron is hot enough. If not, wait a few more minutes and try again.
Some newer irons have specific buttons/dials for each type of fabric.

, It may sound like a strange first step, but think about it: if the pockets are wrinkled and you iron over the top of them, you’re just going to add more wrinkles to your pants. Pull the pockets inside out and press them flat with the iron. This mainly applies to the back pockets, but you can do this with the front pockets as well for good measure.








, Slide the pants over the ironing board so that you are working on the upper 25% only. Press the waistband down by setting the iron on the fabric for a few seconds, and then lifting it up again. Don’t move the iron around, just press it down. Keep the pockets inside-out as you do this.









Pay attention to any pleats at the waistband. Fold them back in place and iron them flat if they’re present.

, Unless your pants were left crumpled in a laundry hamper for several days, they probably won’t have a ton of wrinkles down the length of the legs. However, remove any that might be present by pressing them out with the iron. Set the iron down flat on any wrinkles for a few seconds.









Make sure to get both the front and back of the pants, in order to remove all wrinkles.

, Many classic dress pants have a crease down the center of the leg. Create this by laying a single pant leg on the ironing board so that the inseams are directly over each other. Press the iron down at the top and bottom of the leg, and then ‘connect the dots’ by pressing the rest of the crease between the two iron points.









Keep an eye on the inseams to make sure they are lined up throughout the process.
The crease should stop at the bottom of the pockets (on the inside of the pants) on the front of the leg., When you’re finished ironing, let the iron and your pants both cool down. If you attempt to fold or hang your freshly-ironed pants while they’re still warm or hot, they will form new creases from being folded. Wait till everything is cool to the touch before putting it all away.









Make sure to fold or hang your pants if you don’t intend to wear them right away.

Use an old wood shelf that’s not bigger than 48 x 36 in (122 x 91 cm) or purchase plywood at your local lumber store. Make sure the plywood is between 1⁄2 and 3⁄4 inch (1.3 and 1.9 cm) thick so it’s not too heavy., You can use an old towel or quilt batting for the cushioned part of your ironing board. Use a cotton/polyester blend if you decide on batting and double the thickness of any towel you use. Trace the size of batting to fit on the top and sides of your board., The fabric you use to cover the ironing board should be heavy, so it can withstand lots of high heat from your iron. Choose duck-cloth or linen fabric. Measure the fabric covering to be twice the size of the board’s length and 4 inches (10 cm) wider on the remaining three sides., Place the ironing board’s cushioning just right before you wrap the top fabric around it snugly. Position the batting or towel directly in the middle of the wood board., If you want to make sure the cushioning doesn’t move around when you wrap the fabric, secure it with staples on the sides. Use a staple gun to staple the cushioning in the middle of each side of the board. Use light tension to pull the towel or batting tight on each side. Don’t worry about pulling it too tight, because the fabric will flatten the cushioning out., Position one of the longest ends of your cut fabric over the top of the cushioning and the board. Place the fabric so that the board lays directly in the middle of it and so that the 4 inches (10 cm) around the three remaining sides is even., Hold the fabric in place while you flip the board upside down. Spread the ends of the fabric out on your workspace and fold the longest piece of fabric over the backside of the board first., Pull the longest fabric piece that’s not on top of your wood board tight as you staple it down on the opposite side. Use a staple gun to place three staples near the edge of the far end of the board., Fold the 4 inches (10 cm) piece of fabric opposite from the long piece you just stapled. Pull the fabric tight while you staple it down with three equally spaced staples along the edge., Before you fold the two leftover sides of fabric, tuck each edge in. Do this by tucking the edge of fabric inwards and towards the board, so that it folds in a small triangle shape. Staple the corners down., Pull the middle of the two sides of fabric you just tucked to keep the fabric nice and flat on your new ironing board. Place one to two staples towards the middle of each on the backside of the board."

Identify an area to house the ironing board and laundry supplies.,
Pick up lumber for shelves.,
Purchase two hooks that will be mounted outside the shelf to hold the top of the ironing board.,
Buy paint or stain (you’ll want the organizer to at least look pretty), sandpaper and liquid nails glue.",How to Create a Laundry Room Ironing Center1," You will be building a small, thin shelf to hold supplies and grab the ironing board. So you’ll need not only an area to house the items, but enough space to allow the ironing board to comfortably be used. If your laundry room isn’t feasible, consider a large closet or spare bedroom for your organizing system.


Make sure you have room on one wall to mount a shelf that will hold your ironing board. Check the wall to ensure you can drive screws into it and that its sturdy enough to hold the supplies.;
, You’ll need a 10-ft. piece of 1x8 and a 2-ft. piece of 1x6. This will be used to create the shelves and overall structure.

, Look for a set that comes with its own pair of screws or mounting materials.

, Big tools you’ll need include a jigsaw, electric screwdriver, clamps, nail gun and safety equipment (glasses and gloves).

Wipe with a damp cloth or sponge.,
Wash cushions separately.,
Hose down outdoor wicker furniture.,
Let the wicker dry.",How to Wash Wicker Furniture1," Use a soft cloth and water to gently wipe down all surfaces of wicker to remove dirt and retain shine.


Try using a mild soap on your cloth or sponge for more stubborn dirt and stains on your wicker, but follow by wiping with just water afterwards.
You can also add salt to water as a non-abrasive way to gently scrub away dirt and stains.Add a mixture of one part white vinegar to three parts water on your cloth if you need to eliminate mold or mildew built up on the wicker.;
, Remove any cushions or other material that is not made of wicker and clean separately.


Check to see if cushions have a tag with care instructions. You may be able to put the entire cushion, or a removable cover, into a washing machine.
When in doubt, opt for gently dabbing at cushion fabric with a damp cloth and a small amount of gentle soap or stain remover.

, Wipe outdoor furniture with a wet cloth or sponge and soap, then rinse with a hose.


Never hose down paper fiber wicker, as it will easily be destroyed by a large amount of water. Washing should mainly be done with care on natural reed or synthetic wicker.If possible, tilt your piece of furniture so that any area with a tighter weave of the wicker is on top. This way, water will run down from it to the looser weave, where it can be wiped away or dried more easily without keeping moisture trapped inside the weave.Steam-clean outdoor wicker furniture with a hand steam-cleaner if it is very dirty. Make sure that you dry the wicker right away with a hair dryer or full sun and wind to avoid the wicker warping or bending., Ensure that the wicker is fully dry after washing and before replacing cushions or using the furniture again.


Keep the furniture in a dry place indoors, outside in the sun in dry conditions, or use a fan or hairdryer at some distance away from the wicker to accelerate drying.
Keep the shape of the wicker as best as possible. Avoid sitting or placing any objects on the furniture before it is completely dry, as the wicker may form a new shape when wet.
Expect to wait several days for the wicker to dry entirely.

Remove any melted-on plastic from your iron.,
Use dryer sheets to keep your iron sparkling and smelling nice.,
Fill your iron’s reservoir with the appropriate kind of water.,
Check the power cord regularly.,
Store the iron properly.",How to Clean the Steam Iron and Its Base Plate," Making a vinegar-based cleaning solution that can disinfect, descale, and deodorize is an economic way to clean inside of your iron. This is also the easiest way to clean parts of the iron that are otherwise unreachable.;
, Set the iron on its hottest setting. If your iron does not have a temperature dial, switch it to cotton on the fabric settings.

, This is accomplished by holding down the steam button while pressing the iron into a hand towel on the ironing board. Vent the steam in 20-30 second bursts in this manner for a total of one and a half minutes.

, If there is any solution left after venting, be sure to discard or repurpose it for something else. It has already run through the iron and is not needed in the following step.

, This will ensure that all of the vinegar is removed from the iron’s ductwork and reservoir. Drain any remaining water from the reservoir. , The resulting slurry will act as a mild abrasive and help to remove stubborn buildup on the base plate of the iron. This is particularly useful when an iron’s base plate is scorched and no longer glides over the ironing board smoothly.

, Spread an even layer of the slurry onto the base plate of the iron and gently wipe it with a dampened hand towel in a scrubbing motion. Remove any excess.

, Continue scrubbing and removing buildup in a soft but deliberate manner being careful not to scratch the base plate. Damage to non-stick surfaces can lead to permanent discoloration and rust., Over time these can become clogged with minerals found in ordinary tap water. If your iron is having trouble producing steam, get rid of scale buildup in or around the steam ducts by using a toothbrush, toothpick, cotton swab, or other soft object to remove any visible residue from the area.

, Some steam irons will have non-coated base or sole plates. Though these can be cleaned with the aforementioned salt and vinegar solution, they may benefit from a commercial iron cleaner as well. An extra-fine abrasive may be used as a last resort., Chill the iron by placing its base plate in a shallow bowl of ice water. This will firm up the plastic and allow for easy removal. Scrape any plastic away with a dull plastic knife, plastic spatula, or credit card edge. , Run a hot iron over a dryer sheet and then a hand towel. Alternate back and forth between the two. This will improve the luster of your iron by removing oils and small particles of scorched cloth or dust.

, Depending upon the hardness of your local tap water, the durability of certain internal parts of your iron, and the frequency of use, your iron may call for specific kinds of water. Spring water is always appropriate; however, an equitable and less expensive option is filtered tap water., Note any damage, fraying, or kinks in the iron’s cord. Damage to this area might be a potential fire hazard. If damaged, discontinue use until the cord is repaired.

, Never put unnecessary stress on the iron by storing it on its side or back. An iron should be stored sitting upright in an area where it is stable and will not fall. This is also a safety precaution and ensures that if the iron were heated, the base plate would not be touching a cloth surface that can be damaged as it heats.

, Check for white residue in the holes, or steam ducts, on the iron’s soleplate. Remove any residue you see using a wood or plastic toothpick, toothbrush, or cotton swab. This can help your vinegar mixture better clean the reservation and its ducts onto the plate.








Avoid using anything metal to remove residue because this can scratch the iron’s surface.

, Mix one quarter cup (60ml) white vinegar and ¾ cup (180ml) distilled water in a cup with a spout.With the iron upright, pour this mixture into the water reservoir until it is about one-third full.








Use a larger amount of distilled white vinegar or only vinegar for very clogged irons.

, Plug in your iron again and set it to the steam feature.The heat setting should be at medium to high.Allow it to heat for at least 5 minutes. This flushes out mineral deposits and makes it easier to clean the ducts., Now it’s time to really let the vinegar work its magic. Push down on the steam button and hold it for 20-30 seconds. Repeat at least 6 times, or until the steam flows freely from your iron.







, Unplug your iron again and let it cool off completely. Then pour out any remaining vinegar







, Fill the reservoir with one cup (240ml) plain, distilled water. Turn on the iron again and hold the steam button again. This will clear any traces of remaining mineral deposits or vinegar., Before you begin cleaning, make sure that your iron is unplugged and cooled off. This can ensure that you don’t burn or electrocute yourself while cleaning.

, White residue in the holes of the soleplate is often mineral deposit. Before you clean the soleplate, use a wood or plastic toothpick, toothbrush, or cotton swab to remove this. This allows the vinegar mixture to penetrate and clean the iron’s surface.








Avoid using metal tools to clean visible deposits. This can scratch the surface of the iron.

, Mix equal parts table or kosher salt or baking soda and distilled white vinegar. Stir them into a paste to scrub starch, mineral deposits, and or sizing residue from your iron’s soleplate., Dip a clean, white cloth into the paste. Moving in circles, rub the mixture over the soleplate. Use slightly more pressure for heavily soiled soleplates.








Scrub the steam duct opening with a dab of the paste on a cotton swab. This allows you to more effectively clear away any residue or deposits.

, Wet a separate clean, white cloth. Wipe the surface of the soleplate to remove the paste and any residue or deposits. Repeat scrubbing and rinsing as necessary to remove all of the buildup.







, Never scrub or rub your iron soleplates with a scouring pad, steel wool or abrasive cleansers. You should also gently scrub the surface. Doing this can ensure that you don’t scratch the surface, which can lead to rusting and further staining."

Dust with a feather duster or dry cloth.,
Vacuum with a brush attachment.,
Use a soft brush.",How to Wash Wicker Furniture2," Use a microfiber duster, soft cloth, or feather duster to remove any dust or dirt that has accumulated on the surface.


Try a duster with small nubs, feathers, or texture that will help get into the small cracks of the wicker weave.

, Use a vacuum with a brush attachment on the hose to gently remove dust from on and inside the weave of your wicker.


Make sure the vacuum is at a low suction setting to avoid damage, and brush it gently across the surface of the wicker.
For larger dirt, dust, or other objects stuck in the wicker, try using a pair of tweezers or needle-nose pliers to remove it., Remove dust and dirt from between the weave of your wicker by sweeping a cleaning brush gently across the surface.


Try a paintbrush or even a toothbrush for smaller, hard-to-reach areas.Make sure to use any brush lightly, so as not to disrupt or dislodge any of the wicker.

",How to Wash Wicker Furniture3," Apply water to your furniture only when strictly necessary, sticking to dusting and vacuuming regularly when dust and dirt appear.


A more thorough hose-down cleaning should only be needed about once a year, if that.Do wash away spills and stains as soon as possible with a damp cloth and mild soap, as wicker will absorb any spilled moisture.Use as little water as possible when you do need to use it, as more moisture will only damage the wicker further over time.

, Protect your furniture from damage by using a varnish, lacquer, or wax meant for use on wicker. Apply it in a thin layer with a brush or cloth, or in a spray form if possible.


Try linseed oil or lemon oil as a natural method to help protect the wicker and boost its shine.
Use a lacquer specifically meant for weatherproofing if you intend to start or continue using the wicker furniture outside.

, Apply a small amount of wood glue to any slats of the wicker that appear broken or fraying.


You can also trim pieces of wicker that are frayed or broken and sticking out by using a pair of scissors to cut them away as cleanly as possible. Avoid pulling at any errant pieces.If damage is more extensive, you may need to take the furniture in to a professional, or replace it completely.

, Avoid direct sunlight, rain, snow, or heavy wind on your outdoor wicker furniture whenever possible.


Cover or place your wicker furniture under a roof, deck, or canopy while not in use. You can also bring wicker furniture inside, if possible, to help preserve its life.
Care for indoor furniture should also be taken by controlling humidity as best as possible. Use a humidifier in dry climates to avoid drying and cracking wicker, and use a dehumidifier or place wicker furniture in a room with good air circulation if in a very humid environment.,"

Use a suitable upholstery cleaner on remaining stains.,
Repeat cleaning measures as necessary.,
Call a cleaning professional.",How to Clean White Furniture," Use a soft brush attachment to protect the fabric while cleaning.Pay close attention to gaps, corners, nooks, and crannies. Dirt and debris often accumulate in these places.


Using wet cleaning measure before vacuuming can cause loose dirt and debris to become ingrained in the fabric, making it more difficult to clean.
Removing loose debris from your furniture will make it easier to find and remove stains. Light stains often hide underneath thin layers of dust.;
, Some furniture may be damaged by certain cleaners or methods of cleaning. Check the tag on your furniture to learn which cleaners and methods to avoid. In the event your tag is damaged or lost, look up this information online.


For example, when cleaning leather furniture, you should avoid using water. Use steam cleaners or specially formulated leather cleaning solutions instead.
Abbreviations on the furniture tag, called “cleaning codes,” indicate how to safely clean dirty furniture. The most common of these are:
W: clean with a water based cleaner.
S: use a waterless cleaner, like a dry cleaning solvent.
WS: use either a water based cleaner or a waterless product.
X: vacuum and brush the furniture, but only use a professional service otherwise., Some stains, like those from coffee, red wine, and blood, may require special treatment to remove. If you do not know the source of the stain, examine its shape and color to try and determine its cause.Before cleaning stains generally accepted as difficult to remove, like coffee, red wine, and blood, look up the proper cleaning procedure online to prevent yourself from accidentally ingraining it in the fabric.

, Wipe spots gently in a blotting motion with baby wipes. If you don’t have baby wipes, similarly clean spots with a clean microfiber cloth dampened with cool water and a small amount of mild laundry detergent mixed together.Always test cleaning agents on an out of sight part of your furniture before cleaning visible sections. If the fabric is discolored or negatively impacted by the cleaner, refrain from using it.
In most cases, the cleaning agents in baby wipes will be gentle enough to clean your furniture without damaging it.
When spot cleaning, refrain from soaking the fabric all the way through. This could cause the quality of the fabric to deteriorate., Fill a bucket with cool water. Add a small amount of dish soap. Stir the water until bubbles form. Wet a clean microfiber cloth in the solution. Wring out excess water. Lightly wipe the furniture to clean its fabric.Avoid over saturating the fabric of the furniture when cleaning in this fashion. Only a light to moderate amount of water should soak into the furniture fabric.
While wiping the furniture, follow the natural grain (direction) of the fabric. Going against the grain could damage its appearance.

, The machine wash instructions for your furniture should be listed on its label. Use a cold cycle and an appropriate amount of detergent. Avoid machine washing too frequently, as this can sometimes cause fabric to break down more quickly.If your label has fallen off or is impossible to read, look up machine washing instructions by searching for the furniture name and manufacturer online.
Unless otherwise indicated, do not dry your furniture covers in a dryer. Doing so may cause the quality of your fabric to deteriorate.
For an even higher quality cleaning, take your furniture covers to a dry cleaner. Dry cleaning information should be indicated on the furniture’s label.

, Some fabrics used in white furniture, like leather, shouldn’t be exposed to water if it can be helped. Water can stain or damage these kinds of fabrics. A steam cleaner is usually an effective and safe upholstery cleaning tool in these cases.


The operation of your steam cleaner will depend on its make and model. Follow the instructions that came with your steam cleaner for best results.
For small areas that need additional cleaning power, use the “Steam” function of an iron to apply a burst or two of steam before using general cleaning measures., Air drying is the gentlest way of removing moisture from furniture fabric. Position the cleaned furniture somewhere it won’t be touched and re-dirtied. Some furniture may take up to 48 hours to dry.In some cases, you may need to repeat certain techniques, like wiping the fabric with cool, soapy water, several times before dirt is fully removed.
To prevent the furniture from being over saturated with water, allow it to dry completely after applying each cleaning technique.
Speed up the drying process by opening windows. Though the natural drying option is always best, you could also speed up drying by blowing on wet spots with a hairdryer., Target stains that remain after spot cleaning or general cleaning with undiluted white vinegar or vodka. Similar to spot cleaning, dampen a clean microfiber cloth with vinegar or vodka and blot the stain. Do not over saturate the fabric.


Although the smell of vinegar and vodka may be strong when first applied, when these liquids dry the smell should disappear., These kinds of stains can be removed from many fabrics with a thin layer of paste made from a small amount of baking soda and water. Cover the stain completely with the paste. Wait five minutes, then blot the paste from the fabric with a clean, water dampened microfiber cloth.After the majority of the wine stain has been removed, use a general cleaning measure to remove anything that remains.

, Dampen a microfiber cloth with mild hand soap or dish soap and cold water. Lightly work this mixture into the stained fabric in a blotting motion. With a clean microfiber cloth dampened with cold water, blot the stain to remove the soap. When the stain has faded, wash the fabric as you would normally.


Avoid applying heat to blood and other protein stains, as it will usually make them more difficult to remove.
In some cases, you might not be able to clean blood stains that have set in the fabric of the furniture.
For severe stains, you may need to use soap and cold water several times before the stain fades sufficiently. Allow the fabric to dry naturally in between applications., Specially formulated upholstery cleaner can be found at most general retailers, like Walmart and Target, and hardware stores. Each cleaner will be different, so you should use it according to its label directions.Read the usage instructions of cleaners carefully before purchasing them. Some may be intended for certain fabrics or stains.
Some upholstery cleaners may use harsh chemicals that can break down the fabric of your furniture if used too often.

, You may need to repeat general cleaning measures after the fabric dries from its upholstery cleaner treatment. If the stain remains after the second round of general cleaning, allow the fabric to dry and repeat the upholstery cleaner treatment. Repeat this process as necessary., Professional furniture cleaners have tools and techniques that allow them to remove dirtiness from deep inside the fabric. Schedule a professional cleaning for your furniture about once a year to keep your white furniture in the best condition.


If your furniture is especially old or valuable, to prevent accidental damage, you may want to only use a professional service.
When a professional cleaner visits, ask them about ways you can maintain and clean your furniture on your own."

Wipe down with soap and water.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Store cushions separately.,
Avoid pressure washing.",How to Clean Teak Furniture1," When cleaning your teak furniture, you should always start at the bottom and keep cleaning as you move up to the top of the furniture. This will help you avoid any streaks or irregularities caused by the cleaning solution or the cleaning process.Starting at the top may be tempting, as it is the most visible part of your teak furniture. But beginning here could damage your furniture, or make it become more unsightly.;
, The best way to keep your teak furniture clean and looking great is to give it a quick wipe down with soap and water once every few weeks. This kind of maintenance will prevent discoloration and the buildup of grime and mildew. Simply apply some mild liquid soap to a sponge and wipe down the surface.You can also add a bit of bleach or vinegar to the soap to get it extra clean.

, Be sure to rinse the soap off thoroughly to avoid leaving any soap residue, as this could cause more buildup of grime over time. If you are cleaning your teak furniture outside, use a garden hose to rinse off the soap.


If you are cleaning the teak furniture indoors, use a damp cloth to remove the soap residue. Be sure to frequently rinse the cloth out so that you don’t keep reapplying the soapy water.
Let the teak furniture air dry when you finish rinsing it off.

, The oil in the teak wood often leaks out, especially in the first few months after application, and can stain fabrics that it comes in contact with. If you have cushions on your teak furniture, you should consider storing them separately from the teak furniture itself. This will help your teak furniture look nicer for a longer period of time.This is especially important when it’s raining, and right after you’ve oiled the teak wood.

, Pressure washing can be a great way to clean lots of surfaces, but your teak furniture shouldn’t be one of them. It may seem like a simple solution, but it can wear down the surface of the teak wood over time and cause more damage. If cracks develop in the wood, shooting water into the cracks at high velocities will cause the wood to become deformed over time.Pressure washing can also remove any finish that might be protecting the teak wood, causing more damage in the long run.

Make a bleach cleaning solution.,
Apply the bleach with a brush.,
Use a brush to scrub.,
Use store-bought teak cleaner.,
Rinse off the cleaning solution.",How to Clean Teak Furniture2," Mix together 1  c (240 mL) of chlorine bleach, 1  c (240 mL) of laundry detergent, and 1 US gal (3.8 L) of warm water. This mixture will create a cleaning solution that is strong enough to remove most dirt and stains, but gentle enough to keep from damaging your teak furniture.As always when handling bleach, be careful not to get it on any other materials.

, Use a soft plastic brush to apply the bleach solution and gently scrub it into the teak wood. Let the solution sit for approximately 15 minutes and then rinse it off completely with water.


Make sure to do this cleaning outdoors. If you must do it inside, use a drop cloth on the floor to avoid spilling any bleach around your home and damaging something.

, Instead of power washing away all of the dirt (along with all of the protective elements), use a handheld scrubbing brush to get a controlled clean for your teak furniture. Gently scrub away any stains or imperfections in the wood. But don’t scrub too hard or you might damage the wood permanently.Getting the teak wood wet first can help the scrubbing process be more effective. And a constant flow of water will help rinse away any dirt or grime as you clean.

, This cleaning method is more aggressive in fighting stains and signs of wear. So it may be better suited for teak furniture that has been left outdoors for long periods of time. Simply apply the teak cleaning solution to the furniture and scrub it in with a soft brush. Generally, you should let it remain on the teak for 15 minutes or so before you rinse it off with the hose.Follow the directions for application on the bottle.
Look for the active ingredient oxalic acid in any store-bought teak cleaner.

, Whether you use store-bought teak cleaner or a bleach cleaning solution, you’ll need to rinse off any remaining residue after you finish cleaning. Use a garden hose to rinse the teak off completely and let it air dry.


If you are cleaning your teak furniture indoors, use a damp cloth to wipe off any remaining cleaner residue.

Oil the teak wood.,
Apply a synthetic-resin sealer.,
Re-stain the wood once every few years.,
Store the furniture out of direct sunlight.",How to Clean Teak Furniture3," Purchase some Tung or Linseed oil at your local home improvement store and apply it to the furniture. Use a paintbrush to make even strokes across the entire surface of the teak wood furniture. You can use a damp cloth the wipe up any excess oil as you continue painting. Continue painting until the wood seems saturated and doesn’t soak up any more of the oil.Be sure to thoroughly clean the teak furniture before you apply any oil.

, This kind of stain or sealant will help protect your teak furniture from the elements and prevent damage in the future. Purchase some sealer from your local home improvement store and apply it using a paint brush. Let the stain dry completely before using the furniture again – this usually takes about 24 hours.Be sure to get a sealer or stain that is approved for use on teak wood.

, As with any wood product, teak furniture will need to be re-stained once every 2-3 years. The stain loses its effectiveness over time and needs to be replaced. Once you start noticing more cracks in the teak wood, you’ll need to start thinking about staining it again to seal up those cracks and protect the wood.This step isn’t necessary if you’ve opted to keep up the natural, unstained appearance of the teak wood. However, unstained teak requires more regular cleaning.

, Nothing will make teak age and weather faster than constant, direct contact with sunlight. This will cause your teak furniture to look older and to need more maintenance as time goes on. Try to put your teak furniture in a place that gets a lot of shade, at least during part of the day.Consider storing your outdoor teak furniture in a shed completely away from the sunlight during the winter months when you aren’t using it as much.

Wipe grease stains away with a dry cloth.,
Use rubbing alcohol to handle ink stains.,
Mix lemon juice and cream of tartar to handle dark spots.",How to Clean White Leather Furniture1," Adding a fluid or other cleaning solution will only help the stain set. It’s important to deal with these stains promptly so they don’t have a chance to set.


If the stain has had time to set, you can sprinkle baking soda on it. Leave it for a few hours, allowing the grease to soak into the baking soda. Then, brush everything off with a rag.;
, Take a cotton swab and dip it in rubbing alcohol. Rub at the stain until the ink is lifted. If the stain is particularly large, you might need more than one cotton swab to take care of it., Mix equal quantities of each ingredient, creating a paste. The amount of paste you need to make depends on the size of the spot you’re trying to clear. Slather the paste on the stain, and let it stand for 10 minutes before wiping it away with a damp cloth."

Get the necessary equipment together.,
Sort your laundry by material.,
Check that the iron is ready.,
Use a damp cloth when ironing lace and wool.,
Make sure cotton and polyester fabrics are damp prior to ironing.,
Turn delicate fabrics inside out prior to ironing.,
Iron shirts from the collar down.,
Iron pants from the waist to the leg.,
Iron skirts and dresses from the collar down.,
Keep your iron away from small children.,
Let an iron cool off for at least 10 minutes before putting it away.,
Consider purchasing an iron with built in safety features.,
Treat a burn quickly in the event of an accident.,
Do not leave a hot iron face down.",How to Iron," As the iron can get hot, you want to have all your materials assembled before you begin ironing. You do not want to be fumbling with a hot iron while trying to grab something, so have everything ready before turning the iron on.You will need an ironing board, which is a large, flat surface over which you can iron your clothing.
You will need an old cloth to protect delicate items.;
, Different materials require different means of ironing. You should sort your clothing by material. Cotton clothing, for example, should be ironed differently than silk clothing. You will want to start ironing the clothes that require the lowest heat setting, and then move up.Acetate, rayon, silk, and wool should all be ironed at a low setting. For rayon and silk, turn the items inside out prior to ironing. For wool items, place a damp cloth between the item and the iron.
Medium heat should be used for polyester, and high heat should be used for cotton. Both fabrics should be slightly damp prior to ironing.

, Irons indicate they are ready in different ways. A light may turn on or off, or an icon may display indicating it's safe to iron. Make sure to wait until the iron is ready to begin. Ironing with a cool iron will be inefficient.If you're unsure how your iron indicates it's ready, check your instruction manual.

, Delicate fabrics should not have direct contact with the iron. Lace and wool should not be ironed directly. Use a damp cloth when ironing these types of fabrics.








Make sure the cloth is damp and not sopping wet.
If you're unsure of the fabric's material, check the label. This should tell you what the clothing is made from.

, Cotton and polyester should not be ironed dry. Make sure items made from these materials are slightly damp prior to ironing.








You can pull cotton and polyester items out of the dryer before they get completely dry. You can also spritz them with a spray bottle filled with water to get them damp.

, Some fabrics are very delicate. Ironing the surface can cause the fabric to look burnt or damaged. If you're working with any of the following fabrics, turn the clothing items inside out prior to ironing:








Corduroy
Linen
Rayon
Satin
Silk

, When you iron a shirt, you should start at the collar. Start at the center of the underside of your shirt collar and work your way to the edge. Then, move back to the center and proceed to the other edge.








Drape one side of the shirt's shoulder over the edge of your iron board. Work the iron from the shoulder to the back. Repeat on the other side.
Work from the cuff to the shoulder when ironing sleeves.

, If your pants have pockets, turn them inside out and begin by ironing the pockets. If they do not have pockets, you can proceed to the regular ironing process. Drape the top of the pants over the ironing board and start by ironing the waist. Make sure to go lightly when ironing over pockets, as you do not want to create pocket lines.








From here, lay the pants on the ironing board flat, with one leg laying on top of the other. You more or less want to fold the pants in half horizontally. Make sure the legs and seams line up. Fold the top leg back over the waist. Iron the backside of the bottom leg. Then, flip the pants over and repeat on the other side.

, If your dress has a collar or sleeves, these can be ironed the same way you ironed a shirt's sleeve and collars. With the skirt, drape it over the ironing board. Iron upward, moving from the bottom to the waist.








If a skirt is embellished with ruffles, iron the inside of the skirt to avoid flattening the design.
Items like buttons should be ironed around, as skirts and dresses have delicate buttons that are prone to damage.

, An iron is very hot and can cause serious injury for children. Ironing is not an appropriate household chore for small children. You should also keep your iron out of reach of kids when you're ironing., An iron gets extremely hot, and could potentially start a fire. After you finish ironing, turn the iron off. You should wait at least 10 minutes before storing the iron, as that will give it adequate time to cool.

, As an iron can be dangerous, consider purchasing one with safety features. Safety features can help prevent accidents.A cordless iron can be a great investment. If someone trips over the iron's cord while you're working, you or the other person could get burnt.
An iron with an automatic shut off feature can also help. This way, if you accidentally leave the iron on, it will not start a fire.

, A burn will heal faster and hurt less with proper treatment. As soon as you or someone else is burnt, run the burn under cool running water for about 20 minutes.Never use ice, oil, butter, or soy sauce on a burn. This can cause skin damage.
If a burn is bigger than a small coin, seek medical attention.

, This could cause the iron to burn a surface, and even start a fire. Always stand the iron upright when you need to step away from your ironing for a moment."

Mix water, dish detergent and a powdered stain remover in a bowl.,
Mix Borax and baking soda with warm water.,
Combine white vinegar and water.",How to Clean White Leather Furniture2," Add a tablespoon (14.8g) of stain remover such as OxiClean and half a teaspoon (2.5ml) of dish detergent to a bowl of warm water. You can use a spoon to mix the solution together. The detergent will clean the surface gently while the stain remover will lift any stains that have set, brightening and revitalizing the leather.


This solution can be used with a variety of cleaning tools, such as rags, sponges and toothbrushes., Use 1 teaspoon (5g) of Borax, 1 tablespoon (15g) of baking soda and half a cup (118ml) of water. Mix these ingredients in a bowl.


This is a very similar solution to that used in Mr. Clean Magic Erasers, which will greatly help lift stains when used with a slightly abrasive sponge., You’ll want to mix equal parts of both liquids. For example, if you use 6 ounces (177ml) of vinegar, you’ll need to mix in 6 ounces (177ml) of water. The exact amount of solution you need will depend on the size of the furniture you’re cleaning. Mix the solution together in a bowl, although you may need to use a bucket if you’re using a large amount of cleaning solution.


This solution is best used with a microfiber cloth, but a rag can do just fine."

Buy a melamine sponge.,
Soak up the solution with the sponge and wipe the leather.,
Use a toothbrush for your furniture’s tighter spots.,
Wipe the leather with a dry cloth.",How to Clean White Leather Furniture3," Melamine makes these sponges denser than regular cleaning sponges. They also have pores that serve a dual purpose. They absorb any cleaning solution they’re put into contact with and give the sponge a slight abrasive quality. These make them more effective for cleaning marks and stains. You can buy these sponges in bulk on eBay and other online stores.


You can buy these sponges under the Mr. Clean brand; they come already soaked with cleaning solution. Otherwise you can buy the sponges in bulk and soak them in homemade cleaning solutions.You can also use a cloth instead of a melamine sponge, but be aware it won’t clean as deeply as a sponge. Use a clean rag; any dirt on it could leak out into your cleaning solution., Make sure to squeeze any excess solution. Your sponge should be damp, holding enough solution to clean your surface. It shouldn’t be leaking. Wipe the leather gently, since the sponge’s abrasiveness could damage the leather’s coating if too much pressure is used.


You use a cloth for this step. Note that since a cloth is less abrasive than a melamine sponge, you can use a bit more pressure as you clean., This includes stitching, creases and crevices where the various parts of the furniture meet. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and make sure to scrub gently. You can dip the toothbrush in your cleaning solution to dislodge any spots on the couch.

, Leaving any cleaning solution on leather for an extended period can damage the surface. Wipe thoroughly until the surface is completely dry."

Check your vinyl seats’ care and maintenance instructions.,
Remove the cushions.,
Use soft cleaning implements.,
Clean your vinyl seats with distilled water.,
Wash your seats with soapy water.,
Do not use abrasive cleaning compounds.",How to Clean Vinyl Seats1," Every vinyl seat is a bit different from all the others. The care and maintenance guide provided by the manufacturer when you obtained your vinyl seating will provide special tips and tricks for cleaning that apply to your specific seat or set of seats.For instance, you might find recommendations or proscriptions for certain cleaning products and methods, or advice about how to tackle hard-to-clean areas of your vinyl seating.;
, If your vinyl seat includes removable cushions, take them off before you start cleaning. Clean them separately from the main “base” of the seat. This will allow you to better clean the back and underside of the cushions, as well as the “base” upon which they sit., Only clean your vinyl seats with soft sponges, dish cloths, and soft-bristled brushes. This will ensure your vinyl seats last for many years. Using steel wool, sharp cleaning tools, or similarly abrasive cleaning implements could cause your vinyl seating to tear., Dip a sponge or cloth into distilled water. Wipe the seats down gently as needed. Then, dry them with another cloth or sponge afterwards. This will get your vinyl seats clean and dry.Distilled water is your safest bet.

, If cleaning your vinyl seats with water didn’t do the trick, try again using soap and water. Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water until the mixture is sudsy. Dip a soft-bristled brush in the water. Scrub the vinyl seats until clean. This might best be accomplished outdoors.If you can take your vinyl seats outside, use a hose to rinse them off. This will both keep your floors clean and enable you to enjoy the washing and rinsing process in the open air.
Alternately, you might want to clean your vinyl seats in your tub, if they fit.
If you cannot easily take your vinyl seats outside, rinse them with a damp cloth.

, Vinyl seats are pretty tough – that’s why they are so widely used in boats, cars, and interior furniture. But vinyl can still be damaged. Undiluted bleach, for instance, is too caustic to use on vinyl. Over time, cleaning your vinyl seats with bleach will cause them to break down.Likewise, avoid cleaning compounds containing:concentrated detergents
silicone oils
waxes
petroleum distillates
dry cleaning fluids
solvents
acid-based cleaners

Pull the ties until your fingers go white, tie into a bow, and you're all done.",How to Make an Ironing Board Cover," Important - do not cut the ties or the casing. You need to keep them in one piece for later. Smooth out the IBC completely flat and press (heh! now you've no ironing board to press the IBC on; you can use a towel on the table).;
, Measure 1"" (2.5cm) from the outer edge of the casing all around the IBC.

, Be careful not to make the first incision from the outer edge of the IBC. Keep the precious margin for later.

, Lay the old IBC (minus the margin you've just cut off) onto your new IBC fabric and using the old IBC as a guide cut out the new IBC plus a 1"" (2.5cm) margin. Set aside the old IBC, you're done with it now.

, Bring the right sides (and raw edges) of the margin and the new IBC fabric together. Match the position of the flat edge and pointed ends (of the IBC) on the margin to the new IBC as best as you can - it doesn't have to be exact as all of this will be on the underside.

, Work your way up evenly on both sides (in other words do not pin one side to the pointed end before doing the other side). Stop pinning before you reach the tip (see pic).

, Continue pinning the margin to the new IBC fabric.

, As you pin the margin to the new IBC you'll notice that the new IBC fabric ruffles up. Ruffling up is all right, just keep the ruffles reasonably equal in size and be generous with the pins.

, It is recommended that you have no less than a 1cm (3/8"") seam allowance, and stitch on the margin side, it's easier. If you have a stitch on your sewing machine (like the one that the scissors are pointing to in this image), use that because it does a straight stitch and a zig-zag all in one go, which is handy because it stitches fabrics and prevents the raw edges from fraying at the same time. Use a short length stitch for strength (because the margin is going to take a lot of tension from having the ties pulled taut in side the casing) with a wide zig-zag. If you don't have a stitch like this on your sewing machine, just sew using a short length straight stitch and then go over the raw edges with a zig-zag stitch.

, This heavy-ish fabric will bulk up the old ironing board padding and will prevent the grid of the frame coming through on your ironing (which is so annoying!). Use your ironing board as a guide and cut around with approx 2 centimeter (0.8 in) extra.

, Starting from the bottom:


lay the new IBC wrong side up, then the old padding, then the furnishing fabric piece, and finally the ironing board frame on the table.
jiggle the layers around until all is even.

, Bet you can't wait to attack that mountain of ironing now... hmm... perhaps you can.

Do a spot test before applying solution for stains.,
Use alcohol for stubborn stains.,
Try vinegar on oil stains.,
When all else fails, scrub.",How to Clean Microsuede Furniture," Running a vacuum over the fabric once a week, or more often if you have a pet that sheds, will keep it looking clean and new.


If you have a very powerful or unwieldy vacuum, use a furniture brush instead.;
, Sprinkle laundry detergent over the fabric, gently brush it into the fabric using a cloth or a brush, and vacuum it up. This is especially useful for preventing the lingering odor of household pets.

, Microsuede furniture should come with a tag printed with a code indicating what kind of cleaning solutions can be used on the material. The code will appear as ""W,"" ""S"" or ""S-W.""


""W"" indicates that a water-based cleaning solution may be used.
""S"" indicates that a solvent-based cleaner (or one which dissolves chemical compounds) can be used.
""S-W"" indicates that you may safely use both types of cleaners.

, Even if the fabric isn't stained, washing it will keep it smelling fresh and looking clean.

, Fill a spray bottle with the type of solution recommended by the manufacturer of your microsuede.

, To clean the entire upholstered surface of the furniture, work in three-foot increments to avoid over-saturating one area.

, Apply pressure to the saturated areas of the microsuede using a clean, non-colored cloth. Gently rub the cloth in a circular motion.


Wipe the fabric with a second sponge to remove excess moisture.

, Microfiber material will dry quickly. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for the furniture to completely dry before using it.

, Some removable microsuede covers are machine washable. Check the manufacturer's instructions before laundering your microsuede.

, If you can catch a spill before it soaks in, you may be able to prevent a stain. A quick wipe with a paper towel or cloth will take care of most small spills.


Don't rub the spill into the fabric; dab it lightly so it won't soak in.
Sprinkle baking soda over larger spills. When it dries, run a vacuum over it.

, Choose a spot on the bottom or back of your furniture; you never know if a stain-removal method might damage or cause discoloration to your fabric.

, Soak a cloth or piece of cotton in rubbing alcohol and gently rub the stain until it is removed.


Hand wipes containing alcohol are useful for this purpose.
You can also use vodka if you don't have rubbing alcohol in the house. Just be sure not to use a liquid that isn't clear.

, Wet a cloth with vinegar and rub the stain until it is removed. To prevent the vinegar smell from lingering, wash the microsuede with water or solvent-based solution, whichever your microsuede requires, after applying the vinegar.

, Use a concentrated amount of the cleaning solution approved by your microsuede manufacturer. Spray the stained area liberally and scrub with a brush until the stain is removed.

Turn the sponge over and cut off portions as necessary in order to expose unsoiled sponge.",How to Clean Soot off Furniture1," Hold the nozzle directly above the soot without touching the surface of the furniture. Do not rub the attachment along the wood, since doing so may inadvertently rub the soot into the wood.;
, A dry sponge is specifically designed for purposes like this. This cleaning tool picks up loose soot without rubbing it into other surfaces and works in the absence of water. Wipe the sponge across the soot in straight, unstopping lines until the surface of the sponge turns black.

, In order to be most effective, you need to wipe the soot away with a clean portion of the dry sponge.


Once one side of the sponge turns black, switch to another side.
After all sides of the sponge are blackened with soot, shave off the surface using a sharp knife to expose clean sponge underneath.

Remove and wash the covers.",How to Clean Suede Furniture1," It is important to consult the instructions for your furniture before you do any sort of cleaning. The instructions will give you an idea about what materials you can and can’t use on the suede. A warranty could be voided if you use something that is not meant to be used on suede., A suede brush is typically inexpensive and will be used often with suede furniture. If you don’t have a suede brush, you can also use a towel, toothbrush, or nail brush. Use the brush to work the nap up on the piece of furniture. Then, scrub harder to remove any spots that may be on the furniture., A suede eraser usually only costs a few dollars. Sometimes a suede kit will come with a brush with an eraser on the back of it. If you don’t have an eraser, you can also use a pencil eraser or crepe rubber. Begin by rubbing gently and then add pressure as you move the eraser back and forth to remove grime and stains., Remove the covers and wash them once a month. Read the instructions to see what setting to wash and dry the suede cover on. For some, you can put them in the washing machine, but others can only be washed by hand. Typically, you should wash in cold water on the gentle cycle. Put the covers back on the furniture once it has been washed and dried.You can likely look up the washing instructions for your brand of furniture on the internet if you don’t have the instructions.

Work the restoration polish into the wood with steel wool.,
Wipe away the restoration cream.",How to Clean Soot off Furniture2," Use a light sweeping motion over the soot once or twice to loosen and brush up surface particles. Do not rub the brush against the wood coarsely, since brush attachments can work soot further into the wood. You should also avoid using the brush against unfinished wood, since it is too easy to work soot further into the exposed grains.


This can be done either before or after using a dry chemical sponge, but it may be most effective if done before you use the sponge.

, Use a cream restoration polish for best results. Apply the cream to the wood and allow it to sit for approximately five minutes. Do not allow it to remain on the wood past ten minutes, since it may actually cause permanent damage to wood if it sits too long.

, Scrub the cream-covered soot stain with #0000 steel wool, following the grain of the wood to preserve the appearance of the finish. Going against the grain will likely cause the wood to lose its sheen.

, Use a soft terrycloth or microfiber towel to remove any remnants of the cream. All of the polish must be removed, or else you may inadvertently damage the look and integrity of the wood.

Clean unfinished wood with a moist cloth and a degreasing detergent.,
Sand away light soot stains in untreated woods with sandpaper.",How to Clean Soot off Furniture3," Restoration polishes should not be used on untreated wood. Instead, mix a strong degreasing detergent into a bucket of hot water and dip a clean rag into the solution. Blot out the soot using the soaked rag, but do not scrub. Scrubbing may only work the soot further into the wood.

, Unfinished wood is more sensitive and easily stained by soot than finished wood. If you cannot remove the soot by blotting it out with soap and water, you can attempt to sand the stain away with fine grit sandpaper. Sandpaper will not work on heavy stains that extend deep into the grains, however.

"
"
Vacuum away excess soot using the plain hose nozzle.,
Wash any removable coverings in the washing machine using a strong liquid detergent.,
Dab a rag drenched in hot water and degreasing detergent on soot spots that cannot be removed.,
Take non-washable fabrics to a laundromat or hire professional cleaners.",How to Clean Soot off Furniture4," Position the nozzle directly above the soot, but do not allow it to touch the surface of the upholstery. Do not use any attachment, either, especially not the brush attachment. Soot stains develop more easily in fabric than in finished wood, so the brush attachment is more likely to rub the soot further in and may pose more harm than good.

, Removable elements usually include cushion covers, throw blankets, and pillowcases on decorative throw pillows. If these are all washable elements, tossing them into a warm wash cycle may be enough to remove any soot damage. Liquid detergents often prove the most effective at cleaning away soot, followed by a combination of powder detergent and bleach.


Note that you may need to wash these coverings several times before the soot comes out completely.

, If soot has gotten onto parts of the upholstered furniture itself—for instance, the side of the soda—you may be able to blot out the soot with a rag drenched in a solution of hot water and liquid degreasing detergent. Do not use plain water, since the oily soot stain will only smear with plain water. Do not scrub, either, since scrubbing may cause the stain to worsen.

, If you have delicate fabrics that cannot be washed in your machine or that cannot stand against household detergents, you may need to turn them over to professionals. Take removable coverings to the laundromat and hire professional cleaners to come to your house and take care of non-removable upholstery.

"
"
Vacuum the soot spot with a plain hose.,
Switch to the brush attachment and give the area a light sweep.,
Wipe the leather down with a dry chemical sponge.,
Cover the remaining soot with corn starch or talcum powder.,
Use specialized leather cleaner on smooth, treated leather.,
Take any deeply stained leather or sensitive leathers, like suede, into a professional cleaner's establishment.",How to Clean Soot off Furniture5," As with wood and other upholstery, hold the hose directly above the soot, getting it as close as possible without touching the soot or leather directly.

, Stiff leathers are a little more durable than other types of fabric upholstery, so you can pass a brush over the soot without risking immediate staining. Pass the brush over the soot lightly, once or twice, to remove free-standing soot. Do not rub.

, Use the same method described for wood, passing clean portions of the sponge over the soot in unstopping lines.

, Leather usually benefits from oil treatments, and the fibers that make up leather allow oil to pass in and out without too much difficulty. Since soot is oil-based, you may be able to work soot out of the leather by drawing and drying it out. Both corn starch and talcum powder are effective drying agents. Liberally sprinkle either powder over the soot and allow it to sit overnight before brushing it off.

, If you cannot draw the soot out of the leather, a leather cleanser may do the trick. Look for a cleanser specifically designed to treat soot or oily stains to reduce the risk of making the stain worse.

, Deep stains may require professional treatment for removal. Sensitive leathers, like suede, should not be home treated and should be taken in for professional cleaning from the start.

Clean up the stain immediately.,
Remove stains with white vinegar.,
Sponge off excess moisture.,
Use alcohol.,
Remove ink with Windex.",How to Clean Suede Furniture2," Do not wait to begin cleaning when something is dropped on the furniture. Immediately use a towel for blotting if liquid has been dropped to avoid the liquid being soaked into the furniture. Once most of the liquid has been blotted up, you can use a cleaning solution to remove the stain., Dip a terry cloth in white vinegar. Begin to rub the stain in a criss-cross motion. Rubbing in a circular motion can cause the suede to darken. Once the stain has lifted, allow the suede to air dry., If water has been dropped and dried, rewet the entire portion of the furniture where the water has been dropped. Then, use a sponge to absorb the excess moisture. The wet spot should blend in with the rest of the suede once it dries.Use a suede brush or towel if the water has just been dropped.

, Dip a terry cloth into alcohol. Do not saturate the cloth in alcohol; it should be damp. Rub the stain until it begins to lift. The alcohol should evaporate quickly., Spray Windex onto the ink stain. Use a cloth or sponge to gently scrub the stain. Scrub until the ink begins to lift and then allow it to air dry."
"
Vacuum regularly.,
Dust off the suede.,
Use baking soda for smells.,
Spray on a stain repellent.",How to Clean Suede Furniture3," Vacuum anytime you notice any crumbs or small particles begin to accumulate. Use the upholstery attachment to vacuum. Vacuum in a cross pattern for best results.Vacuum before every cleaning.

, Dust your suede furniture every few days or every week. Use a duster or cloth. Go over the entirety of the suede portion of the furniture., To remove stains and keep the furniture smelling good, sprinkle some baking soda over the suede. Allow the baking soda to sit overnight. Vacuum it up in the morning., Look for a water and stain repellent made especially for suede, which should be available at most supermarkets. Spray it over all of the suede. The repellent will keep the suede from staining when food and liquid is dropped and keep the suede in good condition for longer."
"
Blot at the paint with a paper towel.,
Mix up a gentle soap solution.,
Go over the stain with a stiff-bristled brush.,
Dry the leather with a towel.",How to Clean Paint Off Leather1," Press the paper towel into the affected area to soak up as much of the wet paint as you can. This will minimize the severity of the stain it leaves behind. Work from the outside of the spot inward, folding the paper towel periodically to make sure you’re using a clean section.Don’t wipe or scrub the spot, as this will only spread the paint around and enlarge the stain.An absorbent towel will work even better for soaking up the wet paint. Dig out an old one, however, because it will likely be permanently stained afterwards.;
, Add a few drops of a mild liquid dish soap to a container of warm water and stir. For best results, use a standard detergent or even hand soap—anything stronger may damage the leather.Avoid soaps and detergents that are advertised as “extra strength” or contain “grease-fighting” agents. These typically contain harsh additives that can strip the color the color from dyed leather and cause cracking or splitting.Soap and water will be useful for cleaning most water-based paints, including interior color and arts and crafts paint., Dip the brush into the soap solution, then shake off the excess water. Wet the paint spot and begin scrubbing it gently. After a few minutes, wipe the area with a clean towel and resume scrubbing. Repeat until the stain has been removed completely.An old toothbrush or nylon dish scrubber will work well for this purpose.
Use just enough force to coax out the stain. Otherwise, you may leave noticeable scratches or scuffs.

, Since leather is a natural material, it’s especially susceptible to water damage. You’ll want to make sure that you’ve dried the surface thoroughly once the paint is all gone. If you don’t, the residual moisture can cause the leather to crack, split or blister.To dry leather safely and effectively, pat it with a microfiber towel or soft kitchen sponge.
Consider treating the surface with a specialty conditioner. A good leather conditioner will enhance the color and texture of leather items while protecting them from spills and other accidents in the future."

Allow the shoes to air dry.",How to Clean Microsuede," Furniture labels will often provide you with a code that tells you how to clean—and how not to clean—your furniture upholstery. Microsuede will generally have one of three labels:W, which means wash with water-based cleaners.
S, which means wash with solvent-based cleaners.
SW, which means you can use either water-based or solvent-based cleaners.;
, Your main cleaning agent will be isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, or another clear alcohol, such as vodka.Alternatively, if your furniture has a W or SW code, you can also use a solution made of water and mild soap or detergent. However, microsuede is prone to water marking,so alcohol is recommended. Along with your cleaning agent, you’ll also need a:Clean, empty spray bottle
White or undyed sponge, towel, or cloth that’s both clean and dry
Soft-bristled brush
Vacuum cleaner

, Remove the cushions and use a soft-brush attachment to vacuum up crumbs, dust, and other debris.Pick up large debris with your hands. Be sure to get into all the nooks, crannies, and cracks, and vacuum the cushions as well.

, Use alcohol for any furniture, or if you prefer (with W and SW furniture), mix about one-half ounce (one tablespoon) of mild liquid soap or detergent with 33 ounces (one liter) of water. Shake well.

, Find an inconspicuous area that’s out of sight and do a test patch with your cleaning agent. Spray a small spot with the alcohol or soap solution, dab it with a clean cloth, and let it dry. After an hour or so, check to see that the cleaner hasn’t caused any:


Discoloring
Changes to the texture (a little stiffness in the fabric is normal)
Color bleeding
Fabric shrinkage

, Spray a small area or a single stain with a minimal amount of cleaner (this will prevent water marks). Use your clean cloth or sponge to wipe the area down, blotting stains and soiled spots. Rotate your cloth often to a clean spot so you aren’t just spreading dirt around.


Work in small patches or tackle one stain at a time until the entire piece is clean.
Don’t forget to clean the cushions as well. If you encounter areas that are particularly stubborn, try rubbing them gently with a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush.

, Using alcohol or minimal amounts of water will ensure that your microsuede is dry in no time, but you can also use an oscillating fan to speed up the process.

, Microsuede can become stiff when it’s cleaned. To restore the texture and return the fabric to its soft state, gently buff it with a soft-bristled brush.Return any cushions to the furniture when you’re done.

, It is recommended that you vacuum your furniture every week or so, especially if it gets frequent use. Deal with spills immediately to prevent staining. Microsuede is designed to repel liquids, so spills will initially bead on the fabric, giving you time to dab them up with a clean cloth before they are absorbed and stain.


In case of a spill that you didn't notice right away, deal with stains as soon as you spot them using the same cleaning process. Spray a small amount of alcohol on the area and wipe with a clean cloth.

, Microsuede is used as a fabric for many items, including clothing, towels, drapes, and mops. These can all be cleaned easily, but handwashing is recommended. Using a spray bottle filled with alcohol or polyester cleaner, spray soiled areas and blot or dab the stains with a clean cloth.


Before cleaning any fabric, always read all tag directions regarding proper washing instructions. Perform a small test patch on the fabric somewhere unnoticeable before applying any cleaning solution to the entire cloth.

, You only need the sink about half full or three-quarters of the way full, depending on how many items you'll be washing. As the water is running, mix in one-half to one ounce (one to two tablespoons) of liquid laundry detergent or mild soap. Wash your microsuede items one at a time. Tackle stubborn dirt with a soft-bristled brush.Alternatively, you can wash microsuede items in the washing machine on the delicate or hand-wash cycle. Wash microsuede items alone together, as this material tends to collect lint from other fabrics.Do not use bleach products or fabric softeners on microsuede., When your items are clean, squeeze each one to get out the water. Lay a clean, dry towel flat on a counter or table. Lay a microsuede item flat on top of the towel. Roll the towel up tightly with the item inside, and the towel will absorb the excess moisture. Unroll the towel and hang the item to air dry. Repeat with all your items, replacing the towel with a dry one if necessary.


A dryer can be used on low-heat or a no-heat setting, but it’s best to hang microsuede fabric on a clothes line or on hangers to air dry.

, Using a soft-bristled brush, get rid of as much dirt, mud, and other particles as you can.

, Use alcohol or a soap-and-water solution. Spray small areas at a time, and brush each area with a toothbrush or soft-bristled brush.

, When they are dry, brush them with a dry, soft-bristled brush if necessary to buff the fabric and restore the microsuede’s soft texture.

, The ways in which you clean the leather will depend upon whether it has been treated with a special coating.


Finished leather has a special resin coating that is applied after the tanning process. It is more stiff, shiny and stain resistant than unfinished leather. It also often has a UV coating and is fade resistant. This is the most common type of finish for leather furniture.
Unfinished leather does not have a coating, in order to keep the original softness and rich color of the leather. It is prone to staining, fading and is more susceptible to moisture damage.

, Use the hose attachments to lift the cushions and vacuum the surface. This will remove dirt and dust that can cause stains.


If a noticeable layer of dust appears on your leather furniture after vacuuming, go over it with a microfiber cloth.

, If you leave for vacation, a sheet will protect the leather from accumulating dust that can lead to a tarnished look.

, Hardened or old stains are extremely hard to remove from leather's surface. Keep in mind that wetting the leather should be kept to a minimum.


Wipe water away with absorbent lint-free towels. Push the water outward in both directions from the place where it spilled. If the water stain leads to discoloration, you can achieve a less noticeable stain if you spread the water over a larger area in a thinner layer.

, Apply very lightly. Follow with a deep leather cleaning.

,


Buy lint-free or microfiber cloths. These will not need to be excessively damp to work well.
Dilute a surface cleaner with water. Dip the cloth into the cleaning mixture and wring it out to make sure it is merely damp, not soaking wet.

Saddle soap can change the color of the leather, so test it 24-hours in advance if you are cleaning your unfinished leather for the first time.

, Apply them according to the soap's directions, covering the entire surface.


Most saddle soap requires you to leave the soap on the leather for a short period of time. Apply a cloth dampened with clean water if directed.

,,, This improves the moisture of the leather and prevent cracking.


If you prefer to use a natural product with dark finished leather, apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then buff it with a clean, dry microfiber cloth.

, Products will have varying times and methods for treatment.

Drizzle a little olive oil onto the stain.,
Rub the oil in with your fingertips.,
Let the oil sit for 2-3 minutes.,
Wipe off the leather.",How to Clean Paint Off Leather2," After dabbing at the worst of the mess with a washcloth or paper towel, pour the oil directly onto the leftover stain. For most paint stains, you’ll only need to use about a nickel-sized amount.If the paint stain is located on a slanted or irregular surface of the leather, such as the back of a couch, you can apply the oil using a washcloth.
Olive oil is a surprisingly efficient remedy for treating oil-based paint stains—you’re essentially fighting oil with oil.

, Massage the pads of your fingers into the stain using a circular motion. The added friction will serve to further loosen the paint. You should be able to observe the paint residue dissolving more or less immediately.For heavy residue or paints of contrasting colors, it may help to work the oil in with a brush to allow it to penetrate deeper.
Scratch at drying flakes lightly with your fingernail to scrape them off before they harden.

, As it sets in, it will begin to emulsify the paint, breaking it down so that it can be lifted away with ease. The longer the oil sits, the more thoroughly it will work.


Olive oil is perfectly safe for occasional use on leather. There’s no risk of staining, fading, discoloration or any other destructive side effects.

, Go over the leather a few times with a clean, dry cloth to remove the remaining paint and excess oil. When you’re done, the leather should be blemish-free and shine like new. Follow up by treating the surface with a trusted leather conditioner, if desired.Make sure there’s no oily mess left on any part of the leather. If loose paint runs, it may streak.
As an added bonus, the olive oil will soften, polish and add a coat of natural waterproofing to the leather."

Scrape away the paint with a sharp object.,
Spray the paint residue with a mild acidic cleanser.,
Scrub and repeat.,
Clear away the last traces of paint.",How to Clean Paint Off Leather3," Tilt the edge or corner of your tool to wedge it underneath the dried paint. Work slowly and carefully so as not to scratch or gouge the leather. The idea is to use the scraper to wear down the paint very gradually, making as little contact as possible with the leather itself.To prevent unnecessary damage, equip a utensil with a blunted edge, such as a palette knife, butter knife or even a metal cake server.Wear down the paint a one small section at a time. This process will require a little bit of patience.

, Combine warm water with fresh lemon juice in a spray bottle and shake well. Mist the stain lightly, keeping the cleanser away from other parts of the leather as best you can. As the paint absorbs the solution, its hold on the surface will begin to weaken..You might also use white vinegar, citric acid or heavily diluted rubbing alcohol.The acidity of the cleaning solution will eat away at hardened residue while leaving the leather unharmed.

, It may be necessary to use a little extra elbow grease to remove a stain that’s been dry for a long time. If the paint is still giving you trouble, try pressing into the spot firmly and swirling the cloth, concentrating the pressure under the tip of one finger. Slowly but surely it will give way.Be sure to wipe away the cleanser promptly. When left for too long, lemon juice can have a bleaching effect on dark-colored leather.Reapply the cleaning solution and repeat as many times as needed until the spot has disappeared.

, Once the stain is gone, wipe the affected area with a damp cloth or sponge. There should be no paint or solution remaining on the surface when you’re done. Towel off the leather and handle it delicately until it’s had a chance to dry completely.


Finish by rubbing in some leather conditioner or moisture-resistant oil for added protection."

Give your suede a rub down.,
Treat suede stains.,
Clean vinyl covers while still on your cushion.,
Use a washing machine when applicable.,
Allow cushions to air dry.Using forced hot air to dry your cushion in a dryer may cause the cover to shrink, rendering it useless.",How to Clean Couch Cushions2," The best and safest way to clean leather cushion covers is to make use of a professional service, like a dry cleaner. Remove the cushion cover from the cushion, and take it to a cleaner of your preference.For general cleaning, you can use a commercial based leather cleaner in water or equal parts white vinegar and water.Damp a soft cloth in your solution and wipe the cushions clean.
Avoid using any harsh cleaners, including bleach and ammonia based cleaners. These can easily damage your cushion beyond repair.

, You should mix one part vinegar per two parts linseed oil and put this solution in a bottle.Shake it well, then rub it into your leather with a dry cloth. After 10 minutes, take a dry cloth and buff out any residual solution.

, Suede is a material that requires attention and care to maintain. Remove your cushions from the couch to a clean area of the floor, and in a criss-cross pattern, vacuum all dust, dirt, and hair from the fabric, preferably with the upholstered attachment of your vacuum.







, There are suede rubbing cloths and suede nap brushes that you can use to polish and restore the luster of your cushion. Thoroughly and completely rub down your cushion on all sides to remove debris with your brush or cloth.








, Create an equal parts warm-water and rubbing alcohol solution in a bottle to treat your stain.Shake the bottle vigorously to mix the solution well, and then moisten a terry cloth rag with your solution. Taking care not to apply too much solution to the fabric, lightly dab the cushion cover.









Rub the stain gently in an X-shaped pattern for best results.

, Vinyl cushion covers usually don’t have to be removed. You can wet a cleaning rag with warm water and add a cap of dish detergent to it, then wipe your cushion clean. Rinse the soap from the rag thoroughly, wring out the rag until it is only damp, and then you should wipe any remaining detergent residue from the cushion. Allow the cushion to air dry, or wipe it down with a clean towel., Some fabric cushion covers are machine wash friendly, though to be certain you should check cushion tags for cleaning instructions. Turn the cover inside out before placing it in the washing machine.To protect colors and the fabric, you should wash your covers on a gentle cycle in cool water unless otherwise directed by the tag or manufacturers instructions.

, Drape your cover somewhere warm and dry and wait until it is dry to the touch.

Create a dish detergent solution for cloth covers.,
Use proper sponging technique.,
Cleanse the cushion of all remaining cleaner.,
Speed the drying process.",How to Clean Couch Cushions3," Tags are a great place to find direction for how to clean and maintain your furniture, but if these don't provide you with what you're looking for, your owner's guide might have the information you seek. Take note of solutions you can use and recommended techniques. Some common abbreviations for upholstery are:


W: Use water-based detergent.
S: Clean with water-free products, for example, dry cleaning solvent.
WS: Either water-based cleaner or water-free cleaner is OK.
X: Professionally cleaning only, though vacuuming is acceptable., A steam upholstery cleaner is specifically intended to deep clean the fabric of your furniture and is available to rent at most local hardware stores. If you use a steam cleaner, allow your furniture extra time to dry, as the cushions take on a considerable amount of moisture through this process., If you lack this tool, you can also use a clean broom, but you'll first need to take your couch cushions outside and place them clean surface. To prevent stains from grass or outside dirt, you may want to lay down a towel or drop cloth before setting your cushions outside.

, Using your carpet beater or a broom, firmly whack all your cushions on both the front and back. This process can sometimes kick up considerable dust, so you may want to consider wearing a dust mask while doing this.








, If you notice discoloration after rinsing, you should not hand or machine wash. Take the cover to the dry cleaner instead.

, Add equal parts mild dish detergent to cool water and agitate the solution until the soap and water mix completely to a whipped consistency. Now you can dip your sponge into the solution, wring out the excess moisture, and begin sponge cleaning the cushion.







, For most fabrics, long strokes will serve you best. Sponge the cushion from one end to the other, working against the nap to bring up stains and remove any deeply buried dirt.








After your first round of sponging, you should repeat the process, only this time applying your sponge with the nap.

, Clean your sponge of any detergent it may have and moisten it with clean water. Repeat the sponging process, cleaning once with and once against the nap to remove all detergent and optimally clean the fabric of your cushion., Though shock-heating treatment can cause your fabric to shrink, using a normal fan to blow dry air over your cushion will help speed the drying process. Sponge cleaning can leave your fabric considerably wet; you should allow the cushion plenty of time to dry all the way through.

Purchase your dry cleaning solvent.,
Open windows and doors.,
Prepare your cleaning rag.,
Spot-test to prevent unsightly damage.,
Press clean your cushion.,
Remove residual dry cleaner solution.",How to Clean Couch Cushions4," This can be a little confusing, as ""dry"" cleaning solvent is generally sold in liquid state. The reason these solutions are so called is because these solvents are made without water.You can find these products in the home supply or cleaning section of most stores. If you cannot find something suitable in your area, an online retailer might be the way to go.

, Dry cleaning solutions can have a very strong odor and can be harmful to your health if breathed in for extended periods. A ceiling or box fan blowing fumes out an open window can help dissipate this smell.







, Putting your cleaner directly onto your cushion cover can do damage to the fabric, as these solutions are typically highly concentrated. To prevent this from happening, apply a small amount of cleaner to a clean rag, and follow any other instructions as directed.








, With your cleaner already applied to your rag, rub the rag on a part of the couch that is out of sight. Allow the spot to dry for about 10 minutes. After that, take a clean piece of paper towel and press it into the fabric where you applied the cleaning solution. If the paper towel picks up dye or the fabric becomes discolored, the solution you bought may be too strong.







, Rubbing your rag applied with solution against the fabric of your cushion can be too abrasive in combination with a harsh cleaning agent. Although this may take a considerable amount of time, you should press the rag and solution into the dirty








Do not apply too much solution to your fabric or you may cause discoloration or harm.
Taking frequent breaks and allow the cushion time to dry between applications can help prevent over-saturation.

, Even trace amounts of dry cleaner solutions can have a negative effect if allowed to remain in the fabric of your cushions. After you have finished applying the solvent and allowed the cleaner to set for the amount of time indicated in the instructions, moisten a clean cloth and blot the areas you have cleaned.








Be sure the cloth you use for blotting is only lightly damp, and rinse and wring it out regularly.

Spray “fabric protector” on your furniture.",How to Clean Microfiber Furniture," Someplace on your microfiber furniture, there should be a small tag with a letter or letters. This small code will explain how you are to clean your microfiber furniture.”W” means you must use a water-based solution.
”S” means you must use a solvent-based cleaner.
”S-W” means you can use either a water-based or solvent-based cleanser.
”X” means you can only use a vacuum. (No water or solvent-based cleansers of any kind).;
, If you are lucky enough to find a “W” tag on your microfiber furniture, you can use most cleaning solutions (or even soapy water). However, by and large, most pieces of microfiber furniture will bear an “S” tag. If you are not able to locate a tag on your furniture, you should treat this like an “S” tag to avoid damaging your microfiber., Once you have determined which types of cleansers are appropriate for your furniture, you can select the right product for you. Many of your options will be products you already have at home. Alternatively, store-bough cleansing solutions will be available at many grocery stores and home improvement stores.Water-based cleansers include: gentle soap, mild dish detergent, carpet cleaner, and upholstery shampoo
Solvent-based cleansers include: rubbing alcohol, clear alcohol like gin or vodka, and dry-cleaning solvents.
Once again, if you have an “X” tag, do not use water or solvent-based cleansers.

, The first step in cleaning your furniture is to remove particles, dirt, and hair using a vacuum. If your furniture has removable cushions, remove these and vacuum on all sides of them, as well as underneath. If you own pets or if your furniture is particularly dirty, you may need to go over it with a vacuum more than once.Use an upholstery attachment to lift out dirt as best you can.
If you do not have an upholstery attachment, you can use a dry bristle brush.

, Once you have selected the appropriate cleaning product for your furniture, it is a good idea to do a spot test to ensure that this product will not cause damage or stains.


Dab a bit of cleanser onto a sponge or washcloth, and apply it to an inconspicuous location.
Wait 15-20 minutes for this area to dry.
If there is no stain or spot, you can go ahead and use this product.

, Whether you will be using a solvent-based solution--like rubbing alcohol--or a water-based one--like dish soap and water--place this cleanser into a bottle with a spray top. Then, mist one area of your furniture piece., Select a sponge that is either light-colored or roughly the same color as your microfiber furniture to reduce color transfer when scrubbing. Using a vigorous motion, scrub the furniture where it has been misted. You should be able to see dirt and stains coming off onto the sponge. When you finish with one area, mist and repeat someplace else., If any wet spots remain after scrubbing your sofa, use a blow dryer to eliminate them. This will reduce any chance of stains on your furniture.Use the blow dryer on its lowest, coolest setting.
Hold the blow dryer 6” away from the fabric.

, In order for microfiber furniture to look its best, it needs to be “fluffed” after cleansing. Otherwise, this fabric can become dull and stiff.After your furniture is clean and dry, grab a dry bristle brush.
Rub the fabric in a circular motion all over the furniture.
You should be able to watch the fabric become fluffier and more attractive as you go!

, Once your sofa, chair, or ottoman is clean and dry, use a spray-on fabric protector to help keep it that way! These products are available at most grocery and home improvement stores.Holding the can upright, keep the nozzle about 6” away from the fabric.
Release the spray using a slow, sweeping motion. Allow to dry.
Add a second coat. Remember: two light coats are better than one heavy coat.
Reapply after every cleaning.

Vacuum it.,
Check the tags for guidance.,
Create a water-based cleaner at home with dishwashing liquid.,
Test the detergent mixture in an inconspicuous spot.,
Dampen stains with a sponge.,
Blot future spills quickly.The best way to avoid extensive cleaning sessions in the future is to act quickly when spills occur, treating them before they stain too severely.",How to Clean Furniture1," Regularly vacuuming your furniture is the easiest part of keeping your furniture clean. Make an effort to clean the cracks and crevices of your furniture between cushions, like the areas where the arms of a sofa meet the back. Take the cushions off, too, and vacuum all sides of them.


The fiber density of microfiber furniture makes them stain-resistant, and lets the majority of dirt and debris be easily brushed loose. Give it a brushing before you vacuum.;
, If your furniture needs a solvent-based cleaner, you’ll want to purchase and utilize that; if your furniture calls for water-based cleaner, you can easily make that at home. If you no longer have the tag, consult a professional.W means: Use water-based detergent.

S means: Clean with a water-free product, like dry cleaning solvent.

WS means: Either a water-based cleaner or a water-free cleaner is appropriate.

X means: Professionally cleaning only, though feel free to vacuum it. Keep this is in mind when purchasing furniture.

, Fill a spray bottle with water, then add a couple drops of dish detergent—liquid, not powder. A capful of white vinegar and a few pinches of baking soda in the mix will combat odor. Shake it up well., Dip a sponge into the detergent mixture and rub some of it onto the back or underside of the upholstery - somewhere where it is not likely to be seen. Wipe the spot dry with a cloth and then let it air dry completely. If any discoloration occurs, don't use the detergent mixture. Consider instead having the furniture cleaned professionally.

, Use a sponge to rub your mixture into the furniture, and pat the upholstery dry with a cloth as you work. Allow the detergent to sit and penetrate for several minutes on any stains or tough spots.

, Always blot liquids, as opposed to scrubbing or rubbing. Vigorous movement can work the liquid further into the furniture at this stage, so the aim is to absorb as much liquid as possible before it soaks in.

Polish the furniture when finished.,
Dust antique furniture regularly.,
Keep antique furniture out of sunlight.,
Use a humidifier in a dry environment.,
Remove antique furniture right away if you suspect a pest infestation.,
Consult an antiques expert before attempting to restore or alter old furniture.,
Test your cleaner on a small portion of the furniture first.,
Avoid using oils on very old furniture.,
Leave paint on furniture alone.",How to Clean Antique Furniture," To start, choose a mild cleaner. As you want to keep antique furniture as damage-free as possible, harsh chemicals are a bad idea. A mild dish soap diluted in water is a safe choice for most antiques. Use dish soap intended for hand washing dishes. Soap that you would use in a dishwasher is more acidic.If dish soap is not successfully removing grime, it's okay to opt for a slightly stronger cleaner. Something like Murphy's Oil would work, but use only a small amount. You should not use an abundance of oily products on older furniture.Some experts feel furniture paste wax, which you can find at most hardware stores or department stores, is a better option for cleaning antiques than oil.;
, To start, wet a rag with a light amount of your chosen cleaner. Gently rub down the surface of the furniture. Keep wiping the surface with the same rag until the rag no longer picks up new dirt or debris.Avoid scrubbing, as this can damage the finish of old furniture. Use gentle wiping motions instead.Move the rag in the direction of the grain of the wood.

, Some areas may have stuck on stains or grime. You can use steel wool to remove these stains as long as you use #0000 wool and work at the stains using gentle motions.Rub in the direction of the wood grain. Keep rubbing until the unwanted dirt and debris is gone.
Make sure not to use too much force. This can damage the finish.

, Some areas in the furniture, like corners or curves, may be hard to reach with a rag. For these areas, use a toothbrush. Dip a toothbrush in your cleaning solution. Following the grain, scrub down hard-to-reach areas until dirt and grime is gone., Once you're finished cleaning, you can wipe down the furniture with a dry rag. Use gentle motions to sop up most of the liquid until the furniture is relatively dry to the touch. Allow the furniture to air dry a bit before continuing with the cleaning process., Once the furniture is dry, add a layer of polish. This will make the finish glow and give the furniture a nice look. To polish, simply take a clean cloth and buff the furniture until it glows.Furniture polishes, especially silicone-based polishes, are best avoided on antiques., To prevent the buildup of grime, dust your furniture regularly. When doing routine dusting in your home, take a rag and dust off any debris built up on antique furniture.


If you're using dusting sprays, go for a mild spray or no spray at all on antiques.

, UV light is very damaging to antiques. Therefore, it's a bad idea to allow your antiques to be exposed to sunlight.Do not leave antiques outside, especially in shaded areas.
Do not store antiques near a window, where they may be exposed to sunlight from outdoors.

, Antique furniture is affected by moisture in the air. Changes in humidity can cause wood to shrink and crack. Keep a humidifier in the room where you store your antiques. This will keep the humidity stable, minimizing the negative affects of changing in moisture in the air., Antique furniture can be very valuable. Therefore, it's a bad idea to allow it to be exposed to pests. Certain types of bugs, like beetles, as well as rats and mice will chew through antique furniture. In the event you notice a pest infestation in your home, remove antique furniture right away. Store the furniture elsewhere until the infestation is resolved.Check for any loose or damaged bits before moving antique furniture. You should not carry furniture in areas that are wobbly or dislodged.
Carry chairs by the seat rails. Carry tables by the apron or legs. Always drag furniture, especially large furniture, across the floor instead of dragging it.

, If you have an antique that's pricey or a collector's item, do not attempt to restore it on your own. Talk to a local antiques dealer and ask for advice or tips. If you're not familiar with restoring furniture, you may want to hire a professional instead of attempting to restore an antique on your own., You want to make sure your chosen cleaner will not harm your antiques. Test a small amount on a tiny area of the furniture that is not easy to see, such as underneath the seat of a chair. Wait a few hours and check. If you do not notice any damage or discoloration to the furniture, this cleaner is probably safe to use., Murphy's Oil, when diluted, is usually safe to use on antiques.However, with very old wood furniture, opt for wax over oil-based products. Wax-based cleaners are a better option, as wax will serve to protect wood as well as clean it., It's common to notice old or chipping paint on antiques. Your first impulse may be to remove such discolorations. However, this is a bad idea and may negatively affect the value of your furniture.Collectors usually want antiques as close to original as possible, including any chipped or stained paint. If you're intending to one day sell your antiques, you should especially avoid altering the paint.

Use a protective spray that is safe for suede.,
Work in an extremely-well ventilated area.,
Begin working one section of the couch at a time, allowing fresh air to fill the room before moving on.,
Work your way through each section of the couch until it has been given a full-coat.,
Allow at least 12-hours to dry.

",How to Clean and Maintain a Suede Couch1," Although not entirely foolproof, treating your couch with a protective spray will help prevent spills from becoming permanent stains.


Some protective sprays are water based while others are a synthetic solvent. Consult your owner's manual to see what type of cleaners are safe for your couch.
Please be aware that if the couch is brand-new that applying fabric/upholstery protector may void the warranty. .;
, Fumes emitted from the aerosol spray can be harmful in many ways and should always be avoided as much as possible.


Be sure to open all windows and use as many fans as available.
Painter's ventilator-masks can also be used.

, This will keep the over-spray to a minimum and allow you to breathe easier.


Be sure to keep the can approximately 8-12 inches away from the area being sprayed. Closer may result in 'running,' while too far away will result in an uneven coat.
Sweep, do not point, the spray can smoothly. If sweeping from left-to-right, begin spraying about six-inches to the left of couch, and stop spraying six-inches after you have passed the right edge., You will need to apply two-three coats of fabric/upholstery protector for it to work properly.

Vacuum your furniture.,
Rub down with a vinegar mixture.,
Nourish the leather with vinegar and linseed oil.,
Keep leather out of the sun to avoid cracking and dryness.Constant exposure to direct sunlight is bad for leather, even with diligent upkeep.",How to Clean Furniture2," As with upholstery, regular vacuuming will keep your furniture clean. Remove cushions to ensure you’re able to reach every nook and cranny in the piece of furniture.

, In a bucket, mix equal parts vinegar and water. Soak a rag in the liquid, wring it out so that it’s damp but not soaked, and wipe down your furniture. Rinse out the rag often, to avoid spreading dirt, and follow back after your work with a dry cloth.Equal parts lemon juice and cream of tarter is an ideal spot cleaner for white or beige furniture. Rub the mixture into the stain, and let it sit. After 10 minutes, wipe any residue away with a clean cloth.
Rubbing alcohol, applied by cotton swab, works wonders for ink stains and mildew. Work it in, and then dry the area with hot air from a blow dryer., The mixture should be one part vinegar to two parts linseed oil. Shake it well, rub it in, and leave it for 10 minutes. Then, buff it out with a cloth. Multiple buffs may be required., Consider rotating armchairs or couches away from open windows, or ensuring that your blinds or drapes are closed when you’re not in the room.


Keep leather furniture at least two feet away from heat sources in your home. Constant exposure can cause the leather to crack and age."

Determine the finish used on your furniture.,
Wipe dust and loose dirt from the wood.,
Rub the wood with mineral spirits.,
Make a turpentine mixture for use on finished wood.Mix three-quarters of a cup of boiled linseed oil and one-quarter of a cup of turpentine in a jar, and shake well.,
Work the turpentine mixture into the wood.,
Buff waxed or varnished surfaces with lemon oil.Moisten a cloth, add a little oil, and wipe the piece down.,
Apply furniture wax to protect unwaxed furniture.",How to Clean Furniture3," If you’re unsure, the correct procedure is beginning with mild cleaner, then moving successively toward stronger cleaning methods depending on the furniture’s reaction (or lack of one).If you know that your furniture is stained, painted, etc., then you should employ a method appropriate to that finish.


As a general rule for cleaning wood furniture: don’t use much water, and when you do, don’t leave it on the table for long. Water can cause the wood to warp and crack.

, Use a clean cloth to go over the piece of furniture, loosening and removing any dust and dirt on the surface. Avoid feather dusters for wood furniture, as their quills can scratch wood. Instead, use cloth., Mineral spirits, e.g., paint thinner, are excellent at wearing away accumulated grime. Pour the spirits into a rag, and gently rub your furniture. Work in a well-ventilated space when using mineral spirits. Wipe up any residual cleaner with a damp cloth. Though safe for most wooden furniture, you should test an inconspicuous area (like an underside, or chair leg) to make sure your furniture doesn’t react poorly to the cleaner.

, Both of these ingredients are readily available at hardware stores.


As an alternative, commercial furniture oil is available for this same purpose.

, Pour some on top of the table, then some onto a steel wool pad. Rub the mixture in along the grain. Once finished, polish with a soft rag. This mixture works very well on both finished and unfinished wood. It will increase the gloss and durability of finished wood, and it will prevent drying and cracking in unfinished wood. Rub the oil in thoroughly and allow the furniture to air dry.


Using steel wool might sound severe, but the finish on most wooden furniture is thick enough to protect the wood itself from damage.

, Then, buff the surface, leaving little residue.

, Apply it generously with a cheesecloth, in the direction of the grain. Buff with a separate cloth afterward."

Use a clean cloth when you wipe it down.,
Avoid Windex and glass cleaners.,
Remove scratches with plastic polish.",How to Clean Furniture4," Acrylic and lucite require minimal care, but can be easily scratched by the little flecks of dirt and grime contained within a cloth you’ve been using to clean other furniture. Use a new—or newly laundered—cloth to wipe your furniture down to avoid scratches., As tempting as it might be when your furniture is clear, don’t use glass cleaner on acrylic furniture. Cleaners that aren’t designed for acrylic or lucite can crack your furniture.Similarly, if something gets stuck to your furniture, don’t use a solvent to remove it. Wet cloth and specifically designed cleaners only!

, Products designed to clean plastic are the only cleaners that should be used on acrylic furniture. If your furniture has been scratched, the polish can actually repair the scratch as well.

Identify the material.,
Remove cushions.,
Use the brush attachment on your vacuum.,
Softly brush Rattan and bamboo down with soapy, ammonia-containing water.,
Place it outside in the sun to dry.,
Keep it out of humid areas.",How to Clean Furniture5," “Wicker” refers to the technique used in the furniture’s construction, not to what it’s made from.Your wicker furniture can be paper, rattan, or bamboo (among other possibilities), and there can be slight differences in the sort of care that each requires.

, These will be cleaned separately from the furniture, and the manufacturer should list the proper methods on the tag. Ensure that you’re able to access every inch of the furniture’s surface.

, Care must be taken to clean wicker furniture with gentle tools. Brushing your furniture regularly will help to keep it clean, and using the brush attachment on your vacuum performs double duty.


For tough-to-remove dust, try using a soft paintbrush. For tough-to-reach dust, employ a toothbrush., Mix one part ammonia to two parts water in a bucket, then give it a good squirt of bleach-free dishwashing liquid. A brush is an ideal cleaning implement, but cloth can work.


Ensure you're in a well-ventilated area before mixing chemicals, and use gloves when handling ammonia. Do not lean over the bucket.
Bleach-free is important here. Ammonia and bleach together produces incredibly toxic fumes.If you ever feel light-headed or nauseous while mixing your cleaners, get fresh air immediately.
Wicker furniture should always be handled delicately, even during cleaning. Stiff brushes (and anything more abrasive) can cause extensive damage to your furniture and require the intervention of a professional.For paper and grass wicker furniture, you can forgo the cleaning agents and simply wipe the pieces down with a damp cloth.Wicker furniture only needs this thorough cleaning once or twice a year., It may take several days to entirely dry, but it’s of tantamount importance to entirely dry your wicker furniture. When wet, the cane, grass, and bamboo can slowly revert to their original (non-wicker) shapes.


Wicker furniture must always be thoroughly dried, and care should be taken to avoid saturating it with water while cleaning.Never sit on wicker that isn't dry.
Wicker furniture should not, however, spend the entirety of its time in the sun. Chairs and tables that spend a lot of time in the sun should be rotated throughout the year to prevent the material from splitting.

, Even though wicker ""likes"" humidity, the humidity will promote mold growth and shape distortion in wicker furniture.Store your furniture in climate-controlled areas of your home if you'd like to maintain it longterm. Unless you live in the desert, the porch will not be kind to your wicker furniture.


If you do live in the desert, though, give your wicker an occasional wipe-down with a damp cloth. Dry climes can, like direct sunlight, cause wicker to crack without proper care.

Remove the cushions on the couch every week or so.,
Use a dust buster or vacuum to collect the debris that could not be removed by hand.,
Wipe the cushions down with a suede brush or a terry cloth towel.,
Replace the cushions.,
Brush the nap at least once a week.",How to Clean and Maintain a Suede Couch2," This will allow you to collect all the crumbs, papers and other bits and pieces that have fallen through the cracks.

, Vacuuming will also help eliminate any dust or pet dander that has accumulated and that cannot be seen by the human eye.

, Be sure to check the underside of the cushions for any debris that may have remained.

, Some couches have matching cushions. That is, they are the exact same size and shape. If this is the case, it is a good idea to rotate the cushions to even out the wear.

, Brushing removes dust, which accumulates and causes a couch to look dull. Use a suede napping brush or cloth, which can be purchased at shoe stores that also specialize in cleaning and repair.


Keep a suede cleaning cloth nearby. Use this to rub down the couch now and then to help keep the nap in good shape.
This can be done even while you're watching TV, so it's useful to keep the cloth near the remotes.
Terry cloth towels can be also be used.
Rubbing and brushing are especially important if you allow pets to sit on the couch.

Confirm the piece is bonded leather.,
Remove large debris.,
Vacuum the leather surface.,
Dry dust the leather.,
Create a mild detergent.,
Test a small area.,
Wipe down the piece.,
Dry the surface.,
Condition the leather a couple times a year.,
Blot spills as they happen.,
Move the piece away from sunlight.",How to Clean Bonded Leather," Bonded leather and genuine leather are often cleaned in a similar fashion, but it is important to know what type of material you are working with for processes like spot treatments. Look at the tag on the piece to help you determine whether it is made of bonded or genuine leather., Before you start cleaning bonded leather, pick up any large debris including items like rocks, coins, food crumbs, or any other sizeable object that may have settled into the piece. Dispose of these pieces before vacuuming to avoid clogging your vacuum.

, Once you have removed all large debris, vacuum the surface of your bonded leather item to remove smaller debris such as dirt and pet hair. Use a soft brush attachment on a vacuum hose, or the low setting on a hand vacuum.You may want to further consider using a crevice attachment to get into folds and corners of pieces like bonded leather chairs and sofas.

, If you have not used your bonded leather piece in some time, or if it sits in an area that is prone to collecting dust, use a microfiber cloth or a disposable duster to wipe away any small particles from the piece. This prevents them from becoming caked on later., Use three to five drops of a mild soap such as a facial cleanser or a soap made specifically for leather, and dissolve them in one quart of warm water. Mix until some suds are visible on top.To make your detergent, consider using distilled water, which can be purchased at most supermarkets. Distilled water is free from chlorine and other contaminants in tap water that could cause markings on your leather., Using a clean microfiber cloth, dip a corner into the detergent and apply it to a small, inconspicuous area of the bonded leather piece. Use a dry portion of the cloth to wipe away the detergent, and check to see if it picks up any dye or causes the fabric to thin and fade.If the detergent impacts the leather in any way, do not proceed with cleaning. Contact the manufacturer for recommendations on how to clean that particular piece.

, Once you know your detergent is safe to use on your leather piece, soak a microfiber or other soft-textured rag in the detergent and wring it out thoroughly. Section-by section, wipe down the surface of the leather piece with the detergent-soaked rag. Then, rinse off the section using a second rag moistened with distilled water, but free of detergent.Continue this process in sections until your bonded leather piece has been completely cleaned.
You may need to wipe over sections multiple times with the non-detergent rag to fully rinse it. Continue to wipe down the surface until any sudsing has stopped and soap residue is no longer visible.

, Use a third clean, dry towel or cloth to wipe away any excess moisture from the surface of the bonded leather. Then, allow the piece to air dry in an area with limited natural light. If it is a furniture piece, consider closing blinds or curtains while the piece is drying.Minimizing exposure to sunlight helps prevent cracking and separation of the leather pulp from the backing.

, Once or twice a year, apply a leather conditioner to your piece to help keep it soft and durable. You can purchase a leather conditioner from many home improvement stores, or online. Most standard leather conditioners will work with bonded leather.Use a clean rag to buff the conditioner into the leather. It should not need to be wiped away. Simply allow it to dry for the amount of time specified on the packaging.

, If something spills on your bonded leather piece, blot it with a soft, dry cloth or paper towel. Avoid rubbing, as this could rapidly wear down your leather.If you are worried the spot may leave a mark or stain, use a bit of mild detergent and warm water to remove any residual coloring. Bonded leather is generally durable, and so will likely resist staining if spots are treated quickly.

, Bonded leather can quickly degrade and start to peel or flake when exposed constantly to sunlight. Move your bonded leather pieces away from the sun, or consider using drapes or blinds to keep too much sun from reaching the piece."

Choose a pressure washer that fits your needs.,
Read the entire owner's manual for the pressure washer.,
Protect or relocate any delicate or breakable objects in your work area.,
Connect the pressure washer to your home's spigot.,
Don the appropriate safety gear.,
Attach the appropriate spray tip to the pressure washer.,
Turn the pressure washer on and begin washing your surface.,
Wash the surface again with a narrower-angle spray tip.,
Allow the surface to air dry.,
Finished.

",How to Pressure Wash," Pressure washers can be rented at a daily rate from most equipment rental stores and some hardware stores. They are available in a range of pressure capabilities, from about 1200 - 3000 psi, or pounds per square inch (8300 - 20,700 kPa). A low-pressure model is better suited to more delicate surfaces like aluminum siding, while high-pressure models are great for concrete and brick. Make sure to rent a model that has a detergent reservoir if you want to use detergent.;
, Pressure washers can cause damage to your home, as well as present a danger to yourself if used improperly. The owner's manual will contain important safety and operating information.

, When pressure washing a deck, for example, make sure to remove any plants or light fixtures that could be damaged by the heavy spray of water.

, Set the machine up according to the manual's instructions; this will usually involve running a garden hose from your spigot into the pressure washer. Fill the detergent reservoir with detergent if desired.

, Before using the pressure washer, make sure to wear safety glasses, ear plugs, and heavy work gloves.

, Pressure washers generally come with an assortment of spray tips that can be affixed onto the end of the spray wand; these spray tips adjust the angle (and thus the concentration) of the spray. For most jobs, it's best to begin by attaching the widest-angle spray tip (about 65 degrees), and using it to apply the detergent.

, With both hands on the spray wand, hold the wand at about a 45 degree angle to the surface you are cleaning. Keep the spray wand in motion at all times, working primarily with a gentle back-and-forth motion. For the best results, apply detergent with a wide-angle spray tip before proceeding to a higher pressure setting.

, Detach or close the detergent reservoir, and fit the spray wand with a stronger spray tip. For heavy-duty cleaning, a 15 degree tip works well, while a 30 or 45 degree tip works best for light-duty cleaning. Use the pressure washer to clean the surface as before, keeping the spray wand in constant motion.

, After washing the area to your satisfaction, turn the pressure washer off and disconnect it from your spigot. Allow the work area to dry in the air.

Rinse from the top down with plain water from a garden hose.",How to Pressure Wash a House," Different housing materials can withstand various water pressures. The size, or spray power, ranges from 1,200 to 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi).


Softer housing materials, such as painted soft-grain wood and aluminum, require a 1,200 to 1,500 psi model to prevent pressure damage. You may need a wide spray nozzle to disperse water pressure for even more vulnerable materials, like stucco.
Stronger non-painted surfaces, such as vinyl, clean better with a more powerful 2,500 to 3,000 psi model. These models work the fastest.
Select a pressure washer that has a detergent dispenser if you plan to use a cleaning solution.;
, Cover with drop cloths or plastic covering and secure with duct tape.

,, Combine approximately 1 pound (.455 kilograms) of a non-phosphate concentrated cleaner for every 4 gallons (15.4 liters) of washing water.

, When you are ready, turn on the water.

, Move it in closer until you feel the spray is strong enough to remove dirt but not strong enough to cause damage.

, Spray roof overhangs, under-hangs and gutters at an approximate 45-degree angle. Move the spray steadily from side to side.

, Allow house siding to dry at least 2 days before painting.

Ladder
Broom
Tarps or plastic covers
Hose
Large bucket
Clean cloth or rag
Soft-bristled brush
Fabric protecting treatment spray;
, Smaller awnings can be removed from their frames so that you can clean them on the ground level. Carefully remove the awing from the arms and frame.When you’ve got the awning down, lay it on a flat, clean surface to clean it.

, Awnings that are too large, too heavy, or too awkward are best left in place. You can clean them where they are, but you will need a ladder to access the top to clean the mildew.Look for a ladder with a platform at the top that will hold your cleaning supplies.
If you have access to a cherry picker or other lift device, you can use those as well.

, This is especially important if you're going to be cleaning the awning in place, because you don’t want to splash cleaning solution onto nearby items.Cover the area under and around the awning with tarps or plastic sheets.
Be particularly careful about covering things like plants, furniture, grass, decorations, carpets, and fabrics.

, Before you start cleaning off the mildew, use a broom to clean off any dirt, leaves, sticks, twigs, cobwebs, or other organic materials that have accumulated on the awning.


Leaving organic matter on your awning for an extended period can lead to damage, because the matter will cause deterioration to the fabric as it rots., Awnings do require regular cleaning, but mildew demands a different kind of cleaning solution and more elbow grease. Mildew is a type of fungus that’s similar to mold. On an awning, it will likely appear as gray or white spots, and will look like a powder.You can simply use a regular cleaner if your awning doesn’t have mildew.

, To get the best results from your cleaning efforts, start by hosing down the awing so it’s completely wet. This will make the cleaning solution easier to spread, and the mildew easier to remove., To remove mildew from a canvas awning, you'll need a cleaning solution made with 1 cup (237 ml) bleach, ¼ cup (59 ml) of mild liquid soap, and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of cool water.If you need more cleaning solution, simply double or triple all the quantities.


Mild liquid soaps include laundry soaps that are designed for sensitive skin, babies, or delicate fabrics.
Do not use chlorine bleach on canvas, as this can damage the fabric.
For colored awnings, use a color safe bleach.
It’s also a good idea to test a patch of the cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area to test for color fastness. Place some cleaning solution on a small patch of the top side of the awning and let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing and checking for discoloration.

, Dip the clean cloth into the cleaning solution and spread the cleaner all over the awning. Re-dip the cloth as necessary so that cleaning solution reaches every inch of the fabric, otherwise you might miss some of the mildew.


Once the entire surface of the awning has been soaked with cleaner, let it sit for about 15 minutes. This will give the cleaner time to soak into the fabric and kill the mildew., When the cleaning solution has had time to soak in, take the soft-bristled brush and scrub the top side of the fabric. Use a vigorous circular motion to generate suds. Go over every inch of the awning to scrub away all the mildew.If the cleaning solution starts to dry anywhere, re-soak the area before you scrub.

, After scrubbing mildew from the whole awning, rinse it well with clean water from the hose. Continue rinsing until all the soap and dirt have been washed off. You don’t want to leave any bleach residue on the fabric, or it could cause early deterioration.


If there's any mildew left on the awning, repeat the soaking and scrubbing steps until it’s gone., Most awnings are designed to dry quickly after the rain, so it won’t take your awning long to air dry. If you cleaned your awning in place, simply let it dry on the frame. If you removed your awning, hang it to dry on a line before reinstalling it.


Never dry canvas awnings in a dryer, as they may shrink., When you bought your awning, it would have been treated with a water- and stain-resistant coating to protect it from water and discoloration. But scrubbing it with bleach will have removed this coating, so you'll need to reapply it.


Look for a commercial-grade fabric guard that can be sprayed on.
Once the awning is dry, spray the fabric guard onto the top side of the awning. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for specific instructions.
Some awning warranties will be voided if you use silicone sprays, so make sure you check the conditions of your warranty., For smaller awnings that you removed to clean, return the awning to its frame once it’s dry and after the water-resistant treatment has had time to dry.

, Keeping your awning mildew-free is much easier than having to clean mildew from it, but there are things you'll have to do monthly and yearly to prevent mildew from growing. Hosing down the awning regularly with clean water will remove dirt, organic matter, and other things that could lead to mildew growth.To hose down the awning, simply set up a ladder and use a garden hose to drench the awning. Pay special attention to remove any twigs, leaves, or other debris that’s built up.
Once you soak the awning, let it air dry.

, To clean your awning for annual maintenance, the process is the same as for removing mildew, but you don’t use bleach in the cleaning solution. This will remove pollutants, organic matter, dirt, and other contaminants.Either remove the awning from its frame or set up a ladder to reach the top of the awning.
Soak the awning with clean water.
Mix a cleaning solution with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and ¼ cup (59 ml) of mild liquid soap.
Soak the awning with the cleaning solution and let it sit for 15 minutes.
Scrub the awning with a soft-bristled brush.
Rinse and awning and allow it to air dry.

, When you remove your awning for winter or to store it for extended periods, you can prevent mildew when the awning is in storage. Perform your annual cleaning before storing the awning. Make sure the awning is clean and completely dry before putting it away.Store the awning somewhere clean and dry so that mildew isn't attracted to the area.
Keep the awning somewhere well-ventilated, as this will prevent mildew from settling.

Consult with a professional if you’d like to clean a valuable or cherished heirloom chair., Check the tags on your chair to see what is recommended for cleaning it. Understands the codes that you might find on your furniture. Codes “W” and “WS” mean you can clean it with water or a water-based solution. “S” means that you can use a water-free cleaner, like dry-cleaning solution. “X” means it requires professional cleaning, though you can vacuum and brush it.Consult a professional if you have a chair without a tag, like an antique.

, Make your own cleaner if your chair’s fabric can be cleaned with water or a water-based solution. Mix ¼ cup (59 mL) of mild dish soap and a cup (240 mL) of warm water. Stir the soap and water until it is foamy. Dab the soap and water on any spots or spills. Be sure to blot up any excess soap and water.


Don’t rub soap and water into spots or spills, because it can potentially stain your upholstery.

, Clean spots and spills with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Use a soft cloth to apply the hydrogen peroxide. If you don’t have 3% hydrogen peroxide, dilute 1 part 35% food-grade hydrogen peroxide with 11 parts water to get it to 3%.To dilute 35% hydrogen peroxide, mix 1 and ¼ tablespoons (18.48 mL) of 35% hydrogen peroxide to ¾ cup plus 2 and ¾ tablespoons (220.66 mL) water to make one cup (240 mL) of 3% hydrogen peroxide.

Inspect your home’s siding for damage.,
Clear the area around your home.,
Hook up the pressure washer to your garden hose.,
Pressure-wash your home’s wood siding in 20 foot (6 metre) sections.",How to Clean Wood Siding2," If you notice any deterioration or broken panels, you’ll need to take care of these before you use a pressure washer. The strong water pressure will likely aggravate any already existing damage., Make sure any loose items, such as toys, tools, and furniture, are stowed away before you use the pressure washer. Not only could the water damage them, but you could trip or get tangled up in them, causing an accident. Any light fixtures should be covered in a plastic tarp; tape down the tarp to secure it.


Use a garden hose to spray any plants or shrubs around your home. This will prevent soap from sticking to them.
Make sure all windows and doors are fully closed.
If you have pets or small children, make sure they’re kept away from your home’s exterior while you work. The strong water pressure could injure them., The placement of this connection will vary upon your specific model. Always check the manufacturer’s instructions if you’re unsure of anything relating to the pressure washer’s operation.If you decide to use a cleaning solution, the pressure washer will either have a tank for you to fill or a siphon tube to slide into the solution. You shouldn’t need to use a siding cleaner for most cleaning jobs; only use it if the siding is particularly dirty., Always work from bottom to top; this prevents water from dripping down onto dry panels and causing streaks. Keep the nozzle angled downwards to prevent water from getting lodged in between panels. Make sure to move on only when the section you’re working on has been completely covered.


Pressure washers come with a variety of nozzles, which control the amount of pressure the water is under. For most homes, a 40-degree nozzle is sufficient.If you use a cleaning solution, you’ll need to rinse the wood siding before the cleaner solution has a chance to dry. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing.
If your home is more than one story, you’ll need to use a nozzle extension to reach the siding higher up."

It usually comes in a white powder. You’ll want to add half a pound (227g) of TSP to two gallons (7.8L) of water. You should mix this solution in a bucket.Make sure to wear rubber gloves when handling the cleaning solution, since contact with the skin can cause burns and hives., The best brush for this purpose is a nylon brush with stiff bristles. Dip the brush into your cleaning solution, then scrub the wooden sliding, following the orientation of the panels. Most siding panels are horizontal, so you’ll want to scrub horizontally. Work in 20-foot (6m) sections.Dip the brush in your cleaning solution as needed.

, Right after you finish scrubbing a section of siding, you should rinse it before moving on to the next one. You only need to use clear water for this, and a garden hose is ideal if you have one., To work safely, you should have a second person holding the ladder for you. Fasten your brush to an extendable pole so that you can clean the second story without having to reach and stretch uncomfortably.

Whenever possible, refer to your manufacture's instructions for detail cleaning advice.",How to Clean Vinyl Siding1," This is especially important if you plan to use a pressure washer, as you don't want to further loosen anything from the house. Keep your eye out for bigger gaps than normal between the slats, making a mental note to wash these areas by hand with lowered pressure., You'll have to do each section of the house individually, so you can just cover the side you're working on and move the sheets when you're done. While this may not be necessary if you're just using water to clean the side, it is essential if using soap or chemical cleaners.Pre-water any gardens or shrubs -- the extra water will dilute any soap that creeps in.
You should also cover any electrical outlets or AC units -- anything that could be damaged by the soap., Make sure the house is water-tight, unless you want to be cleaning indoor mildew as well! Removing the screens will only be necessary if you want to use a pressure washer, which can damage and loosen them.

, Most vinyl siding is extremely easy to clean, and simply scrubbing with water will loosen and remove most dirt. However, mold and mildew is a different story. To test if something is mildew or just dirt, spray it with a drop of bleach -- mildew will turn white, dirt will remain brown.<ref.http://www.howtocleanstuff.net/how-to-clean-vinyl-siding/</ref>

Use a high-powered garden hose for small houses, and pressure hose for larger walls.,
Plan to work on a sunny day without a lot of wind, if possible.,
Work on only one wall or section at a time to prevent streaking.,
Start from the bottom, running the hose side to side as you move up.,
Spray at eye level whenever possible, preventing water from pushing in between the siding.,
Work way from the corners, shooting water away from any gaps.,
Consider cleaning around windows and doors by hand.,
After you've working completely up from the bottom, rinse the whole wall from the top down.",How to Clean Vinyl Siding2," Vinyl is remarkably easy to keep clean with a simple rinse, if you do it often enough. Unless there is mold or mildew, or tough/thick stains, some high-pressure water should be more than enough.


For single story houses, a garden hose with an attached nozzle should suffice.
For multi-story houses, you'll likely not reach without a pressure washer, which can be rented cheaply at most hardware stores., Wind will pick up dust and dirt that may stick to the walls, and slow-drying vinyl can leave streaks. Neither are serious issues, but if you work with the weather you'll have an easier, neater job.

, You'll be much more effective if you work in small areas, which will help you keep track of what you've done. Furthermore, you want to rinse the walls off before they dry completely to get rid of the dirt for good, which will be impossible if you try to tackle too large of an area.

, You don't want to wash the walls from the top down, as this will tend to lead to streaks of dirt instead of a clean wall.


If using a pressure washer, do not use the highest setting -- keep it low and gentle., If you have ""slats,"" the stacked horizontal bars of vinyl, you want to try not to force the water between the layers of vinyl. As you get higher up the house, the hose will be hitting less powerfully, and this isn't as much of a concern. Still, when possible, blast at a downward angle, or straight on, to prevent loosening the vinyl siding in any way.

, Work in the direction of curved areas, corners, or molding. Again, you're trying to prevent water from getting stuck or lodged in openings in the siding. If left in dark, cool areas, this moisture can quickly turn into mold or mildew., You want to be careful at any junctions or areas where you can get under the siding, and you want to be especially careful near flimsy screens or windows when using a high-pressured hose. Consider using a long-handled brush, or removing the screens and scrubbing with a cloth and water from the inside of the window.These same rules apply near wiring, plumbing, and gutters as well. At the very least, lower the pressure considerably before proceeding., The first run will dissolved and dislodge the dirt and grime, and it will stay wet as water from above trickles down. Your rinse, which should start from the very top, then removes all of the dirty water to leave your house spick and span."

Fill a large bucket with warm water and dissolve soap or cleaner in it.,
Buy a long extending pole, if you do not already have one.,
Get a soft-bristle brush with a screw-on handle.,
Soak the brush into the warm, soapy water and scrub from the bottom up.,
Use a garden hose or pressure washer to rinse the house from the top down.,
Let the house dry on its own.",How to Clean Vinyl Siding3," Pour a few tablespoons of dishwashing liquid in the bucket, until the water is soapy. Use a professional-grade cleaner, such as Vinyl Renu, if the siding surface shows excessive signs of oxidation. Soapy water may not be adequate to rub the vinyl siding clean on it's own. Other cleaning mixtures include:


2/3s water, and 1/3 white vinegar makes a gentle, natural, and safe cleaner.
For tougher jobs, 2/3 cup powdered detergent, 1/3 cup powdered household cleaner (TSP), and around a quart of bleach with a gallon of water. (Note -- not safe if you have animals!)
Natural cleaners like Simple Green, or oxygen bleach, can fight tough stains without damaging your lawn and landscaping., The best way to clean siding is by hand -- but you won't be able to reach without an extending pole. They are available at hardware stores, such as Home Depot in the U.S. You can also find a pole online on popular retail websites, such as Amazon. A typical pole costs less than US $50.

, The brush will be attached to your extending pole. To make sure the sizes match, you may prefer to buy the pole and the handle together.


Don't use the rough or course brushes -- you want something soft to prevent scratching.

, Wash what you can reach from the starting point, re-dipping your brush whenever it starts to dry. The brush should be dripping wet at all times. Don't worry about the streaks yet -- this is why you work from the bottom up -- it keeps everything wet for the eventual rinse off.For serious cleanings, you can load a pressure washer with your soap mixture first, spraying the whole house down before attacking with the brush.

, This is the golden rule of cleaning vinyl -- brush from the bottom up, rinse from the top down.

Compost toilet paper.",How to Clean up a Toilet Papered House," Pay attention to which areas are most heavily hit with toilet paper. Take special notice of where the long lines of it start and end. This can prevent leftover toilet paper all over the roof and tall trees.


If there is a lot of toilet paper and you are unhappy with this, feel free to contact the police. If your house has cameras, they might even be able to catch the people who did it and have them clean up the mess.;
, If there is a lot of toilet paper, gather some friends or family members to help take it down. You will clean it much faster. Consider having people work on different zones. Maybe one person cleans up the tree while another works on the yard while someone else works on the roof.

, Your clean up will move faster if you collect the paper in a few bins as you go so that you don't have to pick it up multiple times. This will aid in the disposal of it. If you simply throw paper on the ground, you will need to clean it up again. Bins will help you to avoid this.


If you don’t have bins, bring out a few garbage bags and put the paper in them. Garbage bags are easy to move around and can hold a lot of paper. Consider placing a rock on top of the bag so that it doesn’t blow away.

, If toilet paper gets wet, it will stick to the surface and be nearly impossible to remove. If it has already gotten wet, wait until it dries. Try to avoid dealing with wet paper at all costs.Dew is another factor to consider. If your grass is wet, hold off on removal until it dries so that the paper doesn’t disintegrate when touching the ground.

, Start picking up the toilet paper that is highest up, like in treetops and on your roof. This way, if it falls, you will not waste time having to redo an area that you already cleaned.If you don't want to get your hands dirty, you can wear gardening gloves while you remove the paper.

, This is a safer way to get the toilet paper down than with a ladder. These will allow you to reach high places and pull down any paper that is stuck. Try to place the pole in between the paper and the tree branch, for example, and then pull on it. This should help take it down.To rake paper, simply reach up with your rake and scrape it down. Some of it should fall and some of it will likely be caught in your rake. Place any removed paper in a bin or garbage bag.

, If you can’t reach the high places, use a ladder and exercise safety when doing so. Be especially careful if your grass is at all slippery. Have someone hold the ladder in place while you are on it and make sure it is level and locked into place. You don't want to head down to the ER on the same day you were toilet papered.Make sure to use a ladder that is appropriate for the job. If you only need to reach a few feet higher, you don’t need a large extension ladder. Try a step ladder instead.

, This will help you when gathering the little shredded pieces of toilet paper. It takes time and patience to get all of those pieces, but a leaf blower can help you to move them more quickly into a pile.Save this for last. Wait until all the large pieces have been removed and then work on the small pieces that are left over. This will help you to avoid making a bigger mess.

, It is better to do this while removing paper so that you have less to clean up. Use bins or garbage bags and fill them while removing paper. Remember not to put it in a pile on the lawn or driveway because if the ground is wet, you'll have to scrape it off., Once your toilet paper is in your recycling bins, simply give to your recycling service with the rest of your recyclables. If you need to find a recycling center, you can do a quick search at recyclingcenters.org. The cardboard rolls can be recycled as well.Some recycling centers require you to sort your recyclables. Contact your local recycling facility to see if you need to separate your paper products from plastics or other materials.

, If you do not have recycling services, you can throw it out with your garbage. Simply place in garbage bags and dispose with the rest of your trash. However, recycling is recommended.

, Many people don’t realize that toilet paper can be composted. As long as it doesn’t contain ink, it shouldn’t have any adverse effects. Simply add the paper to your compost pile and mix in with the rest of your materials.Don’t add too much paper to your compost pile because it doesn’t contain nutrients that will help your fertilizer be rich. A few handfuls will suffice.

Make a simple list of the tasks and decide your plan of attack in the most simple logical way.,
When cleaning a room, work from top down.,
Bathrooms: Spray foaming cleaner on tub and sink, let sit for a few minutes (if really dirty) and wipe down with soft cloth.,
Put trash, papers, etc and empty the small refuse containers into a large trash can.,
Finish each room by vacuuming or cleaning the floor.",How to Emergency Houseclean," It is sometimes easier to start with the bedrooms or living room because they are usually easier and you will feel like you are making headway quicker. Save the kitchen for last. You might decide some rooms can be ignored by shutting (and locking) the door to them. Put the dirty dishes in a sink full of sudsy water. You will get back to them when finishing up.;
, Go around the room cleaning with your tools. Use the plastic paint scraper for getting up hard gunky spots. With surfaces like the stove, or counters that are very dirty, you will want to use the saturation technique. Saturate the area with plenty of cleaning liquid and let soak a minute or two. Then start cleaning. Use paint scraper where needed. Use your ""Magic sponge"" for spots and finger prints on walls and around doors. Use an old toothbrush for cleaning tight corners like cleaning the gunk around sink fixtures.

, Repeat if necessary. Wipe down fixtures.Clean mirrors and glass with soft cloth and window cleaner. Polish away streaks. Don't use too much spray. Clean toilet with toilet cleaner and toilet brush. Wipe it off and around with a moistened paper towel or wet wipes if you have some handy. Wet wipes can be used to clean around the nooks and crannies of your bathroom floor. You can wipe down your entire floor with a cloth on your hands and knees if your bathroom is small, otherwise use a sweeper-mop.

, You might want to put any other clutter in another trash bag for sorting through later. You will want to stay in the room you are cleaning until you are finished to save time.

, Use your mop or flat mop to sweep and mop at the same time. Use your spray cleaner on the floor to keep the flat mop moist. You might want to test a small section first to make sure what you're using won't damage the floor. Use extra cleaner if the floor is very dirty. Sweep-mop debris in a pile. You can pick up the debris with your shop vac or you can sweep mop debris into a dustpan and throw into a trash can. (*Wood floors need special care--just sweep with a dust mop and clean the floor according to professional instructions on a day when you have more time.)

Clean your bathroom.,
Clean your bedroom.,
Straighten out your living room.,
Do your dishes.",How to Do All Your Chores Within 30 Minutes1," Clear everything off of your sink, toilet and the ledge of your bathtub.

Allocate ten minutes to cleaning your bathroom.
If you have time, wipe down the bathroom mirrors as well.;
, Concentrate on making your bed; once your bed is made, your whole room will look far tidier. Pick up loose clothes and shoes and return them to their rightful places. If you have dirty dishes lying around, return those to the kitchen.Allocate five minutes to cleaning your bedroom.
Shave time off your bed making by leaving the flat sheet untucked - hospital corners take a long time to construct and your comforter will cover them anyway,Open windows as you go to eliminate odors and get a nice cross-breeze going.

, Rearrange your couch cushions and throw blankets. Consolidate any remote controls to one area and straighten up loose magazines and books. If there are any dirty dishes or loose pieces of clothing, return them to the kitchen and bedroom respectively.Tuck a trash bag into your pants so you don’t have to keep running between the room you’re cleaning and the garbage.
Allocate five minutes to cleaning the living room.

, The most obvious sign of a messy kitchen is a pile of dirty dishes. If you have a dishwasher, load it immediately. If not, pile all the dishes into the sink and let the hot water run. While the water runs, wipe down all the surfaces in the kitchen using a rag and some disinfectant. When your surfaces are wiped, wash the dishes and load them into the drying rack.

Divide your room into zones.,
Work on one zone at a time, deep cleaning each one.,
Sleep Zone: This zone is easy to clean and organize.,
Clothes Zone: This isn't as easy as the sleep zone.,
Get Ready Zone:


If you have a bathroom in your room, then that would be your get ready zone.,
Relaxation Zone: Decide what relaxation means for you.,
Work Zone: If you're a preteen or teenager, you will probably have a work area so that you can do homework.,
When you think you're done, do one last check.","How to Do a Fast, Deep Clean for Your Bedroom"," There should be a sleep zone (a bed), a clothes zone (a closet or dresser), a get ready zone (a mirror and makeup, jewelry, etc.), a relaxation zone (music player, games, magazines), and a work zone (a desk or work table).;
, Here is how to do each zone:, Make your bed every morning after you wake up, but replace the sheets later in the day.


Don't forget that you can put storage containers under your bed.

, If you have a closet or dresser, take out everything. Make 3 piles: sell, gift, and keep. This technique can be used in other parts of your room too.


In the sell pile, put stuff that you imagine none of your friends would like, and put it in a garbage bag and into your garage, so later you can have a garage sale.
In the gift pile, you can use these items you think that one of your friends or family members would enjoy. When her/his birthday or graduation or any other kind of event comes up, you will already have a gift.
For the keep pile, you know what to do with this one. Put all of it back in an organized way. For your dresser, fold clothes neatly in piles and put them away. For a closet, hang up all of your clothing items, and don't forget to find a place for your shoes.
If you want, combine the ""sell"" and ""gift"" piles and give the result to charity. It simplifies sorting, and means you don't have to hang onto excess stuff until you get around to having a garage sale.

, Just take out all of the stuff and make a throw away pile, and a keep pile. Organize your medicine cabinet and drawers, and keep like items together, so you can always find them! Keep items that you use a lot on top, maybe some deodorant and toothpaste.
If you don't have a bathroom in your room, this could be the top of your dresser or a desk or something where you keep your perfume, jewelry, deodorant, etc. Just clean out everything, throw away stuff you don't use, and make sure everything is kept neat.

, Do you want a reading nook in your room? Do you want someplace where you can hang out and relax with friends? Your relaxation zone might include a comfy chair, music player, TV, or even games, or it might be a table or stand by your bed. Organize it so that everything has its own place. Maybe a chair in a corner, next to a set of drawers containing CD's, magazines, books, and even games, and maybe a music player on top.

, On the desktop itself, you should have a cup for pens and pencils, a computer (optional), and maybe a picture frame or plant. In the drawers, keep supplies in one or two drawers, and in the others keep papers and such. Keep distracting items to a minimum.

, Do you have the right zones? Do any zones collide? Is everything organized? Is there any clutter? Do you have any trash? Remove and deal with any remaining clutter.

Set time limits.,
Swap chores with a sibling.,
Turn chores into a game.",How to Do All Your Chores Within 30 Minutes2," If you have more than one chore to accomplish within 30 minutes, you need to be conscious of how long it takes to complete each chore. If you have six chores to do in that time, find six songs lasting five minutes each and make a playlist. Play the playlist while you work and as soon as the song changes, switch tasks.Make sure you’ve completed each task to the best of your ability before moving onto the next one.
If you have less chores, choose longer songs or set a timer for the amount of time it takes to do each chore.
Use fun as motivation. If your favorite TV show comes on at a certain time, start your chores thirty minutes before that time. That way, you’ll be motivated to finish your chores within those thirty minutes in order to catch your show.

, Doing the same tasks over and over can be boring, so switching up your routine keeps things fresh. Ask your sibling if you can trade chores for the week; if they usually empty the dishwasher, ask if you can swap your laundry chore for that task. However you want to mix it up, switching chores will make the work more challenging and interesting.If you’re going to trade chores, make sure you both hold up your end of the bargain. The work still needs to get done.
If you’re spending time cleaning their room, be respectful of their property. If you betray their trust, they may not want to trade chores again.

, Just because you have work to do doesn’t mean you can’t make the work fun. Turn your chores into a race with your siblings or parents to see who can get their work done the fastest. Turn on some music and have a dance party while you work. Whatever it takes to make your chores more enjoyable, do that.You can’t win the game if your work is done sloppily, so make sure to be thorough.
Ask your parents to help you find a phone app that tracks and rewards chore performance. Check out Chore Wars, which gives you experience points for completing household tasks."

Do your toughest chores on Monday.,
Clean your bathrooms on Tuesday.,
Use Wednesday to clean all surfaces.,
Tidy up on Thursdays.",How to Do All Your Chores Within 30 Minutes3," Monday is the first day of the week, so your productivity and energy is at an all-time high. Use your thirty minutes on Monday to vacuum the main rooms (living room, kitchen, dining room, etc.), do laundry and pick up anything in a room that doesn’t belong there.To save time, throw laundry directly in the washing machine, instead of in the hamper. Leave the machine running as you do other things.
As you start to vacuum each week, the length of time it will take to complete this chore will decrease. Soon, you’ll be deep cleaning less and maintaining your clean more.

, A bathroom deep-clean includes scrubbing your toilet, mirrors, sink and shower. You’ll also need to mop the floors, remove any debris that is lying around and change out any old towels or linens that are lying around.To save even more time, leave cleaning product and a rag in your shower and clean your shower as you use it.
For bonus points, spray your shower down after every use. This will make your weekly bathroom cleaning sessions go by much faster.
Cut a grapefruit in half, sprinkle salt on it, and use it to help get soap scum out of your bathtub., Start by dusting everything, then wipe down all tables, windows, mirrors, etc. End by thoroughly vacuuming everything you didn’t already vacuum on Monday. If your floors need to be mopped, mop them after vacuuming.Always start with dusting, otherwise you’ll get dust on your newly cleaned floors.
If you’re mopping, mix a floor cleaning product (like Pine Sol) in with your mop water for the ultimate shine on your floors.
Use an already used dryer sheet to dust. The anti-static will help repel dust., Whatever is left lying around by Thursday needs to be organized and put away. If your house is pretty clean at this point in the week, use this day to focus in on a particular area, like an overflowing closet or messy cupboard.Don’t be afraid to get rid of stuff you don’t use. Donate it to charity or throw it out, but if you’re not using it, it’s got to go.
Strategically place bins or baskets in each room to corral random items. This will make each room look cleaner and more polished, and will also help you cut down on the time you spend cleaning up.

Clean as you go.,
Clean your microwave in five minutes.,
Set a timer.",How to Do All Your Chores Within 30 Minutes4," The more you get in the habit of cleaning each mess as you make it, the less the messes will pile up. If you make dinner, wash the dishes as you cook. If there are clothes all over your bedroom floor, pick them up before going to bed. If you allow a mess to pile up and sit, it will look much more intimidating than if you take care of it early and often.Never leave a room empty-handed. If you see something that doesn’t belong, take it with you.
If your house has two floors, make a rule that you never go upstairs empty-handed; always bring something with you that needs to be put away upstairs.
Institute the one-minute rule: if something takes under a minute to do, do it right now.

, Cut two lemons in half and place them in a glass dish with some water. Microwave the water until it starts to boil, then allow the bowl to cool in the microwave for a moment. The steam from the bowl should allow you to easily wipe away the mess in your microwave.Allow the water to boil while you wipe down your counters and appliances for a five minute kitchen clean.
Keep an eye on the water in the bowl to make sure it doesn’t boil over. Otherwise, it will take you twice as long to clean up.

, The key to getting everything done within your thirty minute timeframe is to stay focused. For the thirty minutes your timer is on, you only do the chores and tasks you have assigned. Do not allow yourself to get distracted by e-mails, texts or anything else. Work as hard as you can for the thirty minutes allotted, and when your time is up, move on to something else.Reward yourself with a treat or fun activity for completing your work.
Invite friends over to help (but keep in mind, you may end up having to help with their chores as well.)

Use a high-powered vacuum.,
Make a cleansing paste with salt and laundry detergent.,
Wipe with vinegar.",How to Clean Red Brick1," Use the nozzle of your high-powered vacuum cleaner to remove any surface dirt and grime on your red brick. Go over the entire surface of the brick with the nozzle of the vacuum, making sure you get into all the nooks and crannies.You can try out different settings, but you’ll probably need to use the highest one to effectively remove most of the dirt.;
, Mix 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of mild laundry detergent with 1 oz (28 g) of regular table salt and add just enough water to create a paste. Use a clean, damp cloth to apply the paste to the red brick and let it sit for fifteen minutes, or until dry.Once the paste has dried, remove the remnants with a nylon brush, or another hard-bristled brush.
If there is any remaining soot or dirt, try applying a bit of vinegar with a wet rag and wiping it clean.

, Use a clean rag to apply a bit of distilled white vinegar to the red brick. Dampen the cloth with the vinegar and wipe it across the surface of your brick. Let it sit for a few minutes and then wipe it off with a clean damp cloth.Remove any remaining vinegar residue with some warm water.

"
"
Use a hose to wash off dirt and debris.,
Apply a bleach mixture to eliminate moss and mold.,
Seal the bricks for future protection.",How to Clean Red Brick2," Turn your garden hose on full spray and wash any dirt and grime off the brick as best you can with the strong force of the hose spray. Work methodically from one side to the other so that it doesn’t keep spraying back onto a part you have already cleaned.

You may also use a bucket with soapy water to scrub stains off of exterior red brick.You can use different hose settings to access some of the harder to reach places. For example, you might need a more steady stream to get rid of cobwebs hiding in corners and crevices.

, Make a cleaning solution using four parts water to one part bleach. Combine it all in a bucket. Scrape off any moss or mold with a spatula or a stiff-bristled brush. Apply a generous covering of the bleach mixture directly to the red brick and let it sit overnight. Then you can rinse off the bleach mixture with a hose.If there are still traces of mold remaining, you can make a stronger mixture – half water and half bleach – and let it sit on the red brick for two days before rinsing it off.

, Once you have finished cleaning your exterior red bricks, consider sealing them with a siloxane- or silane-based sealer. This will help protect your bricks from future stains, and it will prevent dirt and grime from building up on your bricks over time.You should be able to purchase these products at any home improvement store.

Use a trisodium phosphate cleaning solution.,
Scrub the brick with an ammonia mixture.,
Call a professional.",How to Clean Red Brick3," Purchase some trisodium phosphate and add 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of TSP to 1 US gal (3.8 L) of hot water. Dip a scrubbing brush into the cleaning solution and scrub the red brick until you begin to see results. When you finish scrubbing, rinse the brick with warm water to remove any lingering residue from the cleaning solution.Be sure to wear rubber gloves while handling this cleaning solution.
You should be able to purchase trisodium phosphate at any grocery or home improvement store among the cleaning supplies.

This method is best for use on exterior red brick, or in a well-ventilated area.

, If your red brick is extremely stained or covered in unwanted paint, it might be a good idea to simply let a professional handle it. These cleaning and removing processes can involve harsh chemical applications that should be left to professionals.Most construction or home improvement companies can cover this kind of work, or recommend a qualified professional who can.

If you have outgrown apparel, toys, or books, bag it up and ask your parents to pass it along, or hand it down to the next sibling who can use it. You'll make space for the things you do use, and it will be easier to clean and organize the rest. Going through your closet and checking if any clothes don't fit you or you don't like any of them is a good idea as these can then be passed down to younger siblings, friends or charity shops.
Recycle any papers you no longer need and sort the rest. Any half used paper can be kept as scrap paper to help save the environment.
If you're a student, consider having a box or special folder to keep loose notes and notebooks. This way, it will be easier to get back to them or check for ones you want to discard. Keep it by your bedroom door, so it will be easier to grab when you are leaving for school.
Store smaller items in bags or storage boxes. These can be put away in a closet, serve as decoration on a dresser, or hide under a bed.
Try to keep similar items together when organizing your room so that they are easier to find. This way you don't have to search the whole room to find an item.

, An unmade bed will make any room look messy no matter how clean it is. Take off blankets, duvets, or quilts and then put them back on neatly. You may also want to take the sheets off and flip the mattress (if you have one) as it is more comfortable on the underused side.You might want to wash your sheets and blankets. You can also make your bed first to keep yourself more motivated to clean the room.


To impress your parents even further, use hospital corners to get your bad bed looking even neater.
If you make the bed first it will give you an area to do other work, like fold clothes, and organize papers and other items.

, Put all the items that don't belong in your room in a laundry basket or box and then go around the house putting the items in the right spot! For example, you might have to take out a sibling's toy, teddy or blanket that belongs in their room or put a book away in the living room.

, Focus on the biggest issues and stop when the timer ends. Usually laundry (which can be thrown in a hamper and stored away in another room), an unmade bed, and garbage are the things that make a room look messiest.

, Dusting will add an extra clean edge your parents will like, without taking a lot of time. Get a wet rag, or use a paper towel and the appropriate type of cleaning solution and wipe down greasy, dirty, or dusty surfaces.

, If you own a small rug, shake it out and hang it outside (if it's not raining) so that it can get some fresh air. Vacuuming might not be enough to get rugs like this totally clean, so shaking it out and airing it can really make a difference, not only in how it looks but in how it smells.


Do this before you sweep or vacuum. So you can get rid of the dirt on the rug.

, Remember to get all the corners and edges of the room, and don't forget to vacuum under your bed as well. This can make a room look even cleaner, since a dirty carpet or floor will make even a clean room still look messy.


If you have a hard floor, it's a good idea to sweep or mop it instead of vacuuming, since a vacuum may not pick up everything.

, Start by opening windows and doors to let fresh air circulate into the room. When it's aired out, spray the room with some air freshener. A nice smelling room will feel more clean, even when it isn't.


It's important to make sure that your dirty laundry is washed before doing this step. Dirty laundry is what usually makes a room smell to begin with.

, Make sure everything in your room has a place to go. If not, trash it: if you have so much stuff that there isn't a place to put everything, that means you have too much stuff for the space you have. This is a good sign that it's time to downsize! In the mean time, having a place for everything in your room will make cleaning your room easier the next time.


Label your boxes and other organization items so that you know where to put things.
If you have a lot of small items, such as jewelry, save that part of the organizing for last because you will have time to store them away neatly. It can take a long time to sort such objects.
Consider space and need before obtaining new objects. It's impossible to organize too much stuff.

, Clean out your closets and drawers by folding or hanging up any clothes laying around. Storing your clothes neatly and efficiently can open up more room in your closet or drawers that can be used for storing new clothes or putting away other items, like storage boxes, collections, unused heaters, and other random items in your room that don't currently have a home.

, Keeping everything in its right place and putting things away when you're done with them will reduce the amount of time spent cleaning in the future. This will also impress your parents and will help to keep them in a good mood. Keeping your room clean might also be a way to negotiate for a bigger allowance or more privileges, as long as the room stays clean and organized.

, Listening to upbeat, inspiring music can make cleaning much more fun. You'll be so excited to hear more and more songs, that the time will fly by as you clean. Use songs with a good strong beat and let them be your montage music!


If you have other things to play music on, stay away from phones (if you get text messages or your phone is connected to a social networking site, put it on silent or turn it off completely) and laptops/computers so that you don't get distracted. By staying away from them, you're helping yourself, even if you don't think so!
Remember, always ask your mom or dad if it is all right to play music.

, Reorganizing or redecorating regularly can be a great way to inspire yourself to clean your room. Every once in a while, change the room decoration or organization to your liking. This will also feel more rewarding that just normal cleaning, because it feels more productive.


The Youth section here on wikiHow has many great ideas if you're struggling!

, If you don't feel motivated to clean your room, think about how nice it will be when your room is clean rather than messy. Having an activity planned for the room that you can look forward to, such as a gathering of friends or a movie marathon with your potential love interest, can provide real motivation for getting and keeping your room clean.

, Some people might find that they start cleaning their room and then never finish because they leave the thing they hate most for last. Try to start with the thing you hate cleaning up first, then tackle the rest. This can help make sure that you see it through to the end.


Reward yourself when you finish that first task that you hate so much. This can encourage you to get it done!
Alternatively, start with the task that will make the most difference. This may be a better choice if your time is limited. One good choice is to make the bed, whether or not you use the bed as a place to put stuff while you're sorting it. Plus, it comes with a built-in reward, namely that your room will look better, sooner.

, Turning room cleaning into a game can really help motivate you to finish and also help encourage you to clean more often! There are lots of ways to turn cleaning into a game, but here are two ideas to get you started:


Use a rope or broom to divide your room into sections. Then number the sections and roll a die. Whichever number comes up, clean the according section. If you finish within 4 minutes, you get a treat! Keep rolling until the room is clean.
Write down all of the areas that you need to clean like bed, under bed, dresser, desk, shelf, bookcase, nightstand, etc. on slips of paper and fold them up to draw out of a hat or basket and clean that area only.
If you have an office chair that spins, sit in it and spin until you stop. Clean that part of your room next. You can also use a bottle which you can spin.
Make it a challenge. If you have a brother or sister that you don't share a room with, you can both clean your rooms and then see who's room is cleaner or who finishes first! Talk to your parents about setting up rewards.
A lot of popular songs are 3-4 minutes long. If you're listening to music, see how much you can get done inside of one song.
Play red light green light, but with cleaning.
Time yourself. Next time you clean, time yourself again and see if you can beat your old time. Remember to completely clean your room, though.

, Ask if a friend can come over and help you clean. Make sure that your parents know you'll both be working, otherwise your friend might get sent home. It's a good idea to choose a friend who's very tidy by nature and good at organizing. They can teach you some tricks and help you get the cleaning done efficiently. Don't forget to help your friend when it's time to clean their place.


If someone else shares your room, get him or her involved, and make sure both of you do your fair share.
Don't let siblings or friends help you if they're going to be a distraction.

, It's easy to get overwhelmed and lose all your motivation, especially when your room is really, really bad. But there are some things that you can do to keep from getting overwhelmed.


Try to work in smaller increments, picking up and putting away 5 things at a time (for example), or try cleaning in 5-minute increments, until the room gets clean over the course of a day. This isn't fast, but it might have better results in the long run, and you won't get exhausted.
Try to clean your room more often, so that it doesn't become overwhelmingly bad. Try to lightly clean your room before you go to bed every night. That way, when it's cleaning day you won't have much to do.

Start in one corner of the room, and move in a circle around the room.,
Put things away as you move around the room.,

,









If something belongs in the room you are in, put it in its proper place.

,


Put anything that belongs in the same room in one pile.

,


There is no point making a pile unless you have to walk to a different room. It's a huge waste of time to pick up one item, take it to another room, then go back and continue cleaning. Take everything that belongs in another room at the same time.

, As you walk around the room, pick up items as you go along, then dust, vacuum, and organize.

, Start with anything that is dark wood, as dust shows more clearly on dark surfaces. Don’t use a dry rag; instead, buy wood cleaners or simply use a wet rag in warm water and a mild soap. Cleaning this way will prevent dust from flying around the room as you clean. In the doorway of the room, spritz a bit of nice-smelling perfume and waft it around with your hand so when people walk in they smell something nice.








, If you vacuum before you dust, the dust will settle and you'll have to vacuum again. Nothing gives a better impression of a clean room than freshly-vacuumed rugs. Buy a perfumed vacuum powder to improve the overall smell of the room as you clean. This will save you time in the long run. Don’t bother vacuuming curtains or upholstery. It takes too much time and pulls you away from other, more important tasks.









To kill odors on carpets and upholstery, spray them lightly with a solution of 1 part white vinegar:5 parts water solution.

, This way, you can spray them on and move on to clean somewhere else while you wait for the chemicals to work on a particular surface. Come back later and simply mop the dirt up.

When you’re gathering up trash, make sure to put away any items that might be lying on the vanity or countertops, such as toothpaste, makeup items, or razors.;
, The areas of the bathroom that are the dirtiest will likely require some extra time to get clean. Choose your favorite bathroom cleaner(s) and apply it to areas such as the shower, toilet, and sink and allow it sit until the end of your cleaning. That will give the cleaning products time to really penetrate and break down the dirt and grime. Make sure to follow the cleansers’ instructions carefully.When it come to cleaning the shower, tub, and sink, it’s best to choose a cleanser that will remove mildew and soap scum.

Put things away as you use them.,
Empty the wastebasket at the end of each day.",How to Clean Your Bathroom Fast2," Your shower or tub is one of the areas in the bathroom that gets dirty the fastest.

Smooth your hand over the panty once more to ensure the item is as flat as possible before starting the roll up.

, Start with whichever side is closest to you and work your way to the other. This will roll the panty into a small, easily storable scroll.









This method will also work for thong panties, although the size of the scroll will be much smaller upon completion.

, Place them side by side. Do only one layer of the rolled panties so that you can easily find what you're looking for without messing up your organization.

Note the pros and cons of this underwear storage method.",How to Fold Panties3," The waistband side should be closest to you. Run your hand over the panty to ensure it's as flat as possible before beginning the fold.








, You will be folding toward the crotch of the panty. Do this using the narrowest possible folds.








, The panty should end up lying flat with the back side up and the crotch closest to you.








, The ends of each side of the waistband should end up overlapping each other.








, For larger types of panties with more fabric, it is best to fold twice on the way up.








, You should notice a distinct pocket inside the center of the bundle.








, This sounds complicated but it becomes a simple flick of the wrist once you get the hang of it. Start by placing your thumbs inside the pocket and bracing against each side of the opening.









Use your middle fingers to push the fabric along the back of the pocket up through the front opening while you fold the outside edges back with your thumbs.
Keep going until the bundle has been rolled into itself three times. You are essentially reversing the narrow waistband folds you made earlier in the process.

, The main advantage is that your underwear will not come unfolded until you are ready to put them on. The downside is that this method is a little more complex than the other folding techniques without being that much more compact.


This makes it ideal for people who tend to be indecisive about choosing underwear and like things to stay neat.

When deciding on your goal, think of the audience. Do you just want it to be clean for yourself, or for guests? Also, the level of “clean” will necessarily be restricted by the amount of time you devote, so keep that in mind. There are a few different possibilities:


You want the room to “look” clean to others. This might be the quickest option, as you'll just be creating the illusion of a clean and organized room. It might include just moving around clutter and wiping down furniture and be doable in under 30 minutes.
You want the room to be organized. This is a moderate option that could take up to an hour, depending on how much stuff is cluttering the room and needs to be put away.
You want the room to be organized and to be free of dirt, grime, and smells. This could take up to 2 hours, depending on a variety of factors.
There are also varying levels between the above options.;
, You’re going to have to set aside a certain amount of time to achieve your goal. One of the largest determinants of how much time you set aside will be your end goal. But before you come up with an amount of time, you need to ask yourself a few questions:


How much time do you have?
How large is the mess?
What is your definition of “quick”?

, Take a few steps to make sure that you’re undisturbed so that you can devote all of your energy to cleaning. After all, you won’t be able to get much done if you’re constantly talking to people, answering the phone, or doing other activities. In addition, you can take a few steps to further motivate yourself. Consider the following:


Turn off your cell phone.
Turn off your computer.
Tell your parents, siblings, or roommates that you’re going to be busy for a little while.
Put on some music that gets you pumped up., Spend perhaps five minutes taking a look at the mess that you’re about to clean up. When doing this, you need to create a list, either mental or on paper, of the biggest obstacles to your cleaning. After doing this, you should be somewhat more prepared to jump right in. Consider the following.


Is clutter a major obstacle? Do you have knick-knacks, old toys, books, and electronics covering all of your surfaces?
Is dirt and grime your major problem?
Is unsorted laundry or shoes your major problem?, If you've answered the above questions, then you can begin to prioritize your tasks. You'll know where to start, and where to spend the most time.


If you want to create the appearance of a clean room, spend your time moving or hiding clutter and wiping down furniture.
If you want a truly organized room, allocate time to organization rather than to things like dusting the fan.
If you want a clean and organized room and are crunched for time, consider devoting a third of your time to organization and the remaining two thirds to cleaning. If you're left with unorganized items, relocate them and tackle that problem later.

, Start off by clearing your floor of anything that shouldn’t be there. This way, you’ll start the process of sorting loose items, and getting rid of dirt and grim. After doing this, you should feel a sense of accomplishment and be well on the way to having a clean and more orderly room.


Take any loose clothes and shoes and make a pile on the floor. Chances are, these are already dirty. If they’re clean, relocate them to somewhere else.
Move out chairs and other small pieces of portable furniture into a neighboring room or hallway, this way, you’ll be able to vacuum easier when the time comes
Get a trash bag and throw any garbage or loose pieces of paper into it.
Make a “miscellaneous” pile on the floor, on a chair, or on a couch., Take a look at your desk, bookshelves, and other pieces of large furniture. Remove any items that don’t belong there, and put them in the appropriate pile (trash, miscellaneous, or clothing).


Haul any dishes to the kitchen.
Throw trash into the trash bag.
Put clothes or shoes in the clothes and shoes pile.
Put misc. items in the misc. pile., Now you’ve got a clear floor and your furniture should be clear, too. Take the opportunity to start sorting through and organizing your three piles. Depending on how much time you have, and what your goals are, you can spend more time on this or spend less time on it.


If spending less time, find some hampers or garbage bags, and put your clothes and shoes in there – for later sorting (wink, wink).
If spending more time, go through your clothing pile, bring dirty clothes to the laundry room and hang up or fold clean clothes.
If spending less time, find some cardboard boxes and dump your misc. pile into them – relocate them to the garage or another room temporarily (wink, wink).
If spending more time, go through your misc. pile and put all the items in appropriate location. Books go on a book shelf, video games go next to the game system, DVDs go on a DVD rack or next to the DVD player., If you’ve got a kitchen table, TV trays, or a counter where you eat, or anything like that, you need to get a rag and some soap, depending on the surface, and wipe it clean. Most surfaces will clean with a wet rag, but sometimes you’ll need to bring in the big guns. But remember:


Use appropriate chemicals for appropriate surfaces. You don’t want to ruin hardwood furniture with abrasive chemicals.
Try to use a microfiber towel when you can.
Stick to water and a little soap when and where you can., Dusting will give your room a much cleaner appearance, and help improve the air quality. It is one of the most important elements of keeping a clean house. Depending on how much time you have, you can choose the extent in which you will dust. Consider:


Use microfiber towels when you can.
Dusting the surfaces of furniture, like desks, a TV stand, bookshelves, and more.
Dust ceiling fans.
Dust and remove cobwebs from crown molding.
Wipe down the surfaces of electronics with microfiber towels., Now that your surfaces are clean and better organized and your floor is clear, it’s time to vacuum. Vacuuming will help remove dirty, dust, and dog or cat hair from the room. It is an essential part of any clean. Most rooms can be vacuumed in under five minutes, if you’re in a hurry.


Start at the back of the room and systematically move toward the entrance.
Make sure to vacuum along the baseboards, behind and under couches and other furniture.
Vacuum couches, chairs, and loveseats if appropriate. Be careful though, try to avoid damaging delicate fabrics.
If you’re going to spend a little bit more time, try to vacuum over an area 3 or 4 times., Mopping is essential in removing dirty and grime from your floor, and all you need is some soap and a bucket. This is a must, so you won’t want to skip it. But, if you’re in a hurry, there are a few ways to save time:


If you want to save time, invest in a swifter or something similar.
Another way to save time is to get a wet soapy towel, and to walk around the room with it. This won’t be as effective as actual mopping, but you’ll be able to pick up a lot of dirt and grime and save time.
If mopping the old fashion way, make sure to sweep the floor first. Sweep from the back of the room toward the entrance, working systematically, and picking up your dirt/debris piles as you move toward the entrance.After sweeping, start mopping from the back of the room toward the front. Mop 3x3 or 4x4 foot sections and then rinse your mop with fresh water. Slowly and systematically move toward the entrance of the room.

, After you've mopped, make sure to take a good look around the room and make some final adjustments if you need to. This is your chance to spend a couple minutes getting to the little things you might have neglected because you were in a hurry. Also, there are some finishing touches that will help your room look and smell clean:


Open the windows to let fresh air in.
Turn on the fan, this will help the floor dry and will spread the clean air from outside around your home.
Consider lighting a candle.
If you're confident in how clean the room is, open the blinds and let some more light in.

Move onto learning a slightly more advanced method.,
Fold the cuffs over towards the toes one third of the socks’ length.,
Repeat folding this way until you can do it easily.",How to Fold Socks2," This way of folding works very well on most socks, and it creates a much tighter and tidier fold.








Again, find a pair of clean matching socks.
Lay the socks on a flat and firm surface.
Lay one sock on top of the other and align them evenly. If you turn them to the side, it should look like you have 1 sock.
However, this time the heels should be facing up and the toes should be pointing toward you. Smooth the socks out.

, Smooth the socks again with your hand. This might be a tad tricky because the heels might be naturally protruding.









Now take hold of the toes and fold the socks again about one third of the length toward the folded cuffs. There should be a little overlap between the toes and the cuffs.
Slightly open the elastic of the top folded cuff and tuck the toes in.
Straighten the socks again. You should have a flat, square-like looking pair of folded socks.

, This method requires more practice, but it is very much worth it! It will help keep your dress socks from getting stretched or misshaped.









Fold all types of socks you have using this method.
If your sock drawers are shallow, or you use drawer dividers, this method will help keep the drawer looking neat and organized.Socks folded this way are easy to organize by color and style.

"
"
Master the neatest way of folding.,
Lay one sock on top of another so they make a cross.,
Give yourself enough time to practice.",How to Fold Socks3," This works best for crew or knee-high socks. The result is a very tidy square-looking fold that doesn’t stretch the cuffs and helps keep the sock drawer looking especially neat!








Again, start with a pair of matching socks you want to practice on.
Lay the socks on a firm, flat surface.
Straighten the socks out with your hands. There should be no lumps.

, The bottom sock’s heel should be facing up. The top sock should cross the bottom one at the middle.









Hold up the bottom sock by its toe and fold it across the top sock. The cross will now look like the letter T. Tuck the toe part that extends past the top sock underneath it.
Now hold the cuff of the bottom sock and fold that end also across the top sock as far as it will go.
Start tucking the unfolded sock by first bringing it by the toes across the forming square. Tuck in the part that might be sticking out.
Bring over the remaining long part by the cuff.
Turn the folded sock square and tuck in the two cuffs that are still loose. Flatten the folded square.

, This method is well worth the time. It will not only help extend the life of your socks, but it will make storing and finding them a breeze.









Practice makes perfect, and in this case it makes perfectly folded socks.
This method is also fantastic for arranging socks in neat drawer dividers.
Once you start folding socks this way, accidental snags and stretched cuffs will become part of the past.

Place socks on top of each other and straighten them out with your hands.
Line up the socks together so that if you turn them to the side, it looks like you have 1 sock. The toes, heels and cuffs should all be lined up.

, Bring the cuff of the top sock about an inch down and inward, toward the other sock.









Start rolling the socks from the toes up by making sure to roll as tight as possible.
Continue rolling until you reach the top. The tighter the roll, the more compact and neat the socks will be.
Once the socks are rolled up, insert a finger inside of the outer cuff and pull the outer cuff over the top and around the rolled socks. Tuck any loose parts in.
Finally, the socks will look like tight little rolls.

, The hardest part will be keeping the roll tight and the socks lined up.

Fold the pants in half or thirds, depending on space.",How to Fold Jeans1," Insert your hand into each pocket, especially the largest ones, and push them to their furthest extent. If your pockets are bunched together, or pulled inside out, they may make your fold uneven or bulky.






;
, Pick up the pair of jeans by either end of the waistband, keeping the seams of each leg along the outer side. Shake the jeans with one or two short, emphatic flaps to remove any obvious wrinkles.








, Line up the legs of the jeans so the seams remain on the outside, or your fold may create wrinkles. You may fold so either the back pockets or front pockets are touching; both methods are common.








, This step makes the folded jeans a little thicker, but it may make them appear tidier, and reduces wrinkles in the crotch area.Smooth out the crotch fabric extending past the legs, then tuck them over the leg lying face-up toward you.

, Lay the shirt face-down in front of you and smooth out any wrinkles with your hand.

, Find the fold point at the top of the left shoulder. This is the spot in between the shoulder seam and the neck seam, where you would usually see a store bought shirt folded. Now, envision an imaginary line going all the way down to the bottom hem from that point at the shoulder. Fold the left side in along that line and smooth out the sleeve so that it lies flat.

, Now, at the shoulder for the sleeve, you’ll see that the edge of flattened sleeve creates a line. Pull this sleeve edge over and match it up with the fold you just made on the side of the shirt. This should create a smooth triangular fold at the shoulder/armpit area. Now, take the cuff of the sleeve and fold it up so that the cuff rests in the circle of the collar. This should create a line at the elbow.

, Fold up the other side of the shirt using this same process.

, Take the bottom of the shirt and fold it up a few inches. This bottom fold should take up about a quarter of the shirt. Take the new “bottom” line where you made the fold and bring that up to be level with the shoulders of the shirt. Flip the whole thing over and you’re done. You should now have a nicely folded shirt.

, Lay the shirt face down on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles.

, Draw an imaginary line from the middle point between the collar and shoulder seams, all the way down to the hem of the shirt. Fold the shirt along this line, bringing the left side of the shirt in to the center.

, Repeat that same process for the other side of the shirt.

, Now, fold up the bottom of the shirt so that the hem meets up with the line of the shoulders.

, Flip the whole thing over. You should now have a folded shirt.


Using a clipboard can make this process easier and cleaner-looking. Simply center the top of the clipboard over the collar of the shirt and fold around it, sliding it out when you’re done.

, Lay the shirt out flat in front of you, face-up. Orient the shirt so that the neck is on your left.

, On side of the shirt furthest from you, pinch the shirt with your left hand halfway between the sleeve seam and the neck seam, at the top of the shoulder.

, Imagine a line going straight down that side of the shirt On that same side of the shirt, grasp the shirt with your right hand halfway down the shirt. This will be where you make the bottom fold of the shirt, just like in a store. At this point, pinch these two spots, your left hand should be parallel with your right hand.


You will want to be sure that your pinch is getting through both layers of the shirt.

, Keeping a firm pinch, cross your left hand over your right hand to bring the shoulder pinch down to the bottom hem of the shirt. Grab the hem in that same pinch with your left hand so that you have all four layers together. Your arms should now be crossed.

, Making sure to keep a firm grasp on the shirt at the two points you have grasped, uncross your arms as you lift up the shirt. Keep the fabric between your two hands taut and give the shirt a shake to get out any wrinkles.

, Lay the shirt face down on the folding surface temporarily, so that you can get the loose sleeve flat, then fold the pinched side over. The shirt should now be facing upwards and b completely, neatly folded.

, Take a hold of the bottom of the crease at the hem of one leg and then use your other hand to grasp the crease at the other end (this usually is somewhere around the crotch). Give the pants a slight shake and hold the fabric taut to smooth the leg out.


You should always be sure that the fly is zipped on a pair of pants before folding, and that all buttons and clasps are done.

, Using that grasped crease as one edge, lay the leg of the pant down so that it is flat and the crease forms on edge.

, Repeat for the other side, laying the second leg down on top of the first. The two front creases should be on the same side, one on top of the other.

, Generally, you should only fold the pants in half from here, although some people will fold the pants into thirds or quarters. Folding once is the better idea because it will create fewer horizontal lines in the leg of the pant and the only one that is created will be at the knee, which is prone to creasing anyway.


Handing dress pants is the better idea, when possible.

, Lay one leg out flat on the table, with the side seams on either side (not at the center).

, Grabbing the far side seam on the other leg, bring it over so that the pants are folded in half. The half fold should follow roughly with the crotch seam.

, Straighten the legs and make sure all of the seams are aligned, to decrease wrinkles.

, You can now fold the pants into thirds or quarters, as you prefer.

, Lay the skirt down on a flat surface and splay the fabric completely so it’s as flat as possible. Fold it in half, bringing one side of the skirt over to the other, and then fold it in half again (the same way). Now, if it has a flare, take the bottom corner and bring it over to the other bottom corner. This should make a triangular fold which makes the skirt much more of a rectangle. You can then fold the waist down to the hem and your skirt should be nicely folded.

, Many people use variations of folding one sock over the other, so that the elastic holds both together. However, this stretches out the elastic over time and is not preferable. It is better to lay one sock on top of the other and then roll them up like a sleeping bag. Put socks away in a drawer in a tidy row, with the swirl of the roll facing upward. This way you can identify and pull the socks you want without having to dig around through your drawer.

, Whether you’re folding women’s or men’s underwear, the process will be functionally the same. Lay them flat with the back side on the table. Fold in one side and then the other to fold the underwear into thirds. Then, fold the top seam down to the ⅔ point and bring the bottom up to cover it.


Fold boxers by folding them in half, along the crotch seam, and then into thirds.

, Fitted sheets are one of the hardest linens to fold and many people give up, but it’s not actually as hard as it seems. By nesting the corners of the sheets, it becomes much easier to fold the sheet and get a very neat final look. You’ll find videos and instructions in the Fold a Fitted Sheet wikiHow.

, Various blankets and sheets can all be folded very simply. Generally, this involves folding a blanket into sixths or eighths. While it might seem like you need to people to fold large blankets, with practice it’s very simple to do on your own.

, There are lots of different ways that you can fold towels. Which was you choose will depend on why you’re folding it. You might want a more decorative fold if you have guests over, or you might want something more basic for storage. Keep in mind that rolling towels, like you’d roll a sleeping bag, is technically the most space efficient way to fold towels.



Fold normal towels for storage either by rolling them or folding them into sixths or quarters.
You can also fold hotel-style or fancy towels very easily.

Alternate waistbands when stacking, to save space.,
Arrange jeans in a row for ease of selection.,
Come up with a sorting system.",How to Fold Jeans2," The waistband of the jeans typically contain a different amount of material than the hems, making a stack of jeans tilted and uneven. Prevent this by alternating the position of the waistband between the left and right sides of the stack.







, Use a box or basket to stack your folded jeans in a horizontal row. This makes it easy to pull out the pair you want without moving the rest of the stack. Keep the folded edge at the top to keep the stack tidy.







, If you own many pairs of jeans, sort them into separate stacks for ease of selection. Consider arranging them by style of cut (e.g. bell bottoms, tight jeans, and loose jeans) to make the neatest stacks. Other possible sorting criteria include color, pattern, or frequency of use.









Consider using shelf dividers to keep different categories of jeans separate in the same container.

Make an ice cube sandwich.,
Bag it up in the freezer.,
Get scraping or tweezing.,
Spot-clean and launder the garment as usual.",How to Remove Chewing Gum from Cotton1," Soft, mushy chewing gum will harden like a rock when frozen, and be much easier to remove. Often, two ice cubes are all you need to get the job started.Lay the gummed up spot of the garment, gum side down, on top of an ice cube. Place a second ice cube on top of the spot.
Wait for the ice to melt. By this time, the gum should be sufficiently hardened.;
, If ice cubes prove insufficient in hardening the gum, or if you have time to wait, you can put the garment, gum and all, into the freezer. Give it at least one hour, or even better a day, to harden.Place the garment in a zip-close bag, with the gum stain facing out.
You could conceivably skip using the bag, but it helps prevent unwanted stains and having the cotton (or gum, for that matter) stick to a frosty surface in the freezer.

, Once the gum is hardened, carefully remove it from the cotton. The last thing you want to do is damage the garment you are trying to salvage through careless yanking or rough scraping.The back (non-serrated) side of a metal or plastic butter knife makes an excellent frozen gum scraper. Work the blade in between the gum and fabric, without stabbing or digging into the cotton. Take your time, because the more you remove now, the easier the final cleaning will be.
If you prefer, you can also employ tweezers to pluck away the frozen gum. This may be preferable if you have several smaller gum spots on the garment. Again, be gentle and thorough.

, If there is still gum residue or staining on the garment, use a spot cleaner or a bit of laundry detergent and blot, wipe, or lightly scrub it away.Check that the spot cleaner is color-safe for your garment by testing it in an inconspicuous spot.
Launder the de-gummed garment as normal, following the recommendations on the tag.

, Grab the narrow edge of the scarf at one end. Fold this end of the scarf up and over until it's lined up with the other end. Straighten the edges of the fabric so that they are lined up.


To be clear, you want to make a ""hamburger fold,"" not a ""hotdog fold."" You should be making the scarf shorter, not skinnier.

, Grab the folded end of the scarf. Fold it over the top of the scarf until it's even with the ""open"" end of the scarf just like you did in the last step.

, Take the folded edge and fold it over the top of the scarf once again. Straighten the edges so that they're properly aligned. When you're done, the scarf should look a little like a small half sheet of paper.

Lay out the shirt.,
Pinch the shoulder.,
Pinch the midsection.,
Fold the shirt over.,
Uncross your arms.,
Fold the remainder of the shirt.,
Lay the shirt down.",How to Fold a Shirt2," Lay the shirt out horizontally in front of you, face-up. The neck of the shirt should be to your left.

, On the far side of the shirt, grasp the shirt with your left hand at the top of the shoulder, halfway between the sleeve and the neck.

, On that same side, grasp the shirt with your right hand halfway down the shirt (think of this as the point where the bottom fold would be on a store-bough shirt). Your right hand should be parallel with your left hand.


Make sure that you have pinched through both layers of fabric.

, Still pinching the shirt with both hands, cross your left hand over your right hand so that the shoulder of the shirt goes down to the hem. Pinch the hem and the shoulder together with your left hand.


Your arms should now be crossed.

, Lift the shirt up as you uncross your arms, keeping your grasp on the shirt with both arms. Pull the shirt taut with both hands and shake out and creases.

, Holding the shirt up, lay it so that the front portion of the unfolded sleeve is touching the ground, up to the equivalent position where it is folded on the other side.

, Lower the rest of the shirt so that the fold is complete and the front of the shirt is facing up.

Use the permanent press cycle.,
Always starch your shirts before folding.,
Don't pack shirts too tightly.",How to Fold a Shirt3," This dryer cycle will allow your clothes to cool while they are still moving, preventing wrinkles from forming. Clothes are most likely to wrinkle while they are warm, so cooling them when they can't form wrinkles is best.

, If you really want to keep your shirts from wrinkling after you fold them, starch and iron your shirts before folding.

, When you put away folded shirts, don't pack them in too tightly. This is more likely to wrinkle them.

"
"
Use your hair dryer.,
Get out the iron.,
Remove any residue.",How to Remove Chewing Gum from Cotton2," Instead of trying to harden gum by freezing it, you can instead soften it further with heat. This is faster, but a bit more risky, because you can scorch the cotton or overheat the gum and make an even bigger mess.Set the dryer on a medium or low setting, and wave it back and forth so no one spot overheats.
Keep going until the gum appears to be on the verge of melting.
Put gloves on (because the gum may be very hot in spots), and peel the gum away. If sufficiently heated, it should pull away easily.

, If you don’t have a hair dryer, or happen to have your iron out anyway, you can use the latter item to soften and peel away the gum. Once again, though, be careful not to scorch the garment or melt the gum into a puddle of sticky goo.Place a piece of cardboard on your ironing board. Place the garment, gum side down, on top of the cardboard.
Set your iron to medium to prevent scorching or overheating. Run the iron over the back side of the gum spot as you normally would.
Check your progress occasionally. When the gum is sufficiently heated, it should peel right away from the clothing and stick instead to the cardboard.

, The process for removing any remaining stickiness or residue is the same whether you freeze or heat the gum off.Blot, wipe, or lightly scrub away any gum remnants with a color- and fabric-safe spot cleaner or with laundry detergent, then launder as usual.

"
"
Give it a sour soak.,
Coat it.,
Fight sticky with sticky.",How to Remove Chewing Gum from Cotton3," Soaking the the garment in a slightly acidic solution will start to break down the gum and help release its grip on the fabric. You need only soak the gummed up portion of the garment, but you can also dunk the entire item if that is easier to do.The first option for soaking is lemon juice, either fresh-squeezed or bottled pure lemon juice.
You can also use white vinegar, which may work even better if warmed.
Let the garment soak until the gum begins to loosen from the garment, then scrape it away with the back of a butter knife. Rinse away the remaining juice or vinegar, then spot-clean (if necessary) and launder the garment as usual.

, No one would ever confuse hairspray and mayonnaise, but either one can be used as a gum-removal coating in a pinch. They may also be a bit messier than other methods, though.Coat the gum with aerosol hairspray, then let it dry. The gum will harden and be easier to scrape away.
Work a healthy dab of mayo into the gum. The oils and acids in the mayonnaise will help break down and loosen the gum, and it should peel away much more easily.
Rinse, spot-clean, and launder the garment as needed and recommended.

, Chewed gum may love to stick to cotton clothing, but if you give it an even more appealing option — like something that is also sticky — it may change its mind and move on without a fight.Mounting putty — the kind used to hang dorm-room posters — can be pressed over the gum. Once you get a good bond, peel the entire glob away.
Also, you can add one more item to the long list of uses for duct tape. Lay a strip over the gum, smooth it over, then pull it off purposefully (somewhere between gently peeling and ripping it away).
Once again, spot-clean and launder the garment as recommended.

Lay the scarf flat.,
Fold in half lengthwise.,
Fold the scarf over on itself.,
Repeat once or twice more in an ""accordion"" style.",How to Fold a Scarf2," Ever wondered how clothing stores get their scarves looking so good when they're on display? With this fold, you'll be able to show off your scarf like it's brand new. To start, lay your scarf completely flat, as above.


For this method, it's also important to straighten out any tassels at either end of the scarf (and to keep them straight throughout the fold) — this makes the fold look a little more professional when it's finished.

, When your scarf is flat, grab one of the long edges and fold it over so that it's in line with the other edge. Your scarf should now look like one long, skinny strip. Try to keep any tassels straight and flat after your fold.

, Next, fold the scarf over itself so that both open edges are in line with each other. To be clear, this is a ""hamburger"" fold, not a ""hotdog"" fold — your scarf should get shorter, not skinnier.

, To finish, fold your scarf either back over on itself either once or twice more (depending on how compact you want the finished product to look. Reverse the direction of your fold each time so that the pattern of folds ""accordions."" When you're done, line the edges of your scarf up so that your tassels hang straight and free past the edge of the fold.


This fold style is handy because, in addition to making your scarf look elegant and attractive, the ""accordion-ing"" folds make it very easy to pick up and throw on in a hurry.

Drape the scarf around the mannequin's shoulders.,
Bring the right side over the left.,
Bring the end of the scarf under and over the top of the loop.,
Tighten the ""knot"" as you wish.",How to Fold a Scarf3," Like other clothes, scarves are often displayed on mannequins in stores. If you have a mannequin (or a similar round display mount), you can make it ""wear"" your scarf with this easy fold. Start by laying the scarf over the mannequin's shoulders (or around the back of your mount) so that it hangs down on either side.


Note that this style also works for yourself — these instructions may be for displaying the scarf on a mannequin, but you can wear it by simply replicating them.

, The scarf should now be hanging down roughly evenly on either side of your mannequin. Grab the end of the scarf on the right and pull it over the end on the left. The scarves should be making an ""X"" pattern.

, Next, take the right end of the scarf that you moved in the last step. Tuck it up and under the left end. Let the slack fall over the top of the loop you've just made. You should now have a very loose ""knot"" or tie roughly in the center of the mannequin's chest.

, At this point, you may pull on either end of the scarf to tighten the central ""knot."" As you do this, for a symmetrical presentation, try to keep both loose ends of the scarf roughly level.

Fold the scarf in half loosely.,
Slip the ring into the fold.,
Twist the scarf until fairly tight.,
Keep twisting.,
Tie the bottom ends together.",How to Fold a Scarf4," This fold, which looks a little like a hair braid, is a space-saving, visually appealing way to store scarves on an ordinary coat hanger. To start, all you need to do is fold the scarf in half. However, unlike above, you don't need to align the edges with each other — a loose fold will do, as long as there's about the same amount of material on either side of the fold.

, With this fold, you'll either tie the scarf directly to your coat hanger or tie it to a metal or plastic ring and then hang this on your coat hanger.If you want to use a ring, grab one before beginning — specially-made ""scarf rings"" are sold at many fashion boutiques and specialty retailers online, but you can also use metal binder rings. Regardless of the ring you use, slip the scarf through it so that the ring sits at the folded part of the scarf before continuing.


If you're not using a ring, just slide your hanger between the two ends of the scarf and up to the fold. In this case, you may ignore references to rings in the rest of this method's instructions.

, Grabbing your loosely-folded scarf, twist each end in opposite directions. After a few twists, the scarf should be a little firm and ""ropey."" Continue twisting — you want the scarf to get quite tight.


Most scarves should be plenty resilient for this fold. However, if you notice your scarf begin to tear or strain under the stress of the twisting, stop and try a different fold — you don't want to ruin your scarf.

, After it's gotten fairly tight, your scarf should begin to curl up on itself with each subsequent twist. Within a few more twists, the scarf should look like a long, knotty, braided lock of hair. The ring should be in the fold at the top of the twisted scarf — if it has slipped, just slide it back to the top.

, Finish by taking the two ends of the scarf and tying them to each other in a basic knot. This should keep the tension in the ""braid,"" ensuring that it stays twisted. Congratulations — you should now have a fairly compact scarf ""braid"" with a convenient hanging ring that should be a cinch to slide onto a coat hanger along with as many other scarves as you wish.

Travel with Tide pods.",How to Use Tide Pods1," Before starting the wash cycle, determine the load size of your laundry. Make sure that your clothes, sheets, or towels are loosely packed into the washer to allow for proper cleaning and rinsing, and to prevent wrinkling and pilling. As a general rule:A small load will fill about 1/3 of the washing machine.
A medium or regular load means that the washer is half full.
A large load fills up about ¾ of the washer.
An extra-large load will fill the washer to full capacity.;
, Place Tide Pods at the bottom or back of your washer, then place your laundry on top. Choose the appropriate number of pods based on your load size. Use one pod for small to medium loads, two packs for large or very soiled loads, and three pods when the washing machine is at full capacity.Be sure that you don’t place Tide pods in the dispenser part of your washing machine, but in the drum itself.

, Tide pods work in all types of washing machines, in warm and cold water. Choose the correct wash cycle on your washer based on the care instructions on your clothing labels. For a breakdown of what instructions the five fabric care symbols indicate, visit Tide’s website at http://tide.com/en-us/how-to-wash-clothes/how-to-do-laundry/how-to-read-laundry-symbols.


For instance, the symbol showing a water-filled basin with one dot in it indicates that an item should be washed in cold water.

, When washing a load of delicates (e.g. undergarments), be sure to use Tide Free & Gentle pods. These pods are free of perfumes and dyes to be gentle on clothing and skin alike. They are also hypoallergenic and dermatologist recommended., All Tide pods are formulated with special stain removers. For especially soiled or smelly laundry, add an additional Tide pod to the wash for extra cleaning power. For stuck on stains, pre-treat items by rinsing them in cold water and blotting stains.For extra stain fighting power, buy a Tide to Go Instant Stain remover pen and rub the stain with it prior to washing.

, Bring a few tide pods with you when travelling to avoid having to purchase detergent at hotels or nearby shops. Store pods in a hard plastic container to prevent them from being pierced during travel, and from getting wet. You can also transport Tide pods this way for trips to your local laundromat."

You start by laying the suit jacket face-up, to ensure that the lapels of the jacket are flat and evenly folded.Grab the bottom of the jacket by the four flaps (two front flap sides, two back flap sides). Use your other arm to support the mid section of the jacket as you flip it over from the bottom, to lay face-down., Fold the left side shoulder and sleeve in toward the back of the jacket. Do the same on the right side of the jacket, making sure that the jacket sleeves are lined up straight and even on both the side edges of the jacket.Use your hands to gently adjust and flatten out any wrinkles.

, Fold the trousers in half widthwise, so both trouser legs line up evenly lengthwise.If your trousers are pleated, you could also fold the trousers along the pleating in the middle of the legs.

Lay the trousers on your flat surface and again fold the trousers lengthwise. Bring the midsection fold of the trousers up to the waistband and bottom hems so the edges are evenly aligned., Place the folded trousers on the top, back portion of the jacket.Make sure that the pants are even with the collar of the jacket. The folded sides of the pants should be parallel to the folded sleeves and shoulders of the jacket.

, With the pants on top of the top, back portion of the jacket, fold the bottom of the jacket up to lie on top of the pants.Use your hands to gently spread out any uneven and bumpy surfaces. Hold on to the entire folded suit by the jacket bottom and collar area, and flip the suit over.Again, make sure that the lapels of the suit jacket are straight and even.

, Open up a large, plastic zip bag, and place the folded side of the suit into the bag first.The collar should be toward the top of the bag. As you close the zip closure on the bag, leave some room for air in the bag.Once the suit is folded in the plastic bag, you can place it in your wardrobe or drawer.


The air pocket in the bag will provide a barrier of air space, so if anything is on top of the suit, it won’t press down and cause wrinkles in the suit.

, Tide pods can be toxic if ingested by children or animals, which is a concern given the pods’ colorful and candy-like appearance. Store Tide pods securely in a high cupboard, out of reach for kids and pets. Be vigilant when using laundry pods (e.g. avoid putting a pod down on a counter or table while preparing laundry, or simply make sure kids and pets are out of the room before doing laundry)., Make sure that the lid of your Tide pods container is shut firmly before storing, and that the pods are kept dry. Wetness could cause pods to leak and stick together in the container. Accordingly, only use dry hands to handle Tide pods when doing laundry."

Place Tide pods in the washer first.,
Avoid overloading your washing machine.,
Do not open Tide pods to use for pretreating.",How to Use Tide Pods3," To ensure that your Tide Pods dissolve properly, always place them in the washer before you put in your laundry. Placing pods at the bottom of the machine allows for the maximum contact with water necessary to dissolve them. If you need to place laundry in the machine to gauge your load size, do so and then remove it to place the Tide pod at the back or bottom of the barrel., Make sure that your washing machine is loosely packed. Overloading your machine will prevent the level of agitation during washing that is necessary for your Tide pods to completely dissolve. When placing clothing or other laundry items in the barrel, avoid pushing or pressing them in to make more room., To avoid stains or issues with your Tide pods not dissolving, do not open Tide pods to use for pretreating. Pods are formulated with super-concentrated detergent that is released during the wash cycle. The stain remover included in Tide pods should be adequate for dealing with stains."

, It is not necessary to leave your jeans in the freezer overnight. An ice cube will harden and moisten the gum.









Put some cubes of ice in a plastic bag.
Put the bag of ice on the gum.
Leave it on the denim for about 25 minutes., Freezing the entirety of your jeans can improve your chances of removing the gum. When the surrounding area of the gum is stiff and frozen, you'll have an easier time scrapping off the gum.Empty all the pockets.
Fold the jeans into a plastic bag. Don't fold the side with the gum with another piece of fabric.
Put the bag in the freezer and leave it there for about an hour or longer.

, Use a dull blade or a kitchen knife to scrape off the hardened gum. When scraping, go with the natural grain of the jeans. Be very gentle and try not to stretch the material too much.







, Grab a toothbrush with hard bristles, but don't use your everyday toothbrush. Brush away the remaining pieces of gum.

Clean concrete.",How to Make Washing Soda," You will need a large metal baking dish (though stone or glass will also work), a one-pound (454 grams) box of baking soda, and a wooden spoon.;
, Cover the bottom of the baking dish with a thin layer of baking soda. Baking a thinner layer that's about one-quarter inch (0.6 cm) thick will ensure that the process occurs uniformly.

, Depending on how large a batch you’re making, this could take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours.Stir every 15 minutes to speed up the conversion and ensure it happens in a uniform fashion., As the baking soda converts to washing soda, it will become courser, grainier, and more matte. Also, washing soda doesn’t clump up like baking soda does. Washing soda grains will be more like sand and will run through your fingers., Once the baking soda to washing soda conversion is complete, leave the washing soda in the baking dish and allow it to cool to room temperature.


Store your washing soda in an airtight container, such as a mason jar or old (clean) coffee container.

, Baking soda, which is also known as sodium bicarbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate, is the chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is used as a cleaner, a deodorizer, and it’s used in baking, along with many other uses.

, Washing soda, also known as sodium carbonate, is the chemical compound with the formula Na2CO3. Washing soda has a much higher pH level than baking soda, and is not safe to consume.


The chemical difference between washing and baking soda is that baking soda has a hydrogen molecule that washing soda doesn’t, and it’s missing one of the sodium molecules.

, When baking soda is heated above a certain temperature, its chemical structure changes. When heated, the baking soda decomposes, or undergoes a dehydration process, and loses its hydrogen molecule, leaving behind washing soda, water, and carbon dioxide., Add between a half-cup and a full cup (125 to 250 grams) of washing soda to your washing along with your regular detergent. Use a full cup for heavily soiled loads or if you have hard water. The grease fighting nature of washing soda will boost your regular detergent’s ability to clean and remove dirt and grime.

, Combine one-quarter cup (62.5 grams) each of washing soda and borax in a lidded plastic or glass jar. Add in one-half cup of baking soda (125 grams) and one-half cup (73 grams) of laundry flakes. Stir to combine.Use about one-half cup (125 grams) of homemade detergent per load.
If you can’t find laundry or soap flakes, purchase a bar of pure soap (like glycerine or Castile soap) and grate it.

, You can make your own dishwasher detergent by combining two cups (500 grams) each of washing soda and borax in a glass or plastic container with a lid. Replace the lid and shake to mix. Use about two tablespoons (30 grams) per dishwasher load.Don’t use this detergent on aluminum, as the high alkalinity can damage the metal.

, Combine one-half teaspoon of washing soda (2.5 grams), two teaspoons of borax (10 grams), and one-half teaspoon (2.5 ml) of liquid soap in a spray bottle. Add in two cups of warm water and agitate to mix.


Use this to clean floors, bathrooms, toilets and showers, kitchens, or anywhere else that’s dirty or grimy., Once a week, pour one-quarter cup (62.5 grams) of washing soda down the drain.
