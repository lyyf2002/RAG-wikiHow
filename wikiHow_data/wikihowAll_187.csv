Instead, assume that you should not use water. In this case, you should stick to vacuuming, scrubbing with a dry brush, or using a product that doesn’t have a water base., Decide what type of solution you will use before beginning to clean your sofa. Good water-based cleaning solutions include gentle soap, mild dish detergent, carpet cleaner, and upholstery shampoo. Water-free solvents include rubbing alcohol, clear alcohol like gin or vodka, dry-cleaning solvent, lighter fluid, baby wipes, and oxygenating solutions that don’t contain bleach., Do this to remove dust and loose debris. You should use the soft brush attachment to vacuum. Do not use a high-powered vacuum attachment. This could pull at the fabric and cause it to wrinkle.You should vacuum your couch once a week.

, Since it is better to avoid using liquid whenever possible, begin scrubbing at stains with a dry brush. This will help lift crusty spills from the fabric. Scrub gently so that you do not pull at the fabric too much., Specifically, remove the seat cushions, back cushions and loose pillows. Vacuum and brush the newly-uncovered areas. Use the vacuum attachment if necessary to remove hard-to-reach crumbs or dust., Pour a small amount of the solution onto a clean washcloth. Gently scrub at a small portion on the fabric that is not very visible. Wait for the fabric to dry before gauging whether or not it has been damaged., If the solution did not cause any damage, you can begin to clean the sofa. Use a clean washcloth or sponge and gently scrub. Do not saturate the couch with the solution. Instead, use only a few drops and reapply more solution if necessary., Even though your solution should not stain, it is better to use a blow dryer on the wet part immediately after you have finished cleaning.

It can be restored to its normal texture with a little brushing. Make sure to use a soft-bristled brush., Once you have cleaned all of the cushions, you can put the couch back together. It should look and feel like new. You can do extra brushing and vacuuming if you aren’t completely pleased with the outcome.

, Use an aerosol can of original Lysol. Spray a small amount of the product onto the stain. Blot the stain with a clean cloth until it lifts. Then, blow dry and use a soft-bristled brush to restore the texture., Mix baking soda and water in a bowl. It should create a thick paste. Apply the paste to the stain and wait a few minutes. Then, wipe the stain clean., If you don’t have WD-40, you can also use Dawn dish soap. Apply a small amount to the spot and blot it with a towel or sponge. Rinse with water until the stain is removed. Avoid using this method if you can’t use water on your sofa., Do not use this method if you can’t use water on your sofa. Rub a cube of ice on the chewing gum until it hardens. Then, peel it off.

You may need to do this several times in order to completely remove the solid. If cleaning a chair with fabric upholstery, it’s important not to rub as you clean; you might force the solids into the fabric and make it more difficult to clean.


It’s important to act as soon as you see the mess, so it doesn’t have time to set.;
, The faster you attend to a spill, the less likely it is to set and cause a stain. If you act quickly enough, you should just need to dampen a cloth or rag with water. Use it to sponge up as much of the liquid as you can. Wring out the liquid in a separate container or a sink, and keep blotting the spill until it’s gone., This tag provides cleaning instructions directly from the manufacturer. If you see an S, you should only use solvent-based solutions to clean the chair. A W means you should use a water-based solvent, while an SW or S/W means either type of solution can be used., Any product containing water could damage the fabric used in your chair’s upholstery. There are several brands of cleaners, and you should always check the instructions coming with the product. Some are in liquid form while others are powdered.


In either case, you’ll want to apply a small amount of solvent to a dry cloth and blot up the stain.
Make sure to use a damp cloth to wick away the solvent, otherwise it could leave a ring on your upholstery., Mix a mild dish soap with water and dampen a clean cloth with it. Blot the stain with the cloth. Be careful not to rub the stain, otherwise you may damage the upholstery, especially if it’s made of fabric or microfibers., Dampen a cotton ball with a few drops of rubbing alcohol. Test the alcohol on a small spot of the chair that’s out of view. If it doesn’t cause any damage, use the cotton ball to rub the stain.Mesh upholstery tends to get frayed if rubbed too briskly. Make sure to be more gentle on these surfaces.Don’t use rubbing alcohol on acrylic fabric upholstery.Rubbing alcohol only has a small amount of water, and you may be able to use it on S coded upholstery. If in doubt, apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a small, inconspicuous part of the upholstery. If there’s no damage, you should be able to use the rubbing alcohol.

, Start with an upholstery attachment, which has a wide plastic end and a brush underneath. The brush is soft enough that it won’t scratch leather and vinyl upholstery. Pass the vacuum over the chair’s seat, back and arms.After going over the upholstery with the upholstery attachment, you can use the crevice tool to cover areas that are harder to reach.Make sure the suction isn’t too strong, as this could damage leather upholstery.

, Use a natural, biodegradable dish detergent as your soap. Make sure to test the solution on a small, inconspicuous part of the upholstery; this is the only way to be absolutely sure the solution won’t damage it. Depending on what the upholstery is made of, the makeup of your solution will vary.


For leather upholstery, mix a few drops of soap with a quart (946ml) of water.For fabric upholstery, mix a quarter cup (59ml) of soap with a cup (237ml) of warm water.For vinyl and fabric, you can use a 1:1 solution, meaning you can use equal parts soap and water., Make sure you use a clean, lint-free cloth. Dampen your rag rather than soaking it; you don’t want to leave an excess of cleaning solution on the upholstery. Be careful not to rub or scrub, as this could fray mesh or scratch leather., Wipe away any water or soap residue, then allow the chair to air dry. Keep the chair in a well ventilated area. This will allow it to dry faster., You might find it easier to work if you’re seated in a different chair. You’ll avoid being continuously bent down, which will save your back. Some wheels pop off just from pulling, while others may require the use of a screwdriver., Whether it’s dried food, gunk or even small pebbles, any of these can hinder your office chair’s movement. The butter knife can slip into the crack between the wheel and its cover, allowing you to scrape off or pop out any debris stuck in the wheel.


If there are hairs stuck in the wheel, you can use a tweezer to remove them., This should take care of any mess you can’t scrape off with the butter knife. If the wheels are particularly dirty, dampen your cloth and add a few drops of dishwashing soap.


If you need to clean between the wheel and the cover, you can use a cotton swab moistened with water to clean along the crack., Any moisture left on the wheel will prevent it from rolling smoothly. Wipe the wheel thoroughly with paper towels, especially if you used soap., Your chair should now roll much more smoothly. If the wheels have screws, remember to screw these back in before sitting in the chair., Since these parts are usually plastic or metal, they’re much easier to clean than the chair’s upholstery. Wiping them with a damp cloth will usually be enough to clean them. If the spill is a bit more tenacious, use a mild solution of water and dish soap.


After cleaning, wipe the arms and legs dry with a clean, dry cloth.

Shake out debris.,
Beat the rug.,
Vacuum the rug.,
Blot spills as they happen.,
Treat potential stains.,
Dry the rug.,
Keep humidity consistent.,
Maintain consistent sunlight.,
Apply a fabric protectant.",How to Clean a Sisal Rug," If you find your rug picks up large amounts of dirt or debris, start by shaking it out. Take it out to an area that you don’t mind getting dirty, such as a garage or yard, and shake the rug by raising one end in your hands above your head and bringing your arms down quickly. This will help expel any large debris., To help get out finer dirt and dust, hang the rug up in an open area such as a yard and use a rug beater or a tennis racket to beat the dust out of the rug. Firmly but gently hit sections of the rug with the racket, working your way from top to bottom, and moving over once you’ve completely cleared a section.Beating the rug may not always be necessary, but it can be especially helpful if you keep it in a place that is prone to dust or high foot traffic. It is also a good alternative if you are unable to vacuum your rug.

, Use a suction-only vacuum such as a hand vacuum or the upholstery attachment for your vacuum hose to finish cleaning the rug. Using the beaters on your vacuum is less effective and may cause more wear to the fibers. Instead, use a strong suction setting to help pull out any dirt and debris that has settled in the fibers and on the underlay.Weekly vacuuming is recommended, even if you cannot see any soiling. Regular vacuuming will help prevent buildup of unwanted materials, keeping the rug looking fresh every day.

, Moisture of any kind can warp the weave of sisal and lead to browning of the fiber, so it is important to address spills as they happen. Blot the spot dry with a clean towel or paper clothes. Avoid rubbing, as this will only spread the moisture.Take note of whether the spill left a stain. Even a slight change in color at the time of the spill can quickly alter the color of the rug.

, If you notice a stain forming, blot up the spill and then treat the area quickly. Use a brush or sponge to apply a small amount of a mild fabric detergent or carpet shampoo to the area. Follow immediately by blotting the area with lukewarm water and a clean, undyed paper towel or cloth. Continue to rinse until all sudsing has stopped.Any cleanser used on the rug should have a neutral pH. Check the label for a pH value of 7.
Use the same process for an oil-based stain, but opt for a tetra solvent instead of a mild detergent., If a sisal rug gets wet, even if it is just with water, it is important to dry the rug as quickly as possible. Use a low heat setting on a hair dryer or a large fan to help you get the rug to dry faster.Dry the carpet as soon as you can to avoid warping or additional water marking.

, Large fluctuations in humidity can lead to discoloration and degraded strength in a sisal rug. Try to keep your rug in a climate-controlled environment. If you notice large fluctuations in humidity in the area where you keep your rug, consider investing in either a dehumidifier or a humidifier.A dehumidifier may be more practical if you live in a place that is typically more dry but has a humid period. A humidifier may be more useful if you live in place that is typically more humid but has noticeable dry periods.
If you experience one abnormally dry day but do not want to invest in a humidifier, hold a spray bottle filled with water well above the rug. Spray the air with water and let the mist settle on the fibers, moisturizing the rug., Since sisal is a natural fiber, it can be bleached by the sun. It is fine to keep a sisal rug in the sunlight just so long as you ensure relatively even sun exposure across the rug. If sunlight only reaches a portion of the rug, it may bleach out that individual part, leading to inconsistent coloration across the rug.If your rug has been discolored by water, leaving it out in the sun for several hours may help bleach the fibers back to a more natural color.

, Fabric protectants made especially for sisal can help keep the rug looking better and make it more difficult for wet spills to stain the surface. Look online or at a home improvement store for a fabric protector meant for use on sisal.Use and wear will decrease the effectiveness of fabric protectants over time. Reapply as you notice your rug getting dirty faster or as you find it is harder to fully clean the rug.

Try leaving the pillow out in bright sunlight.",How to Clean a Memory Foam Pillow2," A fabric freshening spray, such as Febreeze, is a good quick fix if you need to neutralize an odor. While it might not deal with tougher odors, it'll work as an easy first line of defense.You should spray the pillow lightly with fabric spray and avoid saturating it.

, With the pillowcase removed, sprinkle baking soda liberally over both sides of the pillow. Let it sit for up to 15 minutes for basic odor removal. For tougher jobs, let it sit for at least 30 minutes.You can also sprinkle the pillow with borax if you prefer it or don’t have baking soda on hand.

, Use a handheld vacuum cleaner or a hose attachment on a floor vacuum to remove the baking soda. Vacuuming will also remove dust, skin cells, and other particles from within the pillow.It’s wise to invest in an inexpensive handheld vacuum that you use only for your bedding. That way, you won’t use the same appliance for both your floors and places you rest your face.

, Using sunlight to disinfect and deodorize is an old fashioned technique that many manufacturers now recommend. Hang your pillow outside on a clothesline on a warm, sunny day for natural odor removal.To keep it from picking up allergens, choose a day with a low pollen count to air out your pillow. Give it a quick vacuuming after hanging it outside.

Try dabbing it with water and a mild detergent first.,
Spray the stain with an enzymatic cleaner.,
Use a vinegar solution if you don’t have an enzymatic cleaner.,
Blot the area with a damp cloth.,
Avoid ruining your pillow to get out a stubborn stain.,
Dry the pillow completely before replacing the pillowcase.",How to Clean a Memory Foam Pillow3," If a stain has set, your first course of action should be to try cool water and mild soap. Use blotting and dabbing motions and avoid hard scrubbing.Remember to use as little water as possible when cleaning spills and stains.

, If your first attempt is unsuccessful, try a slightly stronger cleaner. Find an enzyme cleaner in a spray bottle at a nearby home, grocery, or department store. Spray the stained area or, to remove heavy duty odors, the entire pillow.Let the cleaner stand for five minutes after spraying.
Spray the pillow lightly and avoid saturating it.

, You can make a quick vinegar solution if you need to remove a stain right away but don’t have an enzyme cleaner on hand. Mix together one part cool water and one part white distilled vinegar, then transfer the solution to a spray bottle. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice to the solution to help cut the vinegar smell.Spray the pillow lightly with the vinegar solution then let it stand for five minutes.

, After letting the cleaner stand for five minutes, dampen a clean cloth or paper towel with cool water. Use it to blot the affected area and gradually work out the stain.Repeat the spray, let stand, and blot process until you’ve removed the stain.

, If you can’t remove a stain, remember that the pillow will be covered by its case and the stain won’t be visible. Don’t scrub or soak the pillow or use a harsh cleaner. If there’s no bad odor, it’s better to have an invisible stain than a ruined pillow., Give the pillow 12 to 24 hours to air dry completely or use a blow dryer on a cool setting. Replacing the pillowcase while the pillow is still wet could encourage mold growth. Using the pillow while it’s still wet could damage the foam."

Determine the type of fabric your couch is made out of.,
Procure the necessary cleaning supplies.,
Wash any wood or metal on the couch.,
Remove all cushions and pillows.,
Vacuum the entire couch.",How to Clean a Couch1," Sofas can be made of anything from cotton to leather, and knowing exactly what fabric you’re working with is important for knowing how to clean it. Check the tag on the bottom of your sofa to determine the type of cloth. The tag should give a label of “W,” “S,” “WS,” “X,” or “O.”









A tag with the letter “W” or “WS” means that your couch is washable with a water-based soap.
A tag with the letter “S” means that it needs to be dry cleaned or cleaned with a non-water based detergent.
If your tag says “X,” it implies that the fabric should only be vacuumed or dry-cleaned by a professional.
A tag with the letter “O” means that the cloth is organic and needs to be washed using cold water.;
, This will differ depending on the type of fabric, but should consist of a detergent of some sort, a brush or sponge for scrubbing, a rag, and a vacuum cleaner.








, If the legs, base, or armrest of your couch have any wood or metal on them, wipe them down with soap and water to clean off any dust or grime. Additionally, you can choose to use a wood or metal polish to enhance the shine of these parts.








, Some cushions and pillows have removable covers which you can simply put in the washing machine. They must be set aside though so that the full couch can be washed.








, If your vacuum is equipped, at the upholstery attachment for the best results. It is important to remove as much dirt, hair, dust, and crumbs as possible before you start scrubbing it. Depending on the fabric, this may be the last step you are able to perform without a professional.

Fill a spray-bottle with rubbing alcohol.,
Mist your couch in small sections with the rubbing alcohol.,
Take a soft brush and rub down the whole couch.,
Replace all pillows and cushions.",How to Clean a Couch3," Because of the quick evaporation time, rubbing alcohol will not leave a mark on fabrics like polyester and microfiber like water does. It will have a scent while you are cleaning, but will leave no scent after the task has been completed.








, Use a sponge to scrub these areas, lifting dirt from the upholstery. Don’t spray large sections at a time, as you don’t won’t have time to scrub it all before the alcohol evaporates.








, Move the brush in small circular motions to return the fabric back to its previous state.








, Your clean couch is now ready to be sat in again!

Wipe leather furniture down regularly with a clean, dry cloth.,
Vacuum the furniture's crevices.,
Clean spills immediately with a dry cloth.,
Use cleaners designed for leather.,
Read the manufacturer’s label or provided care instructions.",How to Care for Leather Furniture1," Use a microfiber cloth. Incorporate wiping the furniture into your weekly household cleaning routine. Keeping dust from building up is the best preventative cleaning measure.


For more stubborn dust, dampen the cloth with distilled water. Make sure that the cloth is not soaking wet. Never let water soak into leather.
Always be sure to use a soft cloth and never use an abrasive brush or scrubber as this can scratch and damage the leather.;
, All furniture builds up some dirt and debris, so leather is no exception. Use your vacuum's hose attachment with a soft bristled brush. Gently run the brush across the entire surface. Vacuum in between and under all of the cushions.If you can remove the cushions, do so to make vacuuming more effective. If you can’t remove them, get in the crevices as best you can. You might also use a narrow angled attachment to get deeper into the furniture.

, When anything is spilled onto the leather upholstery, blot it away as soon as possible. Use a dry cloth or sponge to absorb as much of the spilled liquid as possible, only resorting to a moistened cloth if necessary. Use as little water as possible to clean the spill, and wipe the area dry afterwards.Wiping at a spill will only spread it further, so be sure to blot it. Take the dry cloth and set it on top of the stain and leave it there for five seconds or so while it absorbs the spill.
For non-water spills, you may need to use a tiny dab of gentle soap with warm water. If the stain is bad enough, it’s best to consult a professional so you don’t make it worse.
The most important thing is to clean the spill up quickly so that it does not have time to soak into the leather.

, Detergents, solvents, all-purpose cleaning sprays, ammonia, bleach, and furniture polish can all be harmful to leather furniture. Do not apply these products in an attempt to clean the furniture or remove stains. Keep a leather-specific cleaner on hand for occasional cleaning and emergencies.You may feel that buying a cleaner ahead of time is not a good use of your money, but if you do need it, you’ll appreciate having it on hand rather than needing to go out and buy it. Cleaning up a mess quickly can save your leather.

, General care guidelines are useful, but it is always good to read any information provided by the manufacturer or distributor about specific care suggestions for your piece. Some leather furniture may have specific care instructions based on qualities it has.Some manufacturers may provide or sell a product that is designed to be used on their furniture. If this is the case, buy it since it is made specifically for your furniture.
This can be especially helpful to determine if the leather has been treated in any specific way that would be affected by cleaning it incorrectly.

Place leather furniture in the right room locations.,
Apply a leather conditioner regularly.,
Store leather furniture carefully.",How to Care for Leather Furniture2," Since leather is made of animal skin, think of caring for it in ways similar to how you care for your own skin. Do not position your leather furniture under an air condition vent, close to a fireplace or heater, or in consistent direct sunlight. All of these can dry out the leather and cause it to crack or fade.It is okay if sunlight hits the furniture for part of the day, but long-term exposure will damage the leather.
It is okay for leather to be in air conditioned or heated rooms, but try to keep it from being directly under or next to the source.

, Conditioning the leather regularly keeps it from drying out and developing cracks. Apply a conditioner once or twice a year with a microfiber cloth. Use just enough to lightly cover the leather. Contact the manufacturer to ask what type of conditioner they recommend.Leather conditioner can be purchased from many furniture stores. It is also available at auto parts stores, where it is sold for conditioning leather car interiors.
Choose a quality brand as opposed to something cheaper because you don’t want something that will end up harming the leather. Conditioner is a maintenance cost of keeping leather furniture in good shape, so don’t consider it optional.

, If you need to put leather furniture into a storage unit for a time, get it professionally cleaned beforehand and ensure it is thoroughly dried. Place a plastic sheet under it to combat moisture seeping in. Leather needs to breathe, so never wrap leather furniture in plastic as this will cause moisture to build up and ruin the leather.Never place other heavy items on top of leather furniture as this can cause irreparable indentations in the leather.
Place leather furniture on top of wooden pallets to keep it off of the ground.

Fix torn leather.,
Remove a dent.,
Restore the color of faded leather.",How to Care for Leather Furniture3," Take a piece of denim patch that you would use on a pair of jeans. Cut it slightly larger than the tear in the leather, and round the edges of the patch. Use tweezers to gently stuff it into the tear so it lays flat under the tear. Use a flexible glue for plastic or vinyl and apply to the patch. Squeeze the tear closed over it.Rather than just gluing the tear closed, which will cause it to be a dent, placing a patch under creates a new layer under the leather which will hold it together and keep it smooth.
You can stop at this point and the tear will be repaired. If you want to improve the look, you can put a little bit of superglue in the tear, gently sand while it is still wet which adds dust to the glue, and then restore the color with leather color restoration.

, Leaving something heavy on furniture can cause a dent. Get a heat gun, or use a hair dryer if you prefer. On the low setting, heat up the dented area of the leather. Gently use both of your hands to stretch the leather outward from the dent. Repeat the process of heating and stretching until the dent has been removed or reduced in appearance.

, Go to a furniture store, a hardware store, or look online to buy a leather color repair kit. This will typically include a cream or balm that you gently rub into your furniture. You’ll choose a color that matches as best as possible. Take a cloth, put some of the cream on it, and gently rub it into the spots that are most faded.

Conduct a soft wash on your roof.,
Scrub the shingles with a bristle brush.,
Create a bleach mixture.,
Use a citric-based solution if you don’t want to use bleach.,
Spray the mixture.,
Rinse the surface.,
Trim overhanging tree limbs.,
Remove leaves and other debris.,
Replace damaged or rotten shingles.,
Apply a 5% oxalic acid solution on your roof.,
Clean your roof regularly.",How to Clean Cedar Shingles," A soft wash, also known as a non-pressure wash, is where you take low pressure water and spray down a surface. This is important, as standard high pressure power washes might damage cedar shingles.

Use a 12-volt pump system with pressure of about 60 PSI.;
, Once you’ve soft washed your roof, you may still need to scrub it with a soft bristle brush. A bristle brush will help loosen moss, mildew, lichen, and other growth on the shingles.

You can use a small brush to scrub shingles individually or a large brush on a pole to clean many at one time., Mix one part bleach and five parts water. Sprinkle in several tablespoons of powdered detergent. Stir the mixture and pour it into a spray bottle or something similar.

Use proper safety equipment, including goggles and gloves.
Do not use liquid detergent or a detergent that contains ammonia. This could cause a dangerous chemical reaction with the bleach., Citric-based solutions are non-toxic and quite effective If a tradition bleach solution did not work, you should spray citric solution on your roof. These solutions are available at major hardware stores or can be purchased online.

Citric cleaning solutions should be specially formulated for cedar shingles and may include algaecide, mildewcide, and fungicide.
Commercially available citric solutions may also contain a water-based oil that will help rehydrate your shingles., Use a garden sprayer or similar device to spray the mixture on your cedar shingles. Make sure to get the entire surface of your cedar shingle roof. Pay special attention to areas where there might still be moss or lichen remnants.

Allow the bleach or citric mixture to sit for about 15 minutes., After soft washing and scrubbing the shingles, you should take a common garden hose and rinse the shingles down. This will help remove any bits and pieces of moss or lichen that remain after you’ve scrubbed the shingles.

The water from your garden hose should have about a 40 PSI.
Rinse your roof from the top down, so you can clear off all residual debris., One of the most important ways to maintain your roof is to remove any tree branches or limbs that overhang your roof. Not only will these limbs contribute to the accumulation of debris on your roof, but the shade they help create will encourage the growth of mold and lichen.

You may be able to cut smaller limbs or branches by yourself.
If you have large limbs that overhang your roof, you may need to call in a tree cutting service., You should periodically remove leaves, sticks, and other debris from your roof. Accumulated debris will increase the amount of moisture on your roof and encourage the growth of mold and lichen.

If you have a long broom or pole, you may be able to remove a lot of debris from the ground or from a ladder., Use a hammer to remove any nails or tacks that secure shingles to your roof or other shingles. Remove the damaged shingle. Then, tack and nail down a replacement shingle.

If you’re not comfortable replacing a shingle yourself, you should contact a licensed roofer or contractor to do it for you., This solution will help neutralize the blue-black stain that occurs on shingles overtime. In the end, you’ll have shingles that appear brighter.

Be very careful using oxalic acid, as it is a toxic substance.
Oxalic acid won’t keep shingles bright. If you don’t remove the source of the stain (usually iron from certain nails), you’ll have to apply it again., How often you clean your cedar shingle roof depends on the climate you live in. To determine this, you need to consider the challenges the environment you live in pose to your roof.

Cedar shingles in wet and overcast climates should be cleaned yearly.
Cedar shingles in sunny and dry climates may only need to be cleaned every 2 to 3 years."

Mix your cleaning solution.,
Soak the shingles with water.,
Spray your cleaning solution.,
Rinse off the solution.,
Reapply the solution.,
Clean your roof regularly.,
Trim nearby branches.,
Apply a stain blocker.,
Place metal strips under shingles.",How to Clean Roof Shingles," The day you perform deep cleaning on the shingles should be cool and overcast. Sunlight and warm weather will ensure the cleaning solution dries too fast to be of any use. In addition, choose a day with little wind so that when you spray the solution, it stays on your roof., Before you begin, it’s important to repair loose shingles and flashings to minimize roof damage. Afterwards, clean out your gutters and downspouts. You’ll need the cleaning solution to drain off the roof during rinsing.

, Move any furniture away from the work area. If you’re using a bleach solution, also cover your yard. Rinse down your lawn and plants before you begin deep cleaning so the water dilutes harmful bleach, then cover them with plastic to catch any spray., Before you clean stains, you’ll have to climb up onto the roof and take off twigs, leaves, and anything else that would get in the way. Pick them up with your hand, use an air blower, or gently sweep them off with a broom., While specialized, eco-friendly roof cleaners are available, they are a little more expensive. A home cleaner can be made with a quart (.95 L) of standard laundry bleach and a gallon (3.8 L) of water. Optionally, add ¼ cup (177.5 mL) of a non-ammonia heavy cleaner such as TSP (trisodium phosphate) for extra cleaning power.Bleach is caustic to the roof and plants. At most, the bleach should be 50% of the solution.
Lye products also work, but are caustic to the skin and should only be handled while wearing protective gear.

, Bring your garden hose or water sprayer up to the roof. Starting from the bottom, carefully wet the shingles. This keeps the solution from drying out immediately after application. When you see runoff, stop.

, Load the solution into a sprayer. Using slow, even strokes, coat the shingles. Make sure you don’t miss any spots, or else your roof will come out spotted. Leave the solution to soak in for 15-20 minutes., Use a water sprayer to apply enough force to dislodge algae and moss without damaging the shingles. In case of a lightly-stained roof, a garden hose may also be enough. Again, move slowly. Move back and forth in even strokes, making sure you reach all of the cleaner.


Power washers should never be used. They will wear away your shingles.

, For deep stains, you’ll have to put on more solution. Let the roof dry first, then wet the roof and spray on more the same way you did before. Wait no more than 30 minutes and rinse it off again. Light stains left at this point may wash off over time as long as rain and sunlight can reach the area.A broom can also be used to scrub in cleaner. Use a broom of medium-stiff bristles and apply little pressure so you don’t damage the integrity of the shingles., The debris, including fallen branches and leaves, provides a moist environment for moss and algae. It should be picked up, swept off, or blown off regularly to avoid facilitating the growth. Tackle the gutters too so that water drains freely. Prevention makes stain cleaning much easier later on.

, Overhanging plant life creates the cool, shady environment that moss and algae need to bloom. Trim tree branches and other plants casting shade on your roof or consider moving them. Exposure to sunlight will keep many moss and algae spores from activating., Specialized stain blockers offer resistance for up to three years. Search for roofing algae and moss blockers at a home improvement store. After you clean your roof, spread the stain blocker according to the directions on the label., Copper and zinc strips, found at home improvement stores, can be placed under shingles. When it rains, the water washes away some of the metal, which destroys moss and algae spores.Installing these strips can puncture sealant on the shingles, so it’s best to do this when placing a new roof. Stringing copper wire may work instead.

Gather twice as much sand as you'll need.,
Sift sand to remove unwanted rocks and debris.,
Rinse out organic matter and other unwanted particles.,
Sterilize beach sand by baking it.,
Remove salt from beach sand by simmering it with water.",How to Clean Beach Sand1," You'll likely lose some sand during the cleaning process. When you collect sand at the beach, gather twice as much sand as you need for your project. This will ensure you’ll have enough even if you lose some sand when you clean it.;
, If you have an old colander or strainer, use it to sift out rocks and other debris from your sand. You can also make your own sifter using tulle and a container. Fasten the tulle to the top of the container with a rubber band, then pour the sand through the fabric into the container., Beach sand is littered with particles of broken shell, microscopic organisms, silt, and other tiny debris. To rinse away unwanted particles, fill a bucket halfway with fresh water. Gradually stir your beach sand into the water, continue to mix it for a few minutes, then slowly dump out the water.Drain the water slowly to avoid pouring out too much sand with it.
Repeat the rinsing process until the water runs clear when you dump it.

, For an even deeper clean, you can bake beach sand after rinsing it. Drain as much water as possible, then transfer the beach sand to baking sheets. Set your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) and bake the sand for 45 minutes to sanitize it.Beach sand is home to lots of microscopic lifeforms. If you're making something that will be handled a lot, like kinetic sand, it's a good idea to sanitize the beach sand.
If you want to use beach sand for a hermit crab habitat, you should bake it to sterilize it so your hermit crab isn't exposed to fungus or bacteria., Pour beach sand into a large pot, then add enough water to cover the sand. Heat the pan until it simmers and reduce heat or add more water if it starts to boil. Simmer for a few minutes to dissolve the salt, then remove the pan from heat and use a large coffee filter to collect the sand.Try attaching a coffee filter to a large wide-mouth jar with a rubber band. The coffee filter will strain the sand from the saltwater. Be careful handling the hot pot, and let the water cool until it's safe to touch.
If you want to mix sand with paint, you should remove salt from the sand first to avoid corroding the canvas or paper over time.

Use baby powder to get sand off your skin.,
Hang sandy items outside when you get home.,
Designate one changing area.,
Hand wash your bathing suit.,
Use a handheld vacuum to suck up beach sand.",How to Clean Beach Sand2," Preventing sand from getting into the nooks and crannies of your seats and trunk will save you the hassle of deep cleaning your car after a beach trip. Before you head out for your day at the beach, grab some old bedsheets and line your car’s interior surfaces.When you get home, carefully remove the sheets from your car, hang them to dry, then shake them out and wash them.

, If the beach has showers or faucets, use them to rinse away as much sand as possible before getting into the car. Take showers and rinse feet, chairs, toys, and any other sandy items. If possible, shower and change at the beach and store bathing suits in plastic bags.If the beach doesn’t have showers or faucets for rinsing, you can bring a plastic foot tub or wash basin to the beach with you. Fill it with water and rinse your feet and sandy objects before getting into the car., If the beach doesn’t have showers or if you don’t want to take one there, use baby powder to remove sand. Sprinkle your legs, feet, arms, or any other sandy patches with baby powder, then brush it away with a towel.Baby powder will work best if your skin isn’t wet.

, Despite your best efforts keeping sand at the beach, you’re bound to track some home. If possible, avoid bringing sandy towels, bags, and other items into the house, especially if they’re damp. Instead, hang out them outside, then shake out the sand once they’re dry.It’s easier to shake out sand from items like beach towels when they’re dry.
Try painting a peg rail the same color as your house’s exterior and securing it to a wall in your backyard. You can hang towels on it to dry, or hang and rinse beach chairs or flip flops., Try creating a private outdoor changing area by hanging clotheslines and sheets around a spot in the backyard or porch. If that’s not possible and people have to change indoors, choose a room close to an entrance for changing. Lay down a sheet or towel to catch as much sand as possible.You’ll have the best chances of keeping sand out of your home if everyone changes at the beach.

, Bring your suit to a sink and rinse it with cool water. After rinsing it, fill the sink with cool water and a teaspoon of mild detergent. Let the suit soak for 15 minutes, then drain the sink and rinse away soap residue.Machine washing a sandy bathing suit can leave sand in the washer. Further, machine washing can damage many bathing suits, especially women’s swimwear.

, If all else fails, and perhaps inevitably, you might have to vacuum up a sandy mess in your home or car. Your best option is a rechargeable handheld vacuum cleaner. It’ll fit into tight spaces like corners or bottoms of beach bags and, since it’s not bound by a cord, you can easily use it in your car."

Remove mold and algae with chlorine bleach.,
Use a commercial wood cleaner.,
Use white vinegar to remove mildew.",How to Clean a Wood Fence," If you have plants you care about or you decide to use a chemical cleaner, you’ll want to cover the area around the fence with plastic. Go to your local hardware store and purchase enough plastic sheeting to cover the plants and grass up to at least 3 feet (0.91 m) from your wood fence.Purchase just enough plastic for one section and move it with you when you move to the next to save money.;
, A stainless steel wire brush prepares a wood fence for painting, but it is also handy at getting rid of stuck on dirt and grime. Run a wire brush over any caked-on or large pieces of debris. Be careful not to scrub a wire brush into a painted fence too deeply.If you don’t already have one, purchase a wire brush at a hardware or home improvement store.
Substitute a plastic bristle scrub brush for a wire brush and use a little more pressure.

, Make sure you have a garden hose handy, whether or not you’re using the assistance of a power washer. Wet your wood fence down and remove surface dirt by spraying all over with a garden hose on medium to high pressure., There’s no need to spray your wood fence with the most powerful washer because the pressure can warp and indent the wood. Look for a pressure washer with a strength between 1500 to 2000 psi and steer clear of models with an engine over this., A 25-degree tip on a pressure washer will fan out the water for a gentler wash. Attach a green 25-degree tip onto the end of the pressure washer sprayer. Whether you rent or own a pressure washer, you should have a variety of color coded tips and a 25-degree is typically green., Regardless of the tip you attach or the strength of your pressure washer, it’s a powerful tool. Make sure you stand at least 2 feet (0.61 m) away from your wood fence to prevent any damage., Standing 2 feet (0.61 m) away, use long, even strokes to spray off debris and bring your wood fence back to life. Slowly move the spray tip 1 foot (0.30 m) closer to the surface and spray the length of the fence using even strokes until the wood looks brighter., Don’t damage your wood fence by spraying too long in one spot. Change the area you’re spraying frequently. After you’ve brightened several fence posts using long, even strokes and you don’t see any more color change on the wood, move over to the next set of fence posts., If your fence is not coming as clean as you'd like it, change the pressure with an 18-degree tip. Snap off the 25-degree tip and snap on an 18-degree tip. The added pressure should be enough to clean your fence spotless without damaging it., Mix together an oxygen bleach powder, like Oxiclean, according to the manufacturer's directions. Apply the mixture to a water dampened fence with a large painter’s brush, leave it for 15 minutes and then scrub the surface with a plastic, bristle scrub brush. Rinse the mixture and any remaining residue with a garden hose., Get rid of green residue from algae or mold by mixing two parts water to one part chlorine bleach. Add a teaspoon of dish soap for extra cleaning power and scrub grime away with a bristle brush. Concentrate and use a little elbow grease on stained areas. Rinse your wood fence off thoroughly after you scrub all areas down., You can also buy a pre-mixed cleaning solution to clean your wood fence by hand.

Scrub the stone with dish soap.,
Soak in vinegar to get rid of stubborn dirt.,
Use a pressure washer on tough grime.",How to Clean a Stone Patio1," Dish detergent works well for a basic cleaning. Mix a couple of drops of dish soap with warm water in a large bucket. Use a push broom with thick, tough bristles to apply the soap to the stone. Push the broom over the stone until it’s covered in suds, then rinse with water.Don’t use a wire broom or a brush with wire bristles on a stone patio. Wire can scratch the stone.
Make sure not to use any cleaners that advise against using on limestone.;
, Mix distilled white vinegar with water in a spray bottle. Add less water for a stronger solution to help with deep stains. Spray the vinegar solution over the stone and let it sit for half an hour. Then scrub with a nylon brush.Mop the area afterwards to help remove the excess water and vinegar.

, Use the nozzle setting so the water sprays in a fan instead of a jet. Stand a few feet away from the stone with the pressure washer so you don’t break off part of the stone or causing it to flake. A pressure washer can clean basic dirt and grime off the stone.Spray the pressure washer across the joints and not up and down the joints.
Make sure not to use a pressure washer too often on the stone patio because it can hurt the stone. Only use a pressure washer once per season to protect the integrity of your stone.

Dispose of septic waste.",How to Clean a Septic Tank," Start from the sewer pipe in the lower level of your house, if possible. Follow the direction it takes as it exits the house. Your tank may be out there and buried. Locating the tank now saves time and money later regardless if you or an inspector clean the tank., Your tank may be buried underground. Before inspection, take a shovel and remove the dirt around the top of the tank. Your tank will have an access port lid which should be strong and on tight.


Risers can be added on top of the tank. These help you locate and access the tank without digging. Septic system pumpers can add these., Look along the tank, including the inside, for damaged areas. Cracks need to be repaired by a professional once the tank is pumped so the system doesn’t fail. Look for any rusted or broken pieces on the inlet and outlet pipes required for drainage. Check any distribution boxes or pump chambers, if your tank has one attached.


It is useful to run some water from your house, such as from the toilet or washing machine, to see if the water makes it to the tank and then drains properly.

, Start with a ten foot (3 m) PVC pipe. Using a saw or PVC cutter, separate it into a six inch (15.24 cm) section and a nine and a half foot (2.9 m) section., Pour PVC cement into an elbow joint. Attach the smaller pipe to the top of the larger pipe using the cement and joint. The pipe will stick out straight to the right or left in an “L” shape.

, PVC caps can be found at the hardware store where you got the pipes, cement, and cutters. Push the caps onto the pipes so they’re tight and resist water flow.

, Hold the scum stick with the smaller pipe at the bottom and facing out to the side in the “L” shape. Lower the pipe until you are holding it against the top layer of the septic tank waste without breaking through.

, Use a marker or piece of tape to indicate the scum’s upper point. When the pipe rests on top of the scum layer, place your mark where the pipe crosses from the ground to the very top of your tank., Force the stick down through the scum. You may need to turn the stick so that the pointed part breaks through. When you reach the bottom of the scum layer, you’ll feel the stick moving through water instead of the resistant fat and oil. Hold the stick against the bottom of the scum as you did the top of the scum, keeping the smaller pipe flat and to the side so the stick takes on the “L” shape.

, Again, use a marker or tape to indicate where the scum layer ends. Add your mark to where the pipe crosses the ground into the very top of the tank., Carefully remove the stick and rest it on a tarp. Use tape measure to figure out the distance between the two marks you made. This is the depth of the scum level. When this fat and oil layer is only three inches (7.62 cm) above the bottom of the outlet pipe, the tank must be pumped., Cut a ten foot (3 m) PVC pipe into five foot (1.5 m) subsections. This allows you to make a stable two-part stick., Connect the two pipes with a straight adapter or threaded coupler from the hardware store. Fasten the ends in the connector using PVC cement.

, PVC caps can also be found at the hardware store. Apply one to each end of your stick. Push it on tight so that no sewage can get into the pipe.

, A white rag, towel, sock, or Velcro are useful for capturing a mark to show you the sludge depth. Wrap the material around one end, up to three feet (.91 m) along the length of the pipe. Secure the material with the Velcro backing, tape, or string., If you haven’t already, use a stick made for testing scum depth to poke a hole through the top layer in the tank. Once this is done, lower the sludge stick through the hole until you feel it reach the bottom of the tank.

, Leave the stick to rest for no less than three minutes. The longer you hold the stick, the better able you are to ensure that the sludge stains your white material.

, Now pull the stick back up, holding it steady as you pull it up through the hole you made originally. As long as you don’t move it, you won’t stain the stick. Lay it out on a tarp where you won’t ruin the stain and will be able to clean the stick later.

, Use tape measure to note the length of the stain up from the bottom of the stick. When the sludge or sludge plus scum occupies a third of the tank’s depth (about 12 inches or 30.48 cm high), it needs to be pumped. If the sludge layer is within six inches (15.24 cm) of the bottom of the outlet pipes, the tank needs to be pumped., Pull up the cover of the tank during your yearly inspection. Place the cover aside and locate the pipes leading waste into the tank and water out of the tank. The baffles are inside these, holding scum and sludge in place.


Not all tanks come installed with filters.

, Put on some protective rubber gloves. Reach into the outlet baffle using your hands, a rake, or a hoe. Pull out the filter. It may be brightly colored and have a handle on the end, but if your tank has one it will be inside the outlet baffle., Either hold the filter over the inlet side of the septic tank and spray it with a hose or dip it in a bucket of water. Make sure all the solids fall back into the tank or bucket. When you are finished rinsing, pour any waste back into the tank., Look for any cracks or solids clogging up the filter. When the filter isn’t cleaned regularly, it fills up and stops working. If you are unable to clean it or it appears damaged, replace it with a new filter.

, Whether putting back the old filter or installing a new one, look along the sides of the filter. The filter may have an arrow on it. When you install the filter properly, the arrow will point downwards to the drainage system. When the filter is secure in the baffle, screw the tank’s lid back on tightly.

, Many people make the mistake in thinking that the tank doesn’t need to be treated as long as the plumbing appears to be functioning. By maintaining the tank before it clogs with sludge and liquid stops draining, you will end up saving thousands of dollars in costly repairs. This should be done every one to three years or whenever you measure that the sludge and scum levels occupy about a third of the tank or are approaching the outlet pipe.The smaller the tank, or the more people the tank services, the more frequently it will need to be treated. A 750 gallon tank, standard in a two-bedroom home, will last two residents about four years without pumping. For four residents, it will last less then two years without pumping.Annual treatment will, at the cost of a couple hundred dollars, keep the tank clean and allow any problems to be detected before they turn into serious septic failures.

, Pumping involves using a cast-iron pump that can be switched on. The pump sucks out the solids that can’t be broken down by bacteria and removes them to a container such as the inside of a tanker. Once the sludge and scum are removed, you don’t need to reintroduce bacteria or water., Even if you attempt to pump out the tank yourself, you need to dispose of the waste in a legal manner. The waste has to be transported by a tanker to a government-chosen location away from water and areas where people gather. For this reason, it is better to let a professional handle it."

Crease the shirt in half.,
Flip the shirt over to finish.",How to Fold a Shirt with the Department Store Method," Spread the shirt face-down on a flat, clean surface. Smooth out any wrinkles. Let the arms of the shirt lay naturally extended. If the shirt features buttons or a zipper: button all buttons, and zip the zipper shut completely before you begin folding. 








If the shirt has a hood: fold this bit down first. Lay the hood down flat against the back of the shirt before folding the sleeves inward.
Try placing a clean, crisp magazine on the back of the shirt as a guide for a neater fold. Squarely center the magazine right below the collar. Then, make your folds in line with the edges of the magazine.;
, First, pinch the top of the shirt on either side of the collar. Hold the fabric tight so that you don't create any unwanted creases. Then, take the sleeve on the same side that you're holding the collar. Fold the sleeve and any extra fabric across the center crease of the shirt. Make a straight line from top to bottom on the folded side.








, Repeat the fold for the sleeve that you haven't creased yet. For the sake of presentation, try to make the second fold symmetrical with the first. Don't be afraid to adjust the sleeves a bit so that they match one another.







, The edge of the shirt should extend almost exactly halfway across the back of the shirt. Firmly crease the edge so that it forms a perfect vertical line down the back of the garment.









If the shirt has long sleeves: fold them back in on themselves so that they run lengthwise down the back of the shirt.
If the shirt has short sleeves: fold them so that they fit neatly and symmetrically into the back of the shirt.

, Fold the other edge of the shirt over to meet the first edge in the middle of the back. Make sure that the two edges run parallel, and that they do not overlap.









If you are using a magazine to make the fold more precise: fold each side of the shirt until it hits the magazine. Simply fold the shirt to the width of a magazine.

, Fold up the bottom edge of the shirt so that it meets the top of the shoulders. Let the edge rest just below the collar. Smooth out any creases, and make sure that the fold is symmetrically all the way across the width of the shirt.








, Make sure that all the edges are straight and crisp. Smooth out any creases or wrinkles in the fabric, and check that the shirt is ready for sale. In department stores, the shirt is always displayed with the front facing up. 








If you are folding your shirt for convenient home storage, then it is doesn't matter so much which way you display the garment. It may still be convenient to keep your shirts front-side up so that you can easily tell which is which.

Don't worry too much about finding the exact middle of the line, especially before you've got the hang of this. You do not need to measure it exactly to end up with a tidy, folded shirt.

, Keep your left hand in place as you do this. The shoulder of the shirt should be to your right, so at this point your arms should not be crossed. Remember, the line runs in between the sleeves and the neck.

Your right hand should move directly over your left in a straight line, and continue to the bottom of the shirt. This motion follows the imaginary line.

, Extend your finger and thumb so you can grasp both the shoulder (which you were already pinching) and the fabric at the bottom edge of the T-shirt. Again, make sure you are pinching both the front and back of the shirt.

, Keep a firm grip on both pinches and uncross your hands while simultaneously lifting the shirt off the surface. You 'must move your left hand through the two folds of shirt hanging from your right hand during this uncrossing motion. If you uncross your arms simply by rotating the shirt instead, you will end up with a mess.

This is the easiest part of the fold to mess up. However, once you've understood the type of motion you need to make, it will be easy and quick.

, If everything worked out, a folded shirt rectangle should be hanging down from your hands with a loose sleeve dangling at the bottom. Lower the shirt back down onto the table. The loose sleeve should contact the table first. Lay the rest of the shirt over the loose sleeve so it is not visible from the front.

Remove all furniture and other objects.,
Sweep away excess dirt.,
Spray the patio with a garden hose.",How to Clean a Concrete Patio1," Before getting started, you’ll want to make sure your patio is completely clear. Find a place away from your work area to stash patio furniture, dining sets, planters, grills, toys and anything else that may be damaged by free-flowing water or cleaning solutions. Your work area should ideally be as empty as you can get it.Bring lightweight furniture inside, and move heavier pieces to the yard, sidewalk or a covered porch.
Prolonged exposure to moisture can cause metal furniture and appliances to rust.;
, Use a broom to dislodge as much loose debris from the patio as you can. This will make it easier to reach the more stubborn stains underneath, as well as give you an idea how extensive the cleaning methods you employ will need to be.Substances like compact dirt, dried mulch or sidewalk chalk may need to be scrubbed by hand using an abrasive sponge.

, Once you’ve swept the concrete, hose it down with a heavy stream of water. Push the dirt off to an adjoining section of the yard to drain. The concrete will then need time to dry before you can move on to other, more involved methods.If it’s been awhile since you last cleaned your patio, add some mild liquid dish detergent to a bucket of warm water to make a soapy rinse. The surfactants in the soap will help break up dirt and oil more effectively.In some cases, a good hosing may be all you need to remove a thin layer of dirt and sediment.

Combine distilled white vinegar with warm water.,
Douse the dirty concrete with the vinegar solution.,
Allow the vinegar to sit for several hours.,
Scrub the patio clean.",How to Clean a Concrete Patio2," Pour the vinegar and water into a large bucket in equal quantities and stir them together. Vinegar is naturally acidic, and can help lift and dissolve stains from within the shallow pores of the concrete better than water alone. Use a ratio of two parts vinegar to one part water if your patio has been affected by moss or mildew growth.If you don’t happen to have vinegar on hand, the same concentration of hydrogen peroxide should also do the trick.For slightly heavier or more persistent grime, add half a cup of baking soda to the vinegar solution.

, Slosh the contents of the bucket directly over the surface of the patio. Making sure to cover as much area as you can so that the vinegar will be able to clean the concrete evenly.Apply the solution liberally. Vinegar isn’t damage concrete, so you won’t have to worry about accidentally using too much.
It may be necessary to mix up more solution if you’re cleaning a particularly large area.

, While vinegar makes an effective natural cleaner, it is relatively mild, which means it will take time to work. The solution will gradually seep down into the concrete, breaking up trapped and solidified dirt.Plan your cleaning project for a day with good weather to reduce the chances that unexpected rainfall will wash away the vinegar.
Make better use of your time by tackling other household cleaning and maintenance tasks while the concrete is soaking.

, After a few hours have passed, you’ll most likely notice that the vinegar has whisked away the worst of the mess. If any traces of dirt or discoloration remain, work them out by hand using a stiff-bristled push broom. Afterwards, hose off the patio once again and let it dry completely before replacing your belongings.You can also use an abrasive sponge to scour your patio with a little extra elbow grease.
Avoid using wire scrubbers on concrete, as these can scratch or mark up smooth surfaces."

Equip a high-powered pressure washer.,
Spray off the surface of the patio.,
Wait for the concrete to dry.",How to Clean a Concrete Patio3," The majority of common concrete stains can be coaxed out with enough force. For more noticeable stains like rust, mold and compacted dirt, a pressure washer may be just the thing you need.Pressure washers unleash a concentrated stream of water, chiseling difficult messes from smooth, hard surfaces.
You can typically rent pressure washers from home improvement stores and gardening centers for just a few dollars a day., Aim the nozzle of the pressure washer downward and away from your body. Use slow vertical sweeping motions to push the dislodge dirt off of the patioConcrete is not easily damaged, so don’t be reluctant to use the pressure washer on a higher setting.Make sure the surrounding area is set up for proper drainage. Otherwise, you could be left with standing water to deal with.

, Keep the patio clear until all remaining water has been drained and evaporated. It may be possible to speed the process along by wiping off excess water with a squeegee or dabbing it with a clean, dry towel. Once it’s dry, you can put all furniture and other items back into place.Concrete patios need to be pressure washed an average of once or twice a year to keep them free from buildup that may eventually cause structural damage.
Covering damp concrete with furniture can keep it from drying as quickly, and may provide a moist, shady place for mold to begin growing.

Mix together chlorine bleach and warm water.,
Brush the bleach over the stained concrete.,
Leave the bleach to sit for 15 minutes.,
Pressure wash the patio.",How to Clean a Concrete Patio4," Pour both liquids into a deep bucket or similar container, being careful not to let them spill or splash. Aim for approximately one quarter of bleach for every three quarts of water you use. Stir the bleach solution using a wooden dowel.Chlorine bleach is a caustic chemical that can be extremely harmful if ingested, inhaled or contacted with bare skin. Whenever possible, wear gloves, eye protection and a ventilator or breathing mask when working with bleach.
Never combine bleach with hot water—the steam emitted from the water can carry bleach fumes with it, creating a potential breathing hazard. Heat may also partially neutralize the effects of bleach., Apply the bleach solution using a long-handled brush or roller. As an alternative, you could place the chlorine mixture in a sprayer to avoid making a mess and exposing your extremities to harsh chemicals. Pay special attention to spotted mildew growth and areas with especially heavy discoloration.Test a sample of diluted bleach on an out-of-the way area of the concrete to make sure it won’t leech the color out of a treated surface.
Be sure to work in a well-ventilated space. If your patio is partially covered, leave the doors and windows open and plan on spending no longer than about ten minutes at a time inside the enclosure.

, The stain-fighting power of the bleach should take effect very quickly. To be on the safe side, it’s a good idea to go somewhere else while the bleach is soaking into the concrete.
If even bleach isn’t enough to do away with trouble stains like hard water or rust, try using a sprinkle of trisodium phosphate.

, Finish by spraying the patio with a pressure washer to blast away any visible dirt or residue dissolved by the bleach. When you’re finished, your concrete should look as good as it did when it was first poured! Give the patio ample time to dry, then have a few friends over to enjoy your clean, inviting outdoor space.


A quick pressure washing or hosing will also help clear the air of irritating bleach fumes.

Wash the clothes according to the tag.",How to Make Homemade Oxyclean1," If you need to, use a funnel to help guide the ingredients into the bottle. Homemade OxyClean does not last a long time. It loses it's effectiveness after 6 hours. Because of this, it's better to make small batches at a time.If you'd like to make a larger batch, use the following proportions:2 parts water
1 part 3% hydrogen peroxide
1 part washing soda;
, Don't worry if the washing soda does not completely dissolve. It will still be effective., Homemade OxyClean works best on fresh stains. If the stained garment has been through the dryer, the stains will be difficult to remove.,, Do not wash out the homemade OxyClean. Simply toss the clothes into the washer. If the stain remains after washing, try to remove it again. If you put a stained garment into a dryer, the heat will set the stain.

Fill a jar with the water.,
Add the cornstarch and shake the jar.,
Sprinkle in the essential oil.,
Pour the mixture into a spray bottle.",How to Make Homemade Laundry Spray Starch with Cornstarch1," To make the starch spray, you’ll need a jar with a lid that is larger than a pint (473 ml). Open the jar, and add 1 pint of distilled warm water.You can make the spray in a bowl if you prefer. However, you’ll have to mix it by hand rather than shake it to combine the ingredients.
You can use tap water for the spray, but it’s better to use distilled, especially if you have hard water.;
, Once the water is in the jar, sprinkle in 1 heaping tablespoon (8 to 10 g) of cornstarch. Secure the lid on the jar, and shake the mixture vigorously to combine the water and cornstarch.You don’t have to be precise with the amount of cornstarch. As long as it’s approximately 1 generous tablespoon (8 to 10 g), the spray will be effective.

, If you want the spray to have a fragrance, add 1 to 2 drops of your favorite essential oil to the jar. Shake it again to ensure that the oil is fully incorporated.You can use any essential oil with a fragrance that you like. Lemon and lavender are particularly nice, though.

, When the spray is fully mixed, carefully pour it into a spray bottle. Label the bottle so you know what it is and store it with your laundry supplies.You may have an easier time transferring the spray to the bottle if you use a funnel.
The spray typically lasts for two to three months, though it may start to degrade. Discard it if you notice it becoming discolored or developing mold.

Heat the water in a pan.,
Mix in the cornstarch and bring the mixture to a boil.,
Stir in the vinegar.,
Add the essential oil.,
Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle.",How to Make Homemade Laundry Spray Starch with Cornstarch2," Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of water into a small saucepan, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the water to heat.You can use distilled or tap water for the spray.

, As the water is heating, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of cornstarch to the pan. Use a whisk to mix it into the water, and allow the mixture to come a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.By heating the mixture, you allow the cornstarch to melt into the water so you don’t have to worry about it separating as much.

, After you’ve taken the pan off the heat, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vinegar to the pan. Use the whisk to fully incorporate it into the cornstarch mixture.Vinegar naturally disinfects clothing, which is ideal if you’re using the starch spray between washes.

, If you want your starch spray to have a pleasant scent, you can also mix in some essential oil. Use 10 drops of your favorite oil, and whisk it into the mixture so it’s evenly distributed.Use an essential oil with a fragrance that you like. Lavender, grapefruit, or rosemary are good options.

, When the spray is completely mixed, carefully pour it into a spray bottle. For best results, keep your homemade starch spray in a cool, dark spot.The spray should keep for 2 to 4 months.

Shake the spray before each use.,
Mist the fabric with the spray.,
Run an iron over the fabric.",How to Make Homemade Laundry Spray Starch with Cornstarch3," The cornstarch in a homemade spray has a tendency to settle at the bottom of the spray bottle when it’s sitting on the shelf. Before using the spray always give the bottle a good shake to ensure that the ingredients are mixed.The cornstarch is less likely to separate if you use the heated method to make it, but it’s still a good idea to shake it before each use.

, Lay the item of clothing or fabric that you want to smooth out on flat surface. Lightly spray the item with the cornstarch mixture across the entire surface.A little bit of the spray goes a long way so don’t oversaturate your fabric.

, After you’ve applied the spray, run your iron over the fabric to smooth it as you normally would. Work until you’ve removed all of the wrinkles and added whatever creases you’d like to the fabric.Be careful when using a hot iron. It’s easy to burn yourself.

, Washing soda is a high-alkaline, powdered cleaning agent made from sodium carbonate that works similarly to baking soda by allowing you to cut grease, absorb oil spills and perform heavy cleaning jobs.

, Borax is a cleaning powder that kills bacteria, stabilizes the alkalinity of the washing soda and cleans clothes by releasing hydrogen peroxide as it mixes with water.

, The bar of laundry soap you choose can be as simple as a generic bar of body soap manufactured for human use or it can also be a bar of laundry soap made specifically to spot-clean clean clothes.

Soak the linen immediately.,
Treat stains.,
Wash the linen.,
Rinse the linen thoroughly.,
Check to see if the linen condition has improved.,
Allow linen to air dry.",How to Bleach Linen1," For linens with stains, it is best to set them soaking as quickly as possible when you first notice the stain. Treating the stain quickly will help avoid the stain setting and becoming harder to remove later. Put the linen in a bucket or tub that is completely clean and add water. Allow to soak for at least 2 days, but you can also allow linens to soak longer.It is often recommended to use cold water because hot water can make stains set, but others say hot water is the only way to remove stains. To be safe, stick with a cold water soak.
It’s best to agitate the water every so often. You may also want to change the water depending on how bad the stain is. If the water starts to become obviously dirty, change it out for fresh water and continue the soak.;
, Once the linens have soaked for a while, check them for remaining stains that need further treatment. Use a modern enzyme stain treatment like Spray 'n Wash or Shout. These modern stain removers have made many traditional methods obsolete. Spray a liberal amount on specific spots that need treatment. Allow the stain treatment to soak into the cloth before moving on.It is recommended to never use chlorine bleach, even as a spot treatment, on linens because it can cause yellowing and deteriorate the fabric.
In general, linen releases stains better than other fabrics do, so you may not actually need to do any further treatment besides soaking.

, If you are working with linen that is vintage or delicate, washing by hand is almost always what you want to do. Washing machines can be abrasive because of the rapid violent movement, especially machines with a center agitator. Wash with warm water, a basic mild detergent, and powdered oxygen bleach. Follow the instructions on the bleach product, but in general it is concentrated pretty highly and you shouldn't need too much, only about one filled scoop. Be sure to separate white linens from dark or colored linens to avoid any bleeding of the colors or fading of the white linens.An example of mild detergent would be something recommended for use on baby clothes like Dreft or All Free and Clear.
Oxygen bleach is usually made with sodium percarbonate, so you can look for this in the ingredients when buying. Oxi Clean is a pretty standard bleach to use.
If you are washing by hand, it is highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from the chemical reaction of the bleach.

, Most wash cycles have a rinse as part of it, but it can be good to send the linens through an extra rinse cycle. When washing by hand, rinse multiple times in fresh water each time., After all this, the stain you are fighting may still be present or the yellowing may not have subsided. If this is the case, it can be worthwhile to treat the stain a second time. Put the linen through the wash a second time., It is generally recommended that you never dry linens in the dryer. It is better for the fabric to have time to air dry. Laying the linen out flat will let it dry the best, although this is not always an option. You can also hang it on a clothesline, or drape it on a porch railing. If you do the latter, you will want to cover the railing with another cloth to keep the linen clean.Depending on what the linen is for and if you are going to use it immediately, this is a good time to iron the linen while it is still damp.
Tumble drying linen can cause it to wear out faster and to shrink.

"
"
Let the sun do the work.,
Use non-bleach alternatives in your laundry.,
Heat and soak on the stove with salt and baking soda.",How to Bleach Linen2," Place your linens in direct sunlight, which is a natural way to bleach fabrics. It’s been a standard practice for centuries and still works wonders today. You can leave the linen in the sun for a few hours or up to a week depending on how well the piece is bleaching. Check it every so often to make sure it is not becoming damaged by prolonged exposure.Make sure the linen is damp when you lay it out in the sun. This will help it bleach better. You can either hang it on a clothes line, or if the piece is small enough, you can set it on a table or hang in off of your porch. You may want to consider putting a separate cloth over any wood or other surfaces the linen will touch to keep it clean.
Spread the linen out flat and flip it periodically for the best bleach.
The length of time you should leave the linen out can vary. Some people find that leaving it out for multiple days or a whole week gives the best results. Others feel that too much sun exposure can damage the fabric. Your best bet is to keep a watchful eye on your piece and make sure it doesn’t seem to become damaged. You could also avoid this by continuing to dampen it each day if you are leaving it out for a while.
If you have particularly dark stains, try spraying a mixture of lemon juice and water on the spots before you put it in the sun. This will give those spots a boost to help reduce the stains.

, Since bleach irritates a lot of people’s skin, it can be helpful to try out more natural alternatives which you can add right into your regular laundry loads. Lemon juice, vinegar, baking soda and hydrogen peroxide are all good stain removing and bleaching remedies. These are obviously less harsh methods, so they may also be less powerful than chemical bleach.Try adding ¼ cup to ½ cup of lemon juice, ½ cup of baking soda or hydrogen peroxide (3%), or ½ cup to 1 cup of distilled white vinegar to your regular detergent.

, This can be an especially good option for small linen items like napkins or handkerchiefs. Place the linens in a large pot of water and add ¼ cup salt and ½ cup baking soda, mixing both in well with the water. Place on the stove. Bring to a boil, and then turn off the burner. Leave these on the stove for 2 to 3 days.You might want to change the water a couple times, but it is not absolutely necessary. You can also reheat the water a couple of times to boost the effect.

A box of washing soda. This is also called sodium carbonate or sodium ash, and is available in grocery stores.
A box of borax. This is a naturally occurring mineral that comes in powdered form, and is also available in grocery stores.;
, Stand it in a bowl and use a cheese grater to crate the entire bar. You can also put it in a food processor to grind it to a nice fine consistency. When you're finished, no large chunks should remain; you want it fine enough to mix with the other powders.

, Place them in a big bowl that you won't be using for food purposes, and mix them well with a spoon.

, If you used 3 cups of washing soda and 3 cups of borax, mix in 1 1/2 cups of grated soap - you get the picture!

, This is an optional step that you can choose if you wish to personalize your detergent to meet your family's needs. Baking soda helps freshen clothes that have heavy smells that need to be removed, and essential oils add an extra scent that you might enjoy.

Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) to your rinse cycle.,
Continue through a standard rinse cycle.",How to Make Fabric Softener1,"


Note that the essential oil is not necessary. The vinegar is the component responsible for softening clothes. It strips away residue on your clothes that would otherwise make them stiff, and it has properties that can break down some of the minerals found in hard water supplies.
If you do decide to use essential oils, you can use any scents you want.;
, For a normal load, fill a fabric softener ball with 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the fabric softener solution or add the same amount directly to the washer just before the rinse cycle begins.

Note that the baking soda will not dissolve, but it should be completely soaked.
This homemade fabric softener is often praised by people who have hard water.
Baking soda regulates the pH level in your rinse water, preventing it from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. It also cancels out mineral deposits, like those found in hard water. These mineral deposits are often responsible for making clothes stiff.

, Slowly add 1 cup (250 ml) white distilled vinegar to the mixture. Stir gently until the baking soda is dissolved.


The vinegar will react with the baking soda, causing a fizzy chemical reaction. Do not pour the vinegar too quickly or you will end up with a mess.
Vinegar strips soap and residue from clothing and also helps to soften hard water.
Some believe that the vinegar and baking soda cancel each other out, making them ineffective. The salt that is produced from the chemical reaction acts as a buffer in the rinse cycle, however. Moreover, many of the elements that help soften clothes remain in the solution even after the reaction occurs.

, If you want to make scented fabric softener, then you need to add essential oil or scent booster to the ingredients. Stir either option directly into the fabric softener solution.


If using essential oils, 25 to 30 drops should be sufficient.
If using scent booster, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of the crystals to your water and stir until dissolved.Scent booster is usually found in the laundry aisle. It is not a natural product, so it may not be preferable from an ecological sense, but it will lend your fabric softener a pleasant scent and may save you money in the long run.

Spray each square with white vinegar.,
Add a few drops of essential oil onto one square.,
Throw the scented fabric into your dryer.",How to Make Fabric Softener4," Cut clean cotton cloth into squares that are roughly 5 inches (12.7 cm) along each side.Cotton works well because it is a natural fiber and relatively breathable. Avoid fabrics with fibers that are spaced too tightly together. Also avoid synthetic fabrics.
You can use a rag or old piece of cloth for this, but make sure that the material you use is clean.

, Fill a small spray bottle with undiluted distilled white vinegar. Spray both sides of each square until moist to the touch.


Let dry slightly. The cloth can be moist, but it should not be dripping wet by the time you add it to the dryer.
The vinegar is the only element in this fabric softener formula that lends itself to actually softening your clothes. It may not be as strong as a liquid fabric softener using vinegar, but some of the effects should still remain.

, Drop 3 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil onto a cloth square. Spread the drops out so that they seep into the fibers of the entire square.


The essential oil will give your clothes a pleasant yet mild fragrance. You can technically use this method without the use of essential oils, but since the softening effects are less powerful than a liquid fabric softener alternative, it would make more sense to take advantage of the deodorizing and re-scenting abilities of this method.

, Place the scented fabric softener sheet directly into your dryer as you prepare to dry a load of clothes. Run a standard drying cycle. You do not need to do anything special from this point on.


Each dryer sheet can be used for two or three loads, but you may need to refresh the scent by adding 3 drops or more of the essential oil before use. Refresh the softening properties by giving the sheet another quick spray of vinegar.

To identify damage, look for:Broken corners or pieces
Frayed edges
Deep cuts or scratches;
, If you find that there is no sign of damage, then you should leave the tile as is. Busting it up to remove it will only cause asbestos fibers to be released into the environment. If left alone, they will remain within the tile., If you cover the asbestos tile with another layer of floor, you can protect the tile. This means that you will greatly reduce the risk of asbestos fibers getting into the air. The added bonus is that you save time and money by leaving your original floor intact."

Score the tile.,
Break the tile along the score line.,
Choose a wet saw to cut large or thick tiles.,
Fill the saw’s tray with water.,
Place the tile face down on the wet saw tray.,
Use the wet saw to make the cut.",How to Cut Glass Tile," Your glass tile will come with instructions from the manufacturer and there may be specific installation guidelines. Read and follow the directions provided. The thickness of your glass tile may require a particular cutting tool, for instance, or the manufacturer may recommend a particular technique. Some manufacturers won’t provide a warranty for the materials you purchased unless you follow their specific guidelines for installation.If you don’t feel comfortable with the installation after reading the instructions, consider contacting the manufacturer directly for more information.
You may want to consider using a qualified contractor, carpenter or professional installer for this job.;
, The number of tiles you buy depends on the size of the space and the size of the tiles you choose. Glass tiles are frequently used as backsplash in kitchens, as well as in bathrooms. However, glass tile is very versatile and can be used in many other ways. Measure the space carefully beforehand and purchase the tiles accordingly.


You can purchase glass tiles at most home improvement stores.
Try to buy about 5% more tile than you need for the job to account for any errors that occur during installation.

, The manufacturer’s instructions will elaborate on what you should expect from the materials. Depending on the type of tile, some variations in shape, color, shade and tone may be normal and should be expected. Confirm that the purchased materials meet your expectations before you begin the installation process.Check for any defective or broken glass, as well.

, Small slivers of glass will be discharged as you make cuts, creating a potential safety hazard. Be very careful. It’s imperative that you wear some kind of eye protection or safety goggles when cutting glass tile. It’s also recommended that you wear heavy cloth or leather gloves to protect your hands from flying glass shards.


Gloves will also protect your hands from the extremely sharp edges of freshly cut glass tile., Nippers, also known as “tile nibblers,” are essential for cutting small format tiles. Nippers look a lot like regular pliers, except they have extremely sharp tips. The most effective nippers for cutting glass tiles have tiny carbide wheels attached to the ends. These wheels make it possible for you to apply the necessary force required to make a cut without damaging the glass.


You can also use nippers to perform other detail work like trimming flares, cutting around pipes and breaking off pieces of scored tile.An example of small format tiles are 4mm mosaic tiles.

, Scoring means to minutely cut the glass to encourage a clean break. Most scoring tools feature a carbide or diamond cutting wheel to scratch the glass.


The scoring tool itself does not cut the glass into pieces. It creates a break line, and then the cutter applies pressure by hand to snap the tile along the line.

, To make a successful cut, measurements and cut lines must be very accurate. Use the straight edge to mark an accurate cut line with a non-permanent marker. Marking a cut line will also help you make one continuous, straight cut with the scoring tool, which is ideal.The score needs to run from one side of the tile to the other, so make sure your cut lines are drawn all the way to the edges of the tile., After you mark your cut line, use the scoring tool to scratch that line into the surface of the glass. Place the straight edge next to the line and score along it to ensure accuracy. Tilt the scoring tool at an angle and press down firmly – this will “score” the tile. Be sure to press down hard enough to scratch a visible line into the glass. Avoid pushing down too hard, however, because this can damage the glass.If you hear a gritty sound as you score, that means you are pushing too hard. The right amount of pressure will result in a smooth, tearing sound.
These scored lines are sometimes called break lines.

, Place your thumbs close to the score, one on each side of the line. Put pressure along the line by pressing down with your thumbs. Make sure you press down with equal force on both sides of the score. Then use a quick, snapping motion with your wrists. The tile will snap apart crisply along the scored line. Pull the tile apart after it snaps.You may need to use an additional tool to break the tile. Place a piece of wire or some other thin object directly beneath the score line, making sure the score line is facing up. Apply pressure to both sides of the line to snap the tile.

, It’s very hard to score larger tiles deep enough to snap them cleanly. A wet saw is the best choice. If you don’t own one, most home improvement stores will rent them out. Wet saws usually come equipped with standard (ceramic tile) blades. Do not use these blades to cut glass tile because it will damage the glass.


Switch that blade out with a glass compatible diamond-encrusted blade, which the home improvement store will carry., The water used in a wet saw helps to cool and lubricate the diamond blade as you make your cuts. Without the water, the glass will eventually heat up and explode. Adequate water flow in the saw’s reservoir tray is imperative to prevent this. Make sure you fill the tray up completely with water before you start using the wet saw.

, Cutting the tile face down will help to prevent chipping. Take your measurements and then draw the cut line onto the tile with a non-permanent marker. Place a piece of electrical tape, masking tape or duct tape along the line, which will prevent the glass from chipping at the edges.Line the saw up with the cut line.

, Turn the saw on and guide the diamond blade across the glass tile. Cut along the line slowly. Take your time making the cut and don’t push the blade into the glass. To get a clean cut, push the glass tile against the saw’s blade lightly and steadily."

, This works well to remove stains caused by organic items, like coffee, food, leaves, and lichen. Mix a small amount of ammonia with water. Scrub with a sponge or soft cloth until the stain lifts, Then, dry the area with a clean towel.








Bleach can also be used, but it is not as good as ammonia because it is more acidic.

, Rust occurs when metal oxidizes during contact with stone. The rust stains can be lifted with lemon juice and salt. Pour some lemon juice and salt onto a clean cloth. Scrub with the cloth until the rust is gone. Immediately rinse the surface with water.








Lemon is acidic, so it should be removed as soon you’re done using it. Rinse with a lot of water and dry with a towel.

, Paints and inks are more difficult to use because the cleaners for them are typically harsh. You can use mineral alcohol and a cloth to scrub off the stain. Methylene chloride can also be used, but it is dangerous.

Buy more than you need.",How to Buy a Discontinued Tile1," Whenever you lay out tile, save the product information in your records for future reference. Make your life easier by knowing exactly what you are looking for when it comes time to buy matching tiles. When purchasing a new property with tile work  that you would like to preserve, be sure to ask the seller if they have any of the following info:


The manufacturer’s name
The product name
Item number
Product number
Universal product code (UPC);
, Provide them with as much product information as you can. Find out if their warehouses are holding any backstock of that product.If so, ask if they can arrange a direct sale to you. If for some reason they aren’t able to sell to you directly, ask for the names of retailers and wholesalers that they deal with so you can arrange a sale through them.


If the manufacturer is out of stock, ask for a list of companies who purchased the tile for resale in the past.

, Get in touch with any retailers and wholesalers who used to carry that item.Ask the staff to run a computer search of their inventory to find out if they have any backstock still available. If the company is a chain with more than one location, be sure they run a company-wide search to see if another site has it in case this one doesn’t.


Don’t simply go by what is on the shelves in the front of the house. They may have pulled the item off the shelves because they knew it would be discontinued and unlikely to be a top seller after that.

, Perform an online search with keywords “discontinued tiles” and “buy” or “for sale.” Find companies that specialize or deal exclusively in hunting down old tiles that are no longer in production. Search their websites to see if they currently offer your tile.If they don’t have your tile advertised, contact them directly. Provide them with the product info. Ask them to perform a search through their suppliers or any other leads they may have.

, Resist the urge to immediately buy your tile as soon as it is located. If possible, obtain quotes from multiple sources. Be aware that prices may vary from one to the next, depending on priorities. Expect some sources to be aware of the rarity of the item and capitalize on it. Hope for the best and see if other sources would be happy to unload backstock at a discount just to be rid of it.


Expect the cost to be influenced by how old the tile is, how much is available, and how much you plan to buy., Don’t limit yourself to the precise amount needed to retile a specific surface. Plan against mishaps. Purchase more than needed in case you accidentally break your replacement tiles as you restore your room. Additionally, think ahead to the future, when these tiles will be even harder to come by. Use this opportunity to stock up for future projects, too."

Dilute dish soap with warm water.,
Apply solution to the marble.,
Wipe off tile and thoroughly dry.,
Use a dust mop.",How to Clean Marble Tile1," Cleansers that are too acidic can actually damage marble tile, which means you shouldn’t use products with lemon, vinegar, or bleach on it. That’s why a gentle, non-abrasive dish soap, which has a neutral pH, is the best option for cleaning marble. For the best results, mix approximately 8 ounces of warm water with one tablespoon of the soap in a spray bottle or other container. Shake the mixture well, so the two ingredients are mixed.Don’t use an all-purpose cleanser on your tile unless it’s specifically marked as safe for marble.;
, If you’re using the dish soap and water solution to clean marble tile on countertops, you can apply it directly from the spray bottle. For floors, use a soft mop to apply to the tile. Make sure not to apply too much of the solution to the marble, though -- the tile surface should be damp, but there shouldn’t any pools of liquid.If there is any standing water on your marble tile, wipe it up as quickly as possible.

, After you’ve applied the soap and water solution to your marble tile, you need to wipe down the surface to remove any dirt and debris. Use a hot, wet cloth to wipe down any tile on your countertops or a mop dampened with hot water for your floors. Next, take a soft, dry towel or mop to thoroughly dry and buff the tile.Make sure the cloth or mop that you’re using to wipe off the soap isn’t too wet. Wring the material out carefully to prevent too much water from sitting on the marble surface.

, If you have marble tile on your floor, you may sometimes need to remove dust, dirt, and other debris, such as crumbs or loose tile. However, while a vacuum may be the easiest way to clean up this type of mess, you’re better off using a dust mop to clean the tile. Vacuum cleaners with worn wheels and metal attachments can easily scratch the tile surface.If you want to use a vacuum on marble tile, check the wheels to make sure that they’re not scuffed or rough in any spots. Don’t use metal attachments either.

Determine how your tile can be installed before finalizing your online order.",How to Buy Tile Online," This will help you determine how much tile is needed for the project.


Use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of your floor, then multiply the length and the width to calculate the total floor area. For example, if your room is 12 feet (3.65 meters) by 9 feet (2.74 meters), your total floor area will be 108 feet (32.91 meters).;
, The amount of tiles you need will vary depending on the size of tiles you want for your floors. For example, if you want square tiles that measure 1 foot (30.48 cm) on each side, you will need 108 tiles for a floor area that measures 108 feet (32.91 meters).


Use an online floor tile calculator if you need mathematical assistance with determining how many tiles are needed for your flooring.
Type ""floor tile calculator"" into any Internet search engine to locate a website with a calculator or use the calculator on the ""Dummies"" website, which is featured in the Sources section of this article.

,


Go to any Internet search engine and use a variety of keywords to find tile retailers; such as ""online tile store,"" ""buy tile online,"" or ""best tiles online."" The search results will display numerous retailers that sell tile.
Use specific keywords if you want to buy a certain type or style of tile. For example, if you want to buy ceramic tiles, type keywords such as ""buy ceramic tiles online"" to locate retailers that specialize in ceramic tiles.

, Most retail websites will feature product reviews and ratings written by consumers next to each item being sold. This will allow you to determine if other buyers of the tile have been satisfied with their purchase.


Read both the positive and negative product reviews, and look for trends and patterns with feedback. For example, you may not want to buy a specific brand or style of tile if numerous consumers have written negative reviews about the tile; such as how corners of a specific tile continuously peel up from the floor.

, You may want to choose a tile retailer that honors returns in the event that your tile is the wrong color, wrong size, or if there are any problems with the order.


Look for the warranty and return policies within the ""frequently asked questions"" section of the website or locate a specific section labeled similarly to ""buying policies.""
Look specifically for information that indicates you will be required to pay a restocking fee if you return tiles. In some cases, websites will charge you a large percentage of the final sale price if you decide to return the tile later on.

, Depending on the weight and size of your tile order, your shipping fees may be costly.


Buy from websites that charge flat shipping rates for all tile orders, or for websites that honor shipping discounts if you order a specific amount of tiles. The shipping fees on these types of websites may be less costly.

, In some cases, you may want to follow up with your order or ask questions about the tile during the installation process.


Look for a customer service phone number, email address, and the retailer's office hours of operation. You may not want to purchase tile from an online retailer with limited customer service hours, or from a retailer that does not provide customer service at all.

, If you are not installing the tile yourself, you will need to call local tile installers in your area to determine if they can install the tile you are ordering.


Locate a local tile installer using your local phone directory, your local phone book, or by performing an Internet search.
Provide the tile installer with information about the tile you plan on ordering; such as the tile's brand name, style, and any other details. The tile installer will then be able to verify if they can install that tile for you.

Use a steam cleaner.,
Start with a mild cleaning solution.,
Use oxygen bleach sparingly.",How to Clean Colored Grout1," Steam cleaners use heat and high pressure to get rid of debris. However, if your grout is very old or damaged, you should avoid using a steam cleaner because it may cause further damage. Heat the steam cleaner and then move the cleaning wand along the surface of the grout lines to get rid of any dirt and debris., It is best to try mild solutions first, since they are least likely to damage your colored grout. Start by trying vinegar or baking soda. If that doesn’t do the job, you can move on to hydrogen peroxide, which will work with moderate levels of grime. If your grout lines are really grimy, you may need to use oxygen bleach. However, chlorine bleach should generally be avoided.Chlorine bleach will discolor your colored grout, so you should leave it in the cupboard. Instead, choose either hydrogen peroxide or oxygen bleach.
If your colored grout is dirty around dishwashers or sinks from hard-water deposits, you can use a vinegar solution. In a spray bottle, pour an equal amount of vinegar and water. Spray a bit of the solution on the grout lines. Then, scrub the grout lines with your grout brush.A good alternative to vinegar for mildly dirty grout is baking soda paste. Add some water to baking soda to make a paste. Then, apply the paste to the grout lines and scrub with your grout brush., Although oxygen bleach does a great job on colored grout, it will eventually wear the color down because of the chlorine.The main advantage of oxygen bleach is that it requires very minimal scrubbing and does not produce fumes. You can find it at most home, hardware and cleaning supply stores."

Pick a piece of tile to bring to a store.If you have an intact spare tile lying around, bring that.,
Get rid of the surrounding grout.,
Chisel the tile out of place.,
Bring the tile to a flooring retailer or wholesaler.",How to Buy a Discontinued Tile2," If a piece of existing tile is practically falling off the wall or loose enough for you to pluck off the floor, all in one piece, without damaging its neighbors, go for it. Otherwise, pick an existing tile to remove from the floor or wall. Make things easier on yourself and pick a damaged tile that already needs to be replaced.


If you are looking to re-tile another room to match existing tile that doesn’t need replacing, see if any local flooring companies offer on-site visits to give estimates. Arrange an inspection to see if they are able to identify the existing tile so you don't have to damage a perfectly good, rare tile.
Don’t rely on photographs. Lighting may affect the tile’s color. Also, texture is hard to capture in a photo.

, Scour the grout around the tile with a grout saw. Be patient and work slowly. Only use enough pressure to scrape the grout out of place. Avoid using too much pressure or working too fast, which may cause you to slip off target and scratch a neighboring tile.If you are removing a wall tile, raking too hard may also damage the drywall behind it.Chips and dust from tiling can be very sharp and abrasive. Wear workman’s gloves and safety glasses.
If you are removing wall tiles, place a towel, tarp, or sheet at the base of the wall to catch debris and protect surfaces.
Once you’re finished, line the surrounding tiles with painter’s tape so their surface is protected. Be sure to cover their exposed sides now that the grout has been removed.

, First, set the business end of your chisel in the center of the tile’s surface, at a 90-degree angle. Tap the butt gently with a hammer. Repeat until enough chips fall away for you to slip the chisel underneath the remaining pieces at a 45-degree angle. Tap its butt with the hammer to pry them loose.Always work from the center outward to prevent the chisel or hammer from damaging the surrounding tiles.

, First, measure one of its intact neighbors. Then bring the measurements, the largest chunk of tile, and any product info you might have found to one or more brick-and-mortar stores. Ask the staff to identify it if possible.If the staff is able to identify the exact product, ask for all product info so you can contact the manufacturer as well as any retailers, wholesalers, and specialists who may carry it.
If necessary, bring two chunks of tile: one that shows the most surface area, and one whose thickness is intact. Both features are necessary for exact identification."

Try a reproduction company.,
Settle for the next best thing.,
Customize closely matching tiles.",How to Buy a Discontinued Tile3," If you are unable to find your original tile anywhere, don’t give up. Search online for reproduction companies that specialize in matching discontinued tiles. See if they currently offer your specific tile. If not, find out if they are willing to make a custom order.Since these are reproductions, they may have entirely different product info, which might not show up in your initial search.

, If no exact reproductions are available, find a new tile that matches your original one as closely as possible. Contact the manufacturer to see if they offer any new designs that only differ from the original by a slight tweak.If not, visit brick-and-mortar stores with the product info or a sample tile. Ask them for recommendations on matching your tile with another manufacturer’s product.


The key factors to consider in matching tile are size, shape, color, and texture.

, If no one product captures the same size, shape, color, and texture as your original, prioritize which factors matter most to you. From there, alter the other characteristics to fit your needs as best you can. For example:


If the new tile resembles the old in all ways except for being thinner, don’t worry. Apply extra mastic (an adhesive used to laying tile) underneath the new tile so its surface is even with the old.If the store has another tile that’s perfect except for being too large, ask them if they are able to cut it down to size and/or shape.If not, ask if they would be able to special-order pre-cut tiles from the manufacturer.
If the new tile’s shade of color is slightly off from the original, incorporate this into the room’s design. Buy additional tiles in two or three neighboring shades. Instead of having a handful of new tiles in one new shade stick out as obvious replacements, give the tiled surface more variety to make it look intentional.

Use a liquid cleanser.,
Try hydrogen peroxide.,
Apply a poultice.",How to Clean Marble Tile2," If the stain on your marble tile is oil-based, such as grease or cosmetics, you can usually remove it with a soft liquid cleanser. Use a gentle household detergent on fresh stains and ammonia or mineral spirits on older, more stubborn stains. Dilute your chosen cleanser with warm water, and use a soft cloth to apply it to the stained area. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the cleanser off and a clean, dry towel to dry the marble.You can use the cloth dampened with your cleansing solution to gently scrub at the stain, but don’t be too rough to avoid scratches.

, If your marble tile is stained by an organic material, such as food, coffee, or tea, hydrogen peroxide is usually the most effective cleanser. Mix 12 percent hydrogen peroxide with several drops of ammonia, and apply it to the stained tile with a cloth. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the hydrogen peroxide off, and thoroughly dry the surface with a soft, clean towel.You should only use hydrogen peroxide to clean your marble tile if it is a light color. Hydrogen peroxide may bleach dark marble tile.

, For stubborn or old stains, you may need a poultice, which is a thick, paste-like cleanser, to get them off your marble tile. You can buy commercially-made poultice powder that you simply combine with water. Follow the instructions to mix the paste, and apply it generously to the stain. Allow it to sit for 1 to 2 days under plastic wrap before removing the plastic and letting it dry. You can then rinse the poultice away with distilled water and buff it dry with a clean, soft cloth.You can find poultice powder at your local hardware, home improvement, or stone supply store.
When applying the poultice to the stain, the layer should be approximately ¼ to ½ inch thick.
Secure the plastic wrap over the poultice with painter’s tape to ensure that it’s airtight.

Wipe up spills quickly.,
Use protective coverings.,
Seal the tile monthly.",How to Clean Marble Tile3," Anytime that a liquid sits on the surface of your tile, it has the potential to stain or discolor the marble. Acidic liquids, such as citrus juices, wine, coffee, and vinegar, are a particular danger to marble, but even a puddle of water that isn’t cleaned up quickly can stain the tile. To avoid discolorations, wipe up any spills on the marble as soon as you see them.You can wipe up water with paper towel or a clean cloth, but if an acidic liquid spills on the tile, wipe it up and then clean the air with a cloth dampened with water and dish soap. Make sure to dry the surface thoroughly when you’re done.
If you have marble in your bathroom, remember to dry the tile after every shower and bath.

, The best way to protect your marble tile from stains, discoloration, and other damage is to cover it. Use coasters and trivets on tiled countertops to keep any liquids or food that drip over the edge of a glass or pan from falling on the marble. On tile floors, place mats or throw rugs near doorways so you can wipe dirt and debris off your feet before walking across the marble.If you want to protect a marble tile floor from scratches, try placing rubber mats under metal furniture and accessories. It’s also a good idea to place them under plants and flower pots.

, To protect your marble surface from stains and discoloration, it’s important to apply a sealant approximately once a month. It forms a protective film over the marble so you have more time to wipe up spills and clean stains. You can purchase marble sealer at your local hardware, home improvement, or stone supply store. Follow the directions on the bottle, but you usually mist it on, allow it to soak in, and then wipe down the surface.Make sure to start with clean marble tile before applying the sealer.
If you want extra protection, you can apply a second coat of sealer after the first one is completely dry.

Then, rinse off the surface of the grout to remove surface dirt and debris., Following the directions on the cleaning product, mix your cleaning solution. If you are cleaning a counter, you can use a small plastic bowl. If you are cleaning your floor, you should mix it in your mop bucket., You will notice that grout lines are slightly depressed from the surface of your counter or floor. Fill these depressions with the cleaning solution and then let it sit for at least fifteen minutes., After letting the cleaning solution sit for fifteen minutes, use your grout brush to scrub away the grime. Since the cleaning solution will break down dirt molecules, it should be easy to remove them with a gentle scrub., If you are cleaning a floor, you can add a cleaning solution, such as vinegar or oxygen bleach powder, to your mop water. Mop the floor with a liberal amount of the cleaning solution. Then, let it sit for thirty minutes. Finally, put fresh water in your mop bucket and rinse the floor.If you use vinegar, mix equal parts warm water and vinegar.

Apply a penetrating sealer to your colored grout.,
Wipe up spills right away.,
Wipe down your shower tiles after showering.",How to Clean Colored Grout3," A sealer will make your colored grout stain-resistant, since it makes the grout more resistant to oil- and water-based products.If your grout is very soiled, you could also re-apply the color sealant originally used to color the grout.Depending on the amount of wear and tear and the type of sealant you choose, you will need to re-apply it every year or two.
If you are not sure whether your grout is sufficiently sealed, drip some water on it. If the water stays on the surface of the grout, it is sufficiently sealed. However, if the grout absorbs the water, you need to reseal the grout.When you purchase the sealer, ask if it is both hydrophobic and oleophobic. Some sealers are only water repelling or hydrophobic, whereas others will repel both water and oil-based substances.

, When coffee or soda spills on your colored grout, you should wipe it up right away. This will reduce the amount of work involved in cleaning the grout., When you finish your shower, use a squeegee to quickly wipe down your shower tiles. This will prevent the accumulation of lime, soap deposits and rust stains on your colored grout."

Purchase spackling paste and a small putty knife if repairing a very small hole.,
Spread a small amount of spackling paste over the hole with your putty knife.,
Smooth the spackling paste out with your putty knife.,
Allow the spackling paste to dry and then paint the patch, if necessary.",How to Fix a Hole in a Wall1," Very small holes are usually caused by nails or screws and can be repaired easily and quickly with spackle.


There are a variety of spackling pastes for sale. It's usually a good idea to get a non-shrinking spackling paste, so that a crack does not develop at the seam between the wall and the patch.
Small cracks between molding and trim can be filled with spackling paste but it is probably easier to use paintable caulk, which is available at any home improvement store. Simply run a bead of caulk along for crack and smooth with a wet finger.;
, Do not put a lot of spackling paste on your knife. While it depends on the size of the hole, you will usually only need a small bit approximately the size of a marble.

, The goal is to make the transition between the wall and the patch as seamless as possible. Using a damp cloth, wipe off any excess spackling paste that may have gotten on the wall around the hole.


If you mess up the smoothness of the patch, feel free to start over with a bit more spackling paste on your putty knife.

, Sometimes a hole is so small and your wall color is light enough that retouching the paint is not necessary.

,


The conventional framing method uses 2-by-4 studs on 16-inch (40.64 cm) centers. It uses more wood than the advanced-framing method and has less space between the studs for insulation.
The advanced-framing method uses less wood by using studs on 24-inch (60.9 cm) centers and open corners. The advanced-framing method may be considered by some to be structurally inferior; however, it meets the structural codes of most areas. High-wind areas and areas with seismic activity may be exceptions.

,


Once you have determined the framing method, determine the number of studs you will need and add 10 percent. Extra wood will give you what you need for headers, fire blocking, and short studs above and below windows and doors.
Buy treated boards for the base plate of each wall.

,


For example, if you are cutting studs for an 8-foot (2.44 m) wall using the conventional-framing method, the length of the studs would be 91.5-inches (232.41 cm). This is subtracting 4.5 inches (11.43 cm) for the bottom plate and 2 top plates.
For the advanced-framing method, subtract 3 inches (7.62 cm) from 8 feet (2.44 m).

,,,,


Channels are used where 1 wall will meet another in the middle of a wall.
Corners are used at the end of a wall.

,

Remove old backing paper or wallpaper from the wall and ceiling where you will install the coving.
Use a sponge and water to wipe down the wall and ceiling. Ensure that the sponge is damp, but not dripping water. Scrub the surfaces to remove all dust or leftover wallpaper paste.;
,

Use a tape measure to determine the width of the coving you will be using. Measure from the bend in the coving to the outside edge of the coving on both the ceiling and wall sides.
Measure the length of coving you will need to cover the space on your wall and ceiling.
Divide the length to be covered by the length of coving strips that you have. If you require a total of 60 feet (18.3 m) of coving and have coving in 3-foot (.9-m) strips, then you will need at least 20 strips of coving.
Ensure that you have a few extra strips of coving.

, Use a tape measure and pencil to mark the spaces on the wall and ceiling where the edges of the coving will fall. These marks form your guidelines., Use a putty knife to score the space between the marks you made on the wall and ceiling. Scoring the ceiling and wall will allow the coving to fit more securely against the surface., Look at the back of the coving. The back edges of the coving will be labeled according to which edge will be placed against the ceiling, and which edge will be placed against the wall.,

Ensure that the edge of the coving that will be set against the ceiling is at the bottom of the miter block. The ceiling edge of the coving should touch the bottom base of the miter block.
Situate the coving so the display side faces you.

,

Steady the piece of coving by holding onto it with 1 hand.
Use the other hand to saw the coving. Use a crosscut saw with medium teeth and a rigid blade.

, Lift the coving out of the miter block., Use sandpaper to smooth the cut edge of the coving. Ensure that the cut edge is free of coarse spots."

Gather and purchase all the supplies and tools you will need.,
Apply a drywall patch or sheetrock tape over the hole.,
Apply joint compound, also called 'mud', over the patch.,
Allow your patch to dry, which should take at least 24 hours.,
Paint the patch to match the rest of the wall.",How to Fix a Hole in a Wall2," To patch a hole the size of a golf ball you will need a drywall patch or sheetrock tape, a small amount of joint compound, a finishing trowel, and 120 grit sandpaper.

, A piece of sheetrock tape soaked in water is cheapest but a patch sticks, flattens better, and is thinner.


Drywall patches come in a variety of sizes and should be available at any home improvement store. They are made specifically to patch holes, so they stick to the wall and provide a good surface to smooth over with joint compound.
Holes the size of a golf ball and smaller can also be backed with some tight fitting plug or lid or can simply be taped over.
Any rise caused by the patch can be feathered out with joint compound.

, Use your finishing trowel to get it on the wall and smooth it out.Mud is usually held in a 'California Cake Pan' or small rectangular box about 4 x 12"". If you are planning on doing a lot of sheet rock work in the future, it might be a good idea to purchase one. If you only plan on doing this one repair, don't waste the money.

, Once dry, sand your patch until you cannot feel any seams between the patch and the existing wall.

, Make sure that you have gotten all of the dust off the area that you created when you sanded.


Small patches do not need to be primed although it will add a harder skin to the repaired area.

Allow to dry overnight.,
Sand with 120 grit sandpaper or sandpaper sponge.,
Try to reproduce any wall texture, if necessary.,
Prime and then paint your patch to match the rest of the wall.",How to Fix a Hole in a Wall3," For a large hole in a sheetrock wall you will need a piece of sheetrock, joint tape, joint compound, a finishing trowel, sandpaper, a sheetrock saw, and a razor-knife.


All of these items should be available at any big home improvement store.
Since you may only need a piece of sheetrock that is a few feet square, see if you or a friend has a piece of it lying around, instead of having to buy a whole sheet at the home improvement store. Make sure that whatever way you get it, the sheetrock is the same thickness as the sheetrock on the wall you are repairing.

, To fix a large hole you will need to cut out a piece of the wall all the way to the studs on either side of the hole. This will allow you to attach a new piece of sheetrock to the studs.


With your sheetrock saw cut down along the stud and remove sheetrock. Then with a razor-knife cut down at the center of the stud. This will allow you to attach your new piece of sheetrock to the stud.

, This may take some finessing if the hole is an odd shape. Screw it to the stud on both sides using one screw every six inches or so.Use your razor knife to make small adjustments to the size of your patch. The sheetrock saw is better for rough in cuts.

, This layer of joint compound is simply making a bed on which the joint tape can be applied.

, The tape is pressed into the mud completely flat and the excess mud is scraped off with your trowel.


Sheetrock tape comes dry but needed to be dunked in water before it is stuck to the wall.
Tape can be of any length and should be overlapped about an inch when put together.

, This can be allowed to dry or a second coat can be applied immediately, so as to cover the tape.

, Once completely dry you may want to apply a third coat of mud if you think there will be areas where the mud is not smooth.

, Sand until the surface of the joints is smooth.

, When patching, one of the main problems is matching texture. Texture can be hard to match since it is usually machine blown. To texture patches, a stiff stipple brush will often do the trick, by sticking brush in plaster and stippling on finished and dry patch. If necessary, after it sets up a little, trowel over it to flatten high spots.

, Large areas like sheet rocked whole walls and rooms probably should be primed really well for toughness and seal. Priming really well also saves on finish paint.

Gather and purchase your materials.,
Remove loose plaster.,
Screw down any loose lath to the studs underneath.,
Apply your plaster patching compound to the hole.,
Apply a second coat with your trowel.,
Allow the patch to dry completely.,
Reproduce any wall texture if your walls are textured.,
Prime and paint your patch.",How to Fix a Hole in a Wall4," To fix a lath and plaster wall you will need a plaster patching compound, a large joint or finishing trowel, and sandpaper.

, You will need to remove all of the damaged area while making sure to not expand the damage. Gently remove any cracked or loose plaster, moving out from the center damaged area until all the plaster you encounter is secure.

, Use sheetrock screws but if the lath is cracked add wide thin washers to the screws when screwing down the lath.


If some of your lath is damaged so much that it will not hold up plaster, you will need to replace it.

, This is the rough in coat, so the surface of the patch should be a bit below the surface of the wall and does not need to be sooth. Allow this layer to dry for a bit, until the surface is slightly firm but not hard.


The consistency of this layer of plater patch should be like peanut butter., This coat should stick to the first one but the goal here is to give the surface a smooth surface that is level with the wall.


This layer of patching compound should be just slightly thinner than the one underneath. This will allow you to more easily smooth out the surface with you trowel.

, Sand the surface with 120 grit sandpaper if you did not get the surface smooth enough with your trowel. Getting a completely smooth surface with a trowel will take a lot of practice, so don't be discouraged if you need to do a bit of sanding on your first try.

, Matching texture can be very difficult since it is usually machine blown. To texture patches stick a stiff stipple brush in plaster and apply to finished and dry patch. If necessary, after it sets up a little, trowel over it to flatten high spots.

, Always use a good primer on plaster walls, as it will protect the wall and saves on cost of finish paint.

Set a compound miter saw with the correct angles.,
Cut the right inside corner.,
Set the miter saw angle again.,
Cut the left inside corner.,
Fit the two pieces together before nailing them in place.",How to Cut Crown Molding Inside Corners1," Use an adjustable protractor to measure the actual angle of the inside corner. Divide this measurement in half to determine the number of degrees each cut will need to be set to.


Place the right side of the protractor against one wall forming the corning. Open up the left side of the protractor, extending it all the way open until it is perfectly flat against the wall on the other side of the corner.
Note that the protractor should be parallel to the ceiling and floor at this point.
Most corners will be roughly 90 degrees or only an angle or so off that mark, but for the sake of accuracy, it is important that you find out the precise measurement before proceeding.
Each piece of crown molding extending to that corner will need to be able to fit together. In order for this to happen, both pieces of crown molding need to match the measured angle of the corner, so both should be cut to an exact have of this measured angle.;
, Swing the blade of the saw to the left until the angle matches the halved measurement of your corner.

, Place the piece of crown molding in your jig and on the bed of your saw. Drop the saw and, while keeping your left hand on the molding, make the cut.


The bottom of the molding should be up when you place molding in the jig.
Keep the jig and everything else to the left side of the blade and safely out of the path of the blade. The jig must not be in the way of the jig.
Do not turn the saw as you drop the blade or make the cut.

, Swing the blade of the saw to the right until the angle matches the halved measurement of your corner.


Note that this measurement must be the exact same as the one made for the right inside corner. If not, the two pieces will not fit together correctly when the time comes to install them on the wall.

, Place the piece of crown molding in your jig and on the bed of your saw. Drop the saw and, while keeping your right hand on the molding, make the cut.


The bottom of the molding should be up when you place molding in the jig.

If there are any electrical components on the side of your house, they should be covered in plastic for the duration of the cleaning process., Since you will likely be using a ladder and focusing on the side of the house, you want to make sure there are no objects in your way. Remove any debris, logs, or other items from the side of your house so you have access to all of the siding., Trimming these trees will not only remove an obstacle to your cleaning efforts. It will prevent dirt and pollen from accumulating on your siding., Depending on the type of siding you own and the particular product, you may need to follow very specific maintenance and cleaning guidelines., You should follow the general cleaning and maintenance guidelines for your particular type of siding:

Wash vinyl siding annually with soap and water. You should avoid pressure washing vinyl siding.Wash insulated siding annually with soap and water. You should avoid pressure washing insulated siding.Fibre cement siding should be cleaned annually to prevent dirt and mildew from accumulating.It needs to be repainted every fifteen to twenty years.Wash engineered wood siding once a year with a mild detergent. You can use a light sandpaper to remove really tough stains on engineered wood siding.Clean wood siding once a year with soapy water and a soft bristled brush., Choose a small, one foot square area of siding on your house and clean it thoroughly with the cleaning solution you plan to use for the whole house. Return to the area the next day and check to see if the solution worked and if it had any adverse impact on your siding, such as peeling up the paint or damaging the wood., You will need a five-gallon bucket, a garden hose, a good brush, a wash cloth, a couple tarps, some tape, possibly a ladder and other tools. You will certainly need a bucket to hold the cleaning solution, a hose to rinse off the siding, and a good brush for scrubbing. Make sure you have everything you need before cleaning.

Attach a long handled brush to a pole to get at the high areas. You can use duck-tape to attach the brush to the pole.
Use a wire brush to clean tough mildew and stains on fiber cement siding.Exercise caution when cleaning wood siding. In particular, you should avoid using too much water pressure since it can get into the joints and you could trigger wood rot.Since you are not using a power washer this should not be a problem, but you want to exercise caution even if using a garden hose or a hose attachment.

, Outdoor cleaning wands have a brush attached to a long pole that connects to your garden hose. They are a great alternative to a power washer and offer more cleaning precision.Make sure you have a long garden hose. If you are using a cleaning wand attached to your garden hose, make sure you have a garden hose that will allow you to reach around the entire exterior of your house.
If you have a two or more story house, you will also likely need a ladder to get at the high parts of your siding. Remember to follow the safety guidelines on the ladder and have someone spot you while you are on it.

, You should wear some protective eyewear and some gloves while cleaning your siding to protect your eyes from debris and keep your hands clean.If you anticipate dealing with mold, you should also wear a mask. Find an appropriate respirator mask that has filters to block the mold from entering your lungs. Also, you may want to wear a disposable hair cover to prevent the mold from getting on your hair and skin. If conditions are very bad, you may even need a full body suit designed for mold protection., Using your garden hose, add water to your five-gallon (18.9 L) bucket and then add appropriate cleaning products. Depending on your particular siding and cleaning goals, you may choose a vinegar solution, a bleach solution, oxygen bleach solution, or green cleaning solution. Review possible cleaning solutions below:

Use a vinegar cleaning solution. Mix 30% white vinegar with 70% water for an all-purpose cleaner that will get rid of light mold and mildew stains on your siding.
Use a bleach cleaning solution. Mix a third of a cup (78 Milliliters) of powdered laundry detergent, two thirds of a cup (157 Milliliters) of powdered household cleaner, and one quart (946 Milliliters) of laundry bleach in one gallon (3.78 L) of water.
You can also use a bleach solution to clean mold from vinyl siding. Add one quart (946 Milliliters) of household bleach to a gallon (3.78 L) of water, then add a third of a cup (78 Milliliters) of laundry detergent and two thirds of a cup (157 Milliliters) of trisodium phosphate cleaner.Avoid damaging your landscaping by using oxygen bleach. Mix one cup (236 Milliliters) of oxygen bleach into a gallon (3.78 L) of water. The oxygen bleach will not damage your landscaping.
Use a green cleaning product. Use an environmentally friendly cleaner that is non-toxic and biodegradable so that you can avoid damaging soil in your flower and vegetable beds or on your lawn.If the siding is only moderately dirty, you could just use a bucket of soapy water. Add a couple squirts of dish detergent to your five-gallon (18.9 L) bucket of water.
Use regular household cleaners to get at tough stains on the siding.
Add a diluted mildew cleaner to your solution for protection against mold., Take a walk around the house and look for parts of the siding that are especially dirty or moldy. Allocate more time for scrubbing these parts of your siding., Then, you can scrub the area with a bristle brush or wire brush until it looks clean., If you need to scrub areas that are very high up, you can use an outdoor cleaning wand extension to your garden hose.

If you don’t own a cleaning wand, you can attach a scrub brush to a broom stick or hockey stick. Attach the brush to the broom stick with a roll of duck-tape.

Open up the left side of the protractor, extending it all the way open until it is perfectly flat against the wall on the other side of the corner. Note that the protractor should be parallel to the ceiling and floor at this point.
Most corners will be roughly 90 degrees or only an angle or so off that mark, but for the sake of accuracy, it is important that you find out the precise measurement before proceeding. Divide this measurement by two and make your initial bevel cut according to this figure.

, Guide the blade of a manual coping saw with your thumbnail and make a square starting cut.


Your coping saw should be perpendicular to the molding as you make your starting cut.
Using your thumb as a guide will help you make a more accurate cut.
Cutting a square starting cut is especially important if you have a piece of crown molding with a complex profile.
Keep the molding clamped to a sawhorse or hold it in place with your knee while you work with the saw.
Do not force the blade. If it starts to straw from your cutting line, back up and restart the cut.

, Angle the saw by 30 degrees and shave off more wood from the back of the molding. Stay just outside your cutting line as you work on this part.


Remove more wood from the back than from the front.
Saw slowly and carefully.
You should only cut away material just outside the initial cutting line. If extra material needs to be removed, you can do so gradually with sandpaper.

, You will need to remove notches if you are working with molding in complex shapes. Cut notches and details out that follow the curve of the the shape.


This piece of molding will need to fit over a piece of molding that has not been altered. In other words, each notch will need to correspond to an area that curves outward, so that there is room for that outward curve in the other piece to fit. Anywhere that curves outward, then, should have a notch of comparable width and radius going into it from the side.
You will usually have to approach these notches and details from several angles before you can get them just right.

,


Place your crown molding upside down in your miter box when you cut the bevel, with the bottom at the top.
Attach a wood stop to the table so that the molding will be held at the right angle.
Use a blade with fewer teeth when cutting the crown molding.
Make the fit tighter by re-cutting with your coping saw at sharper angles as previously described. Angles that hit in the back will need to be removed.

, Position a piece of crown molding with a flat edge flush against one side of the corner. Glide your cut piece of molding over this unaltered piece, lining them up as evenly as possible.


If you're lucky, the two pieces will fit together perfectly on your first try. Usually, though, you will need to make a few more adjustments before you get a perfect fit without any gaps.

, Mark any trouble spots of excess material lightly with a pencil. Use a rat-tail wood file or 100-grit sandpaper to shave off this extra wood.


If the joint is close to fitting and the gaps are very small, the sandpaper should be enough.
Use the file if you need to remove larger amounts of wood.

, Butt the two pieces of molding together into the corner. Nail in the first, then the second, making sure that they fit together evenly before doing so.


A nail gun works well for quickly nailing the pieces of molding into place.

The coat should be between 1/8 and 1/4 inch (3 to 6 mm) thick, depending on the severity of damage.
You can apply texture in a variety of ways. Swipe over it with a whisk brush to create a woven appearance, draw overlapping spirals into it using a thick-bristled brush, lightly scuff the mud with a trowel to create the popular ""skip trowel"" look.
Give the mud 24 hours to dry, then apply paint to the wall as desired. You can also apply a glaze over the paint after it dries to further enhance the texture.;
, Plain wallpaper may not be enough to hide damaged, uneven wall surfaces, but textured wallpaper can mask those imperfections more effectively.Measure the dimensions of your wall and buy enough textured wallpaper to cover the entire surface. Depending on your needs, you can either buy it in rolls or large tiles.
Check the manufacturer's instructions to determine how to hang it. Many types have dried glue on the back of each piece. In these instances, you can wet the paper with plain water and paste it directly to the wall.
Most textured wallpaper is also paintable, so if desired, you can apply a coat of standard wall paint over the surface of the wallpaper after it dries.

, Instead of trying to hide any imperfections in your wall, work with them by creating a large mural incorporating the uneven elements.


To deal with discoloration, consider layering coordinating colors over the space to create a scenic view—the night sky, the beach, the mountains, the grasslands, or any other appropriate option.
You can mask minor imperfections in the texture of the wall but sponging the paint on or by using other techniques that add texture to paint.
If you're feeling bold, you can use this technique to work with cracks in the wall, too. For instance, the right crack can look like the branch of a tree; consider painting a tree trunk nearby and adding leaves, birds, and similar details around it.

, It can be somewhat time-consuming, but applying brick over a bad wall can create an intriguing accent. Since brick is such a sturdy material, it should be able to hide everything from discoloration to large cracks.


You can technically use standard bricks to cover the wall, but thinner interior bricks will usually fit the space better. Essentially, you'll be building a brick wall over the wall you already have.
Similarly, you can lay tiles over the wall to cover up imperfections. This can work especially well in rooms that conventional feature tile surfaces, like bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms.

, If you aren't allowed to permanently alter the wall or don't want to spend time hanging normal wallpaper, consider covering the bad wall with adhesive renter's wallpaper instead.The adhesive backing is roughly as strong as the glue on the back of a sticky note, if not a little stronger, so it's easy to remove. If you remove it carefully, you can often reuse it, too.
If you need to cover the entire wall, measure the dimensions of the space and buy a large enough roll to fit your needs. This can be an expensive option, though, so you can also use smaller strips to cover small patches of imperfections if doing so would suit your needs.

, Like adhesive wallpaper, adhesive tiles are a good way to mimic the look of the real thing without committing to anything more permanent.


You can use this to cover a large wall, but it makes an especially useful option for small wall spaces like kitchen backsplashes.
These tiles are also fairly thin, so you should have no difficulty trimming them down to better cover the size and dimensions of your space. Since the outer surface is smooth and hard, you should be able to keep them clean with a soft cloth.
Like adhesive wallpaper, peel-and-stick tiles are relatively easy to remove. If any residue gets left behind, you should be able to clean it off with a standard household cleanser.

, If you're up to a challenge, use colored or patterned tape to create simple patterns over the wall. You can plan out the pattern so that the tape falls out over the imperfections you want to hide.Duct tape should adhere well and is available in a variety of styles, giving you more options to work with. Consider applying it in diamond patches, stripes, or zigzags.

, Vinyl décor decals are essentially large stickers designed for use on painted walls. Choose a design you like and simply adhere it directly over the spot you want to cover up.


Note that this may work best when you're trying to cover simple flaws like stains or ink marks. Strange wall textures can still show through from the front of the decal after you apply it.

, Push a large bookshelf in front of the wall if you need to hide a large space or hang smaller shelves directly onto the wall if you only need to cover up a small patch.


You can use one large bookshelf to cover one panel of the wall, but if you want to cover the entire wall, consider pushing back-to-back bookcases up against it.
When using smaller shelves, place the shelf directly beneath the imperfection you want to hide. Stack decorative elements on top of the shelf in a manner that allows you to cover up the flaw behind them.

, This is classic way to cover up patches of bad wall. Find a painting, photograph, or other piece of artwork large enough to cover the imperfect area, then hang it directly over the spot you need to hide.


You can purchase duplicate prints of classic artwork, frame a poster, or commission a piece from a local artist.
If you aren't able to find artwork you like, consider making your own. Buy several canvases that are large enough to cover the area and paint them as desired.

, For walls with larger flawed patches, you could try creating a collage of favorite pictures. These pictures can be framed or unframed; both options will work, but they'll each create different effects.The picture collage can be as small or large as you need it to be, and you can use either personal or professional pictures.
Try to plan out the collage so that there are pictures directly over any imperfection you need to hide.
Hanging framed pictures will create a more polished, intentional look. Unframed pictures, on the other hand, create an artsy, casual appearance. Regardless of which option you choose, try to use photographs printed on high-quality, low-gloss photo paper to minimize glare.

, You can hang one mirror to cover one small imperfection or create a collage of mirrors to hide a larger area. Mirrors also have the added benefit of making the room look bigger.


When hanging one mirror, consider the dimensions of the space you need to cover. A full-length mirror can cover a tall patch, but if you need to cover a wide space, you can make the same mirror work by simply turning it on its side.
When hanging multiple mirrors, choose a variety of shapes and sizes and hang them in an asymmetrical manner. Make sure to place a mirror over any hole or imperfection that needs covering, though.

, You might think of using curtains to cover a bad wall with a window placed in it, but you can still use this fix even if no windows are involved.


When you're covering both the wall and the window, choose curtains that are long enough to cover the entire damaged space and hang them high above the top of the window. You can also hang curtains in between separate windows if that portion of the wall needs hiding.
Even if you aren't covering a window, you can still attach a standard curtain rod to the top of the wall near the ceiling. Hang heavy fabric curtains from the rod, making sure they hang low enough to brush the floor. Doing it this way makes it look as though the curtains hide a window, so they shouldn't seem too misplaced.

, Fabric is cheaper than wallpaper and it can hide more imperfections than plain paint. It's also fairly easy to hang up and take down, so you won't lose much if you change your mind about it later.


Home decor or upholstery fabric works best since it's heavy enough to keep its form when hung vertically, but otherwise, you can choose any pattern, color, or style you want.
Fold and press any raw edges to the raw side of the fabric, then stretch it out over your wall and staple it in place with a standard staple gun. Work from top to bottom for best results.
Alternatively, you can soak the material in fabric starch and stick it directly to the wall. When the starch dries, it should hold the fabric in place.
If you only want to add a fabric accent, consider covering appropriately sized foam boards with your material instead of placing the fabric directly on your wall. When finished, hang these covered boards over the area you want to hide.

, Tapestries might seems like a dated solution, but nowadays, you can find tapestries that are actually designed to fit into contemporary spaces.


Unlike plain fabric, tapestries are specially woven for the purpose of hanging, so the fibers and the design shouldn't lose integrity once you hang the piece on the wall.
Tapestries come in a variety of sizes, though, so you'll need to make sure that the one you buy is the right size for your wall space.

In some cases, you may be able to save money by buying a single large piece of lumber, or several large sheets, and then cutting these into planks.;
, This project will likely require a trip to a lumber yard or home improvement store, like Home Depot or Lowe's. There are many kinds of wood you might use for your planking, including Douglas Fir fence boards, ¼"" (.635 cm) plywood, or underlaminate.All things considered, you'll need:

Butter knife (optional; or putty knife
Caulk gun (and caulk)
Drop cloth (optional; recommended)
Hammer (or nail gun; with nails)
Jigsaw (optional; for cutting around accents and fixtures)
Level
Paint
Paintbrush (optional)
Pencil (for marking boards)
Primer (optional)
Rag (or paper towel)
Sandpaper (fine grit; 120 to 220 rating)
Saw (miter saw or table saw recommended)
Spacers (for planking, like pennies, nickels, or quarters)
Spackle (optional; for filling nail holes)
Tape measure
Wood planking, Remove any unnecessary furniture or household items from near or around the wall you'll be paneling with your planks. Lay down a drop cloth so it covers the floor leading up to the wall, and use a piece of painter's tape to secure the drop cloth to the floor. All parts of the floor should be covered. You should also:

Encourage ventilation with a fan in rooms that are small or have poor airflow. Not doing so could cause a buildup of toxic fumes from your paint, adhesives, caulk, and so on.Remove all electrical outlet covers, light switch plates, and hot/cold air vents with a screwdriver. Keep screws from these in a plastic baggie to prevent losing them.
Edge hardware that cannot be easily removed, like sconces, sills, and so on with painter's tape. For especially small or difficult to edge hardware, like outlets and switches, you may want to cover it completely with the tape., You'll likely have to cut boards to fit around protruding areas, like wall outlets and switches. Irregular angles will also have to be compensated for, and may require a special angled cut, like a sharply pitched ceiling would, for example.

These special cuts will be the most time consuming part of this job. Depending on your preference, you may find it most convenient to save these cuts for last.

, This step is optional, but if you don't plan on sealing gaps in your planking with caulk, people may be able see the original color of the wall through the gaps between planks. For this reason, a quick coat of primer and paint that is the same color your accent planking will be is recommended.

When painting, be sure you follow the label directions on your paint and primer. In many cases, you'll have to stir or mix the paint before using it.
When painting, do so from the top of the wall down and use long, overlapping strokes. This will prevent drips, runs, and unevenness in the paint.
Generally, a few thin coats of primer and paint create a more chip resistant, better looking finished product. However, since you'll be putting planking over this paint job, a cursory paint job should be sufficient., Either top corner is OK to begin with. Allow a small gap, about the width of a penny between the ceiling/wall, and the board. Use a level to ensure the board is level. In many cases, your ceiling may have a slight angle, so it should not be used as a guide, as it might make your planking look off level. Then, use your nail gun or a hammer and nails to attach the board in place.

If your ceiling is angled, you may want to start at the bottom of the wall. An angled ceiling will require you to cut the same angle into your planks.
You can panel your wall from the bottom-up, although there are often outlets and heating or cooling vents that you'll have to cut around toward the bottom of the wall. This can be time consuming. You may want to do the easier areas first., Depending on the length of your wall, you may have to use a few full planks. For shorter walls, one or two planks may be sufficient. If your wall only requires two planks, after attaching the first one:

Position your second plank the same as your first, but on he opposite side of the top row. Your unattached plank should overlap your attached one.
Use a pencil to mark the unattached plank ¼"" (.64 cm) before where the boards overlap. Use your saw to cut the board at this mark and sandpaper to remove burrs.
Position your plank in place so it is level and aligned with the attached one. Use a penny to ensure there is a 1/8"" (.32 cm) gap between planks, the ceiling, and the wall.
Double check the levelness of your unattached board, then use your nail gun or a hammer and nails to attach the plank to the wall.
Save the excess plank to start the next row. This way, you'll prevent yourself from wasting lumber., Add rows of planks to your wall, working from the top down. Be sure to remember to leave a penny-wide gap on all sides of the planks and their surroundings (other planks, the wall, ceiling, floor).

When a fixture or other feature of your house (like light switches, sconces, sills, sharply angled walls/ceilings, etc.) are in the path of your plank row, you'll have to cut away part of the plank so it fits the fixture or feature.Measure the placement and dimensions of features, then mark these on your plank where it will interfere with the feature. Use a saw to cut the marked area free to make room for the feature.
When cutting your planking to make space for features, you may want to use a jigsaw/reciprocating saw, which can be very efficient for making these kinds of cuts.
After every cut, use your sandpaper to remove roughness or burrs from the cut portions of your board so they have a well finished look., This is the part of the wall where you'll likely have vents and outlets to contend with. These will be handled in the same way as fixtures and features elsewhere on your wall. Measure the placement and dimensions of all vents, outlets, and so on. Then:

Mark the placement and dimensions on your plank. Use a saw (like a jigsaw/reciprocating saw) to cut away the plank where you've marked.
Fit the planks into place in their proper rows. Check that associated hardware (like wall plates or vent covers) will also be accommodated by your cut away sections.
Double check levelness, then use your nail gun or a hammer and nails to attach your plank to the wall. Do this until your final, bottom row is fully covered by planks., You may want to leave nail holes in your wall to give your planking a more rustic appearance, but for a more finished look, fill in these holes with spackle. If your nail holes are very small, you may want to take a hammer and lightly tap holes with it to create a small indentation where the hole is. Dip a putty knife into your spackle, then:

Pull the putty knife over the indentation so that the spackle fills the hole. Try to work some of the spackle deeply into the nail hole.
Drag your knife flat against the plank so that a flat, unblemished surface remains. Allow the spackle to dry completely according to its label instructions.
Lightly sand spackled areas with fine grit sandpaper (120 to 220 rating).Apply a second layer of spackle in the same fashion as the first., Insert your caulk into a caulk gun and apply it according to its directions. Generally, this involves cutting the tip off the applicator and pressing the applicator lever on the gun. Then, use your gun to fill in the gaps between planks and between planks and the ceiling/wall.

Caulking the gaps will give a more finished look to your wall. What's more, you can use a paint-able caulk, so when you paint the color of your accent planking uniform.
After caulk hardens, it retains some flexibility. This is great for you planking, which may warp or swell in humid weather. The caulk will flex with the planks, preventing them from popping free or coming loose., Many kinds of planking are very absorbent. By using two to three layers of primer, you'll not only have a more chip resistant finish, but you'll also use less paint over the course of this project, saving you money.Primer is also useful when you are trying to paint over a dark color, or colors that are vibrant, which can sometimes show through paint-only applications.
Use long, even, overlapping strokes when applying your primer to the planking. Prime from top to bottom to decrease the likelihood of drips and runs.
Once you are finished priming your first coat, touch up drips, runs, and puddling so the coat is even. Wait for the primer to dry, then add coats until you have at least two, but no more than five., Follow the directions on your paint for best results. In most cases, this will involve using a paint stirrer to mix the paint thoroughly and dipping a clean brush into it. Wipe excess paint on the inside lip of the can, then:

Apply the paint from the top row of planks down. Use long, even, overlapping strokes, much as you did for the primer.
When finished with your first coat, check for runs, drips, and puddling. Each coat should be even and smooth. Use your paint brush to touch up these spots.
Allow the paint to dry according to its label instructions, then apply coats until you have no less than two but no more than five coats total."

Prioritize pre-made shelving for easy installation.,
Re-purpose and upcycle suitable open shelves.,
Create a simple open shelf with pipe and wood.,
Have a woodworker or cabinetmaker create a unique shelf.,
Measure and mark the width of your shelves.,
Drill guide holes.,
Install wall anchors for shelves bearing heavy loads.,
Screw your open shelving into the wall.,
Re-check levelness and enjoy your open shelving.,
Position shelves in reachable locations.,
Include decorative display pieces alongside functional ones.,
Tell a story with your shelf space.",How to Create Open Shelving," You can buy pre-made open shelving at most general retailers, big box stores, and furniture stores. These kinds of shelves come in a variety of styles. You should choose the kind of the shelving most suitable for your home.


In most cases, pre-made open shelving consists of a plank or baseboard, brackets for securing the plank or baseboard in place, and screws to fasten the brackets and plank or baseboard into place.;
, Cupboards, for instance, can be very easily turned into open shelving. Remove the sides and front door of old cupboards to transform old cabinetry into an open shelf, though you may want to further anchor these to ensure the weight of the cabinet is well supported.


You can re-finish old planking from barns or old structures, anchor these into the wall, and use these as open shelving as well.

, You can create a simple frame with iron or steel pipe. Fit the pipe together in a rectangular shape by screwing the pipe together so it can accommodate a 2X4 plank of wood (or some other suitable piece of wood to use as the shelf base).When you've screwed together your piping frame, you should reinforce connecting pieces of pipe with zip-ties so it does not come loose over time.
After you've finished your pipe shelving, you can use simple hooks or wall hangers in the wall to support your shelf.
The metal used in making this shelf can be quite heavy. For this reason, you may want to install this shelf on studs.

, If you’re not the woodworking type, you may want to have a professional, like a cabinetmaker or woodworker, to come up with an open shelving design suitable for your home. You could even ask the woodworker to incorporate certain old pieces of furniture or woodwork.


An example of incorporating old pieces of furniture or woodwork might even include something like adding some molding to your open shelving that is commemorative of your first home.

, Your open shelving might have fasteners (like screws) or special anchors. You will likely be able to increase or decrease the fastener or anchor placement within a certain range. Choose a height for your shelf and at this height measure and mark all the fastener or anchor holes for your open shelf.


When you’ve drawn your anchor holes, take a carpenter’s level and hold it so its bottom is level with each of the anchor hole marks. If the bubble of the level is balanced in the middle of the gauge, the holes are level., By pre-drilling screw holes in the wall where your fastener or anchor hole marks have been drawn, you can make fastening your open shelving easier. Insert the appropriate drill bit into your drill and at each of the fastener or anchor hole marks, drill a guide hole with the drill bit.


Push and pull your drill into the wall with firm, moderate pressure while the drill bit is spinning to create a guide hole in the wall for your shelving.
After the hole has been drilled, there may be bits of sawdust or wood remaining in or around the guide hole. Use your fingers to brush this free from the hole.

, Wall anchors are plastic sheathes you can insert into the wall to further support your shelves. Once these are installed, you can fasten your shelf to the wall by sinking fasteners, like screws, through the shelf into the anchors. The materials you make your shelf out of and things you store on it will dictate whether or not your shelves require only fasteners or fasteners supported by anchors. For example:If your shelving is light and you intend on holding light items on it, like knickknacks and utensils, it isn’t likely your shelving will need any support beyond screws.
Moderately heavy to heavy shelving or shelving holding a heavy load, like heavy bottles of shampoo or light appliances, will likely need wall anchors to be properly supported.
Heavy shelves and shelves bearing heavy loads, like heavy packages of food/ingredients or weighty appliances, will likely need to be installed on studs, potentially with wall anchors, to ensure your shelving stays properly attached to the wall.

, Start with the guide hole at one end. Hold it up to its associated mark on the wall, and screw it into place. Do the same at the next hole. After installing the second anchor, use your carpenter’s level to check the levelness of your two anchors. If they aren’t level, adjust them until they are, and then continue fastening and checking levelness in this fashion., After all fasteners are in place, lay the baseboard of your open shelving into the shelf frame. Check that the baseboard is secure and stably in place. Then, take your carpenter’s level and check levelness one more time. If the shelf is not level, adjust it until it is. If it is level, your shelving is ready to enjoy.

, Shelves that are positioned up high can be excellent for decorative purposes, but these can be difficult to clean and to rotate in new decorations to. Keep shelves at or around eye level so you can fully utilize them and clean them without difficulty.You may be able to include half-sized shelves beneath cupboards, above or below windows, or on cabinet sites, even., Your open shelving doesn’t have to be display only. You can intersperse frequently used utensils and dishes with decorative pieces to make your kitchen look less utilitarian and more expressive of your personal taste and style.


Think about grouping together items that are similar, like similar function items (like spoon-shaped or cup-like items), similar colored items, or items from same sets., If you are a home decorator, open shelving might be the perfect place for you to weave a creative holiday tale. You can include Christmas scenes and villages, changing the details according to season so that your home tells a story with its open shelving décor.


You can display models or the finished work of your hobbies on your open shelving so conversation pieces are in open view.
Use your open shelving for easy access storage. Place frequently used items into mason jars or other suitable containers, then place it on your shelving for later use. "

However, different types of caulk have different strengths and weaknesses which can make some varieties more appropriate for certain jobs than others. For instance, latex caulk is a type of caulk which is great for indoor projects. It has a low odor, which is important when ventilation is limited. It also has great expansion properties, can be easily cleaned up with water, and even comes in a variety of colors. Finally, latex caulk can be painted when it's dry, allowing you to make it practically invisible.


However, latex caulk doesn't quite have the durability of other varieties, which can be a problem if it's exposed to widely-varying temperatures, severe weather, and heavy wear.;
, As you may expect from its name, acrylic latex caulk is a type of caulk that's made from latex combined with acrylic resins. This variety has all the strengths of latex caulk listed above. However, because of its acrylic properties, this caulk is more flexible and durable than ordinary latex caulk, making it a great choice for indoor situations in which it will be exposed to a high degree of wear and tear.

, The sturdiest variety of caulk, which uses a silicone base, can be a pain to apply, but is suitable for the harshest conditions. Silicone caulk's toughness makes it great for situations in which it is exposed to widely-ranging temperatures, harsh weather conditions, and heavy wear. For durable all-weather protection, silicone chalk has no substitute.


However, silicone caulk has several disadvantages. It can't be painted, which means you may be stuck with its default clear appearance. It also is difficult to clean up with water, making spills and drips during the application process into serious headaches. Finally, it has a strong odor before drying, which makes good ventilation a must when applying the caulk.

, Though it may seem like combining different varieties of caulk, like acrylic latex and silicone, for instance, might give you the strengths of each, in fact, doing so will simply give you a caulk that won't do its job. Each variety of caulk is specially formulated to work on its own. Mixing one type of caulk with another can leave you with a substance that may not bind to your surfaces, set, or provide proper protection. For baseboard caulking, where protection against water damage is a serious concern, you'll always want to use only one type of caulk at a time.

, If you're tackling a relatively small, simple project, like, for instance, caulking your baseboards at the point that they meet a bathtub, you can usually get away with buying and using small ""tubes"" of caulk which allow you to squeeze caulk out like toothpaste for easy application. For larger projects, you'll want to use a caulking gun and compatible caulking cartridges, which are much quicker. Though it can take some time to get used to them, they're ultimately the more efficient option for large jobs.


Most caulking guns are quite cheap, costing around $10-$20 or less.

, Caulk is tremendously sticky stuff — it's liable to bind to any ""loose"" object it touches. Because of this, it's very important to ensure that both your wall and your baseboard are clean before caulking. Dirt, dust, grease, and grime can mix with or stick to your caulk and make it look unappealing. More importantly, however, they can interfere with the ability of the caulk to bind to the surfaces you do want it to stick to. Since one of the uses of baseboard caulking is to prevent water damage, a tight seal is a must.


Use water or a household cleaner like Formula 409 to give your floor, baseboard, and wall a thorough cleaning. Try not to use soap with water, as this combination can leave a slick film on your surfaces, making it difficult for your caulk to stick.
For floors that have accumulated lots of dust, vacuuming is one additional quick, efficient cleaning option. If you have the option, try using your vacuum's long, skinny ""hard-to-reach-places"" attachment to remove dust from corners.

, While caulking is by no means a dangerous process, it is one that can be frustrating if you are forced to re-do work you've already done. To minimize the risk of avoidable mistakes, ensure that your work area is completely clear of furniture, rugs, and other potential obstructions before beginning. If you have children or pets, you'll also want to make sure they're kept out of your work area by setting up barriers or getting another person to monitor them. Nothing's worse than stopping your project to clean caulk out of a screaming toddler's hair.

, When you caulk your baseboards, mistakes are inevitable. If it's your very first time, they'll be common. Luckily, when it comes to caulking, it's hard to make serious mistakes. For the vast majority of the errors you'll make, the old-fashioned combination of water and rags will suffice, though many household cleaners will also work well.


Additionally, since you'll be on your hands and knees for most of the caulking process, rags can be used as knee pads to provide comfort.
Note that, as will be explained below, water alone is ineffective for cleaning up silicone-based caulks.

, Perhaps the single most important thing you can do to ensure an easy, efficient caulking process is to lay down tape with great care. Taping beforehand allows you to protect against spills and ensures that your caulking job is smooth, clean, and uniform. No special tapes are required. Simply use ordinary masking tape (also called painter's tape), a thin, papery variety of tape which is usually tan or blue.


You'll want to lay two strips of tape along each area to be caulked. One should be on the floor, following along the length of the baseboard and almost touching it. The other should be on the wall roughly 1/16th of an inch above it, running parallel to it.
A single, long length of tape is usually the easiest option in the long run, but using multiple manageable lengths is perfectly fine so long as they are all parallel to the the baseboard and aligned with each other.

, Caulking guns use specially-designed cartridges to dispense caulk. These look like long cylindrical tubes with a skinny pointed cone or ""nose"" at one end. Before loading your cartridge, take a knife or a sharp pair of scissors and trim off the very end of this ""nose"" at about a 45 degree angle to create a small, slanted hole. This hole should be only about 1/8th of an inch in diameter — about the width of a matchstick.


Try to cut your cartridge's tip as conservatively as possible. It's easy to make a small hole bigger, but impossible to make a large hole smaller.

, Next, use the gun's piercing rod (which is usually a stiff piece of wire attached to the gun) to poke a few holes in the cartridge's membrane through the hole you just cut in the tip. This allows caulk to flow easily out of the cartridge. The more holes you poke, the more easily the caulk will flow. About 4-5 holes is usually sufficient.


Note that some plastic cartridges don't have an internal membrane. If you don't feel any resistance when using the piercing rod, you'll know this is the case.

, Most caulking guns can be loaded via the following steps:


Push the spring-loaded lever on the gun and hold it down.
Pull the rod at rear of the gun (the ""pushrod"") all the way back while holding the lever down.
Insert the cartridge into its slot butt-first, then drop the cartridge's point down into the space in the front of the gun.
Make sure the angle of the cut in the point is facing downwards. You may need to turn the cartridge to do this.
Finally, twist the pushrod so the notches are facing downward. Pull the trigger a few times until you feel resistance. You're now ready to caulk!

, To practice, spread out a large piece of newspaper on the floor and hold the point of your caulking gun against it. Pull lightly on the trigger until caulk begins to flow out of the nozzle. When caulk begins to flow out of the gun, move it slowly back while keeping constant pressure on the trigger. Try to make a long, thin, consistent line of caulk without any gaps or thick spots. When you're done, lift the nozzle from the work surface, then twist the pushrod so the notches are in the ""up"" position and depress the spring-loaded lever. This releases the pressure on the cartridge and stops the flow of caulk.


Don't squeeze too hard when you're applying caulk — this can rupture the cartridge, causing a mess and forcing you to start over.

, When you're ready to caulk for real, hold the tip of your caulking gun against the space where the wall and the top of the baseboard meet. Keep the hole in the tip flat against the wall (this means you should hold the gun diagonally. Turn the notches in the pushrod downward. Squeeze on the trigger with steady pressure and begin moving the caulk gun along the length of the baseboard as the caulk flows out. Move at a slow, even pace. Continue along the entire length of the baseboard. Treat any spills with a damp rag.


Don't forget to repeat the process outlined in the practice step for stopping the flow of caulk when you're done with your run.

, When you've caulked one edge of your baseboard, you'll want to smooth the caulk with your finger to ensure the caulk sits in its gap as securely as possible and also to ensure that the caulk has a uniform, smooth appearance. Drag the tip of one finger along the caulk lightly a few feet at a time. As soon as a significant amount of caulk accumulates on your finger, wipe it off with a clean, damp rag. Treat any spills with a separate damp rag.


Don't smooth with too much force. Apply only gentle pressure with your finger. Pressing too hard can scrape the caulk from the wall entirely.

, Next, repeat the caulking process for the bottom length of the baseboard. Keep firm but steady pressure on the trigger of the caulking gun to dispense caulk along the bottom edge of the baseboard. Caulking the bottoms of the baseboards after you've finished smoothing the caulk on the top of the baseboard ensures that leftover caulk from the top won't spill onto your work below.


When finished, smooth over the caulk with your finger as described above.

, When you've caulked and smoothed both edges of a length of baseboard to your satisfaction, it's time to pull your tape up. Be sure to do this while the caulk is still fresh. If the caulk dries before you pull up the tape, you'll end up pulling the caulk from the baseboard along with the tape and will have to repeat your work. Grab one end of your length of tape and pull it gently away from the surface at a forty five degree angle. Proceed slowly and delicately along the entire length of tape. Repeat for the second length of tape.


If you used multiple lengths of tape for a single surface, pull the tape from the wall in the same direction that you laid it. For instance, if you laid three overlapping pieces of tape from left to right, pull the tape from left to right as well.
Handle the tape with care — the leftover caulk can stick to (and stain) clothing with ease.

, For the most part, caulking isn't a terribly dangerous activity. You're unlikely to endanger yourself or others while caulking. This being said, there are things you can do to improve your (already very good) chances of finishing your caulking job unscathed. The first is to ensure that your work area is properly ventilated. Setting up a fan and/or opening windows improves the flow of air through your work area, which can disperse the odor and fumes that wet caulk can give off. This is especially important for silicone-based caulk, which has the strongest odor.


If you're working outside, you don't usually need to worry about this.

, Caulk isn't dangerous or caustic like certain substances used for other home improvement projects — its very purpose is essentially to be as inert as possible. However, it is very sticky and hard to remove from skin and clothing (especially once it dries), so you may want to wear gloves when you work with caulk to keep it off of your fingers and sleeves. This also gives the benefit of making clean-up very quick and easy.


You may also want to wear goggles or protective eyewear, as caulk can be painful if splashed into the eyes (though this is unlikely).

, The one time that you're most likely to hurt yourself while caulking is, ironically, before you're using caulk. As you cut the tip off of your caulk cartridge, take caution to ensure you don't cut yourself. If you're using a knife, be sure to hold the cartridge with your other hand away from the tip. Always cut away from your body — never towards it. When you're not using your knife or scissors, store it safely away from your work area.

, Finally, it bears mentioning that, although caulk is fairly harmless, it is not meant to be consumed or inhaled and can cause serious health problems if it is. If you or someone you know accidentally consumes caulk, call a poison control center immediately for guidance.


Be sure to wash your hands after caulking to ensure you don't accidentally consume caulk while eating, drinking, coughing, and so on.

, When you've caulked your baseboard and pulled your tape, all that's left to do is to allow it dry. Different types of caulk will have different drying times, so check your caulk's packaging for more information. Regardless of the amount of time it takes your caulk to dry, you'll want to ensure that no dirt or dust disturb it as it sets. You'll also want to ensure that young children and pets are kept away from the caulk as well.

, When it comes to caulking, minor errors are all too common. Usually, fixing these errors by hand before the caulk sets by using your fingers is simpler and easier than fixing the errors after the caulk dries. To do this, just repeat the smoothing process with your finger, using extra caulk as needed. If you notice an error after your caulk has dried, re-apply tape to the offending area, apply caulk to your finger, and work it into the crack or gap until it's well-blended with the surrounding dry caulk. When your caulk dries, the repair should be barely-visible.


If you used a caulking gun for your main job but have a small caulk tube handy, you may find that it's much easier to use the tube for touch-up work than to have to assemble a caulk gun again, dispense caulk, and potentially clean up spills. Just be sure to use the same type of caulk as you used for the main job!
As always, remember to remove the tape while the caulk is still fresh.

, Congratulations! You're done. All that's left to do is to return your work area to the way it was before you began. Release the pressure on your caulking gun and remove the cartridge. Most cartridges come with a cap to preserve the leftover caulk. If yours does not, try using plastic wrap and a rubber band or tape. Wash your hands and your equipment with soap, water, and a washcloth. Remove any garbage or debris and replace any furniture, rugs, etc. you moved.


When using leftover caulk at a later date, note that you may need to use a nail or tack to remove dried caulk from the nozzle of the cartridge.

, In general, caulking is a fairly cheap and easy home improvement project. However, it has its limitations. Caulk is useful for sealing small, thin gaps between baseboards and the floor or wall. It's not, however, appropriate for protecting the baseboard itself, which must be painted to provide protection from water damage and wear and tear. Additionally, while baseboard caulking is great for making the bottom edges of a room water-tight, it provides little protection against large sources of water damage, like burst pipes, leaky ceilings or walls, and so on. Thus, baseboard caulking is best used as just one part of a more extensive plan for water-proofing a room which should also include painting, finishing, tiling, and more.


It's also worth noting that baseboards should not be caulked when the floor or wall is unfinished wood. In this situation, caulk provides little protection from water and cannot form a tight seal against the surface it is applied to.

, The time that it will take to caulk varies based on the size of your project as well as how long it takes you to become familiar with your tools. Most one-room jobs can be completed within an hour or two, while longer jobs can take days. Regardless of the size of your job, you won't want to rush, so leave yourself more time than you think you'll need. A thorough caulking job can take lots of time in the short term, but mistakes in your caulking that can result from rushing can cost you more time in the long run.

, Generally, caulking is quite cheap. Caulking guns retail from about $5-$10 for cheap options up to about $20 for the highest-quality options. Cartridges of caulk usually cost no more than $5. In addition to these things, you may need to buy masking tape, a knife or scissors, and gloves. All in all, you usually won't need to spend more than $30-$40. If you own some of these materials already, your costs will be lower.


Your costs will vary based on how many cartridges of caulk you need to buy. As a point of reference, for a 10 x 10 foot bathroom, you'll need about 1 or 2 cartridges. It's usually smart to buy a little more caulk than you think you'll need — you can always save this left-over caulk for later.

Grab the trowel.,
Cut a section of mortar.,
Turn the mortar.,
Slide the trowel beneath the mortar.,
Flick your wrist downward.,
Grab the brick.,
Slice the mortar onto one end.,
Squeeze the mortar into the center.,
Place the brick on the bed.,
Push the brick against its predecessor.,
Scrape away the excess.,
Tap on the placed bricks.",How to Butter a Brick," Grab the trowel handle with your dominant hand. Your fingers should curl around the width of the handle, but your thumb should be extended along the length.


Holding the trowel in this manner will give you greater control over it. Your wrapped fingers should keep the trowel sturdy and secure in your hands, and your extended thumb should make it easier to control the direction you move the trowel.
Make sure that you maintain a firm grip on the trowel throughout the entire process.;
, Using the side of the trowel head, cut away a portion of mortar from a larger pile of previously mixed mortar. Drag this portion away from the primary pile and toward you.


Note that the mortar should already be prepared and sitting in a large pile on your mortar board. Use freshly prepared mortar that is still wet and easy to shape.
The portion you cut away should be from the edge of the pile. Make sure that you remove enough mortar to cover the length and width of the trowel head, if not a little more.
Drag this portion roughly 6 inches (15 cm) away from the primary pile so that you won't accidentally mix it back in as you work.

, Turn the cut portion of mortar several times using the trowel. After a few turns, the mortar should take on a smooth texture and paste-like consistency.Once the texture seems correct, use the trowel to shape the portion of mortar so that it roughly matches the length and width of the trowel head.

, Slide the edge of the trowel beneath the portion of mortar, lifting it onto the flat face of the trowel head.


It should be easy to slip the mortar onto the trowel, especially after turning it over several times on the mortar board. If the mortar sticks to the board and does not slip over the trowel, it might be too wet to use.

, While holding the trowel horizontally with the mortar side facing up, flick your wrist and the trowel downward with a quick snap before stopping abruptly.Keep a firm grip on the trowel as you flick your wrist. The mortar on your trowel should slightly flatten out over the head once you stop the motion.
The force used to snap your wrist adheres the mortar to the trowel. When done correctly, you should be able to invert the trowel upside-down, and the mortar should still remain securely in place. If you do not perform this step, the mortar will slide off as soon as you turn the trowel on its side.
Alternatively, you can usually create enough suction to keep the mortar on the trowel if you tap the bottom of the trowel head against the mortar board. This is a good option to use if you are unable to support the trowel well enough to flick your wrist., Pick up the brick you want to butter using your non-dominant hand. Tip the brick downward at an approximate 45-degree angle.


The end you plan to butter should be tilted slightly upward.
Note that you will only apply mortar to one end of the brick. Do not butter both ends.

, Invert the head of the trowel and slap the mortar onto one end of the brick using a downward motion.Turn the trowel so that the mortar-side faces the end of the brick and sits at a nearly parallel angle.
Starting from the top of the brick, slide the loaded trowel down the end, scraping the mortar off the trowel head and onto the brick end.

, Use the tip of the trowel to press the glob of mortar inward toward the center of the brick end.


Scrape around the perimeter of the brick end, as well, to remove any excess mortar from the sides. Try to keep the entire portion of mortar positioned directly over the end of the brick.
When done correctly, the mortar should roughly form a four-sided pyramid on the end of the brick.
Don't worry if the amount of mortar looks like a lot. Buttering the brick with excess mortar is actually a good thing because it ensures a tight, secure seal when you join the brick. The excess mortar is also easy to remove after you've set the brick, so it should not cause any problems later on.

, Set the buttered brick down onto a prepared bed of mortar. The buttered end should face the brick previously set on the bed.


If using frogged (indented) or perforated bricks, the frogged or perforated side of each brick should face up when you set it.
Note that the first brick in any row will not be buttered. Only subsequent bricks are buttered within each row.
Also not that there should be a layer of mortar on top of the foundation or the previous row of bricks. The bottom of your buttered brick will need to be set into this previously applied mortar.
Place the brick onto the mortar bed so that the buttered end is directly next to the end of the preceding brick. Try to get the brick as close as possible without scraping off any of the mortar.

, Shift your hand to the non-buttered end of the brick, then push the brick inward toward the end of the preceding brick.


Continue pushing until the buttered mortar smashes against the side of the other brick. The mortar should push out at the joining side and top of the joint.
When done, the mortar joint should be about 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) thick., Slide the edge of the trowel head along the bottom and end joints of the newly set brick. Use the excess mortar to butter the next brick. If you prepared the right amount of mortar when buttering the first brick, you should have enough to butter three standard bricks before you'll need to load the trowel with additional mortar.
You shouldn't need to snap the excess mortar onto the trowel. The pressure used in scraping the excess mortar onto the trowel should be enough to securely adhere it.
Any excess mortar you scrape away after setting the last brick of a row should be slapped over the end joints of subsequent bricks. Use the back and edge of the trowel head to smooth the excess into those joints and onto the tops of the bricks.

, After setting each brick, tap on sides and top of the brick with the end of the trowel handle to help settle the brick in place.


This action should also help level the bricks.
Note that the first brick of the row should be leveled before you butter and join the second brick. Likewise, you should level each brick after you set it and before you join any subsequent bricks.
Use a torpedo level or similar tool to make sure that each brick is level with the one before it. Both the tops and sides of the brick must be checked.

Decide on the size of brick column you would like to build, this will help you calculate the amount of materials necessary to execute your plan.,
Wet the bricks a couple hours before beginning the construction of the column.,
Outline a 12 inch x 12 inch (30.48 cm x 30.48 cm) blueprint of your column on the ground where the base of the brick column will be located and, if applicable, where the top of the column will end up on the ceiling of your patio or entryway.,
Attach a string line from the base of the column outline to the top of the column outline where one of the corners of the brick column will lie.,
Slather a thin layer of mortar for the base of the column, smoothing it out using a screed.,
Lay 4 bricks in a square design, leaving 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) spacing between each brick.,
Fill each joint between the bricks with mortar.

,
Slather another 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) layer of mortar on top of the first brick course to create a top joint.

,
Repeat the previous 3 steps for 37 courses (or layers) to create a 7 foot (2.13 m) tall 12 inch x 12 inch (30.48 cm x 30.48 cm) brick column.

,
Concave all of the joints every 2 to 3 layers using a concave joint tool.,
Brush the mortar with a light whisk brush to smooth out the mortar after concaving.

",How to Build Brick Columns,"


A 12 inch x 12 inch (30.48 cm x 30.48 cm) column will require 4 bricks per layer.
A 16 inch x 16 inch (40.64 cm x 40.64 cm) column will require 6 bricks per layer.
If you want to create anything bigger, for example a 32 inch x 32 inch (76.2 cm x 76.2 cm) column, you will have to create a 24 inch x 24 inch (60.96 cm x 60.96 cm) block column for support and wrap it with a 32 inch x 32 inch (76.2 cm x 76.2 cm) brick surface to guarantee a sturdy post.
Measurements below are for a 7 foot (2.13 m) tall, 12 inch x 12 inch (30.48 cm x 30.48 cm) brick column.;
, This will prevent the bricks from soaking up too much mortar.

,


If you are building around a metal rod, the rod will become the center of your column.
If you are creating more than 1 column, outline the first and last columns of the series and space the outlines of the remaining columns in between the first and last column outlines for accurate spacing.

, This will serve as your marker to make sure the bricks are being lined and spaced precisely; the corner of each brick should line up to the string line to ensure a straight construction. This method will prove difficult when first lining up the edges of the bricks, but it will save a significant amount of time as opposed to using a level after each layer (or course) of brick laid.

, A screed is an aluminum device used to flatten out and smooth wet, pasty materials.

, This spacing is called a joint.

,,,, This secures the mortar into place and allows proper water runoff from snow, rain, and other elements. Do not allow the mortar to get so dry that it is no longer moldable.

Consult your local construction codes when designing your chimney.,
Decide what material the chimney will be made of.,
Determine what waste products the chimney is going to vent.,
Determine the width of the chimney flue.,
Buy all supplies needed for building your chimney.,
Build the smoke chamber.,
Construct the flue and outside of chimney.,
Surround the chimney with flashing where it goes through any walls.,
Cap the chimney.",How to Build a Chimney," While each community has its own codes for building chimneys, most codes are based on the National Fire Protection Agencies 211 standard. Go to the NFPA website to review national fire code associated with chimneys. The code is available online for free.This code should guide all aspects of the function of your chimney.


Two general requirements of the 211 standard are that chimneys be at least 3 feet (90 centimeters) taller than the highest point where it goes through the roof of a single structure and 2 feet (60 centimeters) taller than any portion of the building or any adjacent building within 10 feet (3 meters) of the chimney. The taller the chimney, the better it drafts.
A chimney also needs at least a 2-inch (5-centimeter) clearance from combustible material if it is built in or through the walls of a house and a 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) clearance if built alongside the house.;
, The most common material for a chimney is brick or masonry, but prefabricated metal chimneys are also widely available. If building a masonry or brick chimney, you will need to figure out how big it will be to estimate how many bricks to order. If using a prefab metal chimney, you will need to measure the distance from your stove, or other appliance, to the location where it is exiting the house.


Masonry chimneys are usually required to have walls at least 4-inches (10-centimeters) thick.Standard chimney bricks should come in this thickness.

, This will determine whether your chimney can vent multiple appliances or if it will vent only one.


It is possible to build chimneys for several appliances and connect them to a main discharge flue, sized to handle the combined output, provided the subordinate flues for the individual chimneys are not angled more than 30 degrees off vertical and they vent the same type of by-product. In other words, a chimney for a gas range can be combined with one for a gas furnace, but not a wood-burning fireplace.
Flues also must not change in shape or size within 6 inches (15 centimeters) above or below a floor, ceiling or roof made of combustible materials.

, This is mostly determined by what appliance(s) the chimney is built to vent. Metal chimneys are usually round flue pipes, while masonry chimneys usually have square or rectangular flues. Each type has different diameter requirements depending on what they are venting. Consult local and national fire code to determine the diameter you should use.Masonry chimneys are typically lined with a clay or ceramic tile flue, which goes up the center of the brick chimney with a gap between the outside brick and the inside flue, so that the ceramic or clay flue is able to expand and contract without moving the brick. However, stainless steel pipe or concrete may also be used in some cases, depending on what the chimney is designed to vent.
Look at local building code to determine the size flue that is required for the appliance you are venting. These differ, so make sure to check for your specific need.

, While this will vary a bit, depending on the type and location of your chimney, you should have all supplies on hand when starting your project.

When installing a metal chimney you will need flashing, prefab chimney box, chimney cap, prefab chimney sections, and chimney roof braces. When passing through a wall or ceiling, you should use a section of chimney that is rated as a wall pass through, so that there is no risk of your wall or roof catching on fire.
When building a masonry chimney you will need to buy the brick and masonry, mortar, support pieces (such as rebar), flashing, a cap, and specialty masonry tools.

, You will need to start building your chimney from the ground up. For a masonry chimney, this usually means that you will be building your chimney right off the top of a fireplace (if the chimney is designed to vent a fireplace), using a brick that is similar to that used to build the hearth.


You will need to mix your mortar mix with water, making it the consistency of thick peanut butter. Once it is the right consistency, you will use a mason's trowel to load mortar onto each brick before you set it in place. You need to put enough mortar on each brick so that it oozes out the joints a bit, which guarantees that the entire area between the bricks is filled with mortar.
As you build up the walls of the chimney with bricks, make sure that it is level on all planes. Take a level and check that all walls are level on their vertical and horizontal planes, and that in each line of bricks all the bricks are lined up with the other.
For a prefabricated metal fireplace, the smoke chamber is almost indistinguishable from the rest of the chimney.
The chimney should be built on a very solid base. If you are not building on an existing fireplace or base, you may need to pour a reinforced concrete pad for the chimney to be built upon. Consult local code to determine if it is required and what specifications it should be built to.

, The flue connects the top of the smoke chamber to the roof through the middle of the chimney. As noted in the previous section, it may be made of either brick or metal pipe. If clay or ceramic tiles are used to create the flue in a brick chimney, they are laid as the exterior of the chimney is put up.


Metal liners can be dropped into place, while concrete liners are cast in place by pouring concrete through a flexible hose. For more information on how to install a chimney liner see: How to Install a Chimney Liner.

, You'll want to put metal flashing around the chimney in 2 places: around the chimney where it meets the roof and as a lining underneath the chimney cap. Use a waterproof silicone caulk or polyurethane caulk underneath the flashing to keep water from leaking into the house around the chimney., The chimney cap goes over the top of the brick flue housing. It should extend past the chimney wall by at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) and have a drip edge to channel water away from the chimney. Recommended chimney cap materials include stone and concrete either pre-cast or cast in place.


For more information on how to cap a chimney see: How to Cap a Chimney.
A chimney cap is important because it will reduce the amount of moisture that can get down your chimney, keep out animals, block downdrafts, stop sparks from leaving your chimney and also block debris, like leaves and branches, from going down your chimney."

Dig a perimeter trench along the boundaries of your proposed building.,
Set in the largest stones first.,
Pack it tight.,
Cover with gravel, and tamp.,
Lay any pipe or conduit down and pack around it with stone.,
Put in the stem wall of your choice, to keep your building high off the ground.",How to Build a Stone Foundation," The trench should be about 1.5' wide, and deep enough so that it's below the frostline. Use a pick/mattock to break up the soil, and a transfer shovel to shovel it out. The soil can be used as fill to build up the grade within the foundation, or outside it to slope the land down and away from the dwelling. When the trench depth is roughed out, use a square-ended shovel to scrape the bottom, so that the floor of the trench remains packed and undisturbed.;
, If you have boulders, or something like these hardened Quikrete bags to use, lay them in the bottom of the trench like this:


Continue to set in the largest stones you can lift and fit in the trench. The stone should get progressively smaller as you fill towards the top.

, Everything should fit like a puzzle - pound rocks in with a hammer where you need to. Urbanite can also be used, and torn up asphalt sections from roads. If you're using old concrete block, break it up into flat pieces with a hammer.

, Make sure to swish the gravel around with your hands into all the crevices in your rubble.

, For good measure, lay an extra water line, and both 2"" to 3"" greywater and 4"" blackwater pipe, just in case you want to tie into them at some point.

, If you want to continue in the same low-cost, green, site-harvested, ultra-durable tradition, do an earthbag stem wall. This is rows of polypro seed bags filled with either dirt or rock, with strips of barbed wire run between each row for tensile strength. In the standard earthbag stem wall the bottommost rows are composed of bags of tamped aggregate (sand, gravel, rock, etc.), and the rows above are filled with a stabilized earth mix - your dirt mixed with either cement or lime, and allowed to cure until it hardens into rock. The stem wall when finished is covered in chicken wire and plastered for lateral strength and to protect the polypro bags. Earthbags are wide and make excellent stem walls for alternative building systems such as cordwood masonry and straw bale - as well as walls of earthbags themselves!

",How to Build a Gable Roof," The top plates should consist of 2 boards of sufficient width to cover the tops of the walls.;
, You will attached these to each pair of rafters so they resist the outward pressure of the rafters on the walls. Install the ceiling joists onto the top plates so they span the structure from one long wall to the other.

, The ridge board forms the peak of the roof. It's parallel to, and as long as, the longer walls of the structure.

, This gives you something to stand on while you assemble the roof. Later you can move these planks to the outside of the roof.

, You want the slope to be between 25 and 45 degrees.


You can use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the roof's slope and length of the rafter boards if you know the distance from the ridge board to the outside wall and the rise of the roof.
If you don't want to do the math for the rafters, you can buy a copy of The Roof Framer's Bible, which contains tables that will tell you how long they should be.

, The rafters will be attached to the ridge board at intervals of 16 to 24 inches (41 to 61 cm) and sit on top of the walls. The length of the rafters depends on the rise (height) of the roof and how far past the walls you want the rafters to extend.


Use a miter box or miter saw to cut the rafter boards so you can attach them to the ridge board at the correct angle.
Create a triangular notch in the rafters at the place where they will rest on the top of the walls.
Miter the tail end (the end that extends past the wall) so the rafters will come to a point.

, You will attach this to the rafter boards near the peak of the roof on the inside, stabilizing the rafters. It's not necessary to miter cut the collar ties.

, Make sure as you do so that the top plates of the walls fit well into the notches in the rafters. To do this best, get a helper and use and temporary braces.

,, Leave room to install vents so warm air can escape from the roof and help keep the structure cool.

, Begin at the bottom and overlap the sheets. Cover the ridge board with an extra sheet.

, Begin at the bottom and overlap your rows. You also need to offset the rows so the edges of the shingles are centered on the shingles above and below them.

Fix cracked or split shingles instead of replacing them.",How to Replace Damaged Roof Shingles," Any time you're getting up on the roof you need to practice roof safety. Wear protective eyewear, heavy-duty gloves, and gripping boots appropriate for walking on the roof. Preferably, you'll also install roof jacks to have something to stand on, and harnesses to protect yourself. Never do roof work alone.


How you access the roof will depend upon the roof itself and the location of the damage. Always use a secure, sturdy ladder when you're climbing up on the roof, and have a helper to secure it at the base. When walking on the roof, always walk slowly and secure your footing before taking another step.
If you're just trying to assess the damage and replace a few damaged shingles, it might seem like overkill to install roof jacks and harnesses, but depending on the complexity and the height of your roof, it might be the safest option. Roof work isn't something to rush.;
, Find the damaged area of shingles and determine how many new shingles you'll need and the extent of the damage underneath. Look at the corners on the shingles surrounding the damage. Are they curled and pulled up from the roof?


Check the damaged area for damage to the moisture barrier or flashing, and check the damaged area for signs of seepage. If the surrounding shingles aren't doing the work of keeping moisture out, you'll need to replace everything in the square around the damaged area.In some cases, it might be better to remove all the shingles from a roof in urgent need of repairs and re-roof the house instead. If the shingles in the area surrounding the damage are old, brittle, and dry, it’s probably not worth taking the care to re-secure them to the roof.
Cracked or split shingles may be repaired without removing them, provided they're still in good condition. You can learn more about securing the shingles in the following section.

, Asphalt and asphalt sealant will heat up in hot weather, making it moldable and much more difficult to remove. It's a lot easier to remove shingles that are cooled down and slightly more brittle than the moldable, so do the work of removing them first thing in the morning, before the sun has beaten down upon them considerably.


Wet shingles to cool them down before removal, if you must work in the heat. Wetting them down with a small amount of water will help them to tighten and firm up, making them much easier to remove, if necessary.

, Removing all the shingles on the roof is usually done with a large hayfork , or rake-sized scraper used for removing shingles. Since you're only removing a portion of shingles, though, it's usually better to use a smaller tool. A pry bar, crow-bar, or the claw of a hammer works perfectly at getting under and carefully prying up shingles, separating the adhesive and revealing the nails of the shingles underneath.


A good rule of thumb is to remove at least five tabs in the second row above the damaged ""3-tab"" shingle. Pull up enough shingles to reveal the nails of all the damaged shingles that need removed below.
The end seams should be lined-up about a foot off to one side of the damaged one. In other words, you'll want to make sure that you pull off shingles in a radius around the damaged portion, to make sure you get everything.

, Slide your flat pry-bar under the shingles around the damaged portion. Work around the nail, pulling it up. Carefully lift each surrounding tab about 45 to 60 degrees. Go very slowly, but pry firmly, and try not to crack or break them. If the surrounding shingles are in good shape, you can reattach them when you're finished replacing the damaged shingles, saving you money and effort.

, Work your way progressively closer to the damage. Lift the tabs in the first row above the damaged shingle and withdraw the loosened nails from that shingle with the pry-bar by using the same process.

, Loosen the adhesive underneath the tabs of the damaged shingle, then pull them free and discard. If the shingles are severely damaged, don't try to salvage them. Just remove them and replace them with new shingles of a similar style to the rest of the shingles on the roof.


Continue removing the damaged shingles until you've cleared out the shingles that will need replaced. It'll be easier to remove everything before you get started replacing them.

, To replace shingles, you'll obviously need shingles to replace the ones you remove and the materials necessary to secure. Most shingles that are in need of replacement are three-tab asphalt shingles. If your roof involves some other variety of shingle, you'll need to match your new shingles to the old. To complete the job properly, you'll need:


Replacement shingles. Buy more than you'll need at the home repair store. You should be able to count up how many damaged shingles will need replacement and buy accordingly. It's good to have replacements on hand.
Shingle cement or adhesive. Some shingles come with adhesive strips pre-installed, making this unnecessary. If you buy unbacked shingles, though, you might need to purchase additional adhesive to secure them to the roof before nailing them. It's a good idea to buy it to secure other loose shingles anyway.
Roofing nails. Most three-tab shingles will be pre-cut with guide holes that will make the installation process very simple. To secure them, you'll need roofing nails, which are heavy-duty, and about two or three inches long.

, Place a new shingle in the same position as the shingle you removed. If the shingles are backed with adhesive strip, remove the covering and push them into place, then nail them to secure them. Most shingles have pre-cut holes for nails, usually three per shingle. Follow the directions of the shingles that you purchase, or use the other shingles on the roof as a guide.

, Lift each tab slightly on the shingles as you install them, and apply a 1"" (2.5 cm) diameter spot of shingle cement under each tab. Press tabs down into the cement firmly and secure the shingle into place. Continue installing shingles and securing them with adhesive accordingly, until you've installed all the damaged shingles along the row.


After you've finished the damage portion, you can start working your way back up the roof, retailing the loose shingles into place, as long as they're in good shape, and using the adhesive to secure them back onto the roof.

, While you're up there working, it's a good idea to keep an eye out for other areas that look like they may become problematic in the future. Keep an eye out for curled or weathered-looking shingles that might allow water to seep in underneath. Using your adhesive, lift the tabs gently and re-secure them.


Shingles become damaged when water gets in underneath and starts rotting from beneath. If you rescuer loose or weathered shingles on a regular basis, you'll get a considerable amount more life out of them. Regular touch-ups can extend the life of a roof immensely.

, If shingles become cracked or otherwise split, because of falling branches or other types of damage, consider using adhesive to repair them as best you can, instead of removing them completely. Line the crack with a liberal amount of adhesive and stick it back together to repair it. Hold it in place for several seconds and let it seal.</ref>


Shingles will always need remove when they're brittle, curled, and difficult to pin back down. If the shingle is crumbling as you work on it, that's a sign that the shingle, most of the shingles in that area, and possibly the rest of the roof may need redone."

Multiply those numbers to find the square footage that you need to buy. Also measure the edges and corners, as these require different stones than the flat surface.The majority of the area will be covered in flat stones. You may also want corner stones or edge stones. Flat stones are cut smooth on both ends to fit tightly together. Edge stones have a rough edge on one side for placement where they’ll be seen on the end of a wall.
Airstone is sold in eight square foot packs of flat stones, six linear foot packs of corner stones, and seven and one half square foot packs of edge stones.
Airstone offers a calculator to assist you in determining how much stone to buy. Use the calculator at http://airstone.com/installation/.;
, AirStone adheres best with adhesive that is specifically designed for it. For interior walls, use AirStone Interior Adhesive. This comes in a bucket that covers 30 square feet of wall. Outdoor AirStone projects should use a tub of Loctite construction adhesive, which covers 10 square feet.


If you prefer to use some other adhesive besides the one designed for AirStone, you are free to do so, but the result may not be what you want.

, Airstone currently offers three colors of stone, which are Autumn Mountain (tan), Birch Bluff (white), and Spring Creek (grey). These collections include stones in a range of colors, so be aware that every stone is not the exact same color.Since the stones in each color palette include a range of shades, you have a lot of flexibility to match them up with the other colors in the space.

, AirStone can currently only be purchased in the U.S. at Lowe’s, either online or in the store. AirStone, the manufacturer, does not sell their product directly to consumers. If you order online, you have the option to have your stone shipped in the mail, delivered by Lowe’s delivery service, or set aside for pick up at a local store.Shipping costs may vary depending on how much stone you order and how far it has to ship.
If you don’t like to order online, go to the nearest Lowe’s and pick out the stone you want.

, Before you start putting stones on the wall, set out everything you’ll need and cover the floor or counter with a plastic or canvas drop cloth. This prevents a mess in case you drop adhesive. The main supplies you’ll need are the AirStones, the adhesive, a putty knife, and a hacksaw.


It can be useful to take all of the stones out of the box at this point.

, A primary feature of AirStone is the range of colors and sizes which create a natural look of variation. Lay the stones out and group them by size or color so that as you apply them to the wall you can pick from the piles. Purposefully randomizing the stones gives the most desirable look.This will add time to your process and it isn’t vital, but it is a helpful way to get the best look.

, Using the measurements of the area the stone will go, make a sketch on paper with the measurements. Use painter’s tape, or basic masking tape, to make a template on the floor using the measurements.This helps you visualize where the stones will go. It takes longer in the beginning, but it speeds up the process once you begin applying them to the wall.

, Since the stones come in multiple shades and sizes, laying them in a template helps you visualize how they will fit on the wall. Lay them out so that none of the seams match up and so the colors are distributed around randomly.This also gives you a chance to see how many stones you’ll need to cut to fit the area perfectly.

, Take a rag and wet it with warm water and a mild soap or cleaner. Wipe the entire surface carefully to remove any dust or debris that would hinder the adhesive from sticking. Take a dry cloth and dry the surface after you wipe it thoroughly.Allow the surface to air dry if necessary.

, If the section you are covering includes a corner, always place a corner piece to start the row of stones. This keeps you from getting to the corner with too little room to hang a piece. Start with a corner piece for each row., Take your putty knife and scoop up some adhesive from the bucket. Don’t get too much or you might drop it off of the knife. Gently spread the adhesive.It’s not necessary to cover the entire back of the stone in adhesive, but cover roughly 90%. The adhesive will spread some when pressed to the wall.
Another option for putting adhesive on the stone is to use a tube of adhesive with a caulk gun. Be sure to have a wet rag to wipe excess adhesive from the tube. A putty knife will still help you spread the adhesive.

, AirStone’s strong adhesive does not require lots of pressure for it to stick. Gently lay the stone against the wall and hold it for a few seconds. Start on either the left or the right of the area.If you realize you’ve placed a stone in the wrong spot, it can be removed up to 30 minutes after it has been stuck.

, Once you have the initial stone placed, place the following stones in a straight line. Push the edge of each new stone you place tightly against the one before it. Cut the final stone in the line to fit, as needed.


For walls that require roughly 10 or more stones, place four or five on one end of the wall, followed by four or five on the other end of the wall. Keep adding stones until the line meets in the middle, and cut stones if necessary.

, When you get to the end of a row, you may not have a stone that is short enough to fit the spot. Use a sharp hacksaw to cut a stone to the length you need. Be sure to measure before you cut so you get the correct length.Each package of AirStone includes a variety of sizes, so check your pieces first to see if you have a piece that fits without being cut.

, Once you place an entire row of stones, watch carefully on the second row to ensure that the ends of stones in each line do not form a two-row seam. The variety of stone lengths comes in handy to help with this., If you get any adhesive on the front of the stones, on your hands, or on other surfaces, wipe it up quickly. A damp cloth will wipe the adhesive away easily and won’t leave any residue. Don’t let it sit for more than 30 minutes or it will begin to dry.

, Once you’ve placed all of the AirStone on the wall, let the adhesive sit untouched. The material of the wall and the room temperature can affect drying time. The room temperature should be at least 60 for 48 hours after the installation.Be sure not to push anything against the wall or bump it while the adhesive dries.
If AirStone is installed around a fireplace or other heating element, don’t light a fire or turn the heat for during this two day drying period.

Determine if homemade trusses are suitable for the project you're building.,
Design your truss.,
Select the appropriate lumber for the truss you'll construct.,
Set up sawhorses or another flat, stable work place to build your trusses.,
Place the bottom chord board with the crown up, then place the boards the top chords will be cut from over it, so each member laps where they will intersect when the truss is built.,
Mark the top cuts on the top chords where they will meet at the roof peak.,
Determine whether the top chord or bottom chord will overhang the eave of your building, and then choose the appropriate bottom cut of the top chord.,
Locate the position of the intermediate diagonal bracing members you'll need to complete the truss.,
Use one of each unique member you have marked and cut as a pattern to mark subsequent members for each truss you plan to build.,
Determine if toe-nailing the members will create a strong enough truss for you project.,
Nail each member of the first truss together, supporting it at intersections with additional boards or posts to keep the assembly flat while it is laying on it's side.,
Use the first truss you assembled as a template to assemble the remaining trusses.,
Stack the completed trusses on dunnage so they lay as flat as possible, and in the best alignment you can achieve to prevent them from warping prior to installation.,
Install your trusses on the project you're building.",How to Build a Simple Wood Truss," Since your truss will support the roof of your building, it should not violate local building codes and must be designed to meet wind load, snow load, and other structural requirements.;
, You will need to know at least the basic following design elements for your project.

, High density softwoods like southern yellow pine or fir are preferred over lumbers like spruce, lodge pole pine, and white pine. Other things to look at when selecting individual boards include the following:


Size of the lumber. 2X4 inch (5cm x 10cm) nominal boards are suitable for lightweight trusses if the bracing and member connections are well designed and fabricated.
Quality of the lumber. Straight grained, dense boards with few knots are preferred for this project. Try to select lumber with no obvious splitting or barked edges.
Straightness of lumber. Twisted, warped, or crooked boards do not lend themselves well for building trusses. Lumber with a slight curve, or crown may be used, as long as the crown is facing up when it is installed.
Lumber should be kiln dried or seasoned, as green lumber may shrink and/or warp after the truss is assembled and installed.

, If possible, draw out a full size truss on a floor to help you establish the lengths of each member and the angles of the various cuts required. If you cannot do this, use sawhorses and set the bottom chord board on them to begin the process of marking pattern pieces.

, Scribe lines for the cuts at these overlapping places, cutting the bottom chord ends first if required.

, The angle of this cut can be determined with a speed square if you know the roof pitch. Mark a common rafter pitch cut on each top chord, or use a string to make a mark from the center point of the bottom chord perpendicular to that member across the two top chords where they overlap each other.
/images/thumb/3/3d/Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-6-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3d/Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-6-Version-2.jpg








, For a plumb eave line, you should be able to use the same angle you established to the top cut of the top chord. If you want the fascia board (if you anticipate installing one) to slope inward, use a sharper angle.

, There are specific engineering guidelines and even online resources you can use to determine load bearing and span applications for your project, but this article only applies to simple trusses where the general rule of thumb is one brace from the one third points of the bottom chords to the center of the top chords.
/images/thumb/7/7d/Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-8-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/7/7d/Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-8-Version-2.jpg









Divide the length of the bottom chord by three, then measure the resulting distance across the chord, marking the two locations where these braces will intersect the chord.
Mark the center point of each top chord, then place a board long enough to overlap each chord so the angles of the intersection can be scribed on each end.

, Be careful to make sure top and bottom chords are placed so their crowns are up when the trusses are built, and take care to be as precise as possible when marking and cutting each piece, as fitting them in the truss will be difficult if the lengths or angles are not correct.

, Likely, you will want to use reinforcing plates, gang-nailers, or gussets for all the connecting points of the frame members. The illustrations included here show 16 gauge galvanized steel plates, cut from salvages scrap metal being used, but if weathering isn't a consideration, 1/2 inch (12.7mm) plywood plates can be used.

, Use clamps to hold the fitted pieces tightly together while fastening them, and to work out any twists that are present in the lumber you're using.
/images/thumb/9/99/Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-11-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/99/Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Simple-Wood-Truss-Step-11-Version-2.jpg









For metal or plywood reinforcing plates, use plenty of nails of a length that will not penetrate through the member you're fastening, or you will have to bend the protruding ends of these nails over before putting the plates on the opposite side of the truss.

, Make sure all the joints are supported by temporary legs if you're working on a sawhorse or a table that is not large enough for the complete truss to set upon.

, Placing the trusses stacked in this manner will also allow you to observe how well the trusses match each other. Keep in mind that unless you have perfectly sized and straight material, you can expect minor variations from one truss to the next.

Check for damage in the roofing material directly above where the leak is coming in.,
Look for damaged, curled or missing shingles near where the leak is coming in.,
Straighten out shingles that are curled back.,
Reattach curled-back shingles after straightening with a generous amount of asphalt roof cement or compound around the exposed edges.

,
Replace damaged shingles.",How to Repair a Leaking Roof1," This will likely be easier to find on a flat roof, but leaks can also come into the house a good distance from where the actual roof damage is located.


If your roof is slanted, inspect areas on the roof that are higher than where the leak enters the home.
If you have an attic, inspect it with a flashlight for water stains, black marks or mold.
Run a hose along different sections of the roof and have a person inside alert you when leaking occurs.;
, Look closely for exposed roofing tacks, too.

, In colder weather, this might require that you soften the shingle edge with heat, such as an electric hair dryer. Using a torch or other open flame heat source isn't recommended since asphalt shingles may be flammable, and regardless of whether they are flame retardant or not, excess heat will ruin the shingle.,, If the shingle lifts off the roof with little effort, breaks, or simply crumbles, it needs to be replaced.


Remove the old shingle by lifting its edges and prying out the nail.
Scrape the area underneath it to remove any leftover roofing cement.
Use a sharp utility knife to round the back corners of the new shingle slightly.
Slide the new shingle into place and drive 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) galvanized roofing nails into each upper corner, then cover the nail heads with roof cement.

Measure the gable to decide how large a vent you can put into it and to determine the pitch of the roof if you want your vent to match it.,

Figure out how much lumber you will need and what type you will use.,
Assemble other tools and materials you will use for the project.,

Lay out the shape and size of your vent on a flat work table or sheet of plywood.,

Rip the louver boards on a bevel.,

Cut the face frame (1X4 treated southern yellow pine in images, used for strength, not appearance) to the sizes and angles established from your layout.,

Assemble the face frame using finish nails or screws, then test fit on the gable where it will be installed.,

Cut the louver vane frame, again, using the layout for lengths and angles.,
Attach the vane frame to the face frame, caulking the seam with a waterproof sealant and using rust resistant wood screws.

,

Cut a compound angle on one end of a piece of the vane stock ripped earlier.,
Place the stock so it fits within the vane frame to determine the overall length of this first vane.,
Mark the approximate length of the vane, and cut it an inch or so longer than needed to allow for angle adjustments when it is fit into position.

,
Try the vane when it cut to see how well the angles fit.,
Mark the frame about 3 inches (7.6 cm) higher up and measure the difference in length form you longest vane to this one.,
Cut all the vanes needed to complete the louver.,

Begin installing the vanes working from the shortest (top) to the longest, nailing each end, and keeping the vanes flush with the bottom (back) of the face frame so insect screening can be stapled to them later.
,

Turn the louver over to complete nailing from the back side where the ends are more easily accessed.,

Caulk, then paint or stain the louver if desired.
,

Place the louver on the table with the back up, and stretch the aluminum insect screen on it.,
Cut the hole in the gable siding and install your new louver.

",How to Build a Wooden Louvered Gable Vent," This article will describe construction of one that fits the center of the gable underneath the roof flashing.
, Rough sawn cedar is used in the images here for durability and appearance, but any weather resistant lumber can be used. If you want to get exact material requirements, you may need to produce a scale drawing with specific nominal dimension lumber lengths and sizes., See Things You'll Need for tools and other items, below. A table saw, a work table, a compound miter saw, and a finish nailer are very helpful for the project.

, Drawing it here to scale will allow for determining accurate lengths and angles, and to help you position the pieces together for fastening., 22.5 degrees is generally enough, but 30 or even 45 degrees may be preferred. If you measure carefully and cut with a table saw, you should be able to get two vanes from each board, assuming you are using 1X6 cedar fence boards. These will be the stock cut for vanes later., A miter saw is helpful in getting accurate angle cuts., You may want to scribe the inside dimension while doing this to make cutting the hole in the siding easier later on., The frame should be at least 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) deeper than the width of your vanes to make sure it doesn't leak.,, The width angle will be 45 degrees, the bevel should be about 30 degrees, with both long points facing the same direction and opposite the direction of the bevel on the edge of the stock., You can check the fit of the angles approximately at this time but until the opposite end is cut, it isn't possible to do exactly.

,, Make scribed adjustments and check the angles on the saw so later cuts on the next vanes will all be the same.

, If it is ten inches shorter, you can reduce the length of subsequent vanes by the same amount to space them equally without measuring each one.

, Make sure each angle is cut so it faces the same way in relation to other angles and sort them by length.,, Use a finish nailer with corrosion resistant nails or corrosion resistant screws and a screw gun depending on your preference. Remember, the louver will be exposed to weather conditions, so it should be built securely to prevent wind damage that will result in leaks into your building.,, Staple it in place with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) galvanized staples. Make sure to staple through the screen into the louver vanes to help prevent them from bowing or loosening.,"

Be sure you are up to the challenge.,
Check the sub-floor.,
Choose quality material.,
Install proper underlayment.,
Monitor the temperature of the laminate.",How to Avoid Common Problems when Installing Laminate Flooring1," Installing new floors is a big task and is fundamental to your home. To be successful, you need to have patience, adequate knowledge, and proper tools. Understand the time, energy, and commitment that is required before starting major projects.If you choose to hire a professional, be sure they are licensed and experienced. Check their references.;
, Sub-floors are typically concrete or cement and develop weaknesses over time. If you place laminate flooring on a weak or uneven sub-floor, the new floor will be compromised and eventually buckle, damage the laminate locking system, creak, or create micro gaps in the new floor. Here are some ways you can check for problems in a sub-floor:Use a level to see how flat the floor is. Lay a four to six foot level on the sub-floor, and see how close you can get the bubble to float between the vertical lines. If you find that the bubble is floating to one end of the level, the floor may be uneven.Use the level to measure gaps. Any depressions that measure less than 1/8"" are okay for a new floor installation. If you find gaps larger than 1/8"", then you may need to use self-leveling mortar to level the surface.Measure for any areas that peak higher than 1/8"". These areas will need to be lowered to create an even surface. Wood floors will need to be sanded down, and concrete floors will need grinding. Mark all of the uneven areas with a felt-tipped marker to keep track., Cheap laminate flooring has a higher chance of being defective right away and over time. Through usage, it may warp, buckle, and develop permanent stains. If you are working with a professional carpenter, ask for their opinion on the best brands. If you are on your own, ask an experienced home center employee, call a contractor, or check online for reviews on products you are considering.


Purchase approximately 15% more laminate than you expect you will need. This will be useful for boards that are damaged, or in case the measurements are not accurate.Check to make sure you buy products that do not contain harmful chemicals.

, Underlayment is a thin, hard layer of either cement board, wood, or foam. It is vital to the overall project because it protects the floor from moisture which can seep in from sub-floors such as concrete. Once the laminate flooring is introduced to moisture, it will absorb into the laminate and expand. Proper underlayment will help prevent the laminate from absorbing moisture which reduces buckling and warping over time. Underlayment also insulates noise, maintains the temperature in your home, and creates a smoother surface.Plywood is the recommended underlayment material for laminate flooring. However, the specific kind of plywood you use will depend on what your floors will be exposed to after installation. For example, if you live in a humid climate, marine plywood is recommended. When purchasing underlayment, check with the professional for guidance on the best type for you.Plywood underlayment is usually cheap and easy to install. It comes in large sheets that are placed down to cover the floor, and it is secured in place with screws along the edges., Flooring that has been left outside, or in a cold atmosphere, is fully contracted. If you start installing the flooring right when you bring it inside, then part of the floor will be installed cold. If the laminate is installed while it is still cold, it will slowly come to room temperature and change in size. Even if there was only a small section that was installed cold, it will expand and put pressure on the rest of the floor. This can cause humps and cracks in the floor and ruin the overall project.Allow your flooring to warm up overnight before installing it.

Follow the manufacturer's installation directions carefully.,
Inspect each piece of laminate.,
Allow room for expansion.,
Watch for gaps between pieces.",How to Avoid Common Problems when Installing Laminate Flooring2," Most modern laminate flooring does not require you to tap or pound it into place. Instead, they use a system of locks that ""click"" together. If you hammer planks together that use this system, you may break the edges, and your floors will not lock correctly., As the laminate is being installed, look at the laminate planks and edges to ensure they are the right pattern and don't have any visible defects. Replacing just one piece of installed laminate is difficult once surrounding pieces have been installed.Manufacturers will not cover defective pieces once they have been installed., While you want to prevent laminate flooring from expanding, there is no way to avoid it completely. To accommodate this unavoidable problem, it is important to leave a small amount of space around the edges of the room you are installing laminate flooring. If you do not leave expansion clearance, the floors may warp and buckle not that long after installation.Be sure to leave about 1/2"" of space along the edges of the room. To be safe, check with a professional to figure out what the best amount of space to leave is for the room type and climate.

, Most quality laminate flooring is made with grooves and other designs that allow the pieces to lock together. This helps to prevent gaps. Pieces that do not get locked together properly will drift apart over time. The gaps will show as dark lines which are actually open expanses. You can correct these spaces with a rubber mallet. Tap the pieces back together as soon as you notice the problem.If gaps are left unattended, moisture or debris will fall into the spaces and make it hard to fit them snugly back together.
If you don't have a rubber mallet, find a tool that is durable enough to move the laminate but won't scratch or harm the laminate surface."

Study how wood changes over time.,
Begin by hand scraping the wood with a wood floor-scraping tool.,
Brush the flooring in spots with a wire brush.,
Let your dog, if you have one, run up and down the floors with unclipped nails.,
Use chains, drills, hammers, saw blades and ice picks when distressing wood floors.,
Use a soldering iron, lacquer thinner or hot metal to add burn marks to your flooring.",How to Age Wood Floors," Go to a historic building that has wood flooring and study how the floors have aged over time. When you age hardwood flooring, you want to copy from real aged floors.;
, Hand scraping takes time, but it will age hardwood flooring.


Test a small area. Different woods react differently to distressed flooring techniques. Walnut, pine, hickory, pecan and oak work well when you hand scrape them, but hardwoods, such as maple and teak, don't turn out as well with this method.
Scrape in the direction of the grain and avoid the knots in the wood. Scraping against the grain will make scratches that go the wrong direction.
Adjust the angle and the pressure of the scraping tool to produce the texture you desire. Distressing wood floors is an art form, so use your creativity to achieve the results you want.

, Wire brushes may add a grainy feel to the wood.

, Try tossing a ball across the floor so they may run and slide on the floor. Their nails will create natural marks on the floor that will add to the distressed flooring look.

, These tools may be used to create chips, holes and scratches that will amplify the aged look.

, Burn marks may add character to your distressed flooring.

You might also want paint, varnish, caulk, a nail setter, and a nail crayon if you want to get the shoe molding looking finished and professional.
Some people may need to drill pilot holes for their nails, if the molding is very brittle or thin (since some molding may be prone to cracking). If so, you'll need a drill with a bit smaller than the nails you will be using.;
, If you are removing old base molding, start by taking a utility knife and carefully cut through any paint that is adhering the base molding to the baseboard. This will prevent you from chipping the paint on the baseboard as you pry away the base molding.

, Using a stiff putty knife, work the base molding loose by pushing it behind and under the base molding. Be careful not to damage the baseboard or the floor. Pry the molding completely away from the baseboard using a flat bar, then remove all the nails.

, While the molding is removed, you have an excellent opportunity to sand and paint your baseboards. If they are in good shape, continue on with the base molding installation.

, Before you cut your moldings to length, you should prep and apply a finish to them. Take your new wood moldings and lightly sand them. Lay them on a set of saw horses and finish them to match your floors. This can be as simple as a few coats of varnish.

, Measure the area that you will need to cover in shoe molding. Using a tape measure, measure all along the wall. You'll want to write down the exact measurements of each run, from corner to corner. The overall measurements will tell you how much shoe molding to buy and the run measurements will tell you how long to cut each section.


If you have any outside corners in your room, you'll want to cut the molding for that section longer than the wall itself. Add about 1-2"". This is necessary to make sure that the two pieces will be long enough to go around the whole corner and stay connected.
You may have a wall that is longer than an individual piece of shoe molding. Don't worry! We'll show you how to join two pieces together with as little a seam as possible.

, For inside corners, which are the most common corner type in a room, you'll have a few different options for how you can cut the molding. The best option, which will adjust the corner if it is not a perfect 45 degrees and let the molding shift naturally as the wood changes with the season and age, will be to cope one side of the molding.


To do a cope cut, cut one of the two molding pieces to the exact length of the wall for that side, so that the end butts up against the adjoining wall. Next, cut the second piece at a 45 degree angle, with the back side being the longer side. After that, you'll take your coping saw and cut the end in an opposite 45 degree angle, with the saw carefully following the edge of the front face. Sand the edge once the inside is cut away. This should leave you with a face that looks normal but hides a gap behind it. This allows you to fit it against the other piece of shoe molding like a puzzle piece, create a nice seam.If you can't get or don't want to get a coping saw, or if you're really in a hurry (or you just don't care that much), you can simply miter the ends. The long side of the board, once cut, should be on the back and measure to the length of the wall itself.

, For an outside corner, simply miter both ends of the two molding pieces. The back side of the molding should fit the measurement of your wall and be the shorter side of the miter. Placing just a bit of glue where the two sides meet can help ensure that the joint stays firm and a gap does not form.Cut diagonal outside corners. Sometimes your baseboards or wall may not meet at a 45 degree angle, but instead have a flat, diagonal corner. If this is the case, cut your molding pieces at 22.5 degrees and make sure that the back side of the middle piece matches the length of the diagonal face.

, If you have a long run that requires two pieces of molding, do not butt together the two ends of molding. Instead, miter cut (45 degrees) both ends in opposite directions so that the two pieces overlap at the joint. This will prevent a visible gap as the wood shrinks and expands over time.

, With all of your molding ready to go, you can start nailing it into place using the pneumatic nail gun. Nail at the center line of the molding, to help prevent cracks. How far apart the nails are depends on how secure you want it to be but roughly every 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) should do it.


Make sure that your nails are going straight into the baseboards and not angled down into what is probably a gap or floorboards. To do this, you'll probably have to have the nail gun on the floor.

, If you have a nail setter, setting the nails will allow you to get a more professional appearance. Place the nail setter against the nails and tap it with a block or your hand to counter-sink the nails.

, You need to decide how you want the end to look, since it will often stick out from the rest of the molding. There are a few options:


Consider a mitered return. This is the most common method of creating a return and probably the easiest. Miter cut the end of your last piece of molding and then carefully miter cut a tiny single piece. Place them together so that the molding turns back into the wall, creating a much cleaner look.
Consider a bull-nose return. A bull-nose return is another option, although it requires more tools. Essentially, cut the molding to the length you want it to reach and then use the coping saw and sandpaper to round the end down until it looks nice on it's own.
Consider a wrap around with no return. Under some circumstances, it may be possible to skip returns by having the molding wrap around a doorway and continue on into the next room. This is not ideal for all homes, however, so only do this is it makes sense and looks nice.

, Once you've got all the molding installed, use caulk to fill any gaps at the corners and other gaps. Be aware, however, that if there are gaps between the molding and your baseboards, you may have simply placed your nails to far apart and adding an intermediate nail may help.

, Use a nail crayon, if you want to, to fill in the holes created when you countersunk the nails.

, With everything else done, all that remains is to stain or paint the molding however you want it to look. This is easiest when the baseboards are also unfinished, but if your baseboards are already stained you might want to stain the molding before installing it. Once your paint or stain is dry, you're all done! Enjoy your new, professional-looking room!

Remove any carpeting from the area.,
Hammer down any protruding nail heads.,
Make sure the floor is relatively clean.,
Remove any tack stripping along the floor edges.",How to Refinish Wood Floors1," Cut and roll in sections manageable for carrying out to the trash. Once all carpeting has been removed, move on to the real work.;
, Nails may have been added to the flooring to cut down on squeaking or to secure a loose baseboard. Either way, nails that are sticking up above the wood floor present both a danger and a nuisance. Most of the time, hammering the nails down deeper into the flooring is a better and easier solution than taking the nails out.


Hammer the nails down about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) into the floor. Use a nail set so you don't leave hammer marks(dents)in the wood. Work with their direction, not against it. Once the nails are 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) deep, they're ready to be concealed with a little bit of filler that you'll make after sanding down the rest of the flooring. More on that later.

, If old carpet backing is stuck to your wood floor, you will need to scrape it off with a putty knife. This can be a rather tedious job, and can take a great deal of time, but it's worth it.


Go over the floor with a vacuum and mop if necessary. Years of dust and grit can create a lot of debris. You want this debris cleared away before you attack the old wood finish.

, If tack stripping was present along with your carpet, remove it before you start sanding so that you can hit those areas with your finish.

"

Use sanding to buff up any very old, excessively scratched or worn wood.,
Prep the perimeter.,
Use a floor sander to hit the areas of the floor that weren't hit by hand in the detail sanding.,
Save the sawdust created by sanding.",How to Refinish Wood Floors2," Chemical strippers can be used if what you're after is a quick fix, or the floors themselves were recently finished. If, however, you're dealing with traffic patterns, stains, or scratches, your best bet is to sand away those imperfections and then add another coat to the floor.

, Hand-sand or palm-sand the perimeter of the floor with coarse 180-grit sandpaper. Rub out 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) from the edge of the baseboard so that you're sure to cover the areas your mechanical floor sander can't get to.

, You can rent floor sanding machines at hardware supply stores or equipment rental stores.


Start with a coarse grit and begin to sand the floor. Start off gently. You don't want to gouge the floor. If you get a good sander, you'll even be able to lift up the sander and spend a little more time on heavy-wear or problem areas. Change out your sanding disks as necessary. You may need to change out the sandpaper once or twice using the same grit before you've completely removed the finish.
Using a pencil, color the entire area lightly with streaks of graphite. This will help tell you when you've sanded an area. Otherwise, it'll be tough to tell where you've sanded and where you haven't.
Go over the entire floor again with a medium-grit sandpaper. Look at the pencil streaks to determine whether you've already sanded an area or not. Again, you may need to change the disks on your sanding machine before the job is finished.

, If you hit any wayward nails back into the floor in the prep stage, be sure to save the sawdust so that you can patch and plug the 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) holes created by the nails. This will help ensure a nice, even finish.

Use a chemical stripper in lieu of sanding.,
Apply the stripper on an area of about two square feet.,
Let stripper sit for about five minutes.,
Remove the stripper from the wood.,
Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the stripper from the wood.,
Allow the area to dry completely.,
Spot-sand any scratched or worn areas.",How to Refinish Wood Floors3," If you want a quick fix, or the wood underneath the old finish is clean and scratch-free, you may want to use a chemical stripper instead of sanding down the whole floor. If you choose to use a chemical stripper, always follow the instructions on the label and use proper safety precautions.


Use gloves, goggles, and be sure to ventilate the area you're working in. Chemical strippers are designed to peel off the finish from wood; you don't want it interacting with your skin, and you don't want to inhale too much of it., Don't be timid about applying too much of it. You also don't want to cover too much of an area at once as you will want to be able to clean the area in plenty of time.

, Once you've applied the stripper to the finish, let wait the suggested time without interfering. You will notice the old stain bubbling and lifting from the wood.


Don't wait so long that the stripper dries on you. When you remove the stripper, you want it to still be wet.

, You can do this in two steps:


Hit the area with a putty knife to scrape off the stripper along with the finish.
Use denatured alcohol in a disposable aluminum pan to clean off the remaining stripper with the help of steel wool. Do not put too much denatured alcohol in the pan, as it does tend to quickly evaporate.

, Different chemical strippers will need to be cleaned using different methods. Some strippers need to be cleaned with turpentine or paint remover, while others can simply be rinsed with water.

, Water or moisture and your new finish don't work well together; be sure to allow the area to dry completely before moving on to the next step.

, You may need to sand any problem areas before you apply the new finish to your wood floors.

Plug any remaining holes with wood paste or wood plugs.,
Before you apply any finish, be sure to vacuum and/or clean up any debris.,
Once the floor is ready to be refinished, apply the stain or finish of your choosing evenly onto the floor.,
Wait for the finish to dry and, if necessary, apply another coat of stain or finish to deepen the color.,
When dry, finish with a polyurethane coating, if desired.",How to Refinish Wood Floors4," May you had a few cables running into the baseboard; or perhaps those nails we talked about earlier are in need or covering up.


To make a wood paste, mix sawdust with a small amount of white glue to create a paste. Apply paste over the nails with a putty knife and allow to harden before sanding flush with the rest of the floor.
Find small wooden plugs for larger holes. If necessary, drill into the floor to enlarge the hole so that the plug will fit nicely inside. Apply a small amount of wood glue around the side of the plug, fit the plug into the hole so that the grain of the plug and the grain of the floor match well, and hammer down lightly. Allow to dry completely before sanding flush with the rest of the floor.

, You want your entire floor cleared of any sawdust, debris, or stripper before you apply the new coat. Make sure also that your floor is completely dry before applying the new finish.

, Make sure that before you actually start to apply the coat to your floor, you have the windows open for ventilation, you're wearing a mask to keep the fumes from bothering you, and you've spot tested the finish so you reasonably know what it's going to look like on your floor.


Also use gloves and a synthetic bristle brush when applying the finish. Start with the perimeter of the floor and work your way in. A 3-inch band is all you'll need for a perimeter.
Use an applicator pad to do most of the work for you. You can use a watering can with a bit of cheesecloth on top to pour the finish onto the floor, and then use your applicator pad to mop the finish into the floor evenly and cleanly.
Make sure that you leave yourself an area to exit once the finish has been applied. You don't want to have to walk over the newly-stained floor with your dirty shoes when you want to let the finish dry.

, Use the same techniques as described above, and be sure to take proper safety and handling guidelines into consideration.

, It is much easier to use a long-handed roller rather than a brush, and it gives a nicer finish. It is important to lightly sand after each application with 220 grit sandpaper. Clean after each sanding with tack cloth. It may take 24 hours between applications for the polyurethane to dry.

Read the care label.,
Determine if your comforter needs to be cleaned.,
Check for seam strength and any holes.,
Remove stains.,
Load your comforter into a washing machine.,
Set the washing machine to the delicate setting and select the water temperature.,
Add an extra rinse cycle if possible.,
Use a small amount of mild detergent.,
Add a clean pair of white tennis shoes or tennis balls.,
Place your comforter in the dryer with the tennis shoes or balls.,
Dry the comforter on the low-heat setting.,
Fluff the comforter regularly during the drying process.,
Hang the comforter outside.",How to Clean Comforters," Your comforter should have a care label with instructions on how to clean it. Most down and down-alternative comforters can be washed at home with a mild detergent,though some may specify to dry clean only.


Do not deviate from specific instructions on the label. These may include temperature settings for washers and dryers, etc.;
, Comforters probably need a good cleaning once every few months.If you have allergies, however, you may want to wash your comforter monthly.


You don't need to wash your whole comforter if the problem is a single stain. See Step 4 for stain treatment.

, Before proceeding to actually washing your comforter, make sure it has no loose threads or tears. Hopefully, these tears will not be too large and can be easily remedied with a quick needle and thread. Though this adds time to the process of washing your comforter, it will prevent these small holes from becoming larger during washing.

, You can do this with a small amount of non-detergent solution like Woolite diluted with a little water. Alternatively, use a paste made of baking soda and water, a 50-50 solution of baking soda and white vinegar, or simply carbonated water.


Shift the filling away from the stained area.
Apply a small amount of the cleaning solution to the area.
Blot with a clean, white towel or cloth.
Alternatively, rub the fabric together to loosen the stain, and rinse with a small amount of water. Squeeze excess water out with your hands and then blot with a clean, white towel.
If you're not washing your comforter afterwards, let this section air dry, or dry with a hair dryer. Make sure it has dried completely.Never use any bleach or color-treatment solution.

, Make sure it is distributed evenly. Your comforter needs adequate room to get thoroughly clean, so if your home washing machine looks too small to fit the comforter, take it to a laundromat and use one of the large, front-load washers., The delicate setting is essential in preventing damage to the casing. Choosing a water temperature depends on a couple of factors.


Use cool water or warm water per the label instructions.
Use hot water if you want to kill off dust mites and do not have a dryer. Heat over 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 C) kills dust mites, but if you're concerned about damaging the fabric or color of your comforter with a high-heat wash, use cool water and save the heat for the drying step., Depending on your machine, you may be able to select this at the beginning, or you may need to add this as an extra step after the first cycle is complete., Choose a detergent that is safe for delicate materials. Using a small amount prevents over-foaming in the machine, and also reduces stripping the feathers of down comforters., Adding these to the wash will help balance the load and ensure effective cleaning.Make sure the tennis shoes can go in the wash on the settings you've selected.

, Make sure the comforter is evenly distributed. The tennis shoes or balls help keep the fill evenly distributed.


Alternatively, you can use a rubber dryer ball or down fluffer rings., Your comforter will take a while to dry thoroughly, possibly a few hours.


Use high heat to kill dust mites, but only after consulting the care label. Note that tennis balls and tennis shoes may not tolerate high-heat settings.

, Every half-hour, pull the comforter out of the dryer and fluff it. This helps redistribute the fill and encourages thorough, even drying by keeping the comforter properly aerated. You can also check for signs of burns (unlikely on low-heat settings but a risk with higher-heat settings)., If it's relatively dry and sunny out, complete the drying process by putting the comforter outside for a few hours. This helps ensure that the comforter is thoroughly dried, which is essential for preventing mildew. Sunlight also helps kill dust mites.


If it's very warm and sunny outside, you can skip the dryer altogether and hang your comforter out for the entire drying process. If you do this, arrange the comforter so that its surfaces can dry evenly. Be sure to fluff and rotate it 90 degrees every few hours so that the down or fill doesn't collect in any one end.
If weather does not permit, hang the comforter in a dry, well-ventilated area indoors. Laying it over a drying rack allows it to dry fairly evenly. Be sure to fluff and rotate regularly, as instructed above.

, Brand new sheets have chemicals added during manufacture that can prevent them from feeling soft. Detergent will lock in these chemicals and make the new sheets feel a little harsh. To avoid this problem, wash your new sheets with one cup (236 Milliliters) of baking soda. Add one cup (236 Milliliters) of white vinegar to the rinse cycle. After this first wash, you can use regular detergent. Feel free to sleep in your new sheets after the baking soda and vinegar wash.

, If you are washing your regular sheets (i.e., not new), you will need to remove them from your bed(s). Follow the washing instructions provided on the care label of your sheets. The care label will offer specific washing instructions based on the material and brand.Avoid washing too many sheets together. If you try to wash too many sheets at once, they will not get as clean. Also, washing too much at once will strain the motor of your washing machine., Only sheets and pillow cases should be washed together. Other bed linen should be washed separately from sheets.


Avoid washing your sheets with towels.If you wash sheets with towels, you will end up with little lint balls all over your sheets. The friction from the towels will gradually wear down the sheets.Avoid washing your sheets with items of a different colour. If you wash your sheets with other clothing items of a different colour, you may discolour your sheets., It is best to be conservative when measuring out the detergent for washing sheets.Use 2 oz (1/4 cup) or half a cap full of liquid laundry detergent for a regular load.
Use 4 oz (1/2 cup) or one full cap of liquid laundry detergent for a heavily soiled load.Follow the guidelines on the detergent packaging.Avoid using too much detergent. If you want your sheets to last a long time, you should avoid excessive detergent. Loads of detergent will wear down your sheets faster., If your sheets are very soiled, you will choose a different cycle than if your sheets are only mildly soiled. If you always choose the strongest cycle, your sheets will deteriorate faster.Choose “sheet cycle” if your machine has such a setting. If there is no “sheet cycle,” use the regular cycle or the colors cycle.Use a warm water setting for regular washing. If the sheets are very soiled, you can use a hot water setting to kill more germs.Avoid using hot temperatures regularly. If you want your sheets to last a long time, you should generally avoid hot temperatures. A hot cycle will wear down your sheets faster.Use a hot temperature setting if you had a cold recently or if the sheets are especially soiled.

Choose a gentle, cold water cycle and avoid washing silks with heavier fabrics.Dry your silk sheets on a clothes line. If you must use a dryer, choose a no heat setting.To clean your satin sheets, you should machine wash at forty degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). You can use a fabric conditioner in the final cycle to help keep the sheets soft.
Avoid using bleach. Using bleach frequently will eventually damage your sheets.
Dry on a clothes line or tumble dry., Linen is a durable, but tricky fabric. With linen sheets, you should use colder temperatures. Try to use natural detergents and use less detergent than normal. For example, if you usually use one cup, try only using 3/4 of that amount. You can always wash the sheets again later if they are not clean., If you get a stain on your sheets, it is best to remove it immediately. As soon as a stain happens, quickly rinse the affected area of the sheet with cold water. After you have rinsed off the stain, you can move forward with washing your sheets.

You will save energy and electricity use by using a clothes line.Hang white sheets in the sun and coloured sheets in the shade.Hang sheets from the corners rather than in the middle. This keeps them from getting damaged in the wind.
Wear an apron with pockets for clothespins to make the task easier. Alternately, bring a bucket of clothes pins.You may also choose to use a combination of clothes line and dryer. Try drying them on the clothes line and then putting them in the dryer for just a couple minutes. This way you can save energy while also getting the soft feel of sheets just out of the dryer., If it is raining or you do not have a clothes line, you may choose to use the drying machine. The dryer gives a nice soft feel to your sheets.Use a tennis ball tied in a cotton sock to make sure the sheets dry evenly. Use a lavender dryer bag. Lavender oil can help you sleep and is a natural moth repellent and antibacterial agent.Fill a spray bottle with water and several drops of lavender oil.

The lavender scent will transfer to your sheets., Generally, it is best to choose a medium or low heat setting. This makes your sheets last longer.You may also want to choose an automatic setting that tells you when your sheets are dry.


Use the less dry or damp alert settings to prevent over drying of cotton sheets. Avoid hot temperature settings. Hot temperatures will lessen the life of your sheets., If you place them flat across your bed while they are still warm, they will fit to the bed. Also, the sheets will look smooth and ironed, even though you have not actually ironed them.Avoid leaving your sheets in the washer. This causes wrinkles, since the spin cycle of the washer will suck the sheets against the washer wall. Instead, take out the sheets right when they are done and place them on the bed., It is likely that you will get a better night’s rest if you make your bed.Start by stretching the elastic corners of your fitted sheet over each of the corners of your mattress.

Start with no-fuss methods.,
Hang it up to air-clean.,
Brush it out instead.",How to Clean a Wool Blanket1," Expect wool to be naturally repellant towards dirt. Also bear in mind that rigorous washing can actually damage it. Save yourself some time and trouble. Unless something catastrophic happened to your blanket, always try the easiest methods (like air-cleaning and brushing) first to see if they do the job before moving on to something tougher., Choose somewhere indoors with a lot of air circulation to hang it. Set up some fans to get the air moving if needed. Hold your blanket up and give it a thorough shaking to dislodge any dirt or dust clinging to it (or do this outside if you'd rather not vacuum the floor afterward). Then hang it so the air currents can sweep along the wool and blow away the dirt and dust.Avoid hanging it up outside if the sun is out. Direct exposure to the sun can cause pronounced fading in colors.
Do not use heat sources (like space heaters, hair dryers, or even the sun) to speed up the process. Excess heat can dry your blanket out more than desired and damage the fibers.

, Spread the blanket out on the floor and smooth it out so it’s flat. Use a soft-bristle brush for fabrics to brush out dirt. Work lengthwise down the blanket and always brush in just one direction.Brushing in multiple directions can weaken the wool fibers and wear your blanket out.
Fabric brushes can be found with other laundry goods in most stores, or you can find them online.

Create a mixture of hot water and biological laundry detergent.,
Place the sheets into the cleaning mixture.,
Put the sheets in a washer and dryer.",How to Clean Fake Tanner from White Sheets1," It is best to use a bathtub for this as it is large enough to hold the sheets in and won’t overflow. Once the bathtub is filled with hot water, add a small cup of biological washing powder and stir well with a large spoon or stirrer to create the cleaning mixture.


Biological detergent has enzymes in the powder that help clean stains that non-biological detergent does not contain.;
, Push the sheets down with the stirring tool to make sure that all of the fabric is submerged. Make sure to leave the sheets soaking in the bathtub overnight to let the washing powder clean effectively.

, The morning after the soaking take the sheets (use a plastic laundry basket to not get the floors wet) and run the washer on a warm cycle. When the washer is finished, dry the sheets on a clothes line or in the dryer. Once dry the sheets should be completely clean and white.

Deal with fresh spills and stains ASAP.,
Make a cleaning solution.,
Test dyed blankets before cleaning.,
Spray and blot.,
Repeat with mild detergent and water if needed.",How to Clean a Wool Blanket2," Expect wool to repel moisture upon contact, but don’t take this for granted. Keep in mind that the fibers will start absorbing the liquid within a few minutes. If you spill anything that might stain your blanket, clean it right away, before the stain begins to set., Combine one part distilled white vinegar with two parts water. Fill a spray bottle with your solution. If you’re dealing with a recent spill or smudge, try using seltzer water, since the carbonation’s bubbles can actually encircle and seal off particles and other liquids., If the wool has been dyed, expect your solution to cause the dye to run if it isn’t colorfast. Spray a white cloth with your solution until it’s damp. Then pick a small area of your blanket to test. Dab the blanket gently with your damp cloth. Check the cloth to see if it has absorbed any dye from the blanket. If it has, don’t proceed any further.If the blanket isn’t colorfast, it will need to be dry-cleaned.

, Spray the dirty area with your solution. If it’s very soiled, pour enough solution to cover and soak the area. Then use a dry cloth to blot up the solution and dirt. Resist the urge to scrub, since this will weaken the fibers and potentially spread the dirt or stain around over a wider area., If your vinegar solution isn’t doing the job, empty your spray bottle. Add a tiny drop of mild laundry detergent and fill the bottle with warm water. Then spray the blanket again and blot with a fresh cloth.Do not use anything harsher than mild laundry detergent. If it doesn’t do the job either, your blanket will need dry-cleaning.
Many brands specifically label their mild detergents as such. They also might advertise them as being safe for sensitive skin and/or babies.

Once washed, dry the sheets either on a clothes line or in the dryer., If there is any tanner still present on the sheets, a last resort may be to soak it overnight in a mixture of cold water and oxygen-based bleach and repeat the washing and drying process. The white sheet should now be completely clean.Test the bleach on a small area of the sheet before you soak it all to make sure the material won’t be damaged by the bleach.Take caution when handling bleach as it can be dangerous to humans and animals. Use it in a well ventilated area and do not breathe it in. Also, make as minimal contact as possible between your skin and the bleach.

, Look at the instructions on your mattress cover’s tag. Some covers will permit machine drying on a low setting. Many will recommend air drying because it is gentler on the mattress cover. For best results, you should air dry your mattress cover., Baking soda absorbs odors and any residual moisture that might be hiding out in your Tempur Pedic mattress. Take your hands and sprinkle baking soda over the entire surface of your mattress. Make sure it is entirely covered with a thin layer of baking soda.You can also sprinkle the mattress with cornstarch instead of baking soda.
A 50-50 mixture of cornstarch and baking soda will also work to clean your mattress.

, Once you have covered the surface of your mattress with baking soda, you will need to allow it to sit for at least sixty minutes. This will let the baking soda absorb odors and moisture., After you allow the baking soda to sit on the Tempur Pedic mattress for one hour, take a handheld vacuum and vacuum the entire surface of the mattress.

Check the care label.,
Hand-wash by giving it a bath.,
Machine-wash very briefly.,
Air-dry.",How to Clean a Wool Blanket3," If your blanket needs a thorough washing, always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. Bring it to the dry cleaner if the care label says, “Dry Clean Only.” Otherwise, move on to the appropriate method if it says it’s okay to hand- or machine-wash.Washing a “dry clean only” blanket can cause it to shrink and become more abrasive.

, Add a drop of mild laundry detergent or two to your bathtub. Fill it with enough cold water to cover your blanket. Wait to see if any suds form before placing your blanket in the water. If they do, drain and repeat with less detergent. Then place your blanket in the water and let it soak for 15 minutes or longer.Scrubbing or otherwise manhandling the blanket in the water can ruin the fibers, so “hand-washing” shouldn’t be taken too literally. Just let it soak so the water and soap do their thing and dislodge the dirt on their own.
Too much detergent can remove the fibers’ natural oils, which means they won’t repel dirt as well anymore. This is why you don’t want to see any suds forming when you add water to the tub.
If the blanket’s still dirty no matter how long it soaks, it will need to be dry-cleaned.

, As with hand-washing, you don’t want to rough the blanket up too much, so don’t put your blanket in for a full wash cycle. Add just a drop or two of mild laundry detergent to the basin and fill it with cold water. If no suds appear, place your blanket inside. If they do, drain the basin and try again with less detergent. Then, once you place the blanket inside:Give it 15 minutes to soak in the soapy water.
Start the washer’s “gentle” or “delicate” cycle.
Stop the cycle after two minutes.
Switch the cycle to “rinse.”
Run the full “rinse” cycle.

, Regardless of which method you chose to wash your blanket, never use a machine to dry it. Hang it up for the air to dry it instead. Avoid doing so in direct sunlight, however, since this can fade your blanket and damage the fibers.Additionally, don’t wring any excess water out of your blanket when you remove it from the water or washer. This can ruin its shape and can cause permanent wrinkles.If you’re worried about it dripping everywhere as you move it from one place to another, roll it up inside a large beach towel.

Forcing the air out can damage the mattress, plug, and valve.With some thinner air mattresses, you can fold the mattress in half to force the air out.

, Keep the air plug or valve open as you fold the mattress. Once the air is out, lay the mattress out flat and fold it lengthwise onto itself twice until you have a thin rectangle. Then, start from the opposite end of the plug or valve and use your palms to roll it tightly, as if you were rolling a sleeping bag.Use your knuckles and fingers as you roll to apply pressure to the mattress.

, Using a cover can extend the life of your mattress, as well as protect it from bugs, spills, and mold. A vinyl zip cover will work to protect an air mattress.

Take your bedding to the laundromat.,
Wash the bedding in a tub.",How to Clean Heavy Winter Bedding1," On one corner of every bedding item, there’s a small white tag with specific directions and information on how to wash it. This information supersedes any other information you receive from laundry professionals, friends, or how-to guides.

These professional cleaners have the know-how and experience to clean your heavy winter blankets properly.Many blankets are too large for domestic washing and drying machines.
Having a professional clean your heavy winter bedding will save you time, but is the most expensive option.
For some types of heavy winter bedding – wool duvets and comforters, for instance – there is no option apart from taking them to the dry cleaners., If your bedding’s care tag suggests you can machine-wash it yourself, cart it to your nearest laundromat. Put your comforter in an extra-large washing machine. If you’re not sure where you laundromat’s extra-large washing machine is, ask one of the laundromat workers.If you don’t know where your local laundromat is, put a search into your favorite search engine with a word string like “local laundromats.” Use the map feature to find a laundromat with good reviews.
Alternately, talk to your friends about where they take their laundry. If they like their laundromat, take your laundry there, too.

, Some smaller duvets, comforters, and eiderdowns might be best cleaned by soaking them in a tub with mild soap or even bubble bath mix. If the weather permits, you could also use a children’s inflatable pool to clean the heavy bedding item.Once the bedding item is in the tub (or pool), jump in there with it. Gently step up and down on the comforter or duvet to loosen any grime or dust that may have collected within its folds.
After doing one side of the bedding, turn it over and work your way across the other side. Continue until you feel you’ve adequately stepped over the whole surface of the bedding item.
Ensure your feet are clean before beginning this process.
Soaking the bedding outside in a children’s pool on a nice day makes the drying process easier than it would be inside, since you need only move the bedding item from the pool to the laundry line.

If the mattress gets wet, it could easily get mildew.


Never saturate the mattress with water or a cleaning agent.
Instead of using a steam cleaner or a wet rag, you should use a spray bottle. You are less likely to get the mattress excessively wet if you mist the mattress with a small amount of water using a spray bottle., To get stains out of a foam mattress, you will need vinegar, baking soda or an enzymatic commercial cleaner. Enzymatic cleaners work very well, but vinegar is a trusted option that is also inexpensive.You can use a mix of half white vinegar and half water in a spray bottle.

Follow the directions on the bottle of enzymatic cleaner.

, After spraying a moderate amount of cleaning agent on the stain, let it sit for five minutes., After the cleaning agent has had a chance to break down the stain, use a clean rag to remove it. Use a dabbing, up and down motion, as opposed to a circular rubbing motion.If you rub the cleaning agent around too much, you could end up spreading the stain.

, Let the baking soda sit on the stain overnight. In the morning, vacuum up the baking soda. This process should help remove any odors associated with the stain., Since foam mattresses do not do well when they are wet, you need to get your mattress dry as soon as possible.

If the detergent container does not provide specific directions for use with heavy winter bedding, just use slightly less than the amount suggested for the smallest load.
For instance, if the detergent manufacturer recommends filling the detergent cup to the first line, fill the detergent cup 75% of the way to the first fill line.

, Run the bedding through the wash cycle once with detergent. Then run the duvet or comforter through the washing machine again without detergent. This will give it extra time to wash out excess detergent that may have soaked into the fabric.Ensure you wash the comforter on delicate during both the first and second washing cycles.

, Front-loading washing machines allow bedding to tumble around gently and have a lower potential for tearing than do top-loading washing machines, which can cause fabric to wrap around the central agitator.

Memory foam mattresses. These mattresses are made from a material that molds to the shape of your body when you lie down, and holds that shape while you are sleeping. These are a good option for people who don't tend to move around a lot during the night. They retain body heat, so you may not want to go with memory foam if you tend to get hot while you sleep.
Sleep number mattresses. These mattresses can be made harder or softer with the touch of a button. They are usually divided into different zones, so that your partner's side can have a different level of firmness than yours.
Look into brand names, but don't be too biased. Sometimes brand names are better, but that doesn't mean you should overlook cheaper non-brand makes. A well-known name does not imply quality, though often times there is good reason for such a reputation. The important thing is to test mattresses in person and figure out what feels best for your own body.
Understand that a high coil count doesn't necessarily translate into a higher-quality mattress. Mattresses with interlocking coils have coils that lock together. Mattresses with independent coils have a larger number of coils and are better for light sleepers, because they won't fluctuate as much with movement--especially when your partner shifts or gets out of bed.;
, Take the following elements into consideration:


Are you a side, back, or stomach sleeper? Some mattresses are designed to accommodate specific sleeping positions.
Do you have mobility issues? Some mattresses are designed to make getting in and out of bed easier.
Measure yourself and your sleeping partner. For most couples, a queen size bed will be large enough. If you are more than six feet tall, a king-size mattress may be a better choice. For a slender and tall mattress, go with the California king size.

, Some mattresses cost many thousands of dollars, and others are under $500. Knowing exactly how much you're willing to spend before going to the store can eliminate confusion and prevent you from being talked into buying a mattress that's out of your price range.


The average market price for a solid mattress and box-frame set hovers around $800, with the costs of a quality bed ranging upwards of over $1500. If you can find a deal under your maximum price, go for it.
Mattress stores sell a lot of extras, like mattress covers, pillow tops, bed frames, and other items you don't necessarily need. Know exactly what you're willing to buy before stepping into the store. Your mattress will work just as well without accessories, so don't buy them unless you want to.

Invest in a bed with built features.",How to Choose the Right Size Bed," New furniture, like a bed, can be very expensive. By establishing a budget, you'll prevent yourself from overspending. In many cases, you can even narrow down online search results to only show models in your budgeted range.


By using online search features that narrow down models of bed according to price, you'll also save yourself from becoming too attached to models outside your price range.;
, Before you make any new bed purchases, you'll need to measure the space available in your room. Some beds may be too large for small rooms, or some beds may be too wide for narrow spaces.


Take a tape measure and determine the length and width of available space in your room.
Think about the space a person will need to move around the room freely. A bed that is too big may make it difficult to move easily through the room.
Note any protruding parts of the room, like low sills or pronounced molding. These can create obstacles for higher beds., Beds intended for elderly occupants might need to be lower in height. Children may want specialty beds, like bunk beds, canopy beds, or beds shaped like racing cars or spaceships. High school students might want loft beds they can take to college in a few years.


If possible, you may want to ask the person who will be sleeping in the bed what kind of bed they would enjoy most., If you're just starting out life as a young person, you'll probably want an economic, durable bed that fits relatively small spaces. You may not have much space in your dorm room or in the bedroom of a shared apartment, so smaller beds would be ideal in this case. However:If you are more established in your career, have a romantic partner, are planning on getting married, or are in a similar situation, a larger bed will likely be preferable.
If the bed you are buying is for a guest room and you only intend on using it for a guest room, a generic bed would likely be best., You can always re-paint a room to change its color scheme to suit the tones of your furniture, but the furniture you'll be pairing with your new bed should be taken into consideration as well. Generally, furniture of similar style and construction work well as a whole set. For example:If the majority of the furniture in the room you'll be adding a bed to is made of a dark wood, like black walnut, you might choose a bed made of a similar material.
If most of your furniture is black, you might achieve a contemporary look with a bed that has a black painted wooden frame.

, You may have accounted for height when thinking about the bed's occupant, but the height of your bed also plays a crucial role in storage and comfort. Taller beds will not only be more comfortable for taller people, but will also have more storage space underneath.


You may have to take wall protrusions into consideration when thinking about bed height. For example, a room with a low protruding sill might accommodate a low bed but not a high one., Different sizes of bed suit different age groups and phases of life. Young kids, for example, won't need more than a crib or toddler mattress. A twin mattress should be suitable for most older children and young adults. Twin mattresses can be small for adults, in which case the twin XL, an excellent choice for tight spaces, is best. Common sizes beyond these include:



Full beds, sometimes called doubles, are 53"" (1.35 m) wide and approximately 75"" (1.9 m) long. This bed may be short for some adults.

Queen beds are generally 60"" (1.52 m) wide and 80"" (2.03 m) long. The extra space in queen sizes make it a better fit for couples.

King size beds will be about 76"" (1.93 m) wide and 80"" (2.03 m) long. This allows for the most space a couple can have with a single bed.

California King size beds are mostly available on the west coast. These beds are 4"" (10.2 cm) narrower but 4"" (10.2 cm) longer., You never know how a bed will feel until you lay down on it yourself. Even if you plan on buying a mattress online, you should head to a brick-and-mortar mattress store to try it out before purchasing. Test mattresses by:


Removing your shoes and positioning yourself as you would normally lay down on your bed.
Changing your position several times, allowing your weight to settle after each time you re-position yourself.
Taking your time while laying on the bed. It may take you up to 15 minutes before you are fully settled on the mattress., A loft is a kind of bed that is raised off the ground. To get into this kind of bed you usually climb into it with a ladder.Loft beds allow you to store furniture, like desks, shelving, and seating, beneath your bed.


Many furniture stores sell pre-made lofts. These can usually be assembled with simple tools.
If you're somewhat handy and are looking to save some money, you might build your own loft bed.

, If you have less space in your home, you might want your spare bedroom to double as an office, a puzzle room, a TV room, and so on. Some beds fold up out of sight so that you can use a room for purposes besides a bedroom. Use these to get more function out of your rooms.


Some hideaway beds are designed to fold into walls. You may want to make use of this option to make your spare bed all but disappear when it's not in use., Western style futons are a special kind of bed that can also fold into a couch. If you don't have a spare room for guests, a futon in your family room or living room can be used as a bed when necessary.


When considering a futon, prioritize models with plush, durable cushioning. Futons with poor cushioning can be quite uncomfortable.

, Some beds have built in storage, like drawers and cubbies.Other kinds of bed may have furniture attached or built in, like a desk or bookshelf.These kinds of bed can be expensive, but can save you the cost of having to buy a separate piece of furniture down the road.

Try several mattress stores.,
Test mattresses in the mattress showrooms.,
Feel free to negotiate.",How to Choose a Mattress2," Look online for reviews of mattress stores in your area, and plan to visit more than one. This will give you a broader view of the available options. If you see a mattress you love at the first location, you can always go back.

, Get a feel for different mattress types by trying out mattresses of varying levels of thickness and firmness. If a mattress doesn't feel comfortable in the showroom, it probably won't feel better at home.


Test more expensive mattresses first, to experience what a high quality mattress feels like. Compare it to the lower end mattresses until you find one that meets your requirements for both comfort and cost.
Spend more than 10 seconds lying on each mattress. Allow yourself to actually rest for a minute. If you're too tense or impatient with the process you won't get to experience how it actually feels to rest on the mattress, and you may be disappointed once you bring it home.

, Most mattress salespeople are open to throwing in a few extras or lowering the price to make the sale. If you're paying full price, ask if they'll include a box spring, bed frame or pillow top.


Make sure your mattress comes with a warranty, so that you'll be able to return it to the store if you change your mind or if it turns out to be defective. Most warranties allow you to return the mattress within 30 to 60 days.
Most mattress purchases include free delivery, and some companies will dispose of your old mattress.

"
"
Make the most of your trial period.,
If necessary, return the mattress.",How to Choose a Mattress3," It takes a little while for the body to get accustomed to a new mattress, so start really paying attention to the way it makes you feel after about three days. Think about these questions:


How many hours of sleep do you get on the new mattress?
Do you toss and turn or sleep soundly?
Do you feel achy or sore during the day?
Does your back feel supported, or do you sink into the mattress uncomfortably?
Do you feel well rested, regardless of how much sleep you get?

, If you aren't sleeping well on your new bed, it's best to return it. Start the process of choosing and buying a mattress again, taking into account the factors that made the old one inappropriate for your needs.

Pick sheets based on your mattress size.,
Measure your mattress's height.,
Choose the appropriate pocket size based on height.,
Go for cotton sheets as your first choice.,
Consider bamboo sheets if you want an eco friendly option.,
Go for a linen sheet if you live in a hot climate.,
Pick the right weave.,
Pick an appropriate thread count.,
Pay attention to finish.,
Look at what types of dyes are used.,
Pick the right color.",How to Buy Sheets," Sheets are measured based on the size of your mattress. At a department store, sheets should be listed as twin, full, double twin, king, queen, California king, and so on. A sheet's label should give you a sense of whether It's appropriate for your bed.For twin beds, the standard measurement is usually 66 by 90 inches for a flat sheet and 39 times 75 for a fitted sheet. However, some twins are double twins. These are the kinds typically found in a college dorm. For a double twin, go for 39 by 80 inch fitted sheet. You can get by with a flat sheet fitted for a standard twin bed.
For a full sized bed, the standard size of a flat sheet is 81x96 inches. For a fitted sheet, go for 54x75 inches.
For a king sized bed, you'll need a 108x102 inch flat sheet and a 78x80 inch fitted sheet. For a queen sized bed, you'll need a 90x102 inch queen sheet and a 60x80 inch fitted sheet.;
, Mattresses come in various heights. Some mattresses are thicker than others. When picking sheets, you'll need to know the height of your mattress. Take a tape measure and measure the side of the mattress. Most standard mattresses are 7 to 9 inches high, while some can be as much as 16 to 22 inches high., The pocket size of sheets varies. The pocket size you need depends on the height of your mattress.A mattress that is 7 to 12 inches high will need a 7 to 9 inch pocket depth.
A mattress that is 13 to 17 inches high will require a pocket depth of 10 to 15 inches.
A mattress between 18 and 25 inches needs a pocket depth 15 to 22 inches.

, Cotton is usually the best option when it comes to material. Cotton sheets tend to be the most breathable and comfortable, and also last a long time. They are also less prone to wrinkles.Egyptian and pima cotton are generally the best options.
You should also look for 100% organic cotton. Many brands of cotton are mislabeled and actually contain a lot of synthetic ingredients, so make sure you read the label and look for verification that the material is 100% cotton.

, Bamboo sheets are often blended with cotton or other materials. They have become more popular recently. Many people enjoy bamboo sheets as they're made from sustainable materials. If you want an eco friendly option, consider going for bamboo.Bamboo also sops up moisture easily. If you tend to sweat a lot at night, go for bamboo sheets.

, If you live in a hot environment, you may want to go for linen sheets. Linen sheets tend to be highly breathable. They tend to reduce overall body heat, so they can be refreshing in a warm environment.The one downside to linen sheets is that they wrinkle easily. You will have to do a lot of ironing if you select linen sheets.

, Weave refers to the manner in which your sheets are made. Weave is important as it tends to affect the feel of the sheets. Make sure to choose a weave that works for you.A sateen weave provides a softer feel. If you want crisper sheets, go for a percale weave.
Jersey sheets, also known as t-shirt sheets, tend to have a very slippery feel. They're usually best avoided. However, if you're on a budget and don't mind a slippery, heavier feel, you may want to opt for Jersey sheets. They may be cheaper than other brands.
If you live in a cool environment, go for nubby cotton flannel sheets. They tend to keep you very warm.

, The thread count of a sheet affects its softness. Many people believe a higher thread count means softer sheets. However, many manufacturer's exaggerate thread count, so this is not necessarily always the case. In general, a thread count of over 200 is recommended for comfort. Anything above 800 is probably unnecessary.You can identify fabricated thread counts by thread type. Thread that is 2-ply is often twisted around itself to create a higher thread count. However, as the thread is of less high quality, this does not mean the sheets will be softer. Be wary of sheets made from 2-ply thread., Most sheets are finished with a chemical process to keep them from wrinkling. If you're not adverse to chemical-based products, wrinkle free sheets can require a lot less upkeep. However, if you're wary about chemicals, look for sheets labeled as organic., If you're buying a patterned sheet, it may use a lot of dye. Your sheets may feel stiff and uncomfortable if you don't wash them a few times before use.If you have a sensitivity to any type of dye, avoid getting sheets that contain that product.

, Most varieties of sheets come in many different colors and patterns. Ideally, you'll want colors that match the scheme of your room. For example, if you have a room with blue wallpaper, you may want to go with blue sheets.


Keep in mind dark colors hide stains better. If you're buying sheets for a very young child, who may have an accident in the bed, go for darker sheets.

Consider waveless ratings.,
Determine the best number and ideal thickness of fiber layers.,
Try out both hard and soft sided water beds.",How to Choose a Water Bed1," Probably the most essential aspect of choosing the best water bed for your needs is finding one with the right amount of movement. The wave effect is what sets the water bed apart from a traditional mattress. However, too much movement can be uncomfortable or keep you up at night. The waveless rating indicates how quickly the mattress returns to stability after movement. Most water beds come with a waveless rating between 100 and 85%.


100% waveless mattresses return to stability almost immediately after movement. These typically utilize pockets of air, water, and fiber layers within the mattress to achieve maximum stability.
100-95% waveless mattresses move for a few seconds before calming. These are the most common type of water bed mattress. They make entering and exiting the bed comfortable, and feel very much like a non-water mattress.
90-85% waveless mattresses can move for several seconds each time you shift positions. If you are looking for a water bed that offers a rocking, cradling movement to help you sleep, this range may be ideal.
85% or less waveless mattress are what you would call full-motion water beds. Typically, these are hard sided water beds with one, large water bladder inside them. This is what most people think of when they think of water beds. However, for most people, these mattresses will not likely offer adequate support.;
, The goal of a water bed is to cradle the body relieving stress on all pressure points. However, some water mattresses are too soft, and they create a hammock effect where the body dips down in the middle and lifts up at the head and feet. Layers of fiber material improve the support and stability offered by water beds and allow you to sleep more comfortably.


The more layers, the greater amount of support and least hammocking effect.
Thicker fiber layers move more slowly creating less wave when you shift positions., There are two main varieties of water bed, and it’s important that you understand the difference and try out both. Hard sided water beds are the traditional type where a water mattress is held in shape by a specially crafted bed frame. Soft sided water beds are more like traditional mattresses. A foundation and edges are crafted from soft foam, and the water mattress fits into these softer materials.


Hard sided mattresses offer greater motion, but are often large. You’ll need to adjust the rest of your furnishing to match the specially crafted bed frame, and you will also need special bedding to fit the mattress. California bedding sizes are necessary for hard sided water bed mattresses.
Soft sided mattresses are more like traditional mattresses. They can often be placed on your existing bed frame, and they can be covered with traditional bed linens."

Lay the duvet on the bed.,
Turn the duvet cover inside out.,
Grab the corners of the duvet.,
Shake the duvet cover onto the duvet.,
Spread the duvet onto the bed.",How to Change a Duvet Cover1," Lay the duvet comforter flat on the mattress so it is all spread out.Be sure that the long side of the duvet is running lengthwise on the bed, and the shorter side of the duvet is running the width of the bed. Also make sure that the tag on the duvet is at the head of the bed.


Having the tag at the head of the bed will ensure that the tag ends up at the bottom of the duvet cover when you insert the duvet into the cover.;
, Stand at the foot of the bed and spread the duvet cover out and on top of the duvet, with the open end of the duvet cover near you. This doesn’t have to be perfectly neat, just spread out enough that you can see the different corners of the duvet cover. Reach your hands into the duvet cover through the bottom opening.Reach until you can grab onto the two top corners of the cover near the head of the bed.


Grab the left corner with your left hand, and the right corner with your right hand. Pull these two inside corners toward you, out through the duvet cover opening, to turn the cover inside out.Once the duvet cover is turned inside out, once again lay it over the duvet with the opening of the cover near you.

, With the duvet cover inside out, once again reach through the cover opening to grab onto the two top corners of the cover.Once you have a hold on the top two corners of the duvet cover, bring your hands down near the end of the bed to grab onto the bottom two corners of the actual duvet comforter.Your hands should look like you’re wearing mittens as your grab the bottom two corners of the duvet.
This would be the time that you would fasten any closures that the duvet or duvet cover has so the corners of the duvet stay in place within the cover while you use the blanket. These closures might be buttons or some sort of tying arrangement.
You may have to momentarily remove your hands from inside the duvet cover to fasten these closures. Once they are fastened, you can reinsert your hands into the cover.

, Through the duvet cover's two top corners, hold tightly onto the two bottom corners of the actual duvet. Flip the duvet cover over your hands while still holding onto the duvet corners, and shake the cover on to the duvet.Be sure to hold on tight as you shake the duvet cover onto the duvet. This will help ensure that all corners of the duvet are spread out to all corners inside the duvet cover.
Powerfully shake the duvet and duvet cover as if you are trying to wave a blanket evenly onto a bed.You can also stand on the edge of the bed and hold the top two corners of the duvet and duvet cover, to evenly shake the cover over the duvet.
You may have to pull the last portion of the cover over the bottom of the duvet and tuck in the corners.

, Once the duvet is completely inside the duvet cover, fasten the inside closures on the two bottom corners of the duvet and duvet cover (if your duvet and duvet cover have any). Once the inside closures are secure, you can close the duvet cover opening at the foot of the bed.Give your duvet a little shake and pull on all side to make sure the duvet is spread out evenly.

Remove uneaten food.,
Rinse the collection cup.,
Wipe away any salt creep you see.,
Remove ten percent of the water.,
Clean the glass panes of the tank.,
Vacuum the substrate.,
Wipe the protein skimmer.,
Rinse the prefilters.,
Mix and add new salt water to the tank.,
Clean the aquarium and lighting fixture covers.,
Clean the air intake hose and skimmer.,
Deep clean the hoses every few months.",How to Clean a Saltwater Tank," While you should only be feeding the fish in your tank enough food for them to consume within an hour, there may occasionally be food leftover. Take a net and skim the uneaten food out of the tank. Do this an hour after you've fed your fish.If you leave uneaten food in your saltwater tank, it can decay and make the water cloudy.;
, At least once a week you should remove the collection cup from your protein skimmer. Dump the dirty, brown water out of the cup and rinse the cup with fresh water. Place it back in the protein skimmer.If you wait to dump the collection cup, the skimmer won't be as effective in cleaning the water and the cup may even overflow with thick, foamy water.

, As saltwater evaporates from your tank, a crusty, white salt residue will build up on power cords or near the top of the tank. Dip a clean cloth in fresh water and wipe away the salt. Use a dry cloth to dry the cords or tank.You should check for salt creep every day. It's a lot easier to remove salt creep if there's only a little of it. Excessive salt creep can actually wear down your cords and tank.

, You should replace about 10 percent of the tank's water every two weeks. Turn off the power to the tank and take off the cover glass. Use a siphon to take ten percent of the water out of the tank. It should go into a bucket. Discard the old water.Take the opportunity to clean filters, hoses, and pumps before you add the new salt water.

, You can use a simple kitchen sponge to scrub the inside and outside of the tank glass. Ensure that the sponge doesn't contain a rough side that would scratch the glass. Or you can an algae scraper that will remove algae that's stuck on the glass. You can even buy a magnet cleaner that will make it easier to clean the inside of the tank without sticking your arm in.If the glass becomes dirty, you may need to clean it more frequently. Try cleaning the glass every other day.

, Be in the habit of vacuum cleaning the gravel or substrate when you change the water. Many gravel vacuums use a pump to suck the algae and detritus from the surface of the substrate. When you use the vacuum ensure that there's a fine mesh screen, so you don't accidentally suck up the gravel itself or small organisms.Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the vacuum. You'll generally have to hold the vacuum a few inches above the substrate when you clean it.

, Every few weeks you should wipe the neck of the protein skimmer clean. This will make the skimmer more efficient and prevent dirty buildup. To clean the neck, just take a paper towel or clean cloth and wipe the neck clean.If you notice slimy, gunky buildup, you may need to take the skimmer apart and soak it in vinegar. Rinse it clean and reinstall it.

, Remove the prefilters from your tank and rinse them under fresh, running water. Reinstall the prefilters. Try to do this every two weeks, so they don't become clogged with organisms or dirt.If your prefilter hasn't been cleaned in a while and doesn't become clean after rinsing it, you may need to buy a replacement filter.

, Follow the instructions on a bag of commercial salt mix and add dechlorinated tap water to combine new salt water to add back to the tank. Remember to check the temperature and salinity before you slowly pour the new water into the tank. Turn the power back on and put the cover glass back onto the tank.To check the temperature, look at the thermometer in the tank. To check water salinity, use a hydrometer or a refractometer. You'll drop a sample of water onto a plate glass and visually inspect where the water registers on the salinity scale.

, About once a month you should remove the aquarium cover glass and the plastic lighting cover. You'll probably see white, crusty residue from the water. Take a damp cloth or paper towel and wipe off the salt creep.If the residue doesn't come off, it's probably calcium deposit. To clean calcium deposits, soak a sponge or cloth in white vinegar and scrub the deposit away.

, Take the air intake hose and valves from the protein skimmer off and clean them once a month. Soak these parts in white vinegar for about an hour. Take a small aquarium brush and remove any calcium deposits that you see. Rinse the parts off and return them to the protein skimmer.If the intake hose and valves become clogged with calcium, the skimmer won't effectively make foam.

, Spend some time removing all of the algae you see on the pump, filters, and parts of the aquarium. You can use an aquarium brush to scrape away the algae or soak the part in white vinegar, so you can easily scrub away the algae. Do this every other month or as soon as you notice gunk building up in the tank. Focus on deep cleaning these parts of the tank:Protein skimmer
Return pump
Biofilter overflow box
Powerhead
Heater
Thermometer

Talk to people who own water beds.,
Research water bed retailers in your area.,
Visit a water bed retailer.",How to Choose a Water Bed2," If you don’t know anyone who is currently using or who has used a water mattress, you can find reviews online. In some cases, water bed owners will even include videos of themselves getting into and out of the bed, and discussing their comfort levels. If you’d like to ask questions, you can try reaching out water bed owners via online question and answer forums like Yahoo! Answers or through the comments sections of various online water bed retailers.

, It’s important to tryout any mattress prior to investing in it. However, this becomes even more important when choosing a new water bed, especially if you’ve never had one before. Look for furniture stores that carry water beds or water bed specific suppliers in your area.


Search online for furniture retailers. If water beds aren’t listed, call to ask if they carry them.
Search online for mattress retail locations in your area, and call to see if they carry water beds.
If your local furniture or mattress retailers do not offer water beds, they may be able to direct you to a location where you can test out or purchase a water bed.
You may want to consider ordering a water bed online, but make sure they allow in home trials and returns as you won’t be able to test the mattress in advance.

, Once you find a location where water beds are sold, you’ll want to go to the water bed store to try out the available types of water beds. Call ahead to make sure the retailer has water beds available for you to try. Even though they sell water beds, the store may not have any on display. However, some locations are willing to set up water beds for you to try.


There are some online and in store retailers who will allow you to test water beds in your home and return them if you are unhappy.
Even if you are able to test a water bed mattress in a store, ask about return policies and at home trials. A mattress that seems comfortable for a few moments in a store may not seem as comfortable after several nights of sleep."

Measure your room and bedframe.,
Position the bed close enough to outlets for your thermostat.,
Purchase bedding for your water bed.,
Clean your water bed.,
Treat the water.,
Have a repair kit on hand.",How to Choose a Water Bed3," Make sure you have plenty of room to place and fill your water bed. This is especially important, if you are purchasing a hard sided water bed that can take up significantly more space than a traditional bed frame. Measure your room and bedframe, and find the best position for your water bed before you place it. In order to move a water bed, you will need to completely drain and refill it, so taking extra time to find the right position in advance is important., You want to be careful not to cause serious electrocution concerns, when filling your water bed, but you’ll need to be near enough to an outlet to keep your water bed heater plugged in. The heating element of the mattress should be at the opposite end of the mattress from the fill point for your safety. Without a temperature regulating system, water beds are very cold. It’s important to find and maintain a temperature that is comfortable. The heat also provides additional stress relief for the joints.Always unplug your water mattress heater prior to opening the fill point of your water bed.

, Soft sided water mattresses can usually be fitted with traditional bed linens, but you should ask the retailer you purchase from about special bedding sizes. Most hard sided water beds need California size bedding., If you want you water mattress to last, it’s important that you care for the vinyl. Overtime, vinyl absorbs skin, oils, fibers, and dust. It can become hard making the water bed less comfortable and increasing the risk for punctures. Vinyl cleaners remove this buildup and keep the material softer. You should change your sheets and clean the vinyl mattress carefully at least once a month., Like standing water anywhere, the water inside your water mattress can become stagnant. You will need to purchase water treatments and apply them as directed. Typically, water treatments come in the form of a tablet or drops that simply need to be released into the fill spout of your mattress once a month. It’s often easiest to administer these water treatments at the same time you clean your mattress and change your linens. Once a year, you should completely drain and refill the mattress., Even if you are extremely careful with your water bed, leaks still happen. It’s important to have a repair kit on hand at all times to seal any punctures or tears right away. One or two leaks are not necessarily a concern, but if your mattress has numerous punctures or rips, it may be time to replace it."
"
Bring your partner along to try out beds.,
Ask your new partner how you can help them adjust to a water bed.,
Consider dual mattresses.,
Look into water tubes.",How to Choose a Water Bed4," If you are sharing your bed prior to purchasing a water mattress, make sure to include your bed partner in the purchase process. You both need to be comfortable with the amount of support, movement, and temperature associated with the water bed. Try out mattresses together, and choose one that best meets both of your needs., If you already own a water bed and are now sharing with a partner, the adjustment process can be more difficult. If you have a full motion mattress, you may need to invest in a mattress with a higher waveless rating when sharing space with others. In some cases, you may also be able to purchase mattress covers or retainers that reduce motion. If temperature is your concern, you can use extra padding to reduce heat for one partner or the other., If you and your partner are similar in size and weight, the mattress selection process is less difficult. However, if you and your partner are significantly different heights or weights, the selection may be more complicated as a see-saw effect can occur where the weight of one partner lifts the other during sleep. In these cases, a dual mattress may be your best option. These can be fitted into a hard sided or soft sided frame, but they allow you and your bed partner to specify your own comfort levels. Additionally, your movements will not have a dramatic effect on your partner compared with a single water mattress., Rather than a single or double flat mattress, you can also have a series of connected tubules. This reduces movement overall, and because each tube is separated, your weight and movement have less effect on your partner. These mattresses are typically thinner than other water beds, and while they have higher waveless ratings, they do not offer the same level of support available from traditional water beds with fiber layers. You’re also more likely to touch the bottom of your bed frame."

Invert the duvet cover.,
Unroll the duvet and duvet cover.",How to Change a Duvet Cover2," Just how you turned the duvet cover inside out in the first method, you’re going to turn your duvet cover inside out for this second method. Reach in through the bottom opening of the duvet cover and grab the two top, inside corners.Pull these inside corners down and out through the cover opening.


Once the duvet cover is inside out, hold onto the corners and shake it a bit to spread the cover out over the bed.
Be sure that the duvet cover opening is at the foot of the bed., Fully spread out the duvet comforter on top of the duvet cover.Make sure the duvet corners align neatly with the duvet cover corners.


The long side of both the duvet and duvet cover should run along the length of the bed, and the short side of both the duvet and duvet cover should run along the width of the bed.

, If your duvet and duvet cover have fasteners on the corners to keep the duvet corners secured into the corners of the duvet cover, attach those now.


These fasteners might be small buttons and buttonholes, elastic pieces with buttons, or small strings that tie together.

, From the top of the bed, roll the duvet and duvet cover down to the end of the bed.Roll as if you are rolling a burrito. Try your best to roll both the duvet and duvet covers evenly all the way to the end of the bed.


If you are by yourself, you can roll the duvet and duvet cover from the middle of the bed. If you have someone to help you, you both can stand on the sides of the bed, and roll evenly, together., Once completely rolled at the foot of the bed, put your hand in the duvet cover opening, and grab the entire rolled side portion of your duvet and duvet cover.Flip the side of the duvet cover over the side portion you are still holding onto. Once the duvet cover is flipped over the one side of the roll, do the exact same thing on the other side of the roll.


When both sides of the roll have been flipped and are covered by the sides of the duvet cover, even out the rest of the duvet. Flip the middle portion of the duvet cover over the middle portion of the duvet., Unroll the duvet and duvet cover back up toward the top of the bed.Fasten the opening of the duvet cover either by buttoning or zipping the cover flaps together. Shake out the corners and sides of the duvet to flatten out and bunched up areas.


You can use this same rolling and unrolling method to also removing your duvet cover.

Learn about mattress firmness ratings.,
Choose a medium-firm mattress.,
Avoid extra-firm or plush mattresses.,
Choose an innerspring for the best buy.,
Consider splurging on an adjustable air.,
Consider the advantages and disadvantages of memory foam.,
Ask your doctor for a recommendation.",How to Choose a Mattress when You Have Back Problems1," There's no definitive, industry-wide scale for mattress firmness. However, you'll find most mattresses labeled on a scale from extra-firm to extra-plush. Your ideal mattress firmness should be somewhere in the middle of this scale.Mattress firmness scales aren't uniform across all manufacturers, so ask a store salesperson if their mattresses typically run softer or firmer.
When you ask, don't immediately indicate whether you prefer one option over the other. That way, you'll have a better shot at getting a more objective answer.;
, For most patients who suffer from back problems, a medium-firm mattress is the best choice. It provides ample support, but balances support and comfort.You should weigh support and comfort equally. A mattress that provides support but isn’t comfortable will increase stress and joint pressure.

, Medical professionals used to recommend extra-firm mattresses for people with back problems. However, more patients report better results after switching to a medium-firm mattress. Extra-plush mattress should always be avoided, as they provide minimal support and cause the spine to sag., Innerspring mattresses are typically the most affordable and longest lasting options.The best models are reversible to allow periodic flipping and contain 600 to 1000 coils.


The thickness of the individual coils determines the mattress firmness. Medium-firm to firm innerspring mattresses contain coils that are 2.2 to 2.4 millimeters in diameter.
Some inner springs also contain a top foam or memory foam layer. Coil thickness has more to do with the mattress firmness than the top layer, so pay more attention to coil thickness than to the top layer.

, Adjustable air mattresses are more expensive than innersprings and can be adjusted to your desired firmness using an electric pump.Models that have an additional inflatable lumbar support can offer relief to those who suffer from lower back pain.If you sleep with a partner, the biggest pro to an adjustable air is the option to adjust individual halves to suit your preferences.
Keep in mind there’s no definitive evidence that proves an adjustable air mattress is better for back problems than an innerspring.

, Memory foam works well if you don't move positions while you sleep, but takes a while to mold to your body if you change positions. Keep in mind alternating sleeping positions helps ease back problems. Memory foam can also retain body heat, so you might want to avoid it if you get hot at night.If you like the feel of a memory foam mattress, choose a high-density foam option. Foam mattresses with a higher density are better quality., There are a wide range of issues that cause back pain and discomfort. If you haven't already, see your doctor or spine specialist for an accurate diagnosis.


Ask them to give you tips on mattress selection and sleeping positions that can help ease your specific condition.

Add chlorine bleach to the tank.,
Fill the rest of the tank with water.,
Leave the mixture in the tank for 24 hours.,
Check the amount of chlorine in your solution periodically.,
Drain the tank completely.",How to Clean a Plastic Water Tank," The first step to cleaning your tank is to empty all of the water from it. To do so, open the outlet valve or tap at the bottom of your tank and let all of the water flow out.

Connect a hose to the open valve in order to direct the water to a location where it will not cause any localized flooding or erosion.
Permanent water tanks have a washout valve that is located at the base of the tank. If your water tank is permanent and contains a washout valve, use this to drain the tank instead of the regular outlet valve or tap.;
, Since the outlet valve or tap is usually located above the bottom of the tank, you may need to remove some remaining water from the tank after draining it. To do so, use a bucket to scoop as much water out as possible. Once the water in the bottom is too shallow to scoop with a bucket, use a plastic cup or coffee mug to continue scooping it out.

, You probably won’t be able to get all of the water out by scooping it up with a bucket or cup. Remove the remaining water using one of the following methods:

Use a wet/dry vacuum to suck up any water that remains.
If you have a small tank and can safely tip it up, you can do this to drain any remaining water from the tank.
Once you’ve got all but a very small amount of water out of the tank, you can use towels to soak up any water that remains., While you may be able to remove a lot of the sediment and residue from your tank without using a cleaning mixture, using one can help make this job easier. Simply mix hot water with laundry detergent powder or liquid to make a cleaning solution., Use a bristle brush or abrasive sponge to scrub the inside of the tank, with or without your cleaning solution. Move your arm horizontally from side to side while applying a good amount of pressure on the brush or sponge. Continue doing this around the entire inside of the tank, until you remove as much slime and sludge as possible.


You may need to use a brush with a long handle, depending on the size of your tank. This type of brush may be more difficult to maneuver, but will allow you to reach the bottom of the tank safely. If you’re using a long-handled brush, you’ll probably need to move the brush up and down vertically instead of horizontally.Avoid brushes with steel bristles or sponges made of steel. Plastic can scratch easily and these materials will probably be too harsh for a plastic tank., You can also use a power washer to clean the inside of your water tank. You can use the power washer by itself or in conjunction with scrubbing the inside of the tank, depending how tough the sediment and residue is to remove.Pressure washers come in a variety of sizes and strengths, but one with a pressure range between 1,300 and 2,400 psi works best for most household tasks. Follow these steps to clean the inside of your tank with a power washer:

Fill your power washer with water or cleaning solution.
Start by holding it about four feet away from the surface you’re cleaning. Move closer until you find the distance that works best for removing dirt, sediment, and debris.
Hold the pressure washer so the water hits the interior wall of the tank at a 45 degree angle.
Continue this until you are satisfied that you’ve removed all the dirt and sludge from the walls of your tank.
Pressure washers are very powerful, so always wear safety goggles when you’re using them, never point them at another person or animal, and follow all other safety regulations. It is also a good idea to have someone with knowledge of power washers give you a lesson on starting and using them before using yours., If you’re having trouble getting all of the sediment and dirt off the interior walls of your tank, try sprinkling the walls with baking soda and scrubbing them with your brush or sponge., While you are scrubbing, pay special attention to corners and joints in your tank. Residue stuck in these areas can be difficult to clean, so you may need to spend a little extra time getting into these areas. Try using a small toothbrush to help you reach and scrub these difficult places., Once you’re satisfied that you’ve scrubbed most or all of the residue from the inside of your tank, you need to rinse it very thoroughly. This is best done by using a hose to spray down the interior walls, making sure to get into all the nooks and corners. You can also use a pressure washer filled with clean water to do this.

Alternatively, you can rinse the tank by filling it with hot water and letting it stand for several hours. Drain the tank, making sure you collect and safely dispose of the drained water. Repeat this process until the water is completely free of detergent and sediment., Some water tanks may not allow you to drain all of the liquid from them. For example, if your tank is too large to tip on its side and spray out, you probably won’t be able to spray all of the detergent and residue out of the tank. In order to remove this residue, you can vacuum it out with the hose attachment of a wet/dry vacuum. Make sure you get the hose into the cracks, crevices, and corners of your tank in order to remove all of the residue.

After vacuuming, you may need to take a clean rag or mop head and run it along the bottom of your tank to clean any areas that still have sediment on them.

, Pour some of your cleaning solution into these pipes and hoses. Then, use your water pump to pump the solution through the pipes, removing any sediment and dirt inside them. Complete the same process with hot water until the pipes and hoses are free of detergent., Once you’ve scrubbed out the inside of your tank, you can then perform the process of disinfecting it. To start, use a hose to fill your tank three quarters of the way full with clean water., Next, add chlorine bleach to the tank in the ratio of 50 ppm (parts per million) to the amount of water. Follow these guidelines to determine how much household chlorine bleach (5% bleach) to use in your tank:


For a 250 gallon tank, use 4 cups of bleach.
For a 500 gallon tank, use ½ gallon of bleach.
For a 750 gallon tank, use ¾ gallon of bleach.
For a 1,000 gallon tank, use 1 gallon of bleach.

, After adding the appropriate amount of bleach, fill the tank to volume with clean water. This will allow the bleach to mix with the rest of the water in the tank., Once you have the tank filled with chlorine and water, leave this solution sit inside the tank for 24 hours. Be sure no one comes in contact with the solution during this time because it can be harmful to people and animals., During the 24 hour period that you are letting the solution sit inside your tank, use chlorine strips to periodically check the solution to see the amount of chlorine. You want to maintain a measurable chlorine reading throughout the entire 24 hour process. To check this, dip one end of the chlorine strip in the solution and follow the instructions on the packaging to determine how much chlorine is present. If there is no detectable amount of chlorine, repeat steps two through four., Using a hose, drain all of the solution out of your water tank. Hook the hose up to the valve on the bottom of your tank and allow all of the solution to flow out toward your sewage system. Make sure you point the hose away from any vegetation, lakes, and any other areas that may be damaged by the chlorine bleach in the mixture. Do not drain the tank directly into your water distribution system either.

Remove any remaining liquid by scooping it out with a bucket and then using towels, a clean mop head, or a wet/dry vacuum to pick up the rest.

Place plywood under your mattress to see if you need more firmness.,
Take your time testing mattresses at multiple stores.,
Test mattresses at hotels and at the homes of friends and relatives.,
Check the return policy before making a purchase.",How to Choose a Mattress when You Have Back Problems2," If you think you might need a firmer mattress, place a plywood board under your current mattress. If you find you wake up with less pain and experience more restful sleep, you should choose a firmer option for your next mattress.The plywood dampens movement from the bedsprings and gives the illusion of added firmness. This allows you to test your needs at home before investing in a new mattress.

, Since firmness scales vary across manufacturers, you should always test multiple models at different stores before you make a purchase. That way, you'll learn about what's available in your area and how soft or firm various manufacturers' products run.Take your time, and spend about ten minutes in each of your sleeping positions.
While a necessary step, take in-store testing with a grain of salt. Even if you spend lots of time testing a mattress at the store, remember that a model that seems comfortable for ten minutes won’t necessarily offer a good night’s sleep.

, In-store testing provides a rough idea of the comfort and support a mattress provides. However, getting a full night’s sleep is a more thorough test.When you stay at hotels, check mattresses’ labels for model and serial numbers. Search online to find information about design, construction, and firmness. Keep track of the models that are best for your back problems.
Staying with friends and family is more affordable than booking hotel rooms. Ask your loved ones with guest rooms if you can try out their mattresses. Again, note model and serial numbers and keep track of those that offer the best results.

, A good return policy will allow you to return a mattress within 120 days. This period will allow you to test the mattress comfort and support at home for an extended period of time.Keep in mind many manufacturers charge a restocking fee of around 15 percent.

Replace your mattress every nine to ten years.,
Keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned while sleeping.,
Use a pillow for your legs or knees.,
Sleep on your back or sides instead of on your stomach.",How to Choose a Mattress when You Have Back Problems3," Mattresses wear down over time and provide less support as they deteriorate. Replacing your mattress when necessary is particularly important if you already have back problems.Replacing a mattress as recommended can reduce back pain and improve sleep quality by approximately 50 percent., Even the best mattress is no substitute to proper sleeping posture. Use a head pillow that doesn’t elevate your neck and head too much. Your ears, shoulders, and hips should form a straight line, whether you sleep on your side or on your back., If you sleep on your back, place a pillow under the backs of your knees to elevate them slightly. If you sleep on your side, place a pillow between your knees.If you experience lower back pain, you can purchase an adjustable lumbar support pillow or use a small rolled towel. Place it under your lower spine and sleep on your back., Sleeping on your stomach worsens existing back problems, twists the neck, and causes sway back. If possible, vary your positions between sleeping on your back and on each side to avoid putting too much pressure on your joints and vertebrae.The best sleeping position depends on your specific back problems. For example, sleeping on your side can help relieve degenerative or herniated disks, depending on where they're located on your spine. Sleeping on your back with your knees elevated with several pillows can ease other conditions, like hip and sacroiliac pain.
Ask your doctor or spine specialist to recommend the best sleeping posture for your specific back problems.

Use a pipe cleaner for extra effect.,
Rinse out the pipe with hot water.",How to Clean a Pipe Without Alcohol1," A Tupperware container works well and can be cleaned out easily when you're finished. Ziploc bags for smaller pipes and bowl pieces are also good, since they can be disposed of after use.


Try to avoid using cooking pots since the resin can end up staining them.;
, Purchase a few denture tablets from the general store. Once the pipe is inside a container, place the tablets on the gunk left over from smoking.These tablets can also be substituted out for homemade cleaners such as salt and water, salt and vinegar, or baking soda and vinegar. Use equal amounts of your chosen ingredients and stir them together.

, Add hot water from the faucet to the container to submerge the pipe. The dissolving tablets create a fizz that will work on the pipe’s stains. Make sure the water isn’t boiling, or else it can crack the glass. Let the pipe rest for 20-30 minutes.

, After 20-30 minutes have passed, the gunk in the pipe will have begun to break down. To hurry the process and lift smaller pieces, use a straw-shaped pipe cleaner from a smoke shop or the craft store. Move the pipe cleaner around the bowl and push it through the stem., Place the pipe back under the faucet. Use hot water to remove all the gunk and cleaner. Afterwards, set the pipe aside to dry.

When it cools, detach the stem from the bowl. You should perform this cleaning after every smoke., Cover the top of the bowl with your palm or finger. Shake the pipe for several seconds so the ash distributes evenly along the walls. This forms a cake that protects the wood of your pipe from the temperatures inside it., Tip your pipe over the inside of a garbage bag. Allow any ash that is still loose to float out of the pipe for disposal. Knock the pipe a couple of times against the palm of your hand to get out any ash that hasn’t settled into the cake.

, Use a straw-shaped pipe cleaner from a smoke shop or craft store to clean the insides of the pipe. Push it through the stem. If you did not detach the stem from the bowl, push it through the stem until the tip is visible in the bowl.Pipe cleaners designed for pipes come in several varieties. Some are dipped in alcohol or other chemicals. Some are bristled, which are sharper but can help you get out more waste than craft store pipe cleaners.

, Remove the pipe cleaner in the stem. Run another pipe cleaner through the stem. You can also flip the first pipe cleaner over to an unblemished side. Continue pushing pipe cleaners into the stem until the pipe cleaners come out free of debris., Take a soft cloth and wipe down every piece of the pipe.

Proper cleaning removes the moisture you introduce while smoking. Also, for wood pipes, proper care helps you form an ash cake inside the bowl that protects the pipe from heat., Smokers keep a rotation of pipes. A rotation means you switch to a different pipe to use. You can use the same pipe again if you don’t have many pipes, but the longer you leave a pipe alone, the more it is able to settle and dry, protecting it from damage and keeping it from tasting sour., Direct sunlight heats the pipe and can damage wood.

Wash your hands.,
Take the nebulizer apart, if possible.,
Wash the cup or mouthpiece with warm water.,
Let air dry.,
Put the machine back together and store.,
Optionally, wash pieces in soapy water at the end of the day.",How to Clean a Nebulizer1," Before beginning, it's a good idea to take a few moments to wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer. Washing your hands kills bacterial and other harmful microorganisms on them. Since this method for cleaning the nebulizer doesn't use any soap, you won't want to accidentally transfer these onto the nebulizer by cleaning it with dirty hands.


See How to Wash Your Hands for tips on getting your hands as clean as possible. If you have a germ-sensitive job (e.g., healthcare worker), you may want to use the more conservative WHO guidelines for hand-washing.;
, Most nebulizers consist of a mask or mouthpiece, a section of tubing, a few connecting pieces, and a compressed air machine. Gently take these pieces apart from each other. You only need to clean one or two pieces, not the entire machine, so don't leave them connected unless your nebulizer does not come apart.


Most nebulizers come in one of two varieties: atomizer jet and ultrasonic. Atomizer jets, the more common variety, use compressed air to disperse your medicine, while ultrasonic nebulizers vibrate the liquid medicine with soundwaves to make it into a vapor.While these two nebulizers use different mechanisms to operate, they both use similar mouthpiece/tubing setups to disperse the medicine, so the cleaning instructions are virtually identical for both.Some nebulizers (like, for instance, smaller portable models) may have slightly different configurations. In these cases, do your best to remove the pieces that can be removed. Nearly all nebulizers will have some sort of mouthpiece or mask — this is the most important thing to remove and clean.

, Run some warm (not hot) water. Rinse the mouthpiece and any T-shaped connecting pieces that attach to it under the water for about half a minute to one minute, making sure that every part of these pieces gets rinsed.


Do not rinse the tubing or the compressed air machine with water. The tubing is difficult to dry and the machine itself is not intended to be cleaned this way. You can, however, wipe down the outsides of these pieces with a towel., Shake the excess water off of your mouthpiece (and any T-shaped connector piece you washed) and set it on a clean towel. Allow the water to evaporate naturally. This can take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour or two, depending on the climate.

, When the pieces are dry, put the entire nebulizer back together. Run air through the machine for about 10 to 20 seconds to remove any water inside.At this point, you can disconnect the mouthpiece and tubing from the compressed air machine and store both separately.


A good place to store the mouthpiece and tubing is in a clean ziplock bag. The compressed air machine can be covered with a sheet or towel to keep dust off of it.

, Some (but not all) nebulizers will recommend that you disinfect the pieces after each day of use. Consult your model's instructions to determine whether you need to do this. Follow the steps below for this intermediate cleaning method, which is nearly the same as the steps above, but using soap:Remove the nebulizer's mouthpiece and any T-shaped connector pieces attached to it. The tubing and compressed air machine should not be washed.
Run warm water.
Use mild dishwashing soap or detergent to wash the pieces for about half a minute to one minute, making sure that every part of the pieces is cleaned.
Rinse for about half a minute to remove soap.
Shake the excess moisture off and air-dry on a clean towel.

, Use uncooked, white rice. Using your pestle, roughly grind the rice until it becomes a dark color. Discard the colored rice. Pour in another two tablespoons (30 ml) of rice. Grind the rice until it remains white.You may need to repeat this process one or two more times.
Make sure your mortar and pestle are completely dry before grinding it with rice.

, Once the rice remains white, thoroughly rinse the mortar and pestle with warm water until all debris is removed. Then set the mortar and pestle on a drying rack to air dry.Make sure your mortar and pestle are dried completely before putting them away.

Wash the equipment as directed above.,
Get a disinfectant solution (or make your own.),
Soak your pieces.,
Rinse well and air dry before storing.",How to Clean a Nebulizer2," To ensure long-term cleanliness and keep your nebulizer in good working order, it's important to give it regular deep cleanings to kill any bacteria or microorganisms your normal cleaning regimen failed to kill. After you finish using your nebulizer, start by washing it as you normally would. See the section above for more details.


Most manufacturers recommend performing a deep cleaning once or twice per week. If you are unsure how often to deep clean your nebulizer, consult the instructions that came with it.

, Different nebulizer manufacturers will recommend using different products for deep cleaning sessions. Some nebulizers will have a cleaning solution included with them, others will recommend that you buy a commercial cleaning solution from the pharmacy, and others will recommend that you make your own — consult your nebulizer's instructions to be sure which is best for you.


To make your own cleaning solution, mix one part white vinegar to three parts water.For example, you might combine 1/2 cup of white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water.

, Put the mask and any T-shaped connector piece in a clean bowl and cover them with the cleaning solution until they are completely submerged. Leave them to sit so that the solution can clean them thoroughly. The amount of time your nebulizer's manufacturer will recommend for soaking can vary from model to model. Typically, however, this is around 20 minutes to an hour.


Once again, don't soak the tubing or the compressed air machine.

, Once the nebulizer has finished soaking, finish the cleaning process the same way as you would for a quick-clean in the method above. See below:


Remove the pieces from the solution and rinse them thoroughly with warm running water for at least 30 seconds.
Shake the excess water off and set the pieces on a clean towel.
Allow the pieces to air dry.
When dry, you may re-connect the pieces and run the compressed air machine briefly to remove any water caught inside them.
Store the tubing and mask in a clean ziplock bag. Cover the compressed air machine with a towel before storing it.
Dispose of your leftover cleaning solution — don't reuse it."

Check your product guide if you’re not sure how to access the HEPA filter.
Never operate an air purifier or vacuum cleaner without a filter.

, The filter might be caked with dirt and debris, depending on the type of appliance and how often you clean the filter. If necessary, you can gently tap the filter over a garbage can. This will knock off excess debris and loosen any built up dirt., You should use gentle or moderate pressure, as high pressure could ruin the filter. Rinse the filter until the water runs clear and dirt free.Some manufacturers recommend a lukewarm water rinse, while others stipulate cold water only, so check your product guide for the best water temperature for your specific filter.


In general, you should rinse both sides of a washable flat filter. Cylindrical wet/dry vacuum filters should only be rinsed on their exterior and should not get wet inside the cylinder., All washable HEPA filters must dry completely before reinstallation. Shake off excess water, then leave your filter out to air dry for at least 24 hours.Never put your filter in a clothes dryer, use a blower dryer, or use any method other than natural air drying.

If it’s cool, any grease deposits will be hardened and easier to remove.Some microwaves also have grease filters. If you’re cleaning a microwave filter, unplug the appliance before removing the filter.Never operate a range or microwave without the grease filter.;
, A range hood filter might be covered by a plastic casing secured by tabs or screws. However, most filters are easy to remove and require no tools. For some models, simply tilt the filter and lower it out of place.Filters are often secured by a latch that you lift and release.Some are held in place by a metal fastener that you lift or twist.The filter is located on the back of most microwaves.You can also find the filter on the bottom of top-mounted microwaves.In both cases, the filter easily slides out from a slot.
Check your appliance’s user manual if you have any trouble finding the grease filter. Be sure to note how you removed the filter so you can easily reinstall it.

, In commercial kitchens, range hood filters are often so high that it’s necessary to use a ladder to remove them. If you’re a restaurant owner or kitchen manager, you can avoid the hassle and injury risk of using a ladder by investing in a long-handled filter removing tool.You can find a filter remover online for $50-65 (US).

, Metal grease filters are dishwasher safe. The dishwasher is a great option if you clean your filter more than once a month or if it’s free of grease deposits. However, if it’s grimy or greasy, you should hand wash the filter to prevent grease from building up in your dishwasher., You can choose between several cleaning solution options, depending on how dirty your filter is and what products you have on hand. The most basic solution is to fill a sink or basin with boiling water, a quarter cup (60 mL) of baking soda, and a tablespoon of degreasing dish detergent., You can also use a degreasing oven cleaner if your filter is especially grimy. If you use a concentrated cleaner, make a solution by mixing it with water. Check the product’s label for a recommended ratio.For thick, stubborn grease deposits, soak the filter in an auto degreaser.Wear rubber gloves when using an oven or auto degreaser.

, Whether you choose a baking soda solution or a degreaser, you should soak the filter for ten minutes. Soaking will help cut through grease deposits and you'll have less scrubbing to do., Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the filter. You can also use a toothbrush to get into hard to reach crevices. After scrubbing away grease and grime, rinse the filter thoroughly with hot water to remove soap suds and residue., After you’ve rinsed the filter, shake off excess water. Wipe it down with a clean cloth or paper towels. Let it air dry completely before reinstalling it., In addition to the metal grease filter, some range hoods include replaceable fabric and activated charcoal filters, which cannot be cleaned. While the metal grease filter is drying, you can check the other filters and see if they need to be replaced.You should replace a residential range hood’s disposable filters once every three to six months, or when they become noticeable dirty and discolored. You can purchase replacement filters from your model’s manufacturer., You can reinstall the metal filter once it’s completely dry. Slide, latch, or fasten the filter back into the appliance, depending on your model’s design. If your range hood includes a plastic cover, screw or snap it back into place., While residential grease filters can typically go up to three months without cleaning, grease filters in commercial kitchens need to be cleaned weekly or daily, depending on cooking style and volume. The labor and water costs of frequent cleanings can add up, but you can cut your costs by placing disposable wool filters over your metal hood grease filters.Disposable filters are flame retardant and designed to fit over standard metal baffle filters. They also reduce grease buildup throughout the ventilation duct system.

, Saturate the scrubber with hot water and then apply 2-3 drops of a mild liquid dish soap to it. You can also use a mild solution of water and vinegar if you'd prefer., Rub the scrubber over the hard water stains and any spots that look grimy or filmy. You can wipe the whole sink down with this scrubber for a more thorough cleaning.

, Use a spray hose, a cup, or just your cupped hands to pour a little water over the soapy areas and rinse all the soap residue away. You can also wipe it with a clean, dampened sponge.

, Microfiber is gentle enough to be used on granite without damaging it, but any soft towel or cloth will do. Be sure that you’ve gotten the sink completely dry before you attempt to add any oil, since excess water will prevent the oil from working properly.

, Find a clean, dry cloth or rag and pour a few teaspoons of olive oil or mineral oil onto a small section of it.Try not to ball up the cloth so much that it begins to absorb the oil and spread it through the cloth. The oil should sit in a relatively concentrated spot so that it can be transferred to the granite., Wipe the sink thoroughly with the cloth until you’ve distributed a thin, even layer of oil over the granite. Allow it to sit for about a minute before you attempt to wipe it away., Use the clean part of the cloth, or just get a new one, and buff any excess oil off the sink. The granite will be shiny but should not feel slick when you run a finger over it. Continue to wipe it with a clean cloth if your finger comes away with oil on it."

Apply the paste directly to the stained area of your granite sink.,
Cover the pasted area with plastic wrap.,
Allow the paste to dry completely.,
Remove the plastic and wipe away the dried paste.,
Rinse the area completely with water.,
Repeat the process as necessary.",How to Clean a Granite Sink2," Both of these products can be purchased at home improvement or hardware stores. Follow the directions on the whiting powder packaging to mix it with the proper amount of hydrogen peroxide. Mix them together in a disposable container, such as an old food storage container you no longer need.


The resulting mixture should be a thick paste, almost the consistency of peanut butter.
Some examples of whiting powder include powdered chalk, white molding plaster, and talc., Use a putty knife or an old wood or plastic spatula that you no longer need to do the application. The layer of paste you apply to the stain should be approximately half an inch (about 1.25 cm) thick., Secure the plastic wrap down on each edge with a piece of tape. This will allow the paste to fully absorb and lift the stain., Let it sit for at least 24 hours. Occasionally, this may take up to 2 days. This period can fluctuate depending on the directions outlined on the whiting powder product., Use a very blunt scraping tool to remove the dried paste so that you don't scratch the stone. Or just use a soft sponge or paper towel to remove as much of it as you can, and then throw it away. Do not attempt to wash the all of the paste down the drain, as it may clog the pipes.

, Remove any remaining paste residue using a damp sponge or by pouring or spraying water over the area where the paste was.

, If the stain has not been removed from your granite sink after the first try, you can go through the process again. It may take up to five times for this process to fully lift stubborn stains."
"
Rinse and dry your granite sink completely after each use.,
Remove stains promptly.,
Re-seal your granite sink regularly.",How to Clean a Granite Sink3," Rinsing your sink can prevent food and other debris from drying and hardening onto the granite surface, and can protect your sink from any minerals that exist in your tap water.


Keep a microfiber towel or other soft cloth near your sink so that you can easily wipe it down after using it.

, Granite is a porous stone, so the sooner you clean up a stain the better. Try to blot at a fresh stain rather than rubbing it so that you don’t spread it to a larger area.Clean alcohol and citrus stains immediately, since these can dull or etch the granite’s surface.

, Follow your sink manufacturer’s directions regarding how often you should have your granite re-sealed to preserve its shine. Generally, you should do this every two years, but manufacturer recommendations may vary."

",How to Clean a Gas Grill," You do not want to have dangerous gasses build up during the cleaning process that can lead to injury.


Locate the gas supply valve on the propane tank for LP grills and where the grill connects to the house for LNG supplied grills.
Turn the knob or lever clockwise to shut off the gas supply running into the grill.
Remember ""righty-tighty, lefty-loosey"" to close and open valves.;
, Grill brushes can be purchased from your local supermarket that have wire bristles, an acrylic scrubber, and a metal scraper. Invest in a grill brush for easy cleaning.Fill a bucket with soapy water made from teaspoon of liquid dish soap for every quart of water.
Dip the wire brush in the water and scrub away any grimy build up present on the grates.
Be sure to clean both sides of the grates.

, The plates protect the burners and help to disperse the heat to allow for even cooking.


Clean the burner protectors by scrubbing with sponge or scouring pad dipped in soapy water.

, Check the holes in the burners for clogs and use a toothpick to dislodge any objects that may be blocking the flow of gas. In some grill models the burners are easy to remove for cleaning; if yours do not come out easily, you can wipe them clean while they are in place. , If your grill has a removable bottom pan, you can take it out to scrape all the debris away. If the bottom pan is secured in place use a metal spatula or grill scraper to push any burnt scraps through the grease hole and catch them in a trash bag., Once all the chunks are gone, scrub the bottom with a sponge or scouring pad and soapy water to remove any built up grease or grime. Lots of drippings and food scraps tend to build up under the burners of the grill. Pay close attention to this area and clean it as much as possible to avoid corrosion.

, Use the grill scraper to gently clean any flecks off the underside of the lid and wipe it clean with a soapy sponge. Be careful not to scratch the metal or scrape any undamaged paint off the lid as this may lead to rusting or corrosion.

, Reassemble your grill by putting everything back in the reverse order you removed it.


Burner covers and grill grates usually rest in place.
Look for groves or ledges to place these items back in the proper location.

, Turn the grill on high and close the lid for 15 minutes to burn off any remaining soap or cleaners you used on the interior surfaces of the grill., Oiling the grates will help to prevent your food from sticking to the surface.


Dip a paper towel in canola oil.
Use tongs to rub the oily towel over the surface of the hot grates.

, Make sure that the gas valve is completely closed to avoid filling the grill with dangerous flammable gas during the cleaning process.

, Most grills have a disposal drip pan or cup. Clean the surface of the drip pan holder, and replace the liner with a fresh aluminum pie plate or tin can.


If your drip pan is not disposable, wipe out the grease with paper towels.
After removing as much grease as possible rinse the drip pan with a solution of soapy water.

, Make a soapy solution to clean the outside of the grill with 1 teaspoon of dish soap per quart of water.

, Clean all surfaces of the grill thoroughly to minimize the chances of corrosion due to food bits clinging to the metal.


Pay close attention to the areas around the knobs to remove any drips that may have accumulated.
Wipe the side panels or burners with the soapy water as well.

, Keep spots from forming due to soap bubbles by thoroughly rinsing the outside of your grill after cleaning., If your grill has a stainless steel lid or cabinets, spray a glass cleaner on the surface and wipe with a paper towel to keep the surfaces looking shiny., Keep your grill grates cleaner by oiling them prior to each use with an old rag or paper towel dipped in vegetable oil. Use tongs to rub the oily towel on the hot grates before placing food on the grill., It is easiest to clean the grill grates while they are still hot. Use a wire grill brush to scrape away any remaining food bits by rubbing the wire bristles along the length of the grates.

, Regularly inspect the gas lines connecting your grill to the gas tank by applying a small amount of soapy water to the surface of the line and connectors. This should be done each season you are using the grill and monthly during periods of high usage.Use a rag or brush to apply soapy water along the length of the gas line.
Make sure to apply soapy water liberally around the connections and valves.
Look for any bubbles that indicate gas is leaking causing a potentially dangerous situation.

, In between every 3-4 times you grill, heat up the grill without any food present.


Turn the burners on high.
Close the lid to burn up any drippings that have fallen on the burner protectors.
Allow the heat to build up inside the grill for 10-15 minutes.

, Invest in a cover for your grill to protect it from the elements when it is not in being used. Keeping rain and debris from piling up on your grill will help keep it from rusting and extend the life of your grill.,"

Rent an electric sewer snake.,
Prepare for heavy lifting.,
Feed the cable into the drain.,
Stop when you feel resistance.,
Remove the cable entirely if you encounter large clogs.,
Repeat the process until the drain is clear.,
Hose out the drain.,
Call a professional.,
Clean your French drain regularly.,
Inspect your French drain yearly.,
Rent pipe inspection equipment.,
Get a professional inspection.",How to Clean a French Drain," To clean your French drain, rent an electric sewer snake (or auger), a motor-powered spool of cable with a two-pronged cutter at its tip. Call two or three rental locations (e.g. hardware stores, equipment rental stores) to compare prices, which should be around $65 or more for a half day rental. Choose between a 50-foot and 100-foot model (depending on the length of your french drains), and opt for a machine with 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) cable.Visit http://www.rentalhq.com/RentalWiki/drain-sewer-cleaning-machines to find rental locations in your area.;
, If you don't drive a truck, van, or SUV, borrow one or ask a friend for a lift with the auger, which is too heavy to be out into a car trunk. Ask a rental store employee to help you lift the machine into the vehicle, and enlist the help of a family member, friend, or neighbor to move it once you get home. If you are moving the snake on your own, use a ramp to ease it out of the vehicle.Most augers have two wheels on their frame, allowing you to move them easily once they are on the ground.

, Uncover the entrance of the French drain. If your french drain is connected to a gutter downspout, detach the downspout to continue. Turn on the auger and slowly feed the cable in.To protect your hands, wear thick gloves while handling the cable.

, When the cable meets resistance (indicating that it has reached a clog, or has come to a turn in the pipe) stop feeding it into the drain and retract it just enough to free the cutter. Slowly ease it forward once again. Either the cable will find its way around a bend, or a blockage will cause it to turn, allowing the cutter end to work through the obstruction., If the cable encounters a large clog that it cannot clear, remove it entirely by pulling it gently and using the reverse switch on the snake motor (if necessary). Wipe down the cable with a wet rag as it recoils to remove build up. Once the cable is out entirely, turn off the machine and remove debris (e.g. pieces of tree root, leaves) from the cutter., Repeat the process of feeding the cable into the drain until all obstructions are cleared. If large blockages are worked through, you may hear built-up water rush out of the pipe, as well as other debris. Going through the process at least two or three times is normal to be able to adequately unclog and clear a french drain., After snaking with the auger, feed a garden hose into the drain and turn it on. Allow the water to flush out extra debris. For added cleaning, insert the hose into the drain at the same time as the auger to clean off the cable while doing a last snaking., If you can't clear out a clog in the drain after several attempts, contact a professional drain cleaning service to avoid harming your pipes with the auger. Look up several options for service (online, or in local listings) to compare prices and availability. Note that prices may vary, but standard drain cleanings generally cost upwards of $250 per visit., Regular cleaning of your French drain is necessary to prevent a buildup of dirt and debris that could cause a clog. Every week or so, use a garden rake to clear the surface of the drain to remove any debris that could obstruct water flow. In the event of a storm, nearby construction, or another occurrence that may result in excess debris, clear the area as soon as possible to prevent backup., While French drains can operate for years without issues, they should be inspected once a year to ensure that there are no blockages present. Choose a time of year when your schedule will accommodate this task and when the weather facilitates it (e.g. during the summer, when you are on vacation and there is no snow or excessive rain). Schedule the inspection before beginning any other projects in the surrounding area (e.g. planting a garden or building a deck) in case you have to conduct repairs., Call several hardware stores or equipment rental locations to compare rental prices for pipe inspection equipment. These small, cable-mounted video cameras coil into the drain and transmit recorded images to a video monitor, revealing obstructions, collapsed pipes, or other issues. Models range in features, quality, and availability, so costs may vary significantly depending on your location and needs.A less expensive model should be adequate for identifying a simple clog or damage.

, If your own inspection of your French drain is fruitless, or if you want to be certain about the condition of your drain, call a professional drain specialist. Experts can check your drains quickly and effectively, and tell you definitively if there are any problems that could cause leakage, flooding, or damage. Drain specialists can also handle cleaning or repairs if they are revealed to be necessary."

Without disconnecting it, you won’t be able to access it or safely clean it. Unstrap the tank and unscrew screws or bolts that secure it.


For lawnmowers and similar items, you’ll need to remove the fuel line and spark plugs.
For motorcycles, remove the petcock, gas cap, and all hoses that might be attached to it.;
, After disconnecting the fuel line, you’ll need to seal it. Without sealing it, not only can residual gasoline come out of the line, but dirt or other objects could wind up in the fuel line – causing problems for your engine.


Take some sort of smooth-faced clamp and attach it to the line near the carburetor.
Separate the line and the carburetor.
Position the line over a bucket and take off the clamp.
Allow the line to drain into the bucket., Pour any remaining fuel into a gasoline-safe container. If you can’t get everything out, use a suction hose or a similar device to remove fuel from the tank.


Allow the tank to dry completely.
Without draining any remaining fuel, you won’t be able to clean the engine properly. Thus, you need to make sure you get all fuel out of the tank., Take the time to properly examine the tank to look for any problems that might undermine its integrity. Defects, rust, or other problems could pose potential safety hazards or might endanger your engine.


Put the tank out in the open daylight so you can see inside. If you need more light, shine a flashlight into the tank.
Pay special attention to rust spots, wear, or defects in the material of the tank itself.
Make sure to look at the fuel filter to make sure it is clean. If it is not, it should be replaced., By using high pressure water, you’ll break lose any buildup or accumulation on the bottom of the tank. At the same time, you won’t be introducing chemicals – like soap – that could cause problems for your engine.


Set your hose and sprayer to a high-pressure setting.
You may need to get down and point the sprayer in various locations in the tank.
Consider using a pressure washer or blaster if you have substantial rust buildup in the tank."

Look for mounds of dirt.,
Check for tunnels.,
Inspect borders.,
Keep checking.,
Look at pictures of moles.,
Observe your yard.",How to Get Rid of Moles in Your Garden1," If you suspect that you might have moles in your garden, look for mounds of dirt on the surface of your grass. Moles will typically leave heaps of dirt the size of baseballs or softballs when tunneling. Check daily as these mounds can appear quickly as moles make their way through the yard.A typical mole might make between 50-100 mounds in a single month.;
, Moles tunnel deep into the ground, usually at least 10 inches under the surface. If you notice raised swellings of earth under the grass in your garden, try stepping on it lightly. If the ground gives away under your foot, this is a strong indication that you have moles.







, Moles tend to dig alongside structures, tunneling below the surface. Check along your house foundation and driveway for shallow moles runs, evidenced by raised ridges and mounds. Other structures to check the borders of should include:Walkways
Lawn borders
Garden sheds
Fences

, If evidence of moles in your garden subsides, keep checking for evidence for the next few months. When the supply of insects in the upper soil becomes scarce, moles will simply dig deeper and leave less evidence than they do when digging shallow tunnels. Moles may even use dirt from their mounds to fill in old tunnels while digging in deeper soil, giving you the false impression that they have left your yard., Look online for pictures of moles to know exactly what you are looking for in your yard. They are small mammals with front flippers, webbed feet, no visible ears, and a pointed, bald snout. Moles are typically only 7 inches long (approximately 18 cm) and weigh about 4 pounds., Moles are most active in the spring or fall. To spot one, observe your yard in the early morning or evening. While moles only tend to appear above ground surface when they are looking for a mate, you might observe active signs of their tunnelling (e.g. dirt being tossed, grass moving).








Moles are also likely to appear outdoors after a warm rain, when things are moist and temperate.

Remove the items.,
Vacuum out the closet or wardrobe.,
Wash walls and shelves.,
Wash your clothes and other fabric items.,
Freeze items that you can’t wash. Larvae can’t survive freezing temperatures, so the freezer makes a great pesticide.,
Avoid putting worn clothes into your closet.,
Store clothing in airtight containers.",How to Get Rid of Moth Worms1," Take everything out of your closet, including non-clothing items like shoes and storage items. You will need to clean everything, so if you have things like shoe storage racks or organizational items, remove those as well to enable you to thoroughly scrub them., Use an attachment or a handheld vacuum to clean the floor, walls, shelves, and ceiling of your closet. As soon as you finish vacuuming, empty the contents into a sealed bag. Remove it from the house immediately.Make sure that you get the corners and ceiling of your closets., Pour soap or detergent into a bowl or bucket, then fill it with water. Stir the water to mix in the soap. Dip a clean cloth into the soapy water and use it to wipe down the walls and shelves. Continue to dip the rag into the water as you clean the entire closet., Set your washer on the hottest cycle because the larvae can’t withstand the heat. The water should reach about 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) in order to be fully effective. Allow the clothes to cycle for 20 to 30 minutes to ensure that all the moth worms and eggs have been killed.Dry cleaning will also kill the larvae.

, Place your items in a protective covering, such as a plastic bag. Put them in the freezer, allowing at least 48 hours for the cold to kill any larvae on the item., If you plan to wear clothing more than once, find another location to store it until you are ready for your second or third wear. Moths prefer clothes that have sweat or food on them, so they act as a moth magnet., Keep the moths from laying new eggs by keeping clothes that you don’t wear frequently in airtight containers.Easy to use options include sealed storage boxes, vacuum-sealed bags, and plastic storage bags.
For added protection, apply packing tape over the seals.

Vacuum often.,
Protect your bed.,
Keep your fabrics clean.,
Dust often.,
Lower the humidity.,
Replace favorite homes of dust mites.,
Filter out mites.,
Freeze the mites.,
Use an insecticide.",How to Get Rid of Mites1," Dust mites, the most common species of mite in American households, can be easily eliminated with the use of a vacuum cleaner. Dust mites burrow and cling to fabrics, mostly in carpet, furniture and, sometimes, clothing. Regular cleaning by vacuuming or washing fabrics will take care of this problem and alleviate this simple headache.;
, The place in your home with the highest concentration of dust mites is likely your bed; those little buggers get trapped in the mattress pad and pillows, creating waste as they go. Protect your bed by encasing your mattress and pillows in dust-proof covers. This will block out mites and prevent buildup of dust mite waste.

, Bedding is the most likely home of dust mites, but they are heavily present in most fabrics. Aim to wash household fabrics (bedding, pillowcases, curtains, blankets, etc.) once every 1-2 weeks. Use the hottest water the fabric can handle to kill any dust mites that might be present.

, It may seem obvious, but dust mites tend to accumulate in dust. Therefore, make sure your house is as dust-free as possible by wiping down stationary objects often. Use a damp duster or cloth to avoid simply stirring up the mite waste and allergens. If you are allergic to dust mites, wear a mask as you dust to avoid inhaling irritants.

, Create an environment in which it makes it difficult for dust mites to thrive. These little bugs typically enjoy high humidity, warm environments. Use a dehumidifier to keep the humidity level in your home at 50% or below. You can additionally use an air conditioner to keep your house cool, another deterrent for dust mites.

, If mites are really a problem in your home and you’re not opposed to spending a bit of money, make changes to create a house uninhabitable by dust mites. Replace carpet flooring with wood or tile floors, and remove as much fabric as possible. Use bedding made out of synthetic rather than down filler and take down any curtains.

, Keep the dust mites that you clean up permanently out of your house by using filters in your vacuum cleaner and vents. HEPA filters will trap the mites and their waste as they pass through, keeping them from re-entering your home., If you have certain items that you can’t wash but may be full of mites or mite waste, place it in the freezer for 24 hours. This will kill the mites and make it easier to clean up afterwards., As a last measure, you can use an insecticide inside your home to kill any dust mites. Look for one that advertises mites as its primary target, or hire someone to come kill the bugs for you. Keep in mind that using a bug-killing spray may give your home an odor or be the source of other limitations."

Jack the car up.,
Remove the gas tank from the car.,
Drain the tank.,
Degrease the tank.,
Pressure wash the tank.,
Use cleaning solution.,
Rinse the tank.",How to Clean a Gas Tank2," Before removing the tank, you'll have to jack the car up. Do this by positioning a car jack underneath the car and slowly moving it into the air. This will provide space for you to get underneath the vehicle.


Consider using two jacks to securely lift your vehicle.
Position the jack or jacks under the jack points of the car. Consult your owner's manual for these locations., Before cleaning the tank, make sure to remove it from the car. By removing it, you’ll be able to properly drain, inspect, and clean it. To remove the tank, disconnect screws and straps that hold it in place.


Make sure you are not directly below the tank when disconnecting it.
Use another jack, preferably a transmission jack, to lower the fuel tank., After you’ve removed the tank, you need to drain it completely of any fuel that might remain in it. The extent of this process may depend on the age of the tank, how much fuel is left, or the style of the tank. To drain it:


Use a suction device to transfer the gasoline into a storage container.
If there is some liquid you still can’t’ remove, turn the tank upside down and allow it to drain into a container. You may find that sludge or other debris will move out with any remaining gasoline, If your tank still smells of gasoline after you’ve drained it, you may need to degrease it. You’ll find that you get much better results by degreasing the tank.


Use a degreaser like Marine Clean.
Try mixing dish detergent with hot water.
Let the degreaser or soap and water mix sit in the tank for up to 24 hours.
If the degreaser or soap mixture does not work after 24 hours, consider degreasing the tank again for a longer period of time., After removing the tank, you’ll want to take a pressure washer and spray down the inside of the tank. This will help dislodge dirt, debris, and small flakes of rust. It will also help rinse out gasoline sediment.


Use a pressure washer or a regular garden hose and sprayer to clean the inside of the tank.
You may need to point the sprayer at different angles to remove light rust and other sediment buildup from inside the tank., If the tank has substantial rust or other grime in it, you may need to use commercial solutions to remove it. These solutions work by chemically breaking down rust. After using them, you’ll be able to rinse and remove debris from your tank.


Think about professional grade acid solutions that will dissolve rust in a tank.
Cleaning solutions should only be used on tanks that have been sitting for a long time., After you’ve used cleaning solution or even a degreaser like a light soap, you’ll need to rinse the tanks several times so suds or soap residue is completely removed. If you don’t remove all chemical residue from the tank, you may wind up damaging your engine.


After you’ve loosened built up sediment and rust, empty the tank and refill it again to get any more debris that did not wash away.
Rinse the tank until there are no bubbles or foam present in the water. This might require you to rinse it 2 to 3 times.."
"
Allow the tank to dry before reattaching it.,
Dispose of gasoline appropriately.,
Consult a mechanic if you have any questions.,
Wear proper safety equipment.",How to Clean a Gas Tank3," Once you’ve cleaned the inside of the tank, you need to allow it to dry completely. If you don’t, the water may mix with new gasoline and damage your engine or fuel system.


Turn the tank upside down if possible to allow it to drain better.
Sit the tank out overnight.
Make sure the tank is not in a moist or humid location., After draining a tank of gasoline, you need to dispose of it in a proper fashion. If you don’t dispose of it appropriately, it may contaminate the ground water in your community.


Store gasoline in approved containers.
Contact your local waste disposal service to find out where you can dispose of your gasoline.
You may be able to bring your old gasoline to a toxic waste disposal site near you., If you encounter any issues while cleaning the tank, or you have a problem you’re unsure about how to resolve, consult a professional mechanic. A professional has likely dealt with cleaning gas tanks before and will advise you appropriately.


If you’re unsure as to whether you can lift and remove a tank from a vehicle safely, contact a mechanic. They’ll be able to do it safely.

, When working with gasoline or cleaning solvents, you should always use safety equip. Without safety equipment, you might wind causing yourself permanent injury. Use:


Safety goggles.
Gloves.
Other protective clothing.
Also, remember to properly ventilate your garage and to work on your tank outside, if possible."

Make a natural mole repellent spray.,
Try an ultrasonic device.,
Use a humane trap.",How to Get Rid of Moles in Your Garden2," To make a harm-free, mole repelling spray, combine 1/4 cup (2 oz) of castor oil, 1 tbsp. (0.5 oz) of cayenne pepper, and 2 tbsp. of liquid dish detergent in a large bowl or container. Add 1 tbsp. (0.5 oz) of water and stir, then pour the mixture in a container to store. When needed, mix 2 tbsp. (1 oz) of the mixture to a gallon of water and fill a spray bottle. Spray mounds, raised ridges, and the surrounding area of your yard.Castor oil, a powerful mole repellent, can also be effective when applied to the soil on its own.

, Another harm-free mole deterrent option might be an ultrasonic device emitting an underground sonic pulse to repel moles and other underground rodents (e.g. gophers). The penetrating vibrations will not affect you or your house pets, but will effectively deter pests from tunneling nearby. The MoleChaser, for instance, is a small, waterproof, battery-operated spike that can be inserted into the ground to repel underground rodents, and is available online for approximately $25.







, Find an active mole tunnel in your garden and dig to widen one of its entrance holes enough to fit a live trap in. Monitor the trap closely to make sure that the mole does not stay trapped inside too long. Drive the mole, still in the trap, at least 5 miles away from your home before releasing it to relocate it.







"
"
Build an underground barrier.,
Get rid of grubs.,
Get an outdoor-friendly cat.",How to Get Rid of Moles in Your Garden3," Thwart mole tunneling by digging an obstructive trench in your yard. Dig down about 2 feet deep and 6 inches (approximately 15 cm) wide to cover enough area to have an impact. Fill this trench with impenetrable material likes rock or concrete, or fill it with wire.








This is an effective but labor-intensive way to protect your flower or vegetable garden from moles.

, If you have a mole problem in your garden, it is likely that you have a large concentration of grubs, which moles eat. To prevent moles, get rid of their potential food source by spraying your garden with milky spore disease or beneficial nematodes, available online or in garden stores. Neither will harm your plants or lawn, but they will kill grubs that would draw moles to your yard., To prevent moles, consider getting a cat to walk around your garden. Cats are deterrents to rodents of all kinds and will dissuade moles (and other pests) from wandering into your yard. Before adopting or buying a cat, make sure that your backyard is securely fenced in and free of any plants that might be poisonous to cats if ingested.

Clean out your food containers.,
Use airtight containers.",How to Get Rid of Moth Worms2," Look for tiny worms that look like wiggling rice, along with webbing in either food containers or the pantry. You should also notice cast off skins. Check your corners and in the dark areas of pantries for moth worms and cocoons.The worms will grow to about ⅔-inch size (1.7 centimeters), and they have a black or brown head.

, Kitchen moth worms enter your home inside food. After you bring home an item that contains moth eggs or larvae, the moth worms quickly spread to other foods. Go through your pantry, checking items for signs of infestation. You may notice the moth worms, egg casings, or webbing.Foods that the meal moths prefer include cereals, flour, grains, birdseed, dried fruit, candy, pet food, dried herbs, nuts, and powdered milk.
Even if you don’t see any moth worms or casings, webbing means that the food is infested.

, Moth worms cannot penetrate the seal of a plastic bag, so you can prevent them from spreading by putting the infested food in bags. Throw away the items as soon as possible. Don’t allow the infested foods to sit around since it’s possible that you may not have properly closed all of the seals., Unfortunately, most of your food will need to be thrown away. Any food that the moths would normally eat, such as grains or cereals, should be thrown away. If you have any food that is in a container that you cannot wash, then you will need to throw that food out as well., The moths like to lay eggs in the crevices of items, so you may still have active eggs on your items. To avoid a reinfestation, wash these items well in warm, soapy water.Check crevices such as jar lids or flaps on items wrapped in plastic.
You can also kill moth eggs and larvae that may be on the food by putting the food in the freezer, microwaving it for 5 minutes, or baking it at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius)., If you have any shelf liners, then you will need to remove them and throw them away, as they can harbor eggs or larvae. If you plan to place new pantry liners, wait until your infestation is completely gone before putting them down. Otherwise, you may have to replace them again if the moth worms come back., Use a hose extension on your vacuum cleaner to vacuum out any visible moth worms and crumbs. Vacuum in the crevices and corners, if possible, because tiny worms and eggs tend to hide in the darkest spots.

, First wipe down all surfaces, including the pantry walls and ceilings, with a soapy rag. Follow with a mild bleach solution. You can either make your own or purchase a cleaning product that contains bleach. Afterwards, spray the shelves with plain white vinegar and wipe everything down.To mix your own bleach solution, add 1 part bleach to 9 parts water.Don’t forget to scrub down the corners well.

, Run the containers in a hot dishwasher if you have one. If not, wash them out thoroughly by scrubbing them in a bath of hot soapy water. Finish by applying a vinegar rinse. You need to follow these extra precautions because a single moth worm hiding in one container could re-infest the entire area.

, Prevent a reinfestation and the contamination of new foods by storing your food in airtight containers.

When you buy grains, flours, or meals, you may want to store them in the freezer for a week to kill off any eggs that may already exist on or in the product.
You can also refrigerate items until you use them."

Use anti-moth paper or strips.,
Place cedar balls anywhere you store clothing.,
Use mothballs.,
Add bay leaves to kitchen cabinets.,
Make your own herb sachets.",How to Get Rid of Moth Worms3," You can purchase anti-moth paper or paper strips that can be placed in your wardrobe, drawers, boxes, garment bags, or pantry. This paper will kill the larvae and the moths., Cedar balls are a great natural replacement for pesticides. Cedar contains an oil that kills small moth worms, but they don’t have much of an effect on larger worms or adult moths. Hanging a cedar ball in your closet or laying one in your dresser drawer can help, though it won’t solve all of your problems.You can also use cedar hangers., To be effective and safe, your mothballs should only be used when you’re storing your clothes in an airtight container. Place the mothballs in with the clothing, then seal it off. Mothballs do not work immediately, but they contain chemicals whose vapors can build up and kill moths in all stages of their life cycle.Wear gloves while handling mothballs because they can be toxic.

, Moths naturally avoid bay leaves, which you may keep in your kitchen already. For an easy and safe moth repellant, lay out a few bay leaves in your cabinets and pantries., Moths tend to avoid the smell of lavender, peppermint, cloves, thyme, and rosemary. Place your dried herbs in a breathable bag, and then add it to your closets, drawers, and storage areas. The scent of the herbs will ward off the bugs.You can use one herb or a combination of herbs in your sachets.

Get rid of ear mites.,
Treat for itch mites.,
Kill off spider mites.,
Get rid of bird mites.,
Keep clover mites to a minimum.,
Increase the number of spiders in your area.",How to Get Rid of Mites2," Use an ear dropper filled with mineral oil for ear mites. Ear mites are extremely obnoxious pests that usually inhabit dogs and cats' ears more often than humans. Find a common earwax dropper at your local pharmacy, and fill it up with mineral oil. Apply to the whole of your pet's ear, inside and around the inside of the fleshy part.


Keep your pets outside during this time so they do not spill the oil on your furniture or carpet.

, Apply sulfur lotion to the entirety of your body if you have scabies (itch mites). Most experts recommend over-the-counter Lindane as a fairly non-toxic substance. Pure sulfur also works, but is harder to obtain and has a very noxious odor. Make sure you shower thoroughly before application. Consult your doctor or pharmacist before use because some of these scabies treatments do require a prescription due to their toxicity.

, Introduce predator mites in your garden if you have spider mites. Spider mites feast on vegetation in gardens and lawns, killing droves of plants. You can purchase a small colony of predator mites, which actually prove beneficial to your garden's habitat. You can also choose to use chemical treatments, though this may risk the health of your vegetation; so predator mites are an easy, non-toxic alternative.

, These mites can be found indoors and outdoors and are carried by birds. The only way to really get rid of them is through insecticide use, but this is best left done by an exterminator. Move any bird nests close to your home and cut down tree limbs near your house. If the mites are present in farm birds - like chickens - replace all nesting materials and add fresh garlic to their drinking water., Clover mites are reddish brown in color and don't present much of a threat to humans or animals. If they are bothering you though, you can kill them off by mixing borax with warm water and spraying the solution where you notice the mites. This will kill them off and prevent more from joining the party., The last thing some people may want is to bring spiders willingly into their home or garden. However, spiders are a natural enemy of mites and will work to eat them. Keeping spiders around will reduce the total number of mites you have at any one time, and keep it that way. Therefore, don’t kill spiders when you see them in or around your home.

Use ammonia to kill gnats in drains.,Keep the stopper on the drain closed.,
Do not pour vegetable or olive oil in your kitchen sink.",How to Get Rid of Gnats1," To kill any gnats (along with their eggs and larvae) living inside your drain, simply pour a small dose of ammonia into the sink. This will effectively remove all traces of the gnats. Just be sure to leave the ammonia to dilute for several hours before using the sink again, as ammonia is also toxic to humans.


As an alternative to the foul-smelling ammonia, you can put a couple of tablespoons of baking soda into the drain, followed by a cup of white vinegar. The mixture will fizz slightly, then should be left to sit for a couple of hours before running water.;
,, While this may catch some of the gnats that hang around the drain or garbage disposal, it is not worth the trouble of a clogged drain."

Therefore, where there's dust, there are likely dust mites. A key to eliminating dust mites is getting rid of their food source, and that means dusting with a damp cloth. Rinse the cloth regularly to avoid spreading dust.


It’s important to use a damp cloth, because a dry cloth will just stir up allergens and spread dust around the house.Items to dust include furniture, shelves, books, decorations, trinkets, pictures, fixtures, and other items that collect dust.;
, Vacuuming is another great way to get rid of dust, skin, dust mite feces, and other allergens from your house. To avoid spreading dust and allergens, it’s important that you use a vacuum outfitted with a HEPA filter that will trap allergens and prevent them from being blown around the house.When vacuuming, pay particular attention to floors, baseboards, furniture, carpeting, rugs, and behind and underneath furniture.
Use upholstery attachments to get the seams, crevices, and corners of your furniture.

, Dust mites can be found all over your bedding. Remove the pillow cases, sheets, blankets, and covers from your bed. Place the items in the washing machine and wash them with hot water and the regular cycle. When the washing machine is done, transfer the items to the dryer and dry them on a hot setting.


To kill dust mites, the washing machine or dryer must reach between 130 and 140 F (54 to 60 C)., Dust mites love heavy curtains as much as they love pillows and bedding. Remove curtains and drapes from their rods or tracks and check the care label for washing instructions.


For washable curtains, remove any hooks or hangers. Transfer the curtains to the washing machine and wash them with hot water. Transfer them to the dryer or hang them to dry according to the care label.
Some curtains may be dry clean only. Take the curtains to a dry cleaner to kill dust mites., Toys, stuffed animals, and other fabric items are great hiding places for dust mites. Collect all washable items and wash them in the washing machine using hot water. Transfer the load to the dryer and dry the items on high heat., There are some items that you won’t be able to machine wash to kill dust mites. With these items, you can freeze them instead to get rid of mites. Transfer each item to a separate plastic bag, and seal the bag tightly. Transfer the item to the freezer and leave it there for 24 hours. Good candidates for freezing include:Pillows
Special toys
Delicate fabrics

, Dust mites love high humidity. The easiest way to decrease the humidity in your house is with a dehumidifier. You can also decrease the humidity by opening windows on dry days. Always use fans and vents when cooking, showering, and other activities that create steam.


By reducing the humidity in your house, you can create an environment that’s not ideal for dust mites, and you will slow down how quickly they reproduce.
Install a hygrometer to keep an eye on the humidity, and keep the level below 50 percent., Dust mites also love high temperatures. The ideal temperature for them is between 75 and 80 F (24 and 27 C). In winter, set your thermostat to 70 F (21 C), and even cooler in the bedroom if that’s comfortable. In summer, use fans, windows, and air conditioning when necessary to keep your house cooler., Disinfectants like Lysol are ideal for killing dust mites, and will make your home inhospitable to them. After your regular dusting, spray the disinfecting spray everywhere that dust tends to collect, including:Corners
Baseboards
Floors
Shelves
Curtains
Near furniture

, Certain essential oils, and eucalyptus specifically, are effective at killing dust mites. There are a few ways you can use eucalyptus around the house to make your home unfriendly for dust mites, including:


Add 20 drops of eucalyptus oil to your washing machine, especially when you're using a cold or warm water setting.Pour about 30 drops of eucalyptus oil into a spray bottle and fill the bottle with water. Use the spray around the house, including on your bed, furniture, pillows, toys, carpets, and other areas where dust mites live.

, Clutter and unnecessary items around the house attract and trap dust, and this creates a feeding frenzy for dust mites. One of the best ways to get rid of dust mites is to eliminate their food source, and while it’s not possible to completely get rid of dust, you can reduce it by throwing out, selling, or properly storing items like:Books
Decorations and ornaments
Picture frames
Trinkets
Home accessories
Decorative pillows

, Regular dusting with a damp cloth is a great way to reduce dust in the house and eliminate food sources for dust mites. Always dust by wiping surfaces with a damp cloth to avoid spreading dust and other allergens around the house.


For the best results, dust your entire house on a weekly basis., Because linens and bedding are such a hot spot for dust mites, it’s important to keep these clean. Weekly washing in hot water that’s between 130 and 140 F (54 to 60 C) will help to control dust mites in your bedroom.Be sure to wash:


Sheets
Pillow cases
Duvet covers
Blankets

, Carpets and rugs are among the worst places in your house for harboring dust mites. While regular vacuuming and washing (for small rugs) will help to reduce mite numbers, getting rid of the carpet altogether will be even more effective.When possible, remove carpeting and replace it with:


Tile
Hard wood
Laminate
Cork
Concrete

, Because things like thick curtains and drapes can house large numbers of dust mites, you can help get rid of them by replacing these items. For instance, you can replace curtains with plastic blinds or wooden shutters, and fabric cushions and pillows with leather or pleather ones.


Not only are these items easier to clean, but they also won’t attract dust mites the way fabrics do., Pet dander is another huge food source for dust mites. To reduce dander in the house, take your dogs and cats outside daily for a thorough brushing. For dogs, you should also give them monthly baths to reduce dander and fur around the house.


Pets can also suffer from dust mite allergies, so keeping them cleaner is beneficial for you both.

, Mattress and pillow covers are plastic or hypoallergenic fabric envelopes that protect your bed from dust mites, bed bugs, and allergens. The covers encase your mattress or pillows and prevent dust mites from getting in, and protect you from allergens that are already present.


To keep these covers clean, wipe plastic ones with a damp cloth and wash fabric ones weekly., Better ventilation means lower humidity, more air flow, and less dust, and all of these are good for controlling dust mites. You can improve ventilation by opening windows, using ceiling and portable fans, and by making use of vents in the house, such as in the kitchen and bathroom."

Place some eggshells.,
Plant some mothballs.,
Set sticky traps.,
Make a coffee and tobacco ball.,
Place a garlic clove.,
Cut some onion slices.,
Pepper-spray around your home.,
Catch a gecko, let it go.",How to Get Rid of Common House Geckos1," This is a very effective and inexpensive way to scare away geckos: they see eggshells and they think “predator.” Leave two eggshell halves around your home, such as at outdoor entryways, or in the kitchen.Do not crush the eggshells, leave them in two halves.
One two-halves pair at every entrance should be enough: the geckos just need to run into it, then they'll run away from it.
To keep the eggshells fresh, change them every 3 to 4 weeks.;
, Mothballs target moths, cockroaches, ants, flies – and geckos! A real household panacea! Leave some under the stove, refrigerator, or sink to repel geckos., Many of the insects that geckos eat are drawn to light, so, oftentimes, geckos will hang out in those areas. Placing some flypaper near light sources will not only catch geckos’ pesky food source, but will likely catch the geckos themselves.A good position to place the flypaper is on the inside of the light bulb’s shade/housing.
You can also set glue boards or sticky cards near windows or other outdoor entryways.
If you find a live gecko stuck in one of your sticky traps, you can unstick it and set it free by pouring vegetable oil over the trap. It’s nasty – but humane!


, Using moist coffee grounds and some tobacco powder, form a small ball with your hands and stick it on the end of a toothpick. Put this near where the geckos are nesting or where they might easily find it, like an outdoor entryway. The geckos will consume some of this ball and die., Garlic’s strong odor isn’t just repellent to some humans, it’s also repellent to geckos, too! Leave a garlic clove around an outdoor entryway to keep them from entering that way ever again., Onion slices are another irritant that will drive geckos away. Cut an onion in half and leave it in a known gecko hiding place, somewhere warm and cozy that you’ve seen a gecko camping out, or by an outdoor entryway., The irritation felt by humans when sprayed by pepper-spray is not unlike that felt by geckos that encounter it. Mix some pepper and water in a spray bottle and spray the solution around your home in places like under the refrigerator, behind the couch, or on the walls – basically, anywhere warm or anywhere you’ve seen a gecko.








Cayenne pepper or chili powder can be used in place of pepper.Tabasco sauce can be used in place of the home-made pepper-spray.Warning: spraying too much may repel ‘’you’’ from your home, so be mindful of its irritating effect.

, If you have a stubborn gecko that just refuses to be repelled from your home, you can try capturing him manually, as it were, by setting a box against a wall and “encouraging” the gecko to get inside. Then you can release it back into the wild – and set some more repellents to keep it out!

Make a homemade gnat trap.,
Make a wine and soap trap.",How to Get Rid of Gnats2," One easy way to rid yourself of a gnat infestation is with an easy and cheap do-it-yourself gnat trap. Find a used can or jar (Mason jars work especially well) and fill it with apple cider vinegar. Gnats are extremely attracted to the scent of vinegar. After you fill your can or jar, seal the lid and poke very small holes with a nail or screw. Leave the jar in a space gnats usually inhabit, most likely your kitchen or dining area. You can make several of these jars to leave in multiple locations, if necessary.


The gnats will fly into the jar, but will be unable to leave. Once the jar becomes full of gnats and you no longer notice any flying around, dispose of the jar and say goodbye to your gnat problem.
If you don't have apple cider vinegar on hand, any type of vinegar will do. Regular white vinegar works well, though you may want to add a couple of drops of dish soap (preferably lemon-scented) to the jar to make it more appealing to the gnats. Another alternative is to chop up a little banana or leave some banana peel in the jar.
If you don't have any lidded jars available, you can make another kind of trap by cutting off the top third of a soda bottle and placing it upside down in the rest of the bottle to form a funnel. Tape it to secure.


,


Get a small container (such as a shot glass).
Pour in some red wine until it's about three quarters full. This is a great way to use up that leftover wine in the end of the bottle.
Add a drop or so of dish soap and stir it in gently.
Leave it out. Soon enough thousands of gnats will be attracted to the wine. They try to sit on the liquids surface, but the dish soap breaks the wine's surface tension. Because of this, the gnats fall straight through and drown.

"

Get rid of the gnats' food supply.,
Cover your trashcans.,
Don't over-water houseplants.,
Check doors and windows.,
Watch out for dampness.",How to Get Rid of Gnats3," Like so many other insects, gnats feed primarily upon the food scraps you leave out in the open. The best solution to preventing gnats is to not ""feed"" them in the first place. By cleaning your kitchen and dining room regularly and quickly disposing of leftover food scraps and cooking remains, you can prevent gnats from invading your house before they ever become a problem.


When you store food, make sure it is in an airtight or wrapped container within a sealed cabinet or refrigerator. Keep fruit in the fridge, to prevent it from becoming overripe and attracting gnats.Never leave dirty dishes in the sink as the scraps of food stuck to them can attract gnats. Wash dishes immediately after use and cover the dish rack with a clean, dry towel.

, You can prevent a gnat invasion by covering your garbage and waste cans around your house and property. If the garbage cans outside your home are open, gnats can feast there and similarly follow their noses into your home. By covering up your garbage, you won't allow gnats a chance to live off off your discarded food.


Avoid keeping bags of trash in the house overnight. Take out all garbage every night and ensure the outdoor trash cans are covered.
Clean out your indoor garbage containers regularly and wipe down the lid and surfaces with bleach. Bleach will kill gnats immediately upon contact.

, Certain species of gnats love hanging around over-watered house plants and laying their eggs in the soil. You can prevent this from happening by keeping an eye on the soil and making sure it is damp rather than wet. Also ensure that the plant has adequate drainage.

, If you happen to notice gnats outside your home, check all of your doors and windows to make sure they are properly sealed with no gaps where gnats could enter. If you need to leave windows and doors open, use a fly screen with a tight mesh, making sure there are no holes in it.

, Gnats love moist places for breeding, so look out for damp corners in the kitchen and other areas of the house. Wipe these damp spots down with bleach or another kind of disinfectant regularly to prevent gnats from invading. Never leave moist towels or clothes lying around, and keep rugs and mats in sunny spots to prevent dampness from developing."
"
Deal with gnat-infested plants.,
Make a homemade gnat spray by mixing a couple of squirts of lemon-scented dish soap with water in a spray bottle.,
If you have taken all of these steps but you still notice gnats hanging around the plant, you may need to repot the plant using fresh soil.

",How to Get Rid of Gnats4," Some types of gnats are attracted to the moist soil in house plants and even lay their eggs in it. There are several things you can do to get rid of the gnats and save your plant. Firstly, you should stop watering your plant until the top two inches of soil become completely dried out. This will cause the gnat eggs and larvae to dry out and die. Unfortunately, the plant may start to look a little sad, but it should quickly perk up once you start watering it again.

, Spray this liberally all over the plant -- on the leaves, the stem and the soil.


Leave the spray to sit on the plant for an hour or two, this should kill off the gnats. You may then want to spray the plant with plain water to rinse off the soap, to avoid causing damage to the plant.

,"
"
Use a professional insect spray.",How to Get Rid of Gnats5," There are many sprays available in supermarkets and hardware stores designed to kill all manner of flying insects. Simply spray the insecticide onto the gnats themselves, or in the usual areas they inhabit. This will immediately kill any and all gnats and other insects.


Make sure to check the label to find out if the insect spray is harmful to pets. Depending on the strength of the spray, you, your family and your pets may need to stay out of the sprayed area for several hours until the chemicals dissipate.

Render your home inhospitable to geckos.,
Render your backyard inhospitable to geckos.,
Ensure your home is sealed.",How to Get Rid of Common House Geckos2," Geckos like warmth, water, and places to hide. You can do several things to make sure your home doesn’t offer these amenities.









Maintain the general cleanliness of your home by keeping the floor swept and not leaving piles of stuff lying around, such as laundry, newspapers, boxes, etc.Keep your furniture six inches from the walls and don’t hang up many pictures: geckos are nocturnal and like warm, dark places to hide out during the day.Keep your thermostat turned down as low as you can handle: geckos like the warmth and humidity of your home when it gets cool at night.If you have any leaky faucets or pipes or any area that generally offers stagnant water in a humid environment – fix them and remove the water because geckos are drawn to those environments., Your backyard can be a welcome mat to your home if geckos are drawn there by their creature comforts: water, insects, and cover. Here are some guidelines to follow in order to make your yard less welcoming:









Remove any places where water can stagnate, such as birdbaths, as these are the breeding grounds for insects geckos prey upon and sources of hydration to geckos.Water your yard sparingly, as lizards enjoy the moist environment and will drink the water for hydration.Do not plant succulents: if a gecko cannot find any water for hydration, it will nibble on succulents to survive.Trim back your bushes, especially those close to your house, because geckos love places to hide.Placing some netting over your shrubs will keep geckos from using them as hideouts.Use outdoor lighting sparingly, as it draws insects that geckos prey upon. If you must use outdoor lighting, consider sodium vapor or yellow lights., Geckos can squeeze their little scaly bodies into small crevices and holes, so make sure your home is well sealed. Walk around the inside and outside of your home and fill any cracks with caulk and make sure your windows and venting are screened properly."

Don’t leave glasses of water lying around for long periods of time.
Make sure water is not stagnating in your sink or bathtub.

, Ants are repelled by the smell of vinegar, so spray or flick some white vinegar around your window and door frames to keep them from marching in.








Also, try to clean up after you eat: soiled napkins, crumbs, and unwashed dishes are alluring to ants.

, Fruit flies love sweet things, they can’t help themselves. So give them what they want: a small bowl or cup of white wine will lead them to dive in for a taste – and never return!







, Moths thrive in humid conditions.One way of making it inhospitable for them in one of their common feasting grounds is to hang a stick of chalk in your clothes closet. This will dry out your closet and keep moths away., Roaches like to eat many things. One thing they absolutely can’t stand, however, is cucumber peelings (go figure). So next time you peel a cucumber, don’t throw the peelings away but instead leave them lying around your kitchen counter or bathtub to keep roaches from venturing out into your home.








If you find your cucumber peels are attracting ants, you can always use Borax: sprinkle some where there is high roach traffic and you should see their population drop in about a month. Contrary to popular belief, Borax is only mildly toxic to humans and pets.

, Spiders seem to pop up without reason, but, aside from you targeting their insect prey, there are ways to keep them at bay inside your home. Here are some ideas:


Seal any spaces that lead outside, such as the sealing around your windows and doors.Trap unwanted spiders by placing glue boards in garbage cans, basements, kitchens and bathrooms.If your spider problem is overwhelming, you might need to spray spider insecticide or call a team of professional., Crickets are a popular food source for geckos, so curtailing their population outside (and inside!) your home is a good idea to deter geckos from coming around.









A shallow bowl filled with molasses (or beer) diluted with water will eliminate crickets inside and outside your home: they’ll jump right in!Keep your grass cut short in your yard because crickets thrive in tall grass."

",How to Get Rid of Ladybugs," The best way to get rid of ladybugs is to remove them physically using a vacuum cleaner. If you cut the hose off with nylon stocking material, you might be able to create a trap using your vacuum. Trap the ladybugs inside by vacuuming them up and let them go back outside.


Use a hose attachment on the vacuum cleaner rather than the bottom push function.
Put the toe end of the stockings over the end of the vacuum hose, with the leg portion of the stocking inside the hose. Secure the end in place with a rubber band.
As you vacuum up the ladybugs, they will get trapped inside the stocking leg. Carefully pull the stocking out and release the ladybugs outside.
Make sure that the stocking does not get sucked into the vacuum cleaner.
If you cannot block the collection bin or department with nylon, make sure that the bag or canister is empty before vacuuming the bugs up. That way, you can still release the ladybugs outside without dumping a bunch of dirt and debris out along with them.;
, If you do this, the ladybug is likely to secrete a yellow substance that can stain skin, clothes, and other surfaces.


Contrary to popular belief, the yellow secretions left by ladybugs is blood, not waste. When a ladybug feels threatened, it leaves behind a small amount of blood as a warning and defense tactic., Use a broom to sweep the ladybugs outside if they are close to a door.


With this method, you still run the risk of startling the ladybugs and causing them to excrete yellow fluid. As such, you should only do it if the insects are only a short distance away from a door or window.

, While light traps offer limited help, setting one or two up in a dark attic or dark basement can attract and trap a few of the ladybugs hiding out in these locations.


Note that these light traps will only take care of a fraction of the problem and are usually only effective on ladybugs living in confined, dark spaces.
Light traps are not very effective when used in living spaces during the fall or spring.

, Scatter the DE in locations you suspect ladybugs to travel in and around. It can be applied both inside and outside.


Food grade DE is recommended since it will be safer to use around pets and kids. That said, you should prevent your kids and pets from coming into contact with the DE.
DE contains shards of sharp algae. These cut into the exoskeleton of the ladybug as the insect crosses over the DE, ultimately causing the bug to die from being unable to hold in moisture or hydration.

, Mix either one with a little water in a spray bottle and spritz it around areas that you suspect ladybugs to be hiding out at. The sprays should drive the ladybugs away without killing them.


Ladybugs are sensitive to the strong odors of camphor and menthol. While these odors do not kill the insects, these bugs find the odors so unpleasant and harsh that they often move away from areas that reek of camphor or menthol.

, A simple tactic to use against ladybugs is to fill a fishbowl or other glass bowl with soapy water. The reflecting light will attract the ladybugs, who will then fall in and suffocate in the soapy film.


Ladybugs are attracted to light. Placing a clear, glass bowl filled with soapy water by a window or lamp can cause the light to reflect, making the bowl seem very appealing to ladybugs. As they try to come closer to look, they will fall in.
A drop or two of liquid dish soap is all you need. This cuts down the water tension, thereby preventing the ladybugs from escaping and causing them to drown.

, Boric acid, also known as borax, should be applied wherever you suspect a ladybug might travel.


The ladybugs must come into direct contact with the boric acid powder to be affected by it.
When ladybugs get boric acid on themselves, they ultimately end up dehydrating to death.

, The only recommended chemical action to take against ladybugs is the use of barrier pesticides. These chemicals should be sprayed around suspected entrances and paths. When the ladybugs cross the barrier, they get the pesticide on them, and eventually die.


Follow the instructions on the label to mix and apply the pesticide correctly. Never use an outdoor pesticide indoors or an indoor pesticide outdoors.
Usually, the chemical is sprayed along a surface and adheres to it thanks to a carrier substrate in the insecticide. As a result, the poison stays on the surface, waiting for the ladybug to cross over it.

,


Most indoor bug bombs tend to be ineffective when ladybugs are concerned.
Additionally, bug bombs can leave stains and residues on walls, counters, and other surfaces. These stains can be difficult to remove.

, If all else fails, a professional exterminator should be able to come up with a solution to manage your ladybug problem. Make sure to call a pest control operator who has worked with ladybug infestations in the past, though.


A professional will evaluate the problem carefully to determine the best method of approach. He or she will usually apply a fast-acting residual insecticide more potent than those available commercially.
The chemicals commonly used by professionals include lambda cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, bifenthrin, and cyfluthrin., Patch screen doors and window screens with additional screening wherever you see holes.


If your screens are covered in holes, you may find it simpler, quicker, and ultimately cheaper to simply buy a new screen to replace the old one.

, One of the easiest ways to seal off a gap at the bottom of a door is to apply weather stripping there.


As an added bonus, you will likely save money on your electricity bill since less heat will escape your home and you will need less heat overall to warm things up.

, When the weather starts to get colder and the ladybugs are more likely to creep inside for warmth, temporarily block your roof vents with fine wire mesh to cut off a likely path.

, Any other hole or gap that leads from the exterior of your house to the interior needs to be mended so that ladybugs are cut off from your house altogether.


Use high quality silicone or silicone-latex caulk for the best results.Make sure to get all cracks around all your windows, door, siding, utility pips, chimneys, and wood fascia.
Typically speaking, caulk is best for openings around windows and doors, while mortar might be better for cracks or holes in the outer wall. You may need cement for notably large holes.
This step, too, can help you save money on your electricity bill.

, While there is little scientific evidence to support the claim, popular lore dictates that light colors and contrasting colors are more appealing to ladybugs. Painting or siding your house with dark colors could, theoretically, cause fewer ladybugs to come visit.This up for debate, so you should not put too much effort, time, or money into this one unless you plan on changing the color of your house already for other, unrelated reasons.

Apply a home insecticide.",How to Get Rid of Clover Mites," By knowing where to look for clover mites, you can assess the severity of the infestation and begin a treatment regiment. Outside, clover mites gather underneath bark at the base of trees, in lawns, and around algae- or mold-covered areas like roofs and cracks. Clover mites also gather under sidings and in sewers. If the infestation has spread to the cracks and siding of your home, there is a decent chance there are mites already inside your home, making home treatment necessary as well as lawn treatment.;
, Giving your lawn or the plants around your home too much water can create conditions that are perfect for mold and other fungi that can attract the mites. Too much fertilizer can cause a similar problem. If you do not overfeed your lawn, you can prevent these food sources from growing, discouraging the expansion of the infestation.

, If you notice clover mites around the base of your trees or crawling on the leaves or stems of other plants, treat the infested plants with a liquid pesticide labeled to treat mites. Apply the pesticide early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid scorching the plants, and follow label directions to avoid under-dosing or overdosing.

, When a home or plant has clover mites, there is a good chance the entire lawn is infested. If further inspection proves this to be true, apply a broad-range spray pesticide over your entire lawn. Dilute both granular and liquid pesticides with water according to label directions and spray the entire landscape, using a mist nozzle, in the early morning or evening, before the heat of the afternoon.

, Focus your efforts on the south, southwest, and east sides of the house. Clover mites need plant material to survive, and by removing it from the area near your home, you reduce the likelihood of having the infestation spread to your home. You can either leave these areas bare or you can cover them with mulch or gravel, which often turn mites away because it is difficult to crawl over.


Note that gravel and mulch do not always drive the mites away. Resilient clover mites will crawl over it, difficult or not. Moreover, if mold or moss is allowed to gather on these materials, you may end up attracting the mites to your home instead of driving them away.

, Even though many plants provide the mites with a food source, some plants repel clover mites. These plants often prove even more helpful than bare ground or mulch.


Mite-repelling flowers include geranium, zinnia, marigold, salvia, rose, chrysanthemum, and petunia.
Mite-repelling shrubs include barberry, juniper, spruce, arborvitae, and yew.

, Spray a barrier around the perimeter of your house that is 2 feet (61 cm) high and 5 feet (1.5 m) (1.5 m) wide. You need to apply the chemical thoroughly, making sure that you do not miss any spots, and you may need to repeat treatments several times while you get the infestation in your lawn under control.


Apply the treatment in the morning, before the heat of the afternoon or the coolness of night. Bright sun can damage vegetation, but cold weather can make the product less effective.

, Windows, doors, and cracks are all places where mites may enter. Placing a powder-like substance, such as talc baby powder or baking soda, will stop the clover mites that crawl through those spaces from entering any further into the home. The dust coats the clover mites, making it difficult to move and causing them to die off one by one.

, Since the mites are so small, they cannot avoid strips of tape placed across their entryways. When mites crawl onto the tape, they will get stuck and will eventually die. Once the tape becomes covered by dead mites, you can remove it and stick another one in its place.

, When you see clover mites, use a vacuum cleaner to sweet them up instead of smashing them. Smashing the mites usually leaves behind a red stain. Aside from vacuuming up the mites as you see them, you can also do frequent broad-area vacuuming to pick up any mites or mite eggs that you do not see.

, Indoor insecticide application is generally considered a last resort, but occasionally, it may well be necessary. Apply a mild mite-killing insecticide, lightly spraying it on the crawling mites. Avoid broad use of interior insecticides. It is generally considered safer and better to use an insecticide that must be applied directly to the pests than it is to use one that is applied to surfaces of the home.

Mow your lawn regularly and reduce tall vegetation.,
Discourage chigger hosts from coming to your yard.,
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth.",How to Get Rid of Chiggers1," Briars, weeds, and tall grass are all well-known hiding spots for chiggers. Pulling weeds and keeping your grass short is a simple yet effective way to get rid of any chiggers living in your yard. Removing these elements removes the shade and moisture chiggers thrive in. Sunlight and good air circulation create a discouraging atmosphere for chiggers to live in.
You should also regularly prune your trees, bushes, and other shrubs to lower the humidity around those plants and allow more sunlight to filter in.
Continue these practices year round. Dormant chiggers can still return once the weather warms up, so to get rid of them completely, you need to make the habitat as unfriendly as possible at all times.;
, Reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals are favorite hosts among chiggers. Discouraging these animals from hanging around your garden or yard may also cause the chiggers to leave since they will instinctively want to follow their food source.


Remove sources of water that invite reptiles and amphibians.
The removal of dense foliage or shrubbery can discourage small mammals that might otherwise use these areas as convenient hiding places.
Secure lids onto your trashcans and consider setting up fencing around the perimeter of your garden or yard.

, If you need a natural, organic pesticide for severe chigger infestations, you can do a broadcast application of diatomaceous earth to help ward off chiggers and other garden and lawn pests.


This is a natural product formed soft sedimentary rock, which in turn was produced by small, fossilized creatures called diatoms. It comes in the form of a fine white or off-white powder.
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the perimeter of your yard and over any areas that may offer ideal conditions for chiggers to live in. These areas include anything that may be overgrown or any area that offers a good hiding place, shade, and moisture. Focus on tall grass, weeds, and briars.

Remove infested items.,
Kill mold and mildew in the house.,
Run a dehumidifier.,

Improve ventilation.,
Use pesticides as a last resort.,
Vacuum.,
Wipe down areas where booklice were present.,
Throw out paper products you don’t need.,

Keep food airtight.,
Control the humidity and ventilation inside.",How to Get Rid of Booklice," Before trying to get rid of booklice, it’s a good idea to ensure that you actually have them. Otherwise, your attempts to kill them may not work! You can identify booklice by their appearance and by where you find them.


Booklice are small insects between 0.04 and 0.08 inches (1 and 2 mm) in length. The abdomen makes up the majority of the entire body.These insects come in a range of colors, from translucent to white, and from gray to brown.
Booklice that live indoors do not have wings, but they do have relatively large mouthparts.
Because booklice feed on mold, they're often found in warm, moist environments, such as near books and papers, under wallpaper, in pantries, and in open food and grain containers.;
, One of the simplest ways to get rid of booklice from a home or other space is by throwing out infested items, such as books, boxes, stacks of paper, and food.


Throw out any contaminated food items that you find, such as old cereal boxes, bags of flour, or grains and other items that aren't airtight.
To kill booklice on infested items that you don’t want to throw out, seal the items in a plastic bag and place it in the freezer for one to two days. Then remove the bag from the freezer and vacuum the item to get rid of the dead booklice., Booklice love eating mold, and removing their primary food source is a great way to get rid of them. Mold isn't good for human health, so it’s a good idea for your family and for your infestation to get rid of it.


Mold grows where there's moisture, such as on food, in bathrooms and kitchens, in laundry rooms, and on paper products.
When you see visible mold in your house, kill it by scrubbing the area with oxygen bleach, vinegar, or borax.There are some items, such as paper and books, that can’t properly be disinfected without destroying the item. Throw out moldy items that can't be cleaned.

, Booklice need moisture to survive, so reducing the humidity in your house will kill them. Set up a few dehumidifiers, especially in damp areas like basements and bathrooms. Run them to remove moisture from the environment.


To kill booklice, you'll have to get the humidity under 50 percent. Use a hygrometer to measure the humidity.Be sure to empty the reservoir on the dehumidifier when it becomes full.

, There can be lots of standing water in your house that leads to mold, and removing these will stop the primary food source from growing. To clean up and prevent standing water in your house:


Fix any leaking or dripping pipes in the housePlace removable trays under indoor plants to catch excess water
Clean up spills immediately
Use mats in front of showers and bathtubs

, Another way to remove moisture and prevent mold is to increase the ventilation inside. The best ways to do this is by opening windows whenever and wherever possible, and by running ceiling or standing fans to circulate air.Ventilation is particularly important in areas that are prone to moisture, such as basements, attics, and bathrooms.
All bathrooms should be equipped with ceiling fans to remove moisture when showers and tubs are in use.

, Booklice don’t bite, don’t carry infectious diseases, and don’t really destroy wood, paper, or other materials. Because of this, pesticides aren't usually necessary, especially because infestations can usually be controlled by reducing humidity and increasing ventilation. However, if you have a large and uncontrollable infestation, you may want to try a pesticide.


For house-wide infestations, spray anywhere you’ve seen booklice, in all damp rooms and areas, along the foundation of the house, around window and door frames, and even the cracks and seams in bookshelves and pantries.Pesticides you can use include Tri-Die Aerosol, diatomaceous earth, Demand CS, and 565 Plus XLO., After you’ve removed moisture and mold, and increased ventilation, you'll likely have a number of dead booklice bodies lying around. To clean them up, simply vacuum the entire house. Be sure to use nozzle and brush attachments to get into nooks and crannies in areas where booklice were living.For a booklice infestation around books, remove the books from the shelves and vacuum the covers, bindings, and pages.
If you don’t have a vacuum, dust furniture, shelves, and other areas, and then sweep the floors thoroughly.

, When all the books are off the shelves, clean the shelves with your favorite household cleaner. If you had booklice in the kitchen, remove all the food items from the cupboards and clean out the pantry with an all-purpose cleaner.


Let cupboards, shelves, and pantries dry completely over several hours before returning items to their proper places., Paper products can mold easily, especially in high-humidity environments. To ensure that you’ve removed the entire booklice infestation and possible food sources, throw out mold-prone items that you don’t need and don’t use.


Paper products include things like printer and writing paper, letters, books, old newspapers and magazines, and even boxes and cardboard., To prevent books, paper, and boxes from growing mold, keep them in a dry environment. Also, store them off the ground whenever possible.Books should always be kept on shelves rather than stacked on the floor.
If you have a lot of items stored in boxes, store the boxes on shelves when possible, or build platforms to keep them off the ground.

, A bit of water spilled on the ground may not seem like a big deal, but it can actually lead to mold growth in the right environment, especially if it happens frequently. Cleaning spills includes when you:Spill a drink
Slosh water out of the sink when doing dishes
Drip water when getting out of the bath or shower
Experience a pipe burst or leak

, Booklice don’t actually eat the food in your cupboards, but they will feed on mold and fungi that grow on that food. To prevent early spoilage and a booklice infestation, transfer all dry food items to airtight containers after opening. This includes:Breads
Cereals
Beans and grains
Flours, sugars, and other baking supplies

, Even after the booklice infestation has been taken care of, you should still maintain the humidity in your house to prevent mold and stop a future infestation.Leave a dehumidifier running in the dampest rooms in your house year round.
Open windows as often as possible, and use fans to circulate air in the house.

Begin looking for bagworms during the winter or early spring.,
Sweep and rake under trees regularly to get rid of fallen egg sacks.,
Notice areas of dead pine needles or branches.,
Observe new places the bagworms may live.,
Fill a plastic bucket with a mixture of warm water and dish soap.,
Put on garden gloves and bring a small pair of clippers to aid you in removing the bagworms entirely.,
Lift branches, clip off bagworm egg sacks and drop them into the bucket of soapy water.,
Dump the soaked bagworms into a sealed plastic sack and throw them in your dumpster.

,
Repeat this procedure every fall, winter and early spring to reduce bagworm populations before the eggs hatch.,
Plan to treat bagworms with insecticide in May.,
Look for a small, worm-like head poking out of the top of the sack.,
Purchase an insecticide such as Dipel or Thuricide.,
Put the insecticide in a sprayer.,
Spray insecticide in late May, June and early July.",How to Get Rid of Bagworms," Bagworm egg sacks are brown and one and a half to two inches (3.8 to 5 cm) long. They are covered with dead needles, so they appear more noticeable in contrast to the green deciduous needles at this time.


Bagworm sacks can be very hard to find because they look like pine cones. Look through your pinecones to find variations that may be bagworms.;
, Don’t put the debris in the compost, where the larvae can live. Place them in sealed plastic bags in your trashcan.

, If your tree has begun to turn brown, the bagworms might have killed it already. You will want to try a last effort to rid your entire garden of the worms, so that they don’t spread to other trees.

, Their silks are transported by the wind. Anywhere the wind blows in your yard is a potential new spot for the moths and a great place to look.

, Mix it well.

, Clippers will remove all traces of the bagworm threads, so that it’s harder for new bagworms to find their way into the tree., Make sure they are submerged fully.

,, You will reduce the amount of pesticide you need to use if you do a thorough job of handpicking the egg sacks.

, This is when they hatch and are at their most vulnerable. In some areas they hatch in early June., However, they often get spooked back into their sack if they are startled.

, They contain bacillus thuringiensis, a bacteria that is deadly to young bagworms. If you have many trees affected by bagworms, it can be expensive to thoroughly kill the bagworms with insecticide.Orthene, Talstar and Tempo are other insecticides that have been effective in killing newly-hatched bagworms., Thoroughly wet the leaves and needles of the trees that can be affected. Beware when spraying insecticide around pets and small children.


Consider cordoning off the area just after you spray.

, This is when it can kill young larvae. Stop by late July and August when the bagworms are resilient and the insecticide no longer works.


Once September and early October begin, the adult bagworms begin fertilizing their eggs. You should begin the process of handpicking the egg sacks at this time.
Adult male bagworms are moths with black wings and brown spots. They die after fertilization. Female bagworms remain inside the sack in their larval state.

Avoid tall grass.,
Keep your skin covered.,
Close off all openings in your clothes.,
Sprinkle sulfur powder in your socks and shoes.,
Brush exposed skin every 30 minutes while outside.While chiggers have been known to bite exposed skin, they do not necessarily latch on as soon as they come into contact with your flesh.,
Avoid sitting or lying on the ground.,
Shower with hot water and soap after coming indoors.,
Wash your clothes in hot water.",How to Get Rid of Chiggers2," If you are walking in a park, picnic area, or other location at which you have no control over how tall the grass and weeds are, you should avoid areas with tall vegetation and stick to well-worn paths.Avoid unmowed fields and walk in the center of mowed trails to avoid accidentally brushing up against taller vegetation.
Chiggers need well-hidden vegetation that offers plenty of shade and moisture in order to thrive. Tall vegetation provides the perfect environment, which is why you should avoid it if you want to avoid chiggers.

, If you have no choice but to go into an outdoor area with tall vegetation, you should prevent chiggers from attaching themselves to your skin by concealing as much skin as possible. Wear long sleeves, long pants, and tall boots.


You should also opt for tightly-woven fabrics over airy, loosely-woven ones. Chiggers are small enough to find their way in between the gaps present between threads of loosely-woven fabrics, but they will have a significantly harder time finding their way through clothes with smaller gaps.

, Chiggers can find their way to your skin by hopping onto your clothes and crawling underneath. To get rid of them before this happens, you should seal off any openings to your skin as best as possible.Tuck your socks into your pants or your pant legs into your socks, sealing off the gap of skin between them.
If venturing into tall grass or weeds, consider tying off your sleeves around the wrists with rubber bands or ribbon.
When possible, wear clothes with zippers over clothes with buttons.

, Certain strong odors, including sulfur powder, have a tendency to drive chiggers away. Sprinkle a fine dusting of sulfur powder into your shoes and/or socks to drive off any chiggers lurking in the grass and weeds by your feet.


For even better protection, consider sprinkling a light dusting of sulfur powder over the inside of your shirt and pants.
Note that sulfur powder does have a potent odor, which may make it a less than ideal solution if you have a particularly sensitive sense of smell.

, Quickly brushing over any exposed skin on your arms and legs every half hour or so may help you to get rid of any chiggers hanging out on your body.


To the same end, you can also brush off your clothes to help remove chiggers from your garments, as well.

, Even though chiggers do not often hang around low-cut grass, if that grass is near taller vegetation, you should avoid sitting or lying on it. Chiggers can migrate to those areas, and exposing the bare skin of you neck and face could cause chiggers to bite and attach themselves there.

, If you were outside in an area often infested by chiggers, you should take a hot bath or shower immediately after coming back inside.To ensure extermination, you should lather, rinse, and repeat several times during the shower. The water must also be hot, rather than lukewarm.
Vigorously scrub your skin with a washcloth to dislodge any chiggers that may have attached themselves to your skin.
If chiggers did attach themselves to your skin, you may have to deal with the bug bite afterward. Itching associated with chigger bites can be temporarily relieved with benzocaine ointment, hydrocortisone cream, and calamine lotion. You may also be able to reduce itching with petroleum jelly, baby oil, or fingernail polish.

, If you suspect that you may have been exposed to chiggers while you were outside, you can get rid of any hiding out in your clothes by washing the garments in hot, soapy water.


The water should reach a minimum of 125 degrees Fahrenheit (52 degrees Celsius).
The washing cycle should last for 30 minutes or more to ensure extermination.
After washing your clothes, you can dry them in a drying machine or in the sunlight.
Do not wear chigger-infested clothes before washing them. Do not wash the clothes in cool water, since this will not get rid of the chiggers.

Use a repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET).,
Try permethrin treatments for you clothes.,
Look for an insecticide containing bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, esfenvalerate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon bifenthrin, carbaryl, cyhalothrin, or permethrin.,
Call a professional pest control operator.",How to Get Rid of Chiggers3," DEET is one of the most effective bug repellents for use against chiggers and other mites. Apply the repellent to your exposed skin, especially on the hands, arms, and legs.


DEET treatments can last for two to three hours.
Do not spray DEET repellents near your mouth or eyes.
Do not spray DEET repellents on skin covered by clothing, as doing so may cause skin irritation.
Follow label directions carefully when applying. Some repellents can damage clothing, plastics, nail polish, and painted or varnished surfaces.
If any allergic reaction occurs, seek emergency medical treatment.

, Permethrin repellents (0.5%) are also very useful against chiggers, but these should only be applied to your clothes and not directly to your skin.


Permethrin repellents can last for several days after application and remain on your clothes after being washed once or twice. In fact, it is recommended that you treat your clothes one day before you wear them.
Apply the repellent to both sides of your clothing, focusing on openings like cuffs, necks, and waistbands. Let the repellent dry before putting your clothes on.
Follow label directions carefully as you apply the repellent. As with DEET repellents, some permethrin repellents can damage clothing, plastics, nail polish, and painted or varnished surfaces.
If an allergic reaction occurs, seek emergency medical treatment.

, Insecticides containing any of these chemicals will usually prove effective at killing chiggers, but you should read the label carefully to determine if a specific insecticide is formulated for mite or chigger removal.


When applying insecticides to use against chiggers, you should treat hot spots instead of treating the entire area. This is less expensive, quicker, and generally more effective.
Pick out hot spots by placing small squares of black cardboard around the edge of the grass. Watch for a few minutes for yellow or pink chiggers. If you spot any, you can consider the area a hot spot.

Test 10 to 12 locations and focus on areas with ideal chigger habitats. Weeds, tall grass, dead leaves, and briars are the best areas, but you should consider any location in your yard that is moist and shaded.


Follow label instructions concerning application carefully. Wear protective clothing to prevent insecticides from coming into contact with your skin or eyes as you apply them.
Note that you may need to retreat the area two to three weeks later if you have a large number of chiggers infesting your yard.
Note that liquid spray insecticides are generally more effective against chiggers than granular insecticides. If selecting a granular insecticide, however, choose one containing bifenthrin., If preventative measures, natural remedies, and home chemical remedies do not succeed in getting rid of your chigger problem, contact a professional exterminator to help out.


Pest control professionals are licensed to use stronger formulations of chemicals that are more hazardous yet more effective. For instance, the exterminator will often use propoxur, cyfluthrin, or fluvalinate to get rid of chiggers from a yard.
Stay off treated areas until dry. Prevent children and pets from walking over treated areas, as well.
Even with these stronger chemicals, you may need to retreat the area after two or three weeks if the infestation is heavy enough.

Purchase a live trap.,
Observe the armadillo.,
Position the trap.,
Check regularly on the trap.,
Release the armadillo.",How to Get Rid of Armadillos1," An animal trap is a hands-free way to humanely catch an armadillo and get it out of your hair for good. Purchase a large one-door animal trap from a store like Home Depot or Walmart.Make sure that the trap you purchase is a live trap, also known as a catch-and-release trap. These traps are non-lethal and won’t harm the armadillo.
Try to get a trap with measurements around 12” x 10” x 30”.;
, Before setting up the trap, take note of where the armadillo likes to hang out in your yard. You may notice that it burrows in a specific hole or that it tends to hide in a certain corner. Understanding the armadillo’s patterns will help you know where to set up your trap./images/thumb/8/84/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-2-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/8/84/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-2-Version-4.jpg









Also check outdoor structures like your shed or garage.

, Since armadillos usually come out at nighttime and in the early morning, set your trap up during the afternoon when the armadillo is out of sight. Place the trap in an area you have seen the armadillo crawl through. If the armadillo has a burrow, place the trap with the mouth of the trap near the hole. If the armadillo likes a certain area of underbrush, place the trap with the mouth facing the path the armadillo usually takes./images/thumb/8/86/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-3-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/8/86/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-3-Version-4.jpg









In general, armadillos prefer to crawl along the outskirts of a space rather than through the middle. Avoid placing the trap in the middle of the room or yard unless you’ve seen the armadillo there often.
Some people decide to bait armadillo traps with earthworms. However, it’s best not to bait traps since armadillos naturally burrow and dig to get their food and rarely eat things they find on the ground. The bait also may attract raccoons or other unwanted animals.Consider setting boards in a V-shape leading into the trap to lure the armadillos inside.

, Check on the trap several times a day after setting it. You don’t want to trap the armadillo only to forget about it, causing the animal distress. If after a few days the armadillo is still loose, consider moving the trap to another location that the armadillo favors.


If you have tried repositioning the trap and the armadillo still doesn't go in, call animal control.

, After you have captured the armadillo, try to release it as soon as possible. Put on protective gloves to protect your hands from the armadillo’s claws. Place the cage on floor of your car or in the bed of your truck. Drive at least five miles away from your home to a wooded area, preferably one around water, and open the cage to release the armadillo.Stand behind or to one side of the cage as you release the armadillo. There's no reason for it to attack you, but you should still try to not stand directly in front of its path.

Install a fence.,
Figure out their point of entry.,
Close any burrows in your yard.,
Remove brush and potential shelter.,
Make your yard smell unpleasant.,
Purchase parasitic worms.",How to Get Rid of Armadillos2," A fence is the best way to prevent future armadillos from entering your house or backyard. Because armadillos tend to dig and burrow, make sure that the fence starts a foot below the ground./images/thumb/e/eb/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-6-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/e/eb/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-6-Version-4.jpg









Through putting up a fence is a lot of work, so is repairing a damaged garden or backyard after an armadillo has dug it up. Though having just one armadillo may not warrant putting up a fence, if it is a recurring problem a fence may be your best option.
The material of the fence doesn't matter as long as it's sturdy and is installed a foot into the ground.

, If you have caught armadillos inside your house, try to figure out how they got in. Look for any holes or spaces in your house, particularly in seldom-visited places like your basement. Once you have pinpointed the way that the armadillos are getting in, consult a carpenter about the best way to seal your house from small animals./images/thumb/2/2d/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-7-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/2/2d/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-7-Version-2.jpg









Likewise, if you already have a fence around your backyard and the armadillo is still getting in, try to see if the armadillo has dug a hole under your fence that it’s using to get in. Fill in the hole with dirt, and if the problem persists, consider installing the fence a foot or more into the ground.

, Armadillos often dig burrows, or large holes, as they are scavenging for food in the ground. If an armadillo has left a burrow in your yard, fill it up with dirt. This will discourage other armadillos from continuing work on the burrow and further disrupting your lawn./images/thumb/9/98/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/98/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg









Fill the burrow completely with pea gravel and dirt to make it less easy to dig up.

, Armadillos tend to like dark, enclosed places like the space inside clumps of bushes or behind low-hanging brush. If you repeatedly notice armadillos in your yard, consider changing the landscaping to eliminate potential shelter./images/thumb/a/a0/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/a/a0/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg









This could involve snipping overhanging branches or moving patio furniture toward the middle of the lawn to prevent armadillos from hiding under it.

, Armadillos have exceptionally strong senses of smell and are naturally repelled by certain scents. Castor oil is a substance proven to repel armadillos. It is usually marketed toward moles and gophers, but works on several foraging animals. Follow the instructions on the bottle for the best effect.The scent of mothballs also repels armadillos. Place mothballs around burrows as well as any areas you want to protect like your garden to stave off armadillos.
Armadillos are also repelled by the scent of cayenne pepper. Shake cayenne pepper liberally around your yard to ward them off.
You can also soak a rag in vinegar or ammonia and leave it near the burrow to repel armadillos.

, If you are having trouble with armadillos in your garden, spread parasitic worms in your garden or flower beds. Parasitic worms feed on many of the insects that armadillos eat. After the worms have stayed in your yard for a few days, armadillos will see that your yard is not a good food source and won’t come back."

Use a doormat to keep the floor clean.,
Sweep every day.,
Clean up spills right away.,
Use a simple vinegar solution for everyday washing.,
Be sure to pick the right commercial cleanser.,
Use dish soap for deeper dirt.,
Remove scuffs with oil or WD-40.,
Use a baking soda paste on stains.,
Try rubbing alcohol for makeup or ink stains.,
Scrub with a soft nylon brush.,
Rinse with clean water to remove residue.,
Don't scrub too hard.,
Don't use abrasive cleaners.,
Avoid getting the floor too wet.,
Use felt tips on your chairs and tables.",How to Clean Vinyl Flooring," The substances you track into your house on your shoes are damaging to vinyl flooring. Dirt, tiny pits of gravel, and chemicals from asphalt are abrasive to the vinyl, and over time will cause it to get scratched and yellowed. The solution is to wipe your shoes on a doormat, or, even better, take them off when you enter the house.


Using throw rugs in spots that tend to get a lot of foot traffic is also a good idea. In the kitchen, for example, you might want to place a rug in front of the sink, where you might tend to stand when you wash vegetables or do the dishes.;
, Cleaning up dirt and dust as it comes is important, since when it accumulates it can end up getting ground into the floor as people walk through the room. Dirt and dust act as an abrasive and take the sheen off of vinyl flooring. Sweep every day to prevent dirt and dust from building up and becoming a problem.If you'd prefer not to use a broom, you could use a dry mop or vacuum to remove everyday dust and debris.
Be sure to clean under your furniture, along baseboards, and under cabinets.

, Whatever you spill, whether it's orange juice or just a cup of water, clean it up instead of letting it dry on the floor. Sugary drinks are harder to clean once they've dried, and even water can damage the flooring when it's left to sit too long. Cleaning up messes right away will keep your floor looking new and prevent you from doing a lot of work later.

, Vinegar is a totally harmless substance that lightly cleans vinyl floors to keep them looking fresh. As a general rule, you want to use the mild cleanser possible to do the job, since harsher cleanser are tougher on the flooring. To make a vinegar solution, simply mix a cup of apple cider vinegar with a gallon of hot water and use a mop to clean the floor.The acid in apple cider vinegar cleans the floor gently without leaving a residue, which is perfect for keeping vinyl in good shape. As the cleanser dries, the smell of vinegar will fade away.
If you want your floor to look shiny, add a few drops of jojoba oil to the mix.

, If vinegar isn't for you, you could instead use a vinyl floor cleanser manufactured for this purpose. Just be sure you choose the right type of cleanser:


No-wax cleanser is made for modern flooring that doesn't have a waxed surface.
Cleanser for waxed floors is made for older vinyl flooring, which has a waxed surface that must stay intact.


, Mix up your standard apple cider vinegar solution, but this time add a tablespoon of dish soap. The soap should help lift dirt that's embedded in the floor. Use a mop made with nylon scrub bristles for deeper cleaning.

, Vinyl flooring is infamous for getting scuffed, but luckily there's an easy way to remove them. Place jojoba oil or WD-40 on a soft cloth, and use it to rub the scuff marks. If the scuffs are simply on the surface of the floor, they'll rub right off.


Scratches are deeper than scuffs, and they won't just rub away. You can clean the scratches so they're less noticeable, but if you want to get rid of the scratches entirely, you'll just have to replace the individual tiles they're on.


, Mix baking soda with enough water to make a thick paste, and use a soft cloth to rub it over stains from food, like wine or berry juice. The baking soda is slightly abrasive and should take the stains right up.

, Dab a soft cloth in rubbing alcohol and rub it over bathroom stains from makeup and other pigmented items. The alcohol will lift the stains from the vinyl without damaging it.


To remove fingernail polish, try using acetone-free fingernail polish remover. Don't use polish remover that contains acetone, since this can damage vinyl.

, If there's a tricky stain that won't come up with a soft cloth, you can scrub with a soft nylon brush. Make sure you don't use a stiff-bristled brush, since it could leave scratches on your floor.

, After you've cleaned all the stains away, rinse the floor so the residue doesn't sit there. Soap and other substances that build up on the surface of the floor will damage it over time. , Using a stiff-bristled brush and scrubbing too hard will take the shine off of your vinyl flooring. It's important to use the softest possible material needed to remove dirt or stains.


Never try to pry dried substances off the floor with a knife, since it will leave a permanent scratch. Soak the area in a solution appropriate for the stain and attempt to remove it with a soft cloth once it's saturated.

, It's important to use the right type of cleaner for vinyl flooring. Using just any old household cleaner is likely to take the shine off the vinyl, since most contain chemicals that are too abrasive. Stick with vinegar or a commercial cleaner formulated for the type of floor you have.

, Soaking the floor with water will damage the glue that keeps the vinyl adhered to the floor underneath. The water will get into the cracks between the tiles and get trapped under the tiles. Use only as much water as you need to cleanse the floor, and make sure it's dry when your job is done.

, Moving chairs and tables around tends to scuff and scratch floors. Make your cleaning job easier by placing felt tips or pads on the bottoms of your chair and table legs. Avoid using chairs and tables with rollers, since these tend to scuff worse than felt-tipped legs.

Absorb the surface oil with kitty litter.,
Dispose of the litter.,
Squirt dish soap over the stain.,
Add hot water.,
Scrub thoroughly.,
Absorb after 10–60 minutes.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Clean up Oil Spills in a Garage1," Cheap, clay kitty litter will absorb recently spilled oil, before it's soaked in too far. Pour on enough to cover the spill completely, and grind it down onto the oil with a brush. Wait 24 hours for the litter to absorb the oil.You can also use talc, diatomaceous earth, fly ash, fuller's earth, or a commercial oil-absorbent product. Check the label for health and safety information before using. Some of these materials may be dangerous to inhale.
If you just spilled the oil and don't own any litter, soak up as much as you can with paper towels. Blot the spill with an up-and-down motion. Do not wipe i;
, Sweep up the kitty litter and store it in an airtight, metal container with no plastic lining. Check your local laws to find out how to dispose of this flammable material. Some trash collection services will pick up the container, while others require you to bring it to a landfill or hazardous waste materials site.If you handle a lot of waste oil, buy an oily waste can. These are ventilated to cause the soaked litter or rags to dry more quickly.Do not try to wash away the litter. Motor oil can harm plants and pollute storm drains. If not all the oil is absorbed, hosing it may just spread the stain.

, In most cases, the litter will still leave a light oil stain on the concrete. Squirt ordinary liquid dish soap onto this stain.


If the stain is quite dark or large, you may want to try the methods listed under Old Oil Stains instead.
An engine degreaser may work as well.

, Pour on a tiny bit of hot water and mix it into the soap, just enough to make it spreadable. Brush the mixture over the oil stain until the soap covers it in a thin layer.

, It can take some effort to drive the soap into the oil stain, especially if it's penetrated deeply. Scrub with a stiff brush until there are plenty of suds.


Do not use a wire brush, which may scratch the concrete.

, Wait at least 10 minutes for the soap to pull up the oil, and up to an hour for heavy spills.Once ready, absorb the dirty soap mixture using more kitty litter, paper towels, or a disposable sponge. Dispose of all oil-soaked materials as you handled the first round of kitty litter.


Blot the paper towel or sponge directly onto the soap, lifting up. Do not rub it against the floor.
If the soap is difficult to pick up, dilute it with warm or hot water. Absorb all of the water before it carries pollutants to a garden or storm drain.

, Oil spills often take two or three scrubs to remove entirely. If the stain is still dark or the scrubbing didn't have an effect, try a specialized product, as described below.


You do not need to repeat the initial kitty litter soak, just the soap treatment.

Pick them up by hand.,
Sweep them up.,
Use a vacuum to get rid of them.,
Kill the bugs.",How to Get Rid of Boxelder Bugs1," This is a safe, although labor-intensive, way of removing them. You can simply put on a pair of gloves and grab the bugs individually. Boxelder bugs do not bite or sting, so there is no risk of injury or pain. You do need to have quick reflexes, as these bugs can move pretty quickly. Be sure not to squish the bugs while you pick them up. Squished boxelder bugs can give off a noxious smell, which you don't want in your home.;
, If you don't want the close contact required of picking the bugs up by hand, you can just use a broom to sweep them up or out the door. Be careful and sweep them up gently, as squishing them with your broom can release a bad smell.


Boxelder bugs that you remove from your house can be placed back outside if you don't want to kill them. This method does run the risk that the same bugs will reenter your house in the future.

, The easiest way to get rid of the bugs that are in your house is to use a vacuum to suck them up. This requires you to have a vacuum out and ready to use when you see a boxelder bug.Be sure to empty out your vacuum bag or canister quickly after sucking up bugs. You can either deposit the bag directly into the garbage (knowing that some of the bugs are still alive inside the bag) or place it in the freezer overnight to kill the bugs.
If you freeze the bugs to death, you can then take the vacuum bag out of the freezer and continue to use the same bag in your vacuum., You can kill boxelder bugs if you need to. This can be done by spraying a mixture of soap and water directly onto the bugs. This mixture, made of five tablespoons of laundry soap mixed into one gallon of water, only works when the soap mixture is wet and applied directly to the bugs, so it may need to be reapplied if new bugs emerge.You should not use insecticide if the boxelder bugs are in your house. First of all, insecticides are poison and bringing poison into your house can create a health risk to you, your family, and your pets. Secondly, killing boxelder bugs in your house, and not knowing where the dead bugs are, can attract other bugs that eat the carcasses."

Scrub with an alkaline degreaser.,
Treat with an enzymatic or microbial cleaner.",How to Clean up Oil Spills in a Garage2," This product, also sold as ""concrete cleaner,"" is essentially a powerful soap available from concrete distribution outlets. It tends not to work well on non-porous concrete, or on heavily stained areas. Here's how to apply it:Dilute with water according to label (Skip this for heavy stains.)

Apply over the stain.
Scrub hard for several minutes.
Leave it for several hours.
Blot the residue with rags, or lift it with an industrial wet vac.

, One of the newest ways to deal with oil is to break it down with an enzyme or microbe. These can be very effective if you can find one formulated for your specific oil product. Look in hardware and home improvement stores, or online janitorial supply stores. To clean up the stain, just pour the cleaner onto the oil and let sit for several days or weeks.You can try a general-purpose enzymatic degreaser, but for best results find a product that mentions your specific oil (such as motor oil) on the label.
Check the label for instructions. Some products require water or scrubbing, but most do the work on their own.
There may or may not be residue left over once the product has done its work. If there is residue, check the label for disposal instructions. This residue is typically harmless, and can be washed away to the soil or storm drain.

Repeat if necessary.",How to Clean up Oil Spills in a Garage3," A homemade poultice is a powerful and often a cost-effective option. It should deal with most old, stubborn stains, but can be tedious to mix and apply over a large area.

, Poultices contain hazardous solvents, which may be flammable, dangerous to inhale, or corrosive. Check the solvent label for safety instructions before opening. At minimum, work in a well-ventilated area and wear rubber gloves. Keep children and pets out of the garage.


Some chemicals may be banned in your area, especially sodium orthophosphate (aka trisodium phosphate).Check regional laws or ask an environmental agency before ordering a solvent from another state or country.

, Every poultice contains a solvent to break down the oil. Here are a few possibilities, roughly in order from common & mild to specialized & powerful:


Acetone
Lacquer thinner
Mineral spirits
1 pound 6 oz (0.6kg) sodium orthophosphate in 1 gallon (3.8L) water (Very corrosive to skin. Use only as a last resort.)Note — Start with a small test batch.

, To turn the solvent into a poultice, mix it with an absorbent powder until you get a thick paste, similar in texture to peanut butter.Here are common options:


Baking powder, flour, or powdered sugar (less effective but easily available)

Kitty litter, diatomaceous earth, kaolin, or talc (usually more effective)

Whiting chalk or fuller's earth (for non-acidic solvents only. Whiting chalk is recommended for sodium orthophosphate.), The solvent may damage your concrete finish. Brush a little of the poultice onto a hidden area of the floor. Wait for it to dry. If it damaged the floor, mix a new poultice using a different solvent., Spread the paste over the oil stain. Ideally, cover the whole stain in a layer at least ¼ inch (0.6 mm) thick. Spread it slightly beyond the edge of the stain to make sure all oil is covered.

, Most poultices take about this long to dry. If the poultice dries before then (common for mineral spirits poultices), scrape it off and apply a new poultice. Continue once at least 24 hours have passed.

, Brush away the dried poultice. Scrub the stained area with water. Dispose of the poultice according to local hazardous waste laws.

, Stubborn stains may require a second or third application. If there is very little change in the appearance of a stain, try a different solvent or a commercial product instead.

Seal any cracks into your home.,
Make sure screens are in place.,
Seal spaces where cables, wires, pipes, or any other object enters the house from outside.,
Install door sweeps or thresholds.",How to Get Rid of Boxelder Bugs2," The main way that boxelder bugs enter homes is through cracks in walls, flooring, roofing, etc. Thus, a cheap and effective way of combating them is to make sure that all such cracks are sealed.For homes with plaster, stucco, stone, or brick veneer exteriors, check the outside walls for significant cracks. Especially check places where different materials meet, or where horizontal and vertical surfaces meet.
Use caulking suitable for outside locations and the surface you are applying it to to seal these cracks.
For stone or brick veneer, do not seal the weep holes with caulk, as they allow moisture to drain. Instead, use a bug screen or other solution that is sold at your local hardware store., Boxelder bugs can easily come in through open windows without screens. If you want to have your windows open, be sure you have screens covering the entire opening area.


Make sure that all screens on windows and doors are completely sealed. Boxelder bugs can fit through very small holes (about 1/8 of an inch).
Also check that there are screens on all vents, including kitchen and bathroom fans, as well as roof and soffit vents., You can use materials such as silicone, polyurethane, or copper mesh for this purpose. If using mesh, make sure there are no gaps for the bugs to fit through. You may need to research to see which caulking material is best for your specific purpose., These should be put on all doors that open to the outside. This will prevent bugs from entering underneath doors. Filling the space between the floor and the bottom of the door can be done by either attaching a door sweep to the bottom of the door or adding a threshold to the floor beneath the door.


For a door sweep, you usually attach a strip that is specially designed for this use to the bottom, inside edge of the door with screws or some form of adhesive. The length of the strip should be the same width as your door.
A threshold is added by screwing it to the floor under the door. Be careful, however, because a threshold can be a tripping hazard.

Remove boxelder, maple, and ash trees.,
Cover areas on the exterior of your home with soapy water.,
Use insecticides outside.",How to Get Rid of Boxelder Bugs3," This is an extreme measure to be taken only in drastic circumstances. These trees provide food and a place for reproduction for the bugs. If they are not near your house, your house is less likely to be infested with boxelder bugs.


Removing the trees that boxelder bugs feed on is not a particularly effective solution, since boxelder bugs can travel more than a mile in search of winter shelter. So, removing the trees on your property will not ensure that your home does not become infested.
If boxelder bugs become a major problem in your community, you may consider organizing at a community-wide level. However, boxelder bug infestations are usually only widespread in particularly warm years. It is best to use the methods described above to combat the bugs and to avoid the drastic measure of removing trees from your local habitat.
Boxelder bugs reproduce on female boxelder trees. Removing these trees specifically may be the most effective tree removal process for limiting the bug's numbers near your home., This is a temporary solution that will keep the bugs off your house until the water dries up. Boxelder bugs do not like soap, and it can even kill them if they are covered with it completely. Applying soapy water with a sprayer or with a sponge can deter them from specific areas, such as near vents or openings that you want to keep them away from.


Boxelder bugs like to congregate on the sunny side of homes.This is a good place to focus on when applying soapy water.

, It is best to avoid this step, if possible, because insecticides can cause insects beyond just boxelder bugs to die. However, it may become necessary to use them in extreme circumstances. Visit your local hardware store or nursery to find an appropriate pesticide. Common active ingredients for fighting boxelder bugs include bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, lambda cyhalothrin, permethrin, and tralomethrin. There are a number of things to keep in mind when using insecticides:Always follow the directions on the label.
Avoid using insecticides indoors. This can damage the inside of your house and is not as effective as using them on the outside.
Spray during late summer and early fall. This is the time when boxelder bugs are on the move from their summer homes to their winter shelter. Your efforts will be most effective if you spray at this time.
Focus on the spots where boxelder bugs are most likely to enter or to congregate. These include the openings and cracks in your home, as well as areas that receive a lot of sunlight.
Be observant. If you notice that there is one spot around your home where boxelder bugs tend to congregate, spray that spot. While some may already have entered at that spot, you can prevent more from coming into your home in the coming days.

Assemble the items you'll need to make the quilt.,



 

Mark a diagonal line on the wrong side of each s.3/4"" square.,





Sew these squares together in pairs with the white triangles together as shown in the image.,





Add a white triangle to each side of the remaining two strips and sew one strip to the top of the 4.1/2"" square and one to the bottom of the square.,
Sew the remaining red and white 2.1/2"" squares together in pairs.,
Place the backing fabric right side down, lay the wadding on top and then lay the star quilt block on top of that.,Trim the excess wadding and backing fabric and bind as for a normal quilt.",How to Quilt a Placemat," To make a 12"" square placemat you will need:

In the red fabric: One 4.1/2"" square, four 2.3/4"" squares and ten 2.1/2"" squares.
In the white fabric you will need: Four 3.3/4"" squares and fourteen 2.1/2"" squares.
For backing fabric and wadding you will need: A 13"" square of each and for binding you will need a strip 55"" long by 2.1/2"".;
, Sew a seam 1/4"" either side of the marked line and cut along the marked line. The two resulting triangles will open up to make 2 squares, each made up of a red triangle and a white triangle.,

Trim the triangle points.
Sew one pair of squares to one side of the 4.1/2"" square and another to the opposite side of the square. Be careful to sew the squares so that the white triangle is away from the red square.

,

That's the star part of the patchwork placemat complete. It is actually known as the evening star quilt block.

, Add a strip of four squares to the top and bottom of the star block, then sew a strip of squares to each side of the star block., Pin and then sew the three layers together. Consider quilting along the edges of the star; while you don't have to, doing this gives a pretty pattern on the back of the placemat.,"

Consider purchasing a floor cleaner formulated for travertine to use regularly. The label should clearly state the cleanser if formulated specifically for travertine.


Opt for a cleanser with a neutral pH of 7 or below.
You can also use a mild dish soap to clean travertine floors 3-4 times per year.
Do not use dish soap more than 3-4 times per year to avoid soap scum.;
, You should never use harsh cleaners like bleach or ammonia on travertine floors. These harsh chemicals can damage and dull the surface of your travertine floors, aging them well before their time., You should avoid using acidic cleaning agents on travertine floors, as they can dull and damage the surface of the stone. Do not clean floors with products that contain vinegar, lemon, orange, or other citrus extracts., Before you mop your travertine floor, you will want to make sure you remove any loose dirt or debris from the floor’s surface. Try using a dust mop made of microfiber to remove loose dirt., Carefully read the directions on the label of the travertine-friendly floor cleanser. Add the cleanser to a bucket of warm water, according to the directions on the label. If using mild dish soap, add a small squirt of soap to the bucket., Place the mop in the bucket of water and cleaning solution. Then lift the mop from the bucket and wring out the mop. Make sure you wring out as much water from the mop as possible.

, After wringing out the mop, use side-to-side motions to mop the floor. Begin at one side of the floor and systematically mop your way to the other side. Rinse the mop in the cleaning solution frequently, thoroughly wringing out the mop after rinsing.


If you are mopping a large area, make a fresh bucket of cleaning solution after cleaning half of the floor area.

, After mopping the floor with cleaning solution, you will want to rinse it with fresh water. Dump the cleaning solution down the drain and fill the bucket with fresh, clean water. Mop the floor with the clean water. Fill the bucket with fresh water about halfway through and continue mopping.

, After you mop the floors with clean water, you will want to dry them. This will prevent streaks and smudges from forming on the floor as the water dries. Use a soft, nonabrasive cloth made of cotton or microfiber to thoroughly dry the floors., One of the most important parts of maintaining your travertine floor is the removal of dust and debris on a regular basis. Try using a microfiber dust mop on your travertine floors several times a week., You should wet mop your floors weekly, or more often if the travertine floor is in a high traffic area. Regular mopping with a travertine-friendly cleaning solution will help your floors maintain their natural beauty for years.

, You can extend the life of travertine floors and avoid unsightly stains by cleaning up spills as soon as they happen. This is especially important if you spill something acidic like tomato sauce, carbonated beverages, or wine. The acid in these products can damage travertine., Travertine floors can scratch easily. Protect high traffic areas by placing area rugs, doormats, and runners on the floor. This will help prevent dirt and debris from scratching the surface of the floor., It is important that you seal travertine floors on a regular basis. Sealing floors helps prevent damage to the surface of the travertine. Contact the manufacturer and/or installer of your travertine floors to find a sealant that will work for you.

Pour flour around the 1-way door to see if the skunk is still around.",How to Deter Skunks," Sheds, garages, porches and crawl spaces are susceptible to skunk denning (nesting). If you have gaps in your foundation or between your paneling, cover them up now, before a mother skunk dens and has a litter.


It is especially important to check your outbuildings in the fall. Skunks usually look for safe, dry places when the weather turns cold. Create an “L” shaped barrier near decks and porches. The lower portion will deter skunks from digging below the porch to access a denning space.;
, If you have a beetle or June bug infestation, skunks may look for fat larvae in your lawn. Water your lawn minimally while grubs are in their larval stage, because soggy areas cause grubs to rise to the surface.


Look out for skunks when you lay fresh sod. Skunks are smart, and they will roll back the sod to access the grubs.
Small holes in the lawn can be signs of skunks.

, These are sources of food for a skunk and her babies.

, Place all garbage in a metal bin. Open-air garbage and compost is also attractive skunk food. , If you start to smell a musky smell, you may have a fox or skunk nearby.

, Allow the skunk to pass by in the night, if the smell has only been around a day or 2.

, If a skunk is trapped in a garage, open the door at dusk, and close it in the late evening. Since skunks are nocturnal, you can close the door behind it and it will find a new home.


Check your window wells. Skunks occasionally fall into these deep wells and cannot climb out.
You can try making a wooden and chicken wire ramp and setting it at a 45-degree angle in the well. It may have enough traction to walk out on its own. If that doesn’t work, you should call animal control immediately.
Do not try to pick up a skunk.

, If you find a lingering sour and musky smell near an opening in the ground, under a porch or in another area, you must first decide if it is an active skunk den.


Fill the top of the den with leaves during the day, while the skunk is most likely sleeping. Don’t push the leaves in too far or too tight. You don’t want to trap the skunk inside.
Return in the morning and see if the leaves have been disturbed.

, Increase the noise and light in the area, so the skunk is disturbed when it is trying to sleep. Placing a bright light near the hole and turning on a radio may cause the skunk to relocate. Test the den again with leaves packed into the top of the hole. If they are not disturbed for several days, the skunk has probably moved out.

, The ammonia smell may also be uncomfortable for the skunk to bear.


These methods are best for use in a hole. If the skunk is living in a crawlspace or larger area, you will want to use the 1-way door method.

, Then, cover the entrance with wire mesh. If you fail to cover it, another animal may move in.

, You will need to place a 1-way door in each entryway to ensure it cannot get back in.

, You will need to ensure the mother is bringing her babies outside of the den, or they will starve and die on their own. Once you see a mother and her babies walking in a line, you can safely set up a 1-way door.

, If the entrance to the area is larger, you may need to board up part of it or buy a larger 1-way door from a manufacturer.

, Make sure there is a lot of extra fabric on the sides and bottom of the entryway. The fabric must be heavy enough that you cannot push it in the door. You may need to bore some holes in the fabric before screwing it into place under a wooden deck or crawlspace.

, However, the fabric should fall on top of the ground and be impossible to burrow under or push through the door.


Opt for a wooden or plastic 1-way door. These are available from pest control experts or online.

, Look for signs of digging to indicate that it has tried and failed to reenter the den.

, If you cannot see footprints, it has moved on.

Start dabbing the stencil brush over the stencil to add paint to the tablecloth.,
Allow the tablecloth to sit where it is until dried.

,
Repeat the stencil design on matching serviettes, if relevant.",How to Stencil a Tablecloth," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"". When purchasing or making stencils, consider what theme or presentation you're looking for. Some ideas include:


A beach side theme, perhaps with shells, starfish, seaweed, crabs, dolphins, etc.
A cabin theme, with moose, logs, bears, pine trees, etc.
A pattern design, such as circles, squares, lines, etc.
A holiday theme, with baubles, trees, angels, Santa, etc.
A Halloween theme, with ghouls, witch hats, wands, stars, etc.;
, Lay the tablecloth over the table you're planning to use it on once completed. Look around the cloth to see where placement of the stencil designs would look most effective.


Decide where you want the stencils to go and draw up a pattern on paper to follow; or, if you have a complicated pattern, consider marking it out direct on the tablecloth using a disappearing fabric marker. Some questions to help you work out a design include:
Do you want just a sprinkling of stencils in a corner?
Do you want a border of stencils?
Do you want a pattern of stencils? For example, a fan, circle, animal shape or some other design which the pattern follows around or forms the shape of?

, Position the stencil where you wish to start placing the design. If you're working with a marked-on pattern, position with extreme care to match the marks; use pins or fasteners to keep in place. Any mismatches will cause the pattern to look skewed.

, Less paint on the brush is always better and will appear more even when stenciled on. You can always add more if needed.

, Keep dabbing until the shape is filled, then carefully lift up the stencil. Be careful not to press too hard or you risk splashing paint elsewhere or even going over the stencil border.


Continue painting all the stenciled areas until they're finished. Work across the tablecloth either top to bottom or side to side to avoid working over already finished stenciled areas.

,, Although this step is optional, it does make a nice finishing touch.

Fill each bucket with water.,
Prepare the dye.,
Add dye to each bucket.,
Test first.",How to Ombre Dye Table Runners1," If you are only dyeing one or two table runners, you can use two cups of water per bucket. If you are doing a large batch of linens, you can adjust the amount of water based on the instructions of your fabric dye.Heat the water in a kettle or microwave until it is at least 140 °F (60 °C)., If you are using powdered or liquid dye, you should read the instructions on the packaging to determine how to prepare it. In general, you will mix the dye with water, adding either salt or vinegar based on the type of fabric you will be using. You should make up to four cups of dye. Mix the dye in a separate bowl, pitcher, or large measuring cup.

You should adjust the amount of dye for the vibrancy that you want in your table runner. Darker or brighter colors will need more dye. Lighter or pastel colors will need less dye.
For cotton, rayon and linen fabrics, mix in one cup salt of salt. For silk and nylon fabrics, stir in one cup of white vinegar., Each bucket will have a different concentration of dye. For the first bucket, use ¼ cup of dye. For the second, use ½ cup of dye, and for the third, use one full cup of dye., Using a rag, scrap of fabric, or paper towel, test the color of each dye bucket. Dip the test strip into the bucket, rinse out excess dye, and let it dry. Remember that the color may change slightly when it dries, so it is good wait until the test strip has dried to see what color emerges.You can even practice getting the ombre effect. Dip the test strip in each bucket to see how the colors blend into one another.
It is recommended that you wear gloves as you dip into the dye to protect your hands and any other surfaces that you touch.

"

Dampen the runner.,
Dip one end into each bucket.,
Rinse out excess dye.,
Dry.",How to Ombre Dye Table Runners2," Before you dye it, run the table runner under a faucet until the entire fabric is wet. Wring out excess water so that it is slightly damp. Fold the runner lengthwise. Roll the table runner widthwise until you have a compact roll. The hem of the runner should be on one side of the roll., Starting with the first bucket (the bucket with the lowest concentration of dye), dip the hem side of the runner into the dye. Make sure that it is submerged a little less than two-thirds of the way up the rolled runner. Hold it there for a minute. Remove and dip it in the second bucket, submerging it above halfway up the roll. Hold it there longer than the first, about two minutes. For the last bucket, dip the fabric about one-third of the way up, holding it there for three minutes.The longer you hold the runner in the dye, the darker the color will be. If you want a very light shade, submerge it for less than a minute. If you want a very dark shade, hold it down for longer than three minutes.

, Once you have finished dyeing it, run the fabric under a cool, running faucet. Rinse out excess dye until the water runs clear. If there are any sharp lines or splatters in your fabric, you can use a damp paper towel to smooth them out., Hang the table runner to dry completely. Once dry, you should wash the table runner with color-safe detergent before you use it. Do not wash with other linens or clothing in case the dye runs. If you used machine-safe fabric dye, you can put it in a washing machine. If not, wash it by hand."
"
Prepare two dye baths.,
Roll but do not fold the runner.,
Dip one end into the first color.,
Dye the other side.",How to Ombre Dye Table Runners3," You only need two dye baths if you are using two colors. Make one bath for each color used, according to the instructions on the dye packet. Some color combinations that might work include:

Orange and pink
Green and blue
Purple and pink
Red and yellow

, Dampen the runner, and squeeze out extra water. Do not fold the runner as you would for a single color ombre effect. Instead, just roll it up from one end to the other. This will let you dye both sides of the table runner separately. The hem of the rolled table cloth should be visible on either side of the roll., Choose one color, and dip one end of the runner into the tablecloth, submerging it up to halfway up the table runner. Gently move the runner up and down the dye, but try not to get dye higher than the halfway mark. Rinse out excess dye.If you want a white strip in the middle, submerge the runner less than halfway up the runner. If you do not want a white strip, submerge the fabric up to the halfway mark.

, Once you have rinsed the first color, reroll the runner. Dip the other side into the dye and submerge the fabric until you have reached the desired color. Rinse out excess dye, and hang to dry.

If you want the two colors to blend together, dip the second color past the halfway mark.Test this first with a rag or scrap to make sure that that the dyes do not run brown when mixed together.

If glass is present in the spill, use garden gloves or ice cube tongs to pick up the pieces. Cover the glass in newspaper before putting it in the trashcan.Wear shoes with rubber soles while cleaning up the glass.;
, You can use kitty litter, corn starch, sand, or oatmeal as the absorbent material. Pour the material over the entirety of the spill. Allow the material to sit on the spill for about fifteen minutes.You can blot up some of the spill with paper towels before applying the absorbent material. You won’t need as much material if you blot up the spill first.

, You can use paper towels or a spatula to do this. Do not use a vacuum cleaner or mop at this point. Continue to scoop up the material until the absorbent material and oil is gone., Use paper towels or slices of bread to wipe up the oil residue. You should be able to remove most of the residue. Don’t worry if the floor is slightly sticky when you’ve removed most of the residue., Use a grease-fighting dish detergent when you mop. Combine the detergent with warm water.

Contact legislators in your state and ask them to vote for bills that ban drilling and any other environmentally friendly policies. You can also sign petitions calling for your state representatives to sign environmentally friendly bills., Google “oil spill volunteers” to see what organizations are asking for volunteers. Call the organization and ask how you can help. In some instances, like caring for animals, only qualified professionals will be able to help. For other volunteering opportunities, like administrative help, volunteers may have to be trained. Untrained volunteering opportunities, like picking up trash, should be abundantly available.Do not try to help wildlife unless you have the permission and knowledge to do so.The Audubon Society, which protects birds and their habitats, is one place that you can contact for volunteering opportunities.

, If you are in the area where the oil spill occurred, call the local authorities to report injuries and damage that you feel has gone unnoticed. It is likely that there will be a hotline specifically for injured and dead animal sightings, but it will change depending on the event and location. Do not try to help injured animals unless you are qualified to do so., In some cases, a donation is more helpful and preferred over volunteering. A couple of places you can donate to are the National Wildlife Federation and the Save Our Seabirds organization. During oil spills, companies like Dawn will donate a portion of your purchase to help the clean up effort."

Extend or shrink the table to the size it will typically be when you use the tablecloth.,
Measure the table length.,
Measure the width of your table.,
Determine how far you'd like your tablecloth to hang down.,
Calculate the length and width of your tablecloth.,
Get a slightly larger tablecloth if you cannot find the exact size.",How to Measure for a Tablecloth1," If your table has removable leaves or attachments that can be used to alter its size, decide what size best suits your purposes. If you want a day-to-day tablecloth, keep the table at the size you use for normal purposes. If you are looking for a formal tablecloth to use when entertaining guests, you may wish to measure the table when it is extended to its maximum size.









If you want one tablecloth that will fit your table at any size, measure the table at its largest size and select a tablecloth that will hang no more than 6 inches (15cm) over the edge. Be aware that the tablecloth may look uneven when the table is at a smaller size.;
, Use a tape measure to measure the table along its longest direction, or along either direction for a square table. Measure directly in the center of the table, not along one of the outer edges, especially if your table is oval in shape.









Write down your measurements as you make them to avoid forgetting them.

, Measure the other horizontal dimension of the table, at right angles to the first. As before, measure near the center of the table. It doesn't hurt to make this measurement even if your table appears square; it can sometimes be difficult to tell a square and rectangle apart.








, The length a tablecloth hangs below the surface is called the drop length. Most dining room tablecloths have a drop length between 6 and 12 inches (15–30 cm), no further than diner's laps.A more formal dining tablecloth may reach all the way to the ground, as will a tablecloth intended to hide unattractive table legs.








To help you visualize which drop length you prefer, hold a piece of fabric or paper hanging downward from the table's edge. Place your chairs and other nearby furniture objects where they would be located on occasions when you would use this tablecloth.

, Multiply your desired drop length by two, since the tablecloth will hang from both ends of the table. Add this result to your table's length to get your tablecloth's ideal length, and to your table's width to get your tablecloth's ideal width.









If your table is oval, you may purchase either an oval or rectangular tablecloth with these measurements.

, If you cannot find a tablecloth that fits your table's exact dimensions, and you are not interested in purchasing or making a custom tablecloth, use a tablecloth that's slightly larger than your measurements. A larger tablecloth will simply hang lower, while a smaller one may not cover the entire table. Also, as with any fabric, tablecloths may shrink when washed, potentially becoming up to 4 inches (10cm) smaller over time.








You may also consider alternative options, such as a rectangular ""runner"" cloth that runs across the center of a rectangular table without covering the full width.

Freeze the dripped wax.,
Use a dull knife, such as a butter knife, or your fingernail to carefully scrape the frozen wax off the tablecloth.,
Remove the wax with heat.",How to Get Wax Off a Tablecloth," The easiest way to do this is fold the tablecloth with the wax on the outside top layer and put the entire cloth in the freezer. Or, you can fill a bag with ice and place the ice pack on top of the wax while the cloth is still laid out on the table.;
, If the tablecloth is made of lace use extra care not to tear the lace material while scraping the wax.

,


Place paper towels or pieces of brown paper bag on both sides of the stained area. If you use a paper bag, be sure to choose one that does not have any writing on it.
Set your iron to warm or medium and iron over the paper. Do not use steam while ironing. The heat from the iron will cause the remaining wax to melt off of the tablecloth and soak into the paper.
Repeat the ironing process if necessary using fresh paper towels or brown paper bags. Keep changing the paper and repeating the ironing until all wax is removed.
Launder the tablecloth as usual once all the wax is gone.

, This is called the drop.


Leave a drop of at least 12 inches (30.48 cm) for informal table dining. A formal setting tablecloth ideally reaches the floor.

, Multiplying the length of your drop, times 2. Add this measurement to the table width. Next, add this measurement to the table's length. Multiply these 2 sums together.


Use the measuring formula: (length + drop x 2) x (width + drop x 2) = rectangle tablecloth area. Here's an example for a 3 foot (0.9 m) by 4 foot (1.2 m) table with a drop of 1 foot (30.48 cm): (3 feet + (1 x 2)) x (4 feet + (1 x 2)) = 5 feet (1.5 m) x 6 feet (1.8 m) = 30 square feet (914.4 square cm) = 360 square inches (914.40 cm).

, The radius is half of the diameter. Add to this your desired drop length, square the total (multiply by itself), then multiply this sum by pi (3.145).


For instance, use this formula (radius + drop) squared x 3.145 = round tablecloth area. For a 4 foot (1.2 m) diameter round table with a 1 foot (0.3 m) drop: ((2 + 1) x (2 + 1)) x 3.145 = 28.3 square feet (862.6 square cm).

, If you measured your tablecloth area using inches, divide your tablecloth area by 36. If you chose to measure in feet, divide by 3. These will give you your total required yardage. When measuring in cm, divide by 100 to get your total square meters of fabric required.

Measure the diameter of the table with a tape measure.,
Decide how much overhang you want from your tablecloth.,
Calculate the desired diameter of the tablecloth.,
Consider your options if you cannot find a tablecloth in that exact size.",How to Measure for a Tablecloth2," The diameter of a circular object is the distance in a straight line from one edge to the other, passing through the center. For most tablecloths, you can simply estimate where the center is by eye. If you want to be more exact, you may measure starting at several positions and calculate the average of your results. The more exact method is recommended if you want a tablecloth that sits entirely on top of the table, with 0 to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of overhang.









This method may also be used for hexagonal tables or tables with other unusual shapes, as long as each edge of the table is of equal size.

, For most purposes, an overhang or ""drop length"" of at least 6 inches (15cm) is appropriate. A shorter drop length may make the tablecloth look too small for the table.For more formal occasions or tables that do not have chairs stored under them, you may choose to have a drop length extending all the way to the ground.









Measure the height difference between the chairs and the table to find out the maximum drop length that avoids piles of cloth gathering on the chairs when they are pushed in.

, Multiply your desired overhang or drop length by two to account for the fact that the cloth needs to hang over either side of the table. Add this result to the diameter you measured for the table to get the ideal diameter for your table.








, If you cannot find a tablecloth with that exact diameter, and you do not wish to make your own round tablecloth, try to find one that's a couple inches (or a few centimeters) larger, since that is less likely to cause noticeable problems than a smaller tablecloth.









You may also hang a square tablecloth on a round table. Either follow the manufacturer's recommended size for a round table with your table's diameter, or calculate the diagonal length of the square. This length should be equal to the ideal diameter you calculated above, or slightly larger.

Even if utility burlap is not the exact color you want, you can decorate it after you purchase it to make an attractive table runner.Decorate your burlap if you want. Acrylic paint and a sponge brush can be used to decorate thick burlap. This works best if you're making a fringe table runner without pom-poms.You can dip a sponge brush in acrylic paint, which you can purchase at any craft store. Use the brush to add designs like circles, stars, hearts, or whatever shape you want. You can add seasonal shapes, like pumpkin shapes for Thanksgiving.;
, If you're not using burlap, figure what length of fabric you want for your table runner. This will depend on the length of your table. Your runner should be slightly longer than the full length of your table. Runners are usually thin strips of fabric, so strive for a rectangle-like shape.You should use a measuring stick to draw the lines of your rectangle to make sure you cut it straight.
Cut a little more fabric than you intend to use, as you'll be fringing the edges slightly.

, To fringe the edges of your table, use your seam ripper. Pull out 2 to 4 threads from the edges of each side of the runner. If you want longer fringes, pull out more threads.Once you've loosened the threads with the seam ripper, use your fingers to pull them away from the fabric.
Usually, threads will break as you pull. You will have to work your way down the thread, using the seam ripper to dislodge the threads and then gently pulling the loose threads out with your fingers.

, Take a pair of sewing scissors. Trim the fringes on every edge of your runner. Trim them only slightly, especially if they're on the shorter side, until all the fringes are of roughly even length."

Measure your table.,
Decide how you want the tablecloth to look when it is on the table.,
Use an online tablecloth calculator.,
Consider what elements of the tablecloth are important to you.,
Check online options.,
Consider older tablecloths when you want something fancy and elegant.,
Find the antique or vintage tablecloths.,
Know what to look for.",How to Buy a Tablecloth," Note down the measurements by width, length and height. For example: A 6 foot banquet table measuring 30 inches wide by 72 inches long by 29 inches high.;
, Do you want the tablecloth to drop neatly to just above the floor? Maybe you will have people eating at the table and only want a 12 inch drop all round.

, This makes it really easy to work out quickly from your table's measurements which tablecloth will work best for your table.

, Besides the size, there are other things to consider when getting the right tablecloth. These include:


What fabric do you want? There are cottons, linens, blends with synthetics, and so forth. Some don't need ironing, others do. Some may stain more easily than others.
Are you going to launder this tablecloth often? If so, you won't be wanting a delicate, hand-embroidered cloth but a strong, sturdy and colorfast tablecloth instead. If you are looking for a regular use tablecloth for the family dining table, then polyester is a great choice. It is normally stain-treated and washes easily.
Is it just for special occasions? If so, it's okay to want the delicate, lacy and hand-embroidered tablecloth, provided you're aware that it may get stained and require special washing. For something fancier, maybe look for a Damask fabric––these have beautiful patterns woven into the cloth.

, You might like to see what is available online before going to a store. However, actually being in the store is best because you can touch the fabric and see for yourself what it looks like close up.


Purchase a quality made product. Cheaper items will not last as long as those that may cost a bit more but are well made.
You will often find the best prices online but you may wish to get a swatch or sample as online shopping doesn't give the in-store possibility to see the linen.

, They can be great for covering side tables permanently or just used occasionally for very special meals. Antique tablecloths will often be handmade and heavily embroidered, making them a beautiful item in your home and it is nice to honor the person who made it many decades ago by giving the cloth another round of usage.

, Look in antique, vintage and charity stores for older linens. There are also many online sources, such as Etsy, eBay and specialist vintage linen storefronts.


Online sellers will often do the work of checking for flaws and problems with the cloths, telling you upfront so that you are aware of any problems. You can also ask if they don't make any mention of these things.

, When deciding on an antique or vintage tablecloth, there are certain things to look for:


Stains: Look for stains. Some stains ruin an old tablecloth and it's not reusable. However, some stains might be small enough that you can live with them.
Tears or fraying: Look for small tears, fraying and loose threads. Consider whether they mar the overall appearance of the tablecloth or whether they're just part of its character.
Missing embroidery: Unraveled or unfinished embroidery may cause the tablecloth to look incomplete or shabby. On the other hand, this may simply form part of its charm.
Smells bad: Let the seller know it smells bad and see if you can get a price reduction as you're going to have to wash the item. If you can't get it for a good price or it really stinks, leave it be.


However, even if you find any of these flaws, don't be too precious about it, as all old things have some wear and tear and if the stain or tear is small, barely noticeable or simply part of the nature of the item in a good way, then it may still be fine to use it. Also, you may be able to disguise some flaws, especially if the embroidery is worth salvaging. Ultimately, antique or vintage tablecloths are about adding charm and character to your home, so a few flaws are to be expected.

Consider the occasion.,
Measure your table.,
Calculate the proper size for a square or rectangle table.,
Figure out the size for a round table.",How to Choose a Tablecloth Size1," If you're picking a tablecloth for an occasion, consider the nature of that occasion. Depending on the event type, there should be different levels of drop from the edge of the table to the bottom of the tablecloth.


For a formal occasion, such as a wedding, you want a longer drop. Have about 15 inches from the edge of the table to the bottom of the tablecloth.For a casual occasion, like a low-key birthday party, you do not need as long of a drop. Aim for a 6-to-8 inch drop from the edge of the table to the bottom of the tablecloth.;
, There is a simple calculation you can use to determine the measurements of your tablecloth. To start, you'll need to know the measurements of your table.


For a rectangular or square-shaped table, use a measuring tape to measure your table's length and width.For a round table, you'll need to measure the diameter of your table.A diameter is the straight line going through the center of a circle., If you have a rectangular table, you'll need to know your desired drop. Remember, this depends on the type of event you're planning.


To start, add twice the desired drop to both the length and width of the table. For example, say your table is 40 inches wide and 70 inches long. You want a 6-inch drop. You would add 12 to 40, to get 52. You would then add 12 to 70, to get 82.The resulting values are the dimensions of the tablecloth you should aim to purchase. In our above example, you should look for a tablecloth that is 52 X 82 inches., Calculating the dimensions of a round table is somewhat simpler. To figure out your length, you simply add twice your desired drop by your table's diameter. Say you want a 9-inch drop and your table has a diameter of 60 inches. You would add 18 to 60, getting 78. When purchasing a tablecloth, select a 78 inch round tablecloth."

You simply select from a range of values. You can go slightly higher or lower in that range if you want a bigger or larger drop.


For a round table, you'll have to purchase a circle-shaped tablecloth. If you're seating 2 to 4 people, 72 inches should be enough. If you're seating 6 to 8 people, go for a 86-to-90 inch tablecloth. If you're seating more people than this, you're likely planning an event. You should measure your table following the above directions.Some tables have what is called a leaf or leaves. This is a section in the center of a table, or on its sides, that extends the table's length. With round tables, leaves generally change the table to an oval shape. If you intend to use your table's leaves, you'll have to buy an oval-shaped tablecloth and purchase different measurements.With leaves, go for an 80-to-90 inch tablecloth for 6 people. If you're seating 6 to 8 people, aim for something in the realm of 102-to-108 inches. For 10 to 12 people, go for something between 124 and 126-inches., Most square tables, without leaves, can only seat around 4 people. When seating 4 people on a round table, you can usually get by with a tablecloth of 52-to-54 inches. Choose a square tablecloth.With leaves, you'll need to purchase an oblong tablecloth as the shape of your table changes. For seating 2 to 4 people, a 70-inch oblong table cloth should be sufficient.For seating 6 people, go for an 80-to-90 inch oblong tablecloth. For 8 to 10 people, aim for something between 102 and 108-inches.For 10 to 12 people, you should purchase an oblong table cloth between 124 and 126-inches.

Clip the tablecloth, if necessary.",How to Choose a Tablecloth Size3," When it comes to setting the perfect table, colors matter. Formal and informal dining have different rules when it comes to color.


Formal dining should have light colors. Whites and ivories are preferable. If you want to add slightly more color, go with a light pastel shade.Informal dining is less rigid about color requirements. Any shade is appropriate, from bright, primary colors to lighter shades., When setting your table with your new tablecloth, placing the tablecloth should be the first step. Make sure you place the tablecloth correctly.


Buy a padded table liner, which you can purchase at a local home goods store, to set over your table. This helps hold the tablecloth in place. The liner should be slightly smaller than your actual table. Set this on the table first.Drape your tablecloth over the table. Make sure, on a square or rectangle table, the four corners of the cloth align with the corners of the table. Smooth out the tablecloth with your hands to get rid of any bumps or crevices., A runner is a strip of fabric that runs over the table in a horizontal or vertical line. If you want to add something extra to your tablecloth, consider adding a runner.


Runners are often holiday-themed, which can be helpful if you're planning a party around a particular event. For example, if you have a Christmas party a runner decorated with images of holly and snow could be a nice touch.
The length of a runner depends on whether you plan on lying it horizontally or vertically. It should be about a foot longer than the length or width of your table.

, You can add other toppings to your table. Vases, flowers, candles, and centerpieces can be a nice touch. Go with toppers that convey your personality and style.


Avoid any topper that takes up too much space. You want to make sure your guests are still able to eat and drink without disruption.
Be careful with flowers. Avoid flowers with a strong scent as this can affect the taste of food and drinks., If your tablecloth is made from a very silky material, it may slip and move easily. This can be disruptive if guests are trying to eat. You can buy tablecloth clips at most home goods stores or furniture stores. You can attach clips to the edge of your table, securing your tablecloth in place.

A tablecloth that can't fully cover the table won't look quite right when finished. Make sure you measure your table and use a tablecloth that fits to get the best results.


The tablecloth will need to cover the table and reach the floor.
For example, a rectangular table that is 70"" wide and 180"" long will need a tablecloth that is 128"" wide and 238"" long.;
, Before you can box a table, you'll need to place a tablecloth over it. You don't need to be exact just yet. Simply toss the table cloth over the table, covering the surface of the tabletop., Once the tablecloth has been placed over the table, you can begin to level the cloth out on each end. The tablecloth should cover the table evenly, with both ends of it having the same length of cloth covering them. Make sure that the edges of the tablecloth near the floor are hanging at an equal length.Both ends of the table should have an equal length of cloth.
The lower edges of the tablecloth should either be touching or just above the floor.

, The front side of the tablecloth is the side that guests will most likely noticed. For this reason, it is important that you make sure the front edge is level along its length. Neither side should be higher or lower than the other. Take a few moments to make sure the front, lower edge is level with the floor.The front side of the cloth should barely touch the floor.
An unleveled front edge can make the rest of the table boxing unleveled in turn.

, Stand on one edge of the table and use your left hand to secure the left corner of the table cloth. It's recommend that you use your pointer and middle fingers to hold the cloth in place. Holding the table cloth at this point will help prevent the cloth from shifting and will keep the angles looking clean and sharp., While holding the cloth in place with your left hand, reach down with your right hand and grab the lower corner of the tablecloth. Once you've got the lower right corner of the cloth in hand, you can start to bring it up and over the table top.It may be helpful to hold the rest of the cloth in place with your thighs by standing against the table.
Pull the cloth tight in order to get a good, crisp line in the fabric.
Keep the corner of the table in a straight line, matching the edge of the table.

, Move the lower right corner of the tablecloth up and over the table surface. You are going to bring this corner of the cloth to the center of the table's front edge. This action will allow you to create the crisp lines and folds needed when boxing a table.The corner should end in the front and center of the table top.
Don't worry if it looks messy at this point. There is still time to fix the tablecloth.
Make sure the cloth was pulled tightly to ensure a clean fold.

, Before you continue to box the table, it's a good idea to make adjustments to the side of the tablecloth. If it's crooked or unleveled, it will still be this way when you are finished. Take a moment to adjust the side of the tablecloth you started on.The bottom of the tablecloth should be level with the floor.
Try to have the bottom edge of the tablecloth touching or placed just above the floor.

, Go around to the back of the table now and hold the corner you lifted up in place. From here, you can begin adjusting the cloth on the top of the table, removing wrinkles, unwanted folds, and generally making it lay as flat as possible. Keep one hand in place, holding the table cloth, to prevent the tablecloth from falling down and ruining your work.Try gently waving the top section of cloth to work out folds or wrinkles.
Pull the cloth slightly to fix areas where the cloth bunched up.
Remember to keep the lower sides of the tablecloth level with the ground.

, Once the top of the cloth is folded and flat, you can bring the top fold back down. Take the corner you originally placed at the top-center edge of the table, lift it up, and fold it down to the right hand corner. This is the last fold you will need to do when boxing this side of the table.It's a good idea to hold the right corner of the tablecloth in place while you fold the top over to meet it.
Don't worry if the edge doesn't line up, you can still make adjustments.

, Now that table boxing is complete, you can make your final adjustments. You'll want to make sure that the edge of the tablecloth lines up with the edge of the table. Remove any wrinkles, bumps, or unwanted folds if you notice any. The tablecloth should lay completely flat when you have finished., Now that you have completed the fold on one side of the table, you can move on to the opposite end. Both sides should be folded in the same exact way to give the tablecloth a symmetrical and clean finished look. Follow the same steps on the opposite end of the table to box the table."

You can also use a vacuum with a brush attachment to get between the crevices. Remember that slate is soft and easily damaged, so you want to choose a brush that is clean and as soft as possible.;
, Choose a clean dust mop that is not oil-based. Run the mop in one direction over the floor to pick up debris and dust. Avoid moving back and forth, as this will move the dust back onto the slate and cause damage when you clean later., In a bucket, combine about a gallon of warm water with ¼ a cup of detergent. The detergent should be gentle to avoid abrading the floor. Choose a detergent for delicate clothing or a gentle dish soap.


Specialized slate cleaners are also an option. These should be non-acidic. Follow the directions on the container.

, Wring out the mop before you start and make smooth strokes. Go slow. Rinse your mop and wring it out often to avoid any debris clinging to it and getting worked into the porous slate.


Steam mops are also an option. Check the hardware store. These mops pick up extra condensation and dirt.Anytime the mop appears to be leaving streaks or debris on the floor, dump out your water and make the water and detergent mixture again.

, Choose a soft cloth that won’t scrape the slate, then wipe off as much water as possible. This will prevent the water from seeping into the pores. Afterwards, let the floor air dry.

, Once the surface has dried, apply a thin layer of teak oil with a soft cloth. A small amount of oil will ensure a deeper cleaning, but don’t apply enough that the slate begins to absorb it.Slate oil is also a good choice, but tends to be much more expensive than teak oil.

, Slate is a very delicate material, so your floor benefits from getting a soap and water wash every few months. This removes grime and prevents stains and the need to perform deeper, more difficult cleaning later.

Make sure you clean these rugs regularly to prevent the accumulation of dirt.

, Use felt to cover the feet and bases of large moveable furniture like chairs, tables, and TV stands. A small piece of felt to put something between the base or leg of your furniture and the floor will prevent inadvertent scratching.Rugs can be helpful here as well. Place an area rug underneath large furniture that might shift around, like couches. Remember that rugs collect dirt, so be sure to clean them regularly.
If you have chairs that might move often, consider replacing their feet with wheels for more ease of motion. You’ll still have to keep an eye out for scratching, but this will create easier movement.

, If you do need to move items around in the room, lift them off the ground instead of dragging them. For particularly large objects, get friends and family to help so nothing drags along and scratches the floor.Always remember to lift correctly by using your knees and keeping your back straight. Never lift more than you can comfortably handle, and don’t be afraid to wait for help with especially large objects.

, If you notice a small crack or dent in the floor, Pergo makes a finishing putty that can seal the crack. Anything about 1/4 of an inch (6.35 mm) in size or smaller should be easily fixable on your own.If the damaged area is greater than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), replace the plank. A professional installer can be found by calling the Pergo consumer helpline or visiting the Pergo website. It may also be helpful to keep some of the flooring planks after the installation to ensure you always have replacements on hand.

Treat concrete polyurethane as you would tile.,
Sweep or vacuum first.,
Wipe up spills.,
Use a mild cleanser.,
Wet mop the floor.",How to Clean Polyurethane Floors2," Polyurethane on concrete floors creates a durable surface. For the most part, you can treat it like you would any durable floor. In fact, it's often used in warehouses and other industrial areas, where heavy machinery is used., Like wood floors, you can simply vacuum up debris. Set the vacuum to the hard surfaces setting to vacuum this type of floor. It doesn't hurt to set it to hard wood if you have that on your vacuum.Otherwise, use a broom or dust mop to remove debris., Most spills won't stick to this coating. Therefore, if you get them up as quickly as possible, it won't take much work to clean them up. Use a soft cloth to wipe them up quickly. You can also use a little glass cleaner on the spill if it won't come up easily., Even though polyurethane is durable, it's still a good idea to use a mild cleanser.

Determine your floor’s finish.,
Scrape away dried paint, gum, and other petrified materials.,
Clean a sound finish with a hardwood cleaner.,
Clean an unsound finish with mineral spirits.,
Soak deep, widespread pet stains with hydrogen peroxide overnight.",How to Clean Old Hardwood Floors2," If you’ve just purchased an old house, ask the realtor or former homeowner about the hardwood floor’s history. If you’re unable to find information about your floor, you can test it to determine the finish.Test finish soundness by applying a few drops of water onto a worn area. If the water beads for a few minutes, the finish is sound. If the water absorbs into the wood, the finish is unsound and water-based cleaning products must be avoided.
Sound finishes are more likely to be modern, while unsound finishes are more likely to be older.

, Older hardwood floors are often spotted with caked, petrified materials, like dried paint, over-waxed deposits, or gum. If it was covered by linoleum or carpet, bits of the covering and adhesive might still be present. Hand scrape any of these materials with a plastic spatula or dull putty knife.If you have trouble, try placing a plastic bag filled with ice cubes on top of the gum or wax. Let it sit for a few minutes, then try scraping it off the floor., If your old flooring doesn't have any serious damage, it might just require a simple cleaning, buffing, and resealing.Remove all furniture and floor coverings, and take off your shoes or cover them with booties. Spray the floor with a small amount of hardwood floor cleaner. Wipe the floor down with a dry terry cloth mop or a terry cloth hand towel., It's best to clean a floor with an unsound finish with odorless mineral spirits.Dampen a terry cloth towel and wipe down the hardwood surface. Use a scouring pad or sanding screen to deal with tougher spots., It'll take some work to remove stains and odor if your hardwood flooring is in a room that was formerly used as a litter box. Pour hydrogen peroxide over the affected areas, cover them with rags soaked in hydrogen peroxide, then let them soak overnight. The next day, wipe up any excess cleaner, then screen or sand and refinish the floor.If you're just dealing with one light stain, cover it with a rag soaked in hydrogen peroxide, but check it every 10 minutes. Wipe up excess cleaner as soon as the stain is gone.
In extreme cases of pet odor, the subfloor below the hardwood is contaminated. The hardwood floor will need to be removed so the subfloor can be treated.

Test for wax.,
Screen your floor with a buffer.,
Refinish your floor.,
Avoid sanding old hardwood floors unless absolutely necessary.,
Consult a professional with restoration experience.",How to Clean Old Hardwood Floors3," Unless you know your floors are unwaxed, you'll need to test for wax in order to know how to best care for your flooring. Dampen a piece of extra fine steel wool and use it to rub areas you think might be waxed.Wax will show up as a light grey smudge or smear on the steel wool.
Floors that date prior to 1930 typically have many layers of paste wax over a tung oil finish or shellac. You can screen and re-wax the floor or use a chemical stripper to remove the wax and apply a modern polyurethane finish.

, The easiest and gentlest way to restore an old floor to its former glory is to screen it with a buffer. After cleaning the floor, use a handheld sanding screen to roughen up the edges and corners of the room where the buffer can't access. Use a buffer with a 150- or 120-grit sanding disc to screen the floor, or buff down the existing finish.The sanding discs will wear out, so you'll need at least three to screen a typical room.

, Once you've finished buffing, wipe down windowsills and other surfaces and vacuum the room thoroughly to remove all dust.Your choice of finish will depend on the results of your wax test.


For waxed floors, apply paste wax. If your floor was finished with a modern sealer, go with polyurethane. You can't use one if you started with the other: don't apply wax to a polyurethane finish or vice versa., If your floor is more than 50 years old, you should avoid sanding it. There's a limit to how much wood you can remove without permanently damaging the floor. When cleaning and reviving an old hardwood floor, sand only if it's so heavily stained that screening or chemical stripping aren't options., Get professional help if your old hardwood flooring is seriously worn or damaged, or if you're unsure about its composition. Word of mouth is typically the best way to find a good contractor. Look for one with restoration experience who won't advise you to simply rip out the entire floor unless absolutely necessary.For example, if your floor needs patching, you could have an experienced contractor remove flooring from a hidden spot, like a closet, and use it to replace a worn or damaged area.

, Add a black tea bag to one cup of water and complete a brew cycle. Allow the tea to cool and then pour it into a spray bottle. Lightly spray the laminate floor with this mixture and then wipe it dry with a mop., If you notice one spot that stands out on your floor, pour a few drops of jojoba oil on a towel. Place this towel on top of the stain and hold for a few minutes. Wipe away any residue with water., For tough food stains, mix together baking soda and distilled water until they form a heavy paste. Cover the stain with the paste. Wipe it away after a few minutes. Repeat until the stain is gone., This cleaning method must be used carefully, as lengthy exposure to alcohol can strip some floors of their protective coating. Get a cotton ball and dip it in a bit of rubbing alcohol. Wipe the stain with the ball and wait a minute or so. Rinse the area with distilled water., Whenever you add water to a cleaning mixture make sure to only use distilled water, as it will not leave additional deposits on your flooring.

, Dip a clean microfiber cloth into the vinegar cleaning solution and start working the cleaner into the shag carpet. Rub the stain quite vigorously (though avoid breaking or damaging the long shag carpet fibers) until the stain dissipates to your satisfaction.You may need to use quite a bit of elbow grease to fully eliminate the stain.

, Once you have finished scrubbing, you’ll need to let the shag carpet dry completely before you begin to use it like normal again. This can take up to 48 hours, or even longer depending on the size of the carpet and the thickness of the fibers.


You can think about setting up box fans to blow on the shag carpet to help it dry more quickly if you are running short on time.

, Gently shake a bit of the dry carpet shampoo onto the shag carpet. Be careful not to overdo it and apply too much of the dry shampoo. A light sprinkling will do.Be sure to choose a carpet shampoo that is intended for use on synthetic carpets like shag carpet.
You should be able to purchase dry carpet shampoo at any home improvement store or larger home goods store.

, Use a brush to work the dry shampoo granules into the fibers of the carpet. The more you work the shampoo into the carpet, the better it will do at cleaning the carpet.Be sure not to work too vigorously, as you don’t want to damage the carpet.

, The dry carpet shampoo needs a bit of time to work properly. Let it sit on the shag carpet for approximately sixty minutes before you begin the removal process.Be sure to carefully follow the directions on the dry carpet shampoo packaging.

, Try not to vacuum the shag carpet too intensely, as this could damage the long fibers of the carpet. The carpet fibers could get frayed or even break off over time. You could also damage your vacuum cleaner.If you must vacuum the shag carpet, try to use a low-powered handheld vacuum cleaner to avoid damaging the fibers.

, If you are using cleaning solutions such as carpet shampoo or vinegar, it is especially important to ventilate the area during the cleaning process. Open whatever windows are available, especially those that create a cross-breeze in the room, to help eliminate potentially harmful odors.You may want to consider opening any doors to the room as well to further ventilate it.

, When dealing with shag carpet, it’s important to be proactive about spills. If you spill anything (especially liquid) on your shag carpet, you should blot it immediately with a clean towel to minimize the amount of the staining liquid that is able to soak up into the carpet fibers. This will make the cleaning process much easier.Remember to blot at spilled liquids rather than rubbing. Rubbing could damage the carpet fibers.

, A steam-cleaning machine uses hot water and non-foaming carpet detergent to clean carpet that has been dirtied with use. Rent a steam-cleaner and follow the instructions on the machine to clean your carpet. Once you have finished cleaning, you’ll need to let the carpet dry for several days before returning to normal use.Be careful not to pull the machine too vigorously over the shag carpet, so as not to damage the carpet fibers.
You can rent steam-cleaners from most grocery stores, home improvement stores, and even some carpet cleaning stores.
You should steam clean your shag carpet once or twice per year to give it a good deep clean and to maintain its appearance.

, If you are struggling with the decision about whether or not to clean your shag carpet yourself, you might want to consider hiring a professional to clean it for you. Due to the delicate nature of shag carpet, it is very easy to damage in cleaning. It might be better to play it safe and pay a professional.Be sure to check around for a carpet cleaning company that has experience cleaning shag carpet specifically.

Collect your patinating necessities.,
Prepare to patinate the metal.,
Soak the metal in vinegar.,
Intensify oxidation with peroxide, if desired.,
Allow your metal to dry and consider a sealant.",How to Patina Metal1," You can find most of these items and ingredients in your home. You'll need a suitable container to soak your metal in a patinating solution, like a plastic container or cheap bowl. After patinating, you can clean this container and reuse it as you see fit, but it must at least be deep enough to completely submerge the metal you'll be patinating. Including these things, you'll also need:


Clean rag (or paper towels; for drying)
Container
Hydrogen peroxide (3% solution; optional)
Metal (to patinate)
Plastic/rubber gloves (optional; recommended)
Salt (any kind OK)
White vinegar;
, For the best results, always clean your metal and container before patinating. Even fingerprints or invisible residue can influence the outcome of your patination, so clean and dry your metal and container carefully and thoroughly.


In most cases, a few drops of dish soap and a scrub brush will be enough to clean light to moderately dirty pieces of metal and containers.
Soak especially dirty metal pieces in degreaser. This will remove build up in difficult to reach nooks and crannies.
If you're trying to patinate steel, cleaning it with Trisodium Phosphate can be very effective. Then rinse off the metal and allow it to air dry.Wearing clean gloves while cleaning and handling the metal can protect your skin from harsh cleaning agents while preventing fingerprints from being re-transferred., Add vinegar to your clean, dry container so there is enough to completely submerge the metal. Then add an equal amount of salt to the vinegar, stir it thoroughly, and insert the metal so it can sit in the solution and create a vinegar-salt patina.Allow metal to soak in vinegar-salt patinating solutions for no less than half an hour. This solution can produce many colors of patina depending on soak time, metal composition, temperature, and other factors.
For more intense oxidation, first soak the metal in only vinegar. Following that, add hydrogen peroxide and salt to the vinegar as subsequently described., The addition of hydrogen peroxide and salt to your vinegar will cause many iron alloys, like steel, to rust.This can add color, character, and realism to your patina. For every four parts white vinegar in your container, add one part hydrogen peroxide and one half part salt to the solution.For example, if you have four cups of vinegar in your container, you would need to add one cup hydrogen peroxide, and one half cup of salt.
If you don't know the amount of white vinegar in your container, remove your metal for a moment and pour the vinegar into a measuring cup, then return it to its container.

, For a truly natural look, you may want to leave your patinated metal without a coat of sealant. However, this kind of patina can be susceptible to flaking or fading. After your metal is fully dry, you can protect its patina with:


A clear coat of acrylic finish. This will create a smooth, hard barrier between your patina and the forces that cause it to flake and fade.
Waxes. For example, you might find regular beeswax or renaissance wax helpful for preserving the surface of the patina and its color."

Aluminum, or one of its alloys, which are often silvery-white. It is a light, common metal that shares a density of 2.7 g/cm³ ( .098 lbs/in³) with most of its alloys.

Copper, or one of its alloys, which are usually reddish in color. Deoxidized copper has a density of 8.9 g/cm³ (.322 lbs/in³), copper nickel 8.8 g/cm³ (.318 lbs/in³), navy brass 8.6 g/cm³ (.311 lbs/in³), and silicon bronze of 8.7 g/cm³ (.314 lbs/in³).

Iron, or one of its alloys, which are relatively lustrous and gray in hue. Cast iron has a density of 7.5 g/cm³ ( .271 lbs/in³), wrought iron shares the same density as steel at 7.8 g/cm³ (.282 lbs/in³), and stainless steel of 7.9 g/cm³ (.285 lbs/in³).

Silver, or one of its alloys, are bright and shiny. Silver has a density of 10.5 g/cm³ (.379 lbs/in³) and nickel silver 8.4 g/cm³ ( .303 lbs/in³)., Now that you know the kind of metal you're working with, you'll need to research what kind of chemical treatment will work best for patinating that kind of metal. Some common treatments include:


Jax Chemical Company's pre-mixed metal coloring solutions. Many of these are formulated to work well on copper, brass, and bronze.
Baldwin's Patina, which is suited for copper and steel clays as well as brass, bronze, and copper metals.
Liver on Sulfur (LOS), which works for many metals and alloys, with the exception of brass, gold, aluminum, and stainless steel., Contaminants on the surface of your metal could negatively impact the end result of your patination. For most light to moderately dirty metals, briskly scrub it with dish soap and water, then air dry.


For dirtier pieces of metal or a deeper, more thorough cleaning, soak the metal in degreaser overnight, rinse it clean with water, then allow it to dry.
Handling the metal with clean gloves can prevent you from accidentally transferring oil from your hands to the metal and influencing the patination., Many of the chemicals used to create a patina give off dangerous fumes that can cause harm or death if they build up, so work in an area with good airflow. Read and follow the directions that came with your chemicals carefully to ensure the safest and best results.


Generally, your bare hands should never come into contact with chemicals. Wear plastic or rubber gloves at all times when handling chemicals, or metal with chemicals on it.
Keep chemicals from your eyes and mouth with protective eye-wear and a mask. Many of these are poisonous, and can lead to irritation, illness, or worse., Depending on the chemical treatment you've chosen for your metal, you may have to apply it directly to the metal's surface, prepare it in a container then dunk your metal, and so on. Follow your treatment's label instructions for best results.Many chemical treatments will change color depending on number of applications and/or soak time. Generally, LOS will yield yellow/gold on the first dunking, pink/red on the second, turquoise/purple on the third, and gray on the fourth.
Some chemical treatments may need to reach a certain temperature to work best. LOS, for example, should generally be prepared in very hot water., There may be harmful chemicals still on your metal after you've applied the treatment. Frequently, this can be made safe by covering the metal completely with baking soda and then rinsing it clean.Gentler or more environmentally safe chemicals may only need a quick rinse with clean water before your metal is safe to handle barehanded.
Harsh and specially formulated chemicals may require specific neutralizing agents to render the solution harmless.

, Some chemicals will continue to be dangerous after preparation. These chemicals should indicate this on their label and provide instructions for neutralization and disposal.


Your chemical may have come with a separate neutralizing agent, but in many cases, baking soda can be added to neutralize chemical solutions.
LOS breaks down with exposure to light and air. Leaving your container of LOS open in a sunny, well ventilated area for a day will neutralize it.Any chemicals left out to neutralize over time should be kept safe from children and animals in a well ventilated area.

, You can preserve the color and consistency of your patina while adding polish with a sealant, like a clear coat of acrylic, beeswax, or renaissance wax. However, for the most realistic look and continued patination, unsealed might be your best option."

Purchase your project supplies.,
Ready your work area.,
Prepare the metal.,
Mix and apply your oxidizing paint.,
Add the patina solution.,
Wait until it is dry, then adjust the patina as you see fit.",How to Patina Metal3," To imitate the patina effect, you'll need a special kind of paint that has tiny metal particles in it. This is called oxidizing paint or surfacer. This will react with a special patina solution to create that patinated look. For this project, you'll need:


Containers (x2; for paint and sealant; optional)
Degreaser (optional)
Foam brush (x2)
Gloves
Metal (to patinate)
Oxidizing paint & patina solution (often sold together)
Paint stirrer
Plastic/rubber gloves
Sealant (spray-on recommended)
Dish soap & water, Fumes from the paint and oxidizing solution you'll be using can build up in areas with poor airflow and cause injury or death. Choose a well ventilated work area and a flat, stable work surface for this project.


Paint can sometimes spatter and spread where you'd rather it not. Lay down a tarp or some newspaper to catch unwanted paint droplets in your work area.
Depending on the container your oxidizing paint and patina solution came in, you may be able to work straight from the container or you may want to pour these into separate containers.
If you decide to use a separate container for your oxidizing paint, be sure to mix the paint with a stirrer thoroughly so it is consistent throughout before transferring the paint., Dirt, oil, and other contaminants on the surface of your metal can negatively impact the outcome of the patina. A little bit of dish soap, warm water, and a good scrub will be enough to clean most metal. Allow it to air dry, then you're ready to apply the oxidizing paint.


The most thorough cleaning will yield the best results. An overnight soak in a suitable degreaser will remove contaminants entrenched deeply in crevices.
Wearing gloves will prevent you from accidentally leaving behind fingerprints, which can cause the patina to deform., The small metal particles in the paint can sometimes clump up and create inconsistencies in your patina. Take a paint stirrer and thoroughly mix the paint so it is smooth and consistent throughout. Then, use a clean foam brush to apply the paint to your metal.


Each brand of paint will be different, so you'll have to follow your paint's directions for the best results. Generally, apply two thin coats of paint with one hour of drying time between coats.
Depending on your surface, you may need a few coats before it is completely and evenly covered with oxidizing paint., After the second coat, wait until the paint is tacky to the touch. Be sure to wear your gloves while checking tackiness. Then, take your clean foam brush and:


Use liberal applications of the patina solution to create an intense effect. Be consistent, inconsistency will lead to patchy patination.
Use incremental applications of the patina solution to gradually intensify the effect. This way, you're less likely to overshoot your ideal patina.
Wait patiently for the color change. Many factors can influence the time it takes to oxidize and create a patina effect. Generally, color should change in 10 to 15 minutes., At this point, you will be able to see how the paint interacts with the patina solution. Once the paint and solution are dry, you can reapply more paint and solution to modify the patina to suit your preferences.


Much like paint can flake off or fade over time, so can your imitation patina. A thin layer of clear sealant will help prevent this from happening."
"
Get an abrasive like steel wool or sandpaper.,
Purchase or rent an orbital hand sander or another mechanical sander.,
Hold the can and sand down the sides.,
Use a sandblaster if you have access to one.",How to Remove Ink from Soda Cans2," Get a tough abrasive that can scrape the paint off the can. Steel wool or sandpaper may be able to do this for some aluminum cans. You can pick up these supplies at most department and hardware stores.

, If you want a quicker and easier way to sand, you can use a hand sander or mechanical sander to remove the paint from your can. Using a mechanical sander will save you some time and effort.


Hand sanders typically cost anywhere from $60 to over $100.Always read the manual before using a piece of electronic equipment.

, Hold the can in one hand and use the sander to scrape away the paint from the outside of the can. This process will require more force if you're using a non-mechanical sander or piece of steel wool. Continue to sand until all of the paint is off. If you don't need your can to be intact, you can empty it out and cut it down the side, roll it out, and tape it to a piece of cardboard. This may make sanding it easier.


A can that's full is much easier to handle because it won't get crushed as you sand it.

, You can use stronger sanding equipment, like a handheld sandblaster, to remove the paint from the surface of your can. Secure the can to the ground outside using duct tape and blast the can with your sandblaster. Once one side is shiny, rotate your can and continue sandblasting it.Use safety goggles and gloves when using a sandblaster.Some sandblasters with high pressure can break or destroy your cans if you sand them. Use a lower pressure sandblaster to avoid this.
Use an empty can when using a sandblaster to remove the ink from the can.

Remove the metal knobs from the drawers.,
Wash the metal knobs.,
Sand the knobs.,
Prepare the knobs for priming and painting.,
Prime the metal knobs.,
Apply paint to the metal knobs.,
Reinstall the metal knobs.",How to Paint Metal Knobs," To do this, you will usually only need a Phillips-head screwdriver. Loosen the screw holding each knob in place and set both the screws and knobs aside.;
, It helps to wash the knobs before sanding and painting them; this keeps small particles of dust and debris from mixing in with the paint and marring the finish. You can wash the knobs with water and any mild soap. Wipe the knobs completely dry with a clean cloth before sanding them.

, Once the knobs are dry, go over each of them lightly with medium-grit sandpaper. This will prepare the surface for priming, and will also help to remove any loose or flaked paint from the knob. Wipe the knobs with a tack cloth after sanding to remove any particles of paint or metal left by the sanding.

, You will not be able to handle the knobs while applying the primer or paint, because this will create fingerprints in the finish. The simplest way to set the knobs up for painting is to lay them out on a sheet of plastic with their tops facing up. However, a more elegant solution can be prepared using a sheet of cardboard.


Obtain a large sheet of sturdy corrugated cardboard; you can easily cut one out from a shipping box. Fold the sheet down the middle so that it holds a 45 degree angle. Place the folded cardboard on top of a flat surface so that it forms a ""tent"" shape. Poke the screw of each knob through the underside of the cardboard and secure the knobs just as you would when installing them in your drawers.






You can now prime and paint the knobs in place on the cardboard support. The cardboard will keep the knobs from rolling and touching each other, and the angle will keep paint from pooling around the knobs. Make sure to lay down newspaper or another disposable material underneath the cardboard tent.







, You should purchase and apply a clean metal primer to improve the paint's adhesion. Clean metal primer is available in spray cans and can be purchased from nearly any hardware store. To apply it, shake the can as indicated in the directions, and spray the entire cardboard support in long, smooth passes. A thin layer is all that is needed, and will dry faster than a thick layer. Allow the primer to dry as per the can's directions; the primer should no longer be tacky to the touch before applying paint.

, For painting metal knobs or other hardware, you should use a metal spray paint, which is designed to adhere well to metal. For a glossy and durable finish, use a spray paint that is designated as ""enamel."" This paint should be applied just as you applied the primer. Shake the can and spray the knobs in long, smooth passes. Keep the spray can moving at all times to avoid creating thick patches that may lead to drips. One coat of paint will usually be sufficient.

, After allowing the paint to completely dry, unscrew the knobs from the cardboard support and screw them back into your drawers.

Loosen the rust with a wire brush.,
Sand the surface thoroughly with an 80-grit sandpaper, then with a finer 120-grit sandpaper.,
Wash the surface with a degreasing cleaner.,
Wet a cloth with paint thinner and wipe it over the surface of the steel.,
Place the steel on a drop cloth or cover the area around the steel with drop cloths, to avoid getting paint on it.

,
Brush a rust-inhibiting primer that includes zinc chromate or iron oxide onto the metal.,
Paint your steel surface with 2 coats of outdoor paint, since most steel is kept outside.",How to Paint Rusty Steel," You can either do it by hand or use a wire wheel brush attachment inserted into a hand drill.


If you must prepare a large rusty steel surface, use a sand blaster to remove the rust. A sandblaster uses compressed air and particles of sand to blow off the surface of the steel.;
, Sweep away your work area with a broom to avoid getting particles on the surface during the painting process.

, Pine, orange and other citrus-based cleaners will work well. Use a scrub brush to scrub the surface and rinse clean with water.

, It will remove the slight rusty finish that appears after cleaning steel.

,, Allow the primer to dry according to package directions. Repeat, if recommended.


Do not use a paint sprayer or spray paint cans for the rust inhibitor, because they will not reach into all the tiny pores on the steel's surface. This is more important than the top coat because it will slow down the oxidizing process in the future.
You can also use an anti-rust enamel paint over 1 coat of regular primer.

, You can choose a matte, semi-gloss or glossy finish, according to your preference.


Use a brush or paint roller to apply the exterior paint, if you want to ensure you reach every crevice of the steel. Hold a brush at the base of the handle to ensure you have good control of your brush strokes.
Use spray paint, if you want to ensure there is an even coat. Make sure you hold the can at the proper distance, as indicated by the directions on the can. Spray parallel to the object, moving your hand back and forth in smooth motions during application. This will provide a professional-looking finish and avoid drips on the steel surface.

Cover the area around the railings carefully.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Mix a solution of half vinegar and half water in a bucket.,
Scrub the railing thoroughly with your cleaning solution.,
Rinse the railing and allow it to dry before continuing.

,
Use a wire brush to slough off any loose rust flakes on all the surfaces of the railings.,
Sand the surface of the railing with medium-grit sandpaper.,
Rub the surface of the railing with a tack cloth to remove dust from sanding.

,
Apply your first coat of rust-inhibiting primer immediately after sanding and wiping the rail.,
Check your primer's directions on how long it must dry before your second coat.,
Allow the primer to dry according to the product's directions.

,
Apply a layer of topcoat.,
Allow the topcoat to dry completely.

,
Add another layer of topcoat, if you do not feel it is adequately covered.

,
Remove your drop cloths and tape and clean your brushes according to the paint can's instructions.

",How to Paint Rusty Railings," Use drop cloths for larger spaces and painter's tape for smaller spaces.;
, Wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Put on safety goggles and a dust mask before starting any work. Metal flakes will be scattered as you prepare the metal.

,


You can also use diluted, mild detergent.

, This should remove dirt and remaining rust.

,, Most rusty railings have a layer of flaky rust covering their surface. Use the wire brush to remove as much rust as possible.


If you have large or intricate railings, or if you have a lot of rust on the surface, you can buy a wire brush attachment for a drill. Attach the brush to the drill and move along the entire surface of the railing. It will make the job easier.

, Medium grit is between 80 and 120 grit. This is called scuff-sanding and it should take gloss off the surface and allow the primer and paint to bond more easily.


Sand rough spots with coarse sandpaper, from 40 to 60 grit.

,, This is sometimes called ""direct-to-metal"" primer. First apply your coat of paint, then brush it into the crevices before it dries.

, Once again, use a brush to get into all the crevices of the metal railing.


If you do not have time to do all the steps in 1 day, wait until the next to sand and apply primer and paint.

,, You can use a spray can, roller or brush to apply the topcoat. Brush the coat with a paint brush to remove any drips and get into the crevices.


Many people prefer to use semi-gloss or high-gloss paint for their topcoat. These finishes add a shine to the railings and can make them easier to clean.

Determine the working range of the metal you are going to forge or weld.,
Choose a fuel for your forge.,
Design the hearth and fire pit to a size suitable for the project you are going to use it for.,
Choose the location where you will set up your forge.,
Form up a concrete foundation for your forge.,
Lay up about 24 inches (61.0 cm) of brick on this foundation, leaving the interior hollow, like a box.,
Leave an opening for the forced air supply piping either in the side or front of this box, as well.,
Fashion a metal pan or fire pit liner to fit over the walls of the brick box you have laid up.,
Lay your fire pit floor using fire brick or soapstone brick and mortar mixed with fire clay to withstand the high temperatures of your forge.,
Lay up regular clay brick for your sides in a hearth type configuration if you like, to draft the smoke and heat away from the work ledge and fire pit.,
Allow all of the masonry work to ""cure"" for a reasonable length of time.",How to Make a Metal Forge," Iron is forged in the range 1200 F to 2550 F (650 C - 1400 C), brass or bronze at somewhat cooler temperatures.;
, Natural gas, propane, or liquefied propane gas are readily available in most locations, but for an authentic, old fashioned forge, coal/coke or charcoal fires would be the first choice.

, For craft and hobby work, a small pit will be sufficient. If you have ambitions for forging swords or other long ""weapons"", you may find you need a ""deeper"", or larger fire area. For very large heavy forgings, a forging oven with an overhead hoist may be more suitable, but for this discussion, we will look at smaller, hearth-type furnace forges to heat the steel.

, If you are going to use it for long term work at frequent intervals, you may want to enclose it in a woodshed or building, but this will require ducting the excessive heat out of the work space, so we will look more along the lines of hobby work, and assembling it in an outdoor area.

, A fairly useful size and configuration might be about 19X29 inches. Install reinforcement bars, and place concrete in the form. Float the concrete flat and fairly smooth.

, Leave an opening in the back ""wall"" of this box for removing ash from the fire pit, about 12X12 inches. You may decide later to have a metal door built for this, but that really doesn't matter.

, You may choose to fashion a bellows assembly or buy an electric blower for this purpose, but for this project, a 4 inch (10.2 cm) cast iron pipe should work for your air duct, regardless of what you use to supply the air.

, This should have a depression of about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) in the center, and can be formed out of 12 or 16 gauge stainless steel, or 1/4 inch (10.2 cm) cold rolled steel plate. It must be strong enough to support the fire brick liner or packed clay which is the base for the fire. You will need a hole near the center of the depressed area of the pit liner for the fresh air supply pipe described earlier.

, You will want one layer of brick to line the fire pit ""floor"" so that the metal pit form does not burn out from the high temperatures. The sides should be laid up with fire brick and mortar to form a ledge to support the work pieces or tongs with which you will hold your workpiece. The working height of this ledge depends on how tall the forge-worker, or smith, is. Waist high is a good average height.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but helps keep the temperature more comfortable at the front of the forge.

, Depending on climate, this is usually 28 days. If you are anxious to begin using the forge sooner, build a small ""curing"" fire in the fire pit to temper the masonry before getting it really hot.

Start with steel with sufficient carbon content.,
Heat the steel.,
Quench the steel in a fluid.,
Clean the steel.,
Heat the steel again, but not as much.,
Let the steel cool.",How to Harden Steel," Hardening steel causes the structure of carbon to crystallize, similar to the way coal or graphite changes to diamond under the heat and pressure within the earth. Without other metals alloyed with it, steel to be hardened needs to have a carbon content of about 0.6 percent or higher. This kind of steel is called high-carbon steel or tool steel. (Steel alloys such as silver steel and gauge plate are also high-carbon steels.)









Medium carbon steels, with a carbon content of 0.4 to 0.55 percent, can also be hardened, but these steels need to have other metals alloyed with them so that the steel can be hardened more thoroughly.
Mild steels, with a carbon content of 0.4 percent or less, cannot be hardened directly. They can, however, be coated with other materials to make them harder in a process called case hardening.;
, Heat the entire piece of steel slowly at first. Then, concentrate the heat on the area that is to be hardened, such as a chisel point or screwdriver blade tip, until that area glows red hot.








, Dipping the hot steel into a liquid or gas rapidly cools it, hardening the metal. Several fluids may be used as a quench.









Oil is the most commonly used quench liquid especially if you are unsure of the exact chemical composition of your steel. Common oils used are vegetable, mineral, cottonseed or whale oil. Oil cools the steel more slowly than water which makes it less prone to cracking but hardens just as much as water. Complex steels such as most modern steels with several alloys tend to crack if quenched to quickly such as with water. If bubbles are allowed to form, they can slow the cooling process and create soft spots in the metal, so the quenching liquid is usually agitated to prevent bubbles from forming. Quenching oils may cause fumes, spatters and spills and do constitute a possible fire hazard if not monitored properly.
Salt water quenches hot steel faster than plain water, because the salt makes bubbles pop faster. However, it must be rinsed off immediately, because it will corrode steel faster than fresh water.
Glycol polymers mixed with water provide an intermediate rate of quenching between water and oil, with the rate of cooling dependent on the amount of glycol. They corrode the steel less than water and are less likely to catch fire than oil, but the ratio of polymer to water must be monitored constantly to ensure consistent results.
Cryogenic quenches are used to prevent soft and brittle spots from forming and forcing the steel to become more thoroughly hardened. These quenches are more likely to be used with high-carbon than medium-carbon steels.

, This removes the quenching fluid and prepares the steel for tempering. If a liquid other than water was used to quench the steel, water may be used to rinse the steel off. If not, a light abrasive, such as emery cloth, may be used.








, This second heating tempers the steel to take away the brittleness created by the hardening process. The steel may be heated in a furnace or a bath of oil, sodium and potassium nitrate mixture or lead. The temperature to which the steel is heated during tempering determines how hard the tempered steel will be; the higher the temperature, the softer but tougher it will be.









During the tempering process, the heated steel shows surface oxide colors according to how hot it is. Colors start with light straw at about 200 °C (392 °F) through to purple at about 300 °C (572 °F). These colors are used as a guide for the tempering temperature according to how the steel will be used. Alloyed steels require higher temperatures to reach a particular color than carbon steels, however.

, This time, unlike the rapid cooling during quenching, the steel can be cooled either quickly or slowly, depending on the desired properties of the finished steel. Steel alloys subject to becoming brittle again after tempering should only be cooled slowly, however.

Take a piece using these dimensions as shown above.,
Cut a piece of sheet metal, 2 X 4 inches, .040 material thickness and a Bend Radius of .375.,
Mark down a few important measurements on your piece of metal.,
Calculate your Bend Allowance.,
Walk over to the brake.,
Lift the clamping bar, then slide your piece in underneath your radius.,
Slowly lift up the folding leaf to start bending.,
Once you have bent the piece of sheet metal, put down the folding leaf to its original spot and lift up the clamping bar.",How to Make a 90 Degree Bend in a Piece of Sheet Metal Aluminum,";
, You will do this by taking any size piece (a relatively good size) and putting it in the cutting machine. But before you cut your piece, you need to first take a 6"" ruler and mark out your 2 X 4 inch measurements. Afterwards, take your piece over to the cutting machine. Place it in according to your measurements, press down with your foot, and it will cut the aluminum. Next, take your piece and lay it out on a table in front of you. Take a single-cut file and deburr all the sides and corners of your piece, so it's easier to work with.

, Before you mark anything though, make sure that the grain traveling on your piece is moving in the opposite direction from when you bend it. Meaning it will be traveling lengthwise. The next few markings that you will put on your piece are important reference points for when you bend the aluminum.


Mark down your Bend Tangent Lines. These lines are where your bend will begin and end. To figure out your Bend Tangent Lines, you will need to figure out your Setback.
Setback is defined as the distance from your Bend Tangent Line to your Mold Line. To find Setback, you add your material thickness and the radius of your bend, times your K value(your angle, 90 degrees). In this case, (.040 + .375)1.0000. You will get an answer of .415. Now take the 2"" measurement that we already know from flat side A, and starting from your center line, subtract .415 from it. You will get an answer of 1.585"" which you can measure with your 6"" ruler. Mark it down on your piece of metal. This marks your first Bend Tangent line.

, The Bend Allowance is defined as the amount of material used for the bend, and is determined by using the following formula: BA= (0.0173(BR) + 0.0078(MT)). For bends 1-180 degrees, this formula is used. Inputting our values into the equation, we end up with an answer of .617. The use of a table can also help us find Bend Allowance. Now measure .617 from your first Bend Tangent line, then mark it. Draw another line which will give you your second Bend Tangent line.


Lastly, you will need to mark your sight line. A sight line is your Bend Radius measured from the Bend Tangent line that's closest to the end going in the brake. Soon when we'll place your piece in the brake, you will place the radius in until it reaches the edge of your sight line. This will ensure the bend is in the right spot for the perfect bend. Next, Measure your Bend Radius, .375, from the Bend Tangent line closest to the edge of the metal entering the brake. Mark it with a dotted line, to tell it apart from your Bend Tangent lines. Once that is complete, you are now ready to bend your piece of sheet metal!

, You will need to set the brake in order to bend your piece of sheet metal. Place your piece upward in the brake. Adjusting the handles behind the brake and the handles on the clamping bar, will slowly start to move and tighten around your piece. Continue to do so until you can't pull out your piece of sheet metal.

, Slide it under until you reach your sight line. Look down or use your 6"" ruler to make sure your sight line is directly under your radius. Clamp down the bar to tighten your piece in place.

, You will need to lift up the folding leaf far enough so your piece passes the 90 degree mark. You need to do this in order to avoid spring back. If you were to just bend it to the 90 degree mark and take it out, your piece of metal would slowly bend backwards and you would need to bend it again. So in order to save you from that trouble, we will bend the piece of sheet metal further to ensure it will come out 90 degrees.

, Take out your piece and walk over to a flat surface. Place your piece flat on each side and measure with your 6"" ruler to see if it's a perfect 90 degree angle. If your piece happens to be a bit past the 90 degrees, pull it back a bit then measure it again. Congrats! You have now created a 90 degree bend in a piece of sheet metal.

  Masonite die working side is facing downward.,
Get the needed materials: they're listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section below.,
When deciding the measurement for the die, make sure the edge of the plywood is 2"" beyond the outside edge of the design to make extra room for the sheet metal to be bolted onto the die and to be strong.,Make sure each die for each side has Masonite glued onto the working side(s).,
Draw the outline of the design onto a piece of craft paper or thick paper (a paper bag is perfect).,Glue the paper design onto the plywood and let dry to follow when you cut out the shape.,Drill holes into the plywood on the inside edge of the design for the jigsaw blade, as a starter hole.,

Cut the design from the plywood with the jigsaw, saber saw or coping saw (drill a starter hole to insert the blade), making sure to keep the blade straight, vertical, not at an angle with the edge of the plywood, forming the outlined shape straight through, carefully, if you are going to use each half.,Place the sheet metal on top of the die.,Make sure the sheet metal lines up with the sides of the Masonite faced plywood.,Tape the sheet metal to the die with painters, masking tape.,
Measure and cut at least four holes all of the way through the plywood, the same size as your four bolts.,
Make sure to anneal (soften, remove stress from) the brittle metal with sufficient heat and gradually cooling, if you are using brass, copper or sterling silver.,Bolt the metal to the die using the bolts/screws, nuts or tee nuts.,

Sink the metal into the die using the hard plastic hammer.,
Unbolt the first side and flip the die over and use that side to repeat the sinking process again for a second half (mirror image).,Finish by attaching the two mirror halves or by following whatever the design calls for.",How to Form Metal With the Masonite Die Forming Process," The sheet metal shown is galvanized.

Visualize the process: draw an outline of the simple design/shape you wish on the surface of the plywood that you already faced with Masonite (either regular Masonite used for plain, brown clipboards, or double hardened Masonite). Cut out and remove the inner shape thus leaving the die (the outer part). Bolt/Screw your desired sheet metal onto the die, with nut, to cover the side to be hammer-tooled/worked downward into the die, to form the metal into the die; unbolt it; trim off margins (or not if will be framed); finish the ""metal art"" as desired (smooth or texture, burnish or polish, clear coat or paint (or both), etc.).

Another die forming technique is to form sheet metal with hydraulic pressed in die forming, instead of hammering.;
,

When you get your Masonite sheets, either the Regular Masonite that is used for clip boards (only one side is hardened while the other side is not and also is not smooth) or double hardened Masonite (each side is hardened and smooth) which produces sharper edges on the sheet metal than regular Masonite because the unhardened edge will become rounded off.

,

The thickness of the built-up layers of plywood will be equal to the desired depth of the finished product.
Example: if the design is 4"" in diameter and the finished product desired will be 1"" deep the plywood with the Masonite face(s) should be 8"" square and 1"" thick. If the end product is going to have two sides make sure each side is a mirror image (opposite) of the other -- or like the back/or other side of the object -- bolted to the opposite side of the die -- or completely separate as a somewhat different shape, e.g.: the back or other side of a head or body is an opposite/mirror image.
On a face (head) one might have an eye nose and/or mouth shape as a final (added) layer to carefully hammer into those, for dull features (not detailed)...

,, The paper should be the same size as the plywood.,,, If the blade isn't kept straight and vertical -- but at different angles on each edge, the outside edges of the design hammered into the sheet metal will not be identical for each half to match to form a 2-sided, 3-D object.,,,, Drill these holes in each corner. Drill through both the metal and the plywood at the same time., (This is opposite of tempering for adding hardness by suddenly cooling in cool/cold water for example.),, Be sure to not do too much along one edge at once -- but instead, work around and around to keep the forming consistent and aligned., Or if you made the die deep enough, then you can have metal on both sides, and so hammer into each side, but less than halfway, if you have the metal sides mounted back to back for convenience.,"

Purchase a copper sheet appropriate to the specifications of your job.,
Choose a soft temper of copper sheet to allow you to hammer copper more easily.,
Select a copper sheet that is as thin as possible but still works for your job.,Purchase a piece of plywood that is as long and wide as your copper sheeting.,Put on protective gloves to prevent cuts and protect your hands from any pieces of copper that may dislodge while hammering.,Unroll the copper sheeting onto the plywood.,
Put on protective eyewear when hammering copper.,
Hammer a nail into both ends of the copper sheet and into the plywood.,Place a towel over the portion of copper you're about to hammer.,Use a ball peen hammer to create the indentations.,Hammer softly, letting the weight of the hammer create the indentations in the copper.,

Get approximately 2 feet (about 61 cm) more copper sheeting than you need for the job. Allow 1 foot (about 30.5 cm) on each side. It will shrink with extensive hammering, and you'll need the excess on the ends for hammering in nails.;
, It can also be shaped by hand, if necessary.,

The thinner the copper sheeting, the easier it will accept the indentations of your hammer. For ease of hammering, choose a 24-gauge thickness for your copper sheeting. This can also be called 16 oz. or .021 inches (about .05 cm).

,,,,

This protects your eyes from any stray shards of copper that may dislodge while indenting copper.

,

This will secure your copper sheeting in place while you are hamming the copper.
You want the copper sheeting to be as flat and flush against the plywood as possible. This will give you the most control over your ability to hammer and indent the copper sheeting.

,,,, To avoid making too drastic of indentations in your copper sheeting, start soft and gradually apply greater and greater force until you've created the desired pattern.,"

Tilt the drawer.,
Pull straight out.",How to Remove Drawers1," If you plan to remove more than one drawer from a piece of furniture, you should start by removing the top drawer first. Work your way down one drawer at a time until you reach the bottom.


Removing the upper drawers before removing the lower ones can prevent the piece from becoming too top-heavy, thereby preventing it from wobbling or tipping over as you work. If the piece itself is secured or much heavier than the loaded drawers, however, there is no danger of tipping and the order of removal won't matter.;
, Pull the drawer out as far as it will go without offering any resistance. Most drawers will reach a natural stopping point.


Stand in front of the piece of furniture and position one hand on either side of the drawer.

Buy cleaning supplies in bulk.,
Make your own cleaning supplies.,
Use coupons on cleaning supplies.,
Monitor your supply costs.",How to Save Money on Housekeeping Costs1," One way you can save money on cleaning supplies for your home is to buy them in bulk. Go to your local bulk store and buy items like eco-friendly cleaners, eco-friendly towels and rags, and eco-friendly washing supplies in bulk. Keep large quantities of dishwashing detergent, laundry soap, and other materials on hand as they never go bad. Use a little bit at a time so your supplies last for a long time.Having cleaning supplies in bulk can also ensure you always have access to supplies when you need them. This can cut down the time and energy you would have to invest in going to the store and buying more supplies every time you need to clean.;
, Another way you can save money on upkeeping your home is to make your own cleaning supplies using basic, household materials. You can make your own laundry detergent using washing soap, borax, and water so you do not have to buy detergent. You can also make your own all natural disinfectant using tea tree oil and white vinegar so you are eco-friendly and can cut down on costs.You can also learn how to make your own all natural cleaner using household products so you do not have to spend money on cleaner on a regular basis. Make the cleaner in bulk so you have it on hand when you need it.

, You can also cut the cost of cleaning supplies by clipping coupons for cleaning items. Look through fliers and online promos at your local grocery store to find coupons for items like detergent, disinfectant, and surface cleaner.You can download Apps on your phone that will list coupons for certain items or brands.
Always compare the regular price cost of a generic brand to the coupon savings on a brand name product. Sometimes a generic brand is cheaper than a brand name product, even with coupon savings.

, Keep a close eye on how much you spend on cleaning supplies on a monthly basis. You may aim to spend less than $20 a month on cleaning supplies by buying in bulk and clipping coupons. Determine where you going over your budget on your cleaning supplies and see if you can find a way to reduce this cost.For example, you may notice that you spend a lot of money on dishwashing detergent every month. You may then decide to make your own dishwashing detergent to save money on this cleaning cost.

Develop a family mission statement.",How to Run a Household," It may sound strange to think of your home in terms of a business, but we’re not talking about your home becoming an impersonal corporate machine. Rather, the idea is to apply business management practices to your household as a way of bringing order.


It’s useful to look at business management structures to see your role as “home manager” with a little more formality.
You can follow a traditional hierarchy management style, where there is one “boss” who manages a few subordinates, who in turn manage those below them.You can look at models of “flat” organizations who don’t let one person be on top, but rather share the top with others and have open communication with most subordinates.;
, Once you have determined that a home management system is needed, it is necessary to designate a home manager (also called a “family manager”). This person will more than likely be the parent who is home more often, since their job will be to keep a close eye on the operations of the house.


It does not matter which parent takes on this manager position, as long as it gets taken. True, in many homes the mother is the likely candidate, but fathers are just as capable of taking on this role.
The same applies whether both parents work or one stays at home to care for the children. Whoever is home more often will be best suited as home manager.
If one or both parents work from home, the parent who counts as “home more often” is the one available to give their full attention to the family most frequently.

, Most home tasks can be broken down into six categories: family and friends, food, special events, time and scheduling, finances, and self-management.You can be creative with how these categories get completed each week, but breaking household chores down into tangible categories makes running a home instantly easier.
Making a separate to-do list for each category may help with organizing and prioritizing the household.
You can organize tasks in each category in a number of ways. You can pick one category per day of the week and accomplish all tasks for that category each day. Or you can assign a category to each hour in a day, spending time on specific tasks until the hour is up—no matter how much is done, rather like periods at school.

, Do you like to delegate tasks as quickly as possible, or do you like to do everything yourself? Looking at the six areas of household management can reveal which style you prefer, and show you where this is working for the family and where it isn’t. Seek help for the areas that aren’t flourishing under your current style of task management.


The fact is that no one style of leadership works all the time in all situations. A good manager is flexible, adapting to each situation as it arises. Not to mention that different people (your family members) respond differently to every management style., Once you have those six categories laid out, you can see where the family manager is strong and where he or she is weak. Noticing strengths provides clues to what motivates you and what drains you.


To determine the family manager’s strengths, look at the state of the house. Are they already good at completing everyday chores like laundry and dishes, or do they abandon that work in favor of creating fabulous meals?
The family manager should use this knowledge to perfect what they are good at and seek help for where they are weak. This way there is balance in all the household tasks, not just one aspect of them.

, Once you see what you’re good at, you’ll notice where you need to improve. Having others balance your weaknesses will keep your household running in good order.


Is there clutter in family areas that makes it hard to relax? Find someone who is good at minimizing clutter and put them to work, whether they are a family member or a friend.
Ask for help from your family members, but you can also read books and internet posts about how to be more flexible. You can also find friends who are good at the things you’re not, so you can learn from them.

, The family calendar should be centrally located, preferably the kitchen. It’s important to know what everyone in the household is doing in a visual so that things don’t get forgotten.


Making this calendar a white board allows you to quickly jot down everyone’s schedule and erase it when changes arise. In other words, a flexible calendar will help you be flexible.
Include a weekly menu so that family members can simply read it instead of nagging the home manager. Allow them to make changes to the menu as long as they are willing to pay for the different ingredients.
Tack up an ongoing grocery list so that family members can add to the list themselves when they see a supply running out or want a particular item.
You can also create a space for phone numbers near this calendar to minimize stress.

, Make a plan for when groceries will be purchased each month and how much money will be spent on them. Knowing which day this shopping trip occurs each month will minimize stress for everyone.

, Mail can get piled up if it doesn’t have a designated home. Minimize clutter fast by setting the mail where the home manager can go through it once a week.


You can add a space for important papers so that when a child needs a permission slip signed or a bill needs to be filed, nothing gets lost. The family manager should check this bin each evening to sign things, and children should check it each morning before school.

, One of the best ways to manage a home is to have help. Set up a weekly chore chart so that every member of the family has a job and the weight of the entire household doesn’t rest on one person. This is part of the business management structure concept, that the boss (family manager) delegates tasks.


Chore charts are good for many reasons, including getting help to manage the house, building confidence in children, and teaching responsibility.You can make your own chore chart or find a printable template online.

, Even though the goal is to eliminate clutter by having an organized home, clutter is going to happen. Busy schedules interfere with good intentions all the time. Clutter can be combed through once a month to keep from getting out of control.

, Once or twice a year at the changing of seasons is a good time to clean out areas of the house that normally don’t get attention. Regular maintenance of rarely-cleaned places keeps a home looking and feeling clean year round.


You are probably putting away warm or cool clothes twice a year anyway, so digging a little deeper makes sense.

, Once you’ve decided who will be the family manager, you need to explain this official situation to the entire family. Although it might feel strange for everyone at first, once they see how much more efficiently the house is run, they will get on board.


Explain the role of the home manager, including the vision to run the home like a business. Lay out the six parts of a home for everyone so they can determine what areas of housekeeping they’re strong in. If they are strong in an area the family manager is weak, recruit that person to help the home manger.
Explain if you have decided on bringing in outside help to assist the family manager with their weaknesses.

, You’re going to set up a family calendar, a chore chart, and a paperwork filing system—all things that may take some getting used to. Explain in detail how each part of these things work.


If your family has never been exposed to organization on this level, consider this family meeting a “training” session for “new employees.” Of course, you’ll train while living daily life as well.

, No house goes without a rule system of some kind, but now that you are getting purposeful about running the household, a true set of rules needs to be defined. This provides clear understanding about what is expected of each family member.


When people have unspoken expectations, disappoint can lead to anger and even resentment. Having a clear set of rules prevents such expectations, thus circumventing anger altogether. Less anger means a happier home, a pleasant result of truly running a household.
Make sure that everyone has a voice in setting up these rules. This will prevent resentment and rebellion.
Write down the rules you agree upon, perhaps even posting them near the family calendar.

, One last step to uniting the family under this new style of management is developing a mission statement together. This statement is a one-sentence catchphrase that describes the things your family values most.For example, your mission statement could be like the Three Musketeers, “All for one and one for all.”

Move from top to bottom.,
Pull the drawer.,
Forcefully tug the drawer out.",How to Remove Drawers2," Furniture with one drawer is relatively easy to handle, but if you need to remove multiple drawers from one piece of furniture, you need to make sure that you start with the top drawer and gradually work your way down to the bottom drawer.


By working from top to bottom, you can prevent the piece from becoming too top-heavy and tipping over. If the furniture body is heavier than the loaded drawers, however, the order of removal won't make much difference.

, Extend the drawer out as far as it will go. Most drawers will naturally stop at a certain point.


Position yourself in front of the drawer and place one hand on either side of the drawer face.
Maintain some distance when you start, giving the drawer adequate room to extend outward as you pull. If necessary, step back so the drawer can pull out as far as possible.

, Continue tugging on the drawer toward your torso, pulling it out as straight and evenly as possible. The drawer should eventually come out completely, but you may need to exert considerable force before it does so.


The resistance offered by the drawer will vary based on its construction. Drawers that use a center wooden track are generally more difficult to remove than those with two side wooden tracks.
Each drawer should have a plastic ""stop"" piece, and this piece is responsible for preventing the drawer from falling out accidentally. The stop for center track drawers will usually be fairly rigid, making these drawers more difficult to remove. On the other hand, the stop for side track drawers is usually quite flexible, making such drawers far easier to remove."
"
Focus on the top drawer.,
Open the drawer.,
Locate the track levers.,
Press the levers.,
Pull the drawer straight out.",How to Remove Drawers3," When you need to remove more than one drawer from a piece of furniture, you should usually start with the top drawer. Progressively work your way downward, saving the bottom drawer for last.


The order of removal is only important if the loaded drawers are heavier than the body of the furniture. In such cases, the piece can become too top-heavy if you work from the bottom up, and the piece may tip over as a result. Working from the top down prevents this issue from occurring.

, Extend the drawer out as far as it will go on its own. Stop only when the drawer reaches its natural stopping point.


You should stand in front of the piece of furniture while removing the drawers. Position one hand on either side of the drawer, keeping your hands close to the drawer front and out of the way of the metal tracks.
Keep a little space in between your torso and the drawer so that the drawer can extend outward as far as possible without being blocked.

, You should spot one lever in the center of each metal track. The lever can be either straight or curved.


Full-extension slides, which are most common on 12-inch (30.5-cm) drawers, will usually have straight tabs. Three-quarter-extension slides, which are more common on 6-inch (15.25-cm) box drawers, typically have curved disconnect levers., Use your left hand to press up on the left-side lever. Use your right hand to simultaneously press down on the right-side lever.For drawers with straight levers, simply lift or depress the lever as far as it will go.
For drawers with curved levers, lift or depress the lever until the curve flattens out. You'll need to press directly on the curved or humped portion of the lever to accomplish this.

, While still holding the levers in their correct positions, continue pulling the drawer outward and toward your torso. It should lift straight out.


Typically, the metal tracks will continue sticking out from the front side of the piece after you've removed the drawer. Carefully push those tracks inward, moving them in a straight, parallel direction, before handing the piece of furniture further.

Reuse towels.,
Reuse old linens.,
Eliminate paper waste.,
Use refillable containers.,
Recycle any products you can no longer use.",How to Save Money on Housekeeping Costs2," To cut costs and be environmentally friendly, you should try to reuse your towels when possible. If you are running a hotel, you may encourage guests to reuse their towels to cut back on cleaning costs and water usage. Have a small sign in the hotel room that notes you are trying to encourage guests to be eco-friendly by asking them to reuse their towels for at least two nights.If you are a homeowner, you may try reusing your towels for a week and hanging them to dry so they are still clean enough to use throughout the week. You may then encourage others in your household to use the same towels for a week to cut down on costs and be more eco-friendly.

, Rather than throw away old linens, repurpose them as rags that you can use in the kitchen. Or stitch the old linens together to make kitchen aprons. You can also use old linens as scraps for a quilt or a blanket.You can also re-dye old linens and use them in your decor at home or in your hotel.

, Make an effort to cut down on the amount of paper you throw away at home or at your hotel. Wait to fill up toilet paper or tissue boxes until they are almost done. Provide a limited amount of paper items in each guest room so guests are less likely to use them up or throw them away.You can also reduce the amount of newspapers you throw away by offering them at the front desk rather than in each guest’s room. You can also encourage guests to look at the news online.
Always use reusable drinking cups that are made of glass instead of paper.
Avoid providing items that are one use only, such as plastic shower cups or liners for an ice bucket.

, Get in the habit of using containers that can be reused and refilled at home or in your hotel. Stock refillable soap dispensers in the bathroom and the kitchen. Keep refillable shampoo and conditioner bottles in the bathroom. This will cut down on the amount of waste in your home or your hotel and ensure you do not need to keep buying new single use only items for guests.You should also try to get into the habit of reusing containers once they are empty. Reuse containers by washing them out and repurpose them for something else, such as a garbage can, a recycling bin, or a container for other items.

, To be more environmentally friendly and cut down on waste, recycle as much as you can. You may put recycling bins in a central area of your home and write a note about what can be recycled and what cannot be recycled. Encourage members of your household to recycle paper, plastic, and glass products.You can also try to recycle any cardboard boxes that are no longer being used in your home as well as the packaging that items come in. Explain what can be recycled to the members of your household and make it a house rule that everyone must recycle.
You can also encourage guests at your hotel to recycle by setting up recycling bins by the garbages in common areas of the hotel. You may also put up a sign in the rooms noting what can be recycled in the room and where the guests can put the items to be recycled.

Create a staffing schedule.,
Monitor your staff’s overtime.,
Make sure your staff are always busy.,
Cross train your staff.",How to Save Money on Housekeeping Costs3," One way to save money on housekeeping costs as a hotel owner is to create a schedule for your staff. Calculate the labor needed for each working day by considering how many guests are in the hotel and how much time it takes for each room to be serviced. Have a clear day by day schedule so you know how much staff you need and do not over staff when you don’t need to.Having a staffing schedule can also help you calculate your labor costs. You can calculate labor costs by taking the employees required to service a room and dividing the amount by the number of rooms that can be serviced at a specific time.
You should also factor in insurance and employee benefits to determine how much you will be spending on staff. If the amount seems higher than other costs, you may consider how you can reduce your staffing costs without sacrificing the quality of the hotel.

, Keep an eye on how often your staff works and if they are starting to work over their standard work hours. Notice if your staff seems to be working too many overtime hours, which then drives the cost of labor up. Look over the staffing schedule and notice if there are staff you can cut or hours you can reduce so staff does not work overtime.If you know you will need a lot of staff for busier times of the year, such as the holiday season, you may plan ahead so you have enough staff to cover the hours without having them work any overtime.

, You should also ensure there is a long list of secondary tasks that staff members can do if they are less guests in the hotel or less maintenance of the rooms that need to be done. Create a list of tasks for days that are slow so your staff are always busy and never idle. This will ensure the hotel is still maintained and you are being cost effective.For example, you may make a list of tasks like, “clean the common area, clean the back kitchen, organize the supply closets” so your staff always has something to do while they are working.

, To maximize your staff and keep them engaged in their work, you should try training them in a variety of tasks or roles. Perhaps you train maids in stocking the supply closet and in maintaining the rooms. Or maybe you have a supervisor take on the manager role when the regular manager is unavailable.Though it may take some effort upfront to cross train your staff, doing so will benefit everyone in the long term. Often employees are more engaged in their job if they are given the chance to learn a variety of skills and assume different responsibilities.

Every time you walk pass it, for example, coming home from the store or work, separate the quarters from everything else and drop them in there.;
, If you're a person that uses cash more or instead of credit or debit cards, you'll soon find yourself swimming with loads of random coins. Go to your local bank and request quarter rolls or individual quarter change instead of dollar bills.

, When receiving cash back, ask the cashier in advance if you can get four quarters instead of a dollar bill. You can also do this when receiving cash back from a debit card. Check with the Customer Service Department or Courtesy Booth, if they have one, as well.

, Ask your parents or siblings if they have extra change so that you can exchange them for quarters. If you have dollar bills to trade, they wouldn't mind relieving their heavy wallets. Take other coins as well and trade them somewhere else later.

, Air and water tanks at the gas station or car washes always accepts change. Stop by your local laundromat and see if there's any available. Video arcades and casinos are also excellent choices for public change machines. For these, make sure that they give back actual quarters instead of tokens in return.

, Designate it for coin change and use it every time you get food takeout or go through fast food drive-through.

Keep your clothing away from direct sunlight.,
Ensure proper airflow.,
Avoid excessive humidity.",How to Preserve a Signature on an Article of Clothing," Touching the ink before it’s dried might smudge or smear the signature. If you’re wearing the signed piece of clothing, it may be best to carefully remove it to allow the ink to dry. Set the clothing down where it won’t be disturbed until it’s dried. You can usually tell that it’s dried by looking at it in the light; if it doesn’t shine, it’s probably dry., Make sure the signature is pointing upwards, towards you. You don’t have to worry about all of the clothing fitting on the ironing board, you just need to have the signature on the ironing board.


Note that you won’t be able to do this with all fabrics. Leather, for instance, can’t be ironed. You should strongly consider storing such clothing to preserve signatures rather than wearing it., After letting the iron warm up, press it onto the signature. Don’t slide the iron as you usually would; this might smudge or smear the ink. Press the iron just for a few seconds, otherwise you might burn the garment.


Make sure there’s no steam coming from the iron. Water will prevent the ink from setting, and will actually help remove the signature., Don’t put your signed garment in with any other clothing. Use the hottest setting and leave the clothing in the dryer for about 30 minutes. After removing it, the ink should have completely set, make it more resistant if you choose to wash the clothing.Be aware that not all types of clothing can be put in the dryer. For these, you should strongly consider storing them rather than wearing them if you want to preserve the signatures.

, If you’re set on wearing autographed clothing that can’t be ironed, you should only wash it in cold water; hot water can cause the ink to fade if you haven’t helped it set., Since you can’t iron leather or put it in the dryer, you need to take this extra step to protect the ink. All you need is to add a bit of the product to a soft sponge, then swipe the sponge along the autograph. The clear coating will help to preserve the ink., If you’re dealing with, say, leather, suede or chiffon, you won’t be able to use the dryer after washing or to set the ink. Hang up any clothing made of these to dry after washing, making sure to keep them out of the sun. , If your signed clothing is exposed to direct sunlight, the ink and fabric are likely to fade with time. Keep it displayed away from windows, and turn off the lights when you leave the room.


You can buy display cases specifically for holding autographed clothing or jerseys. These typically control the amount of light that enters the case, protecting the clothing within., If your clothing doesn’t have a chance to breathe, the fabric isn’t likely to last very long. If you put up the clothing in a display case, make sure it’s not right up against the glass. If it’s up on a wall without a case, create proper airflow by opening doors and windows from time to time; don’t let the same musty air sit in the room.


If storing your signed clothes in a drawer, note that they won’t last as long without proper airflow. The signature might also rub off on other clothes stored in the same drawer., Too much moisture will cause the signature to shrink and smear. Choose where you display your autographed clothing carefully; avoid basements and garages as these tend to be more humid. An air-conditioned or otherwise temperature controlled room is best for keeping signatures vivid and viewable longer."

Wash your clothes less.",How to Prevent Laundry from Bleeding," Manufacturers often put warnings like “wash with like colors” or “color rubs off” on the labels of garments that are at risk of bleeding in the wash. If the label is unclear or your garment is old and you’re not sure whether it will bleed, set it aside to be tested. Testing your clothes for dye bleeding beforehand will help you determine if you need to take extra precautions when washing them., Colorfastness indicates how well a piece of clothing maintains its dyes. You can test for colorfastness by ironing some white fabric onto a damp portion of your garment. If the white fabric absorbs any color, the garment is not colorfast and it is prone to bleeding in the wash. , You can also check to see if an article of clothing is colorfast by placing it in a bucket or sink of soapy water. Let it soak for about 30-minutes and then check back. If the color of the water has changed, the garment is not colorfast., You’ll want to take extra care when washing these garments to prevent any unwanted dye bleeding or dye transfer. Wash these clothes separately -- or even individually -- to keep your wardrobe looking bright and new., Besides separating colorfast clothes from non-colorfast clothes, it’s always a good idea to separate your dark clothes from your lights, and your white clothes from your colors. This will help in preventing dyes from one article of clothing from transferring to another in the wash. , Washing your laundry with hot water can cause more dye bleeding and transferring. Using cold water will help maintain the brightness and color of your wardrobe. If you have to use hot water to remove a stain from a colored garment, wash the stained article of clothing by itself to prevent its dyes from transferring to your other clothes.

, Color catchers are sheets that you can put in with your laundry that collect loose dyes that escape your clothes. They help prevent dyes transferring from one garment to another, so your new white shirt won't accidentally turn orange., Depending on the type of fabric your garment is made of, you might be able to use a dye fixative to help prevent bleeding in the wash. Dye fixatives help set loose dyes so they don't wash out or transfer to other fabrics. , Friction causes the fibers in your clothes to wear down, which leads to more dye bleeding and fading. Avoid excessive friction by using the lighter wash settings on your machine and adding fabric softener to your load.Turning your garments inside out can protect the outside of your clothes from friction, helping them stay brighter and less-worn looking for longer.Wash rough garments like jeans together in one load to prevent them from wearing down the fibers in your other clothes. , The more you wash your clothes, the more likely they are to fade and bleed. Instead of washing all your clothes after one wear, see if you own any pieces of clothing that can get multiple uses before you throw them in the wash. "

Learn to iron.",How to Manage Laundry in a Small College Dorm Room," The floor is not a good option in a small dorm room. Look for a hamper that is easy to carry, easy to store, and washable (now and then). Pop-up hampers, X-frame hampers, and laundry bags are good choices. You can leave them out in the room, or they will fit nicely in a closet. When not in use, they fold up and can be easily tucked away until needed. Rigid hampers are great if you want to store stuff on top or use it as a piece of furniture, but they are somewhat awkward for transporting to the laundry area.;
, When you get a stain on your clothes, use a pre-wash to keep it from setting, thus making it easier to get it clean when you do get around to doing your laundry. Some pre-treat wipes and sticks actually remove the stain allowing you to wear the outfit at least one more time. If you have a tough stain, check out one of the numerous guides written specifically for removal of stains.

, Hopefully your parents have taught you the ins and outs of how to wash your clothes. If not, ask whether an organized or tidy roommate can talk you through it.

, Little loads of wash cost just as much as the full loads, so share the washer with a friend if you don't have enough to fill it. Full loads also save water and energy.

, Pieces like tops, hosiery and underwear will last longer and be easier to sort if you divide them first. Mesh bags come in many shapes and sizes and you may need several to organize and separate your clothes. Try mesh bags for hand or machine washing sweaters. They help to prevent them from twisting and stretching.


Even if you don't wash t-shirts in separate bags, it's wise to have one or two bags that you can use for delicate items, such as bras and sweaters.

, Air drying can be tricky when you're short on space. Try a portable folding dryer, sometimes called a clothes horse. They fold flat to take up little space and can be stored in the closet, under the bed, behind a door. There are many styles and sizes to choose from and they can be used indoors or outdoors.

, You will save space in your dryer and you may also save ironing time. Be sure that the dryer you pick is tall enough to keep the clothes from dragging on the floor. If you don’t like the stiffness of some air dried clothes, like your jeans, once they are dry or almost dry put them in the dryer with a fabric softener dryer sheet for about 15 minutes. This will make them softer, without wear and tear and tons of quarters.

, It's a necessary evil for most cotton clothing. Even in a dorm room, there are ways. An over-the-door ironing board is one solution, but you may prefer the tabletop ironing boards, because they can be used anywhere—on the bed, on a desk, even on the floor. If you are really strapped for space, try an ironing blanket. Just clear off a space on a hard surface, such as your desk. When finished it folds up to store in a drawer, on a hook, or on a shelf.

Work in the correct order.,
Pull out the drawer.,
Remove the stabilizer screws.,
Release the catch.,
Pull the drawer out completely.,
Push in the tracks.",How to Remove Drawers4," As a general rule, you should remove the top drawer from a piece of furniture first. Gradually work your way down, removing one consecutive drawer after the next, until you finally reach and remove the bottom drawer.


Stabilizer screws are generally used on drawers that are expected to hold plenty of heavy materials, so it's extremely important that you remove the drawers in the proper order. Removing the lower drawers first would cause the piece to become too top-heavy, encouraging it to wobble or tip over as a result.

, Extend the drawer out as far as it naturally goes before reaching its built-in stopping point.


Stand in front of the drawer. Keep enough space in between your body and the drawer for the drawer to fully extend into.
You'll need to pull the drawer out using the front handle or by placing your hands on either side of the drawer front. Keep your fingers away from the metal tracks on the side of the drawer.

, Locate the two stabilizer screws on the inside of the drawer body. Remove both screws using the appropriate screwdriver.Note that most drawers of this variety use #8 screws that will need to be removed with a Phillips screwdriver.

, Locate the catch-and-release tabs on both sides of the drawer. Simultaneously pull upward on both catch mechanisms to release the drawer from the two side tracks.


You'll likely need to pinch the catch between your index finger and thumb to maneuver it.

, Continue pulling the drawer outward, keeping it as straight as possible, until it completely lifts away from the piece of furniture.


Brace yourself when removing the drawer. Regardless of whether it's full or empty, the drawer will likely be heavy.
Check the right interior lip of each drawer you remove for a number decal. These decals indicate which drawer belongs in which cavity, which you'll need to know when you return the drawers to the piece. The top drawer is usually labeled with the number ""1.""

, Before working with the piece further, push in the center stabilizer track and both side suspension tracks. Push using a straight motion that runs parallel to the tracks.

"

Work from top to bottom.,
Extend the drawer.,
Unscrew the cable.,
Press the disconnect tabs.,
Pull the drawer straight out.,
Push both metal tracks back into the piece.",How to Remove Drawers5," When removing multiple drawers from one piece of furniture, you should start at the top of the piece and gradually work your way down to the bottom drawer.


By removing the top drawers first, you can prevent the piece of furniture from becoming too top-heavy. If the piece were to become top-heavy, it would wobble and may even tip over as you work with the remaining drawers.

, Pull the drawer straight out of the piece, stopping only once the drawer resists and refuses to extend out further.


Position yourself in front of the piece of furniture. Make sure that there's enough space in between you and the drawer for the drawer to extend out fully.
Pull the drawer out by lifting the front handle toward you. If necessary, grab the front face of the drawer from the bottom to help extend it further out. Keep your fingers away from the metal tracks while the drawer is in motion, though.

, Locate the cable attached to the exterior back sides of the drawer. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws holding that cable in place.The anti-tip cable is a safety feature that prevents more than one drawer from being opened at the same time.
On the top and bottom drawers, the cable will be threaded to special inserts at the rear of the drawer.
On the middle drawers, the cable will be threaded through eyelets on the rear center of each drawer and the back panel.
Note that you'll typically need to use a Phillips screwdriver to detach the cable from each drawer.

, Look toward the back of both the left and right metal tracks. You should be able to find a disconnect tab in the center of each one. Press inward on both disconnect tabs at the same time.


Make sure that both tabs are completely depressed. For most drawers, these tabs will not lock into place after pressing them down, so you'll need to continue holding them down until after you've completely removed the drawer.

, Continue pulling the drawer forward, tilting it slightly upward at the same time. You should be able to completely remove it from the piece of furniture.


Note that the drawer will likely be very heavy, regardless of whether it's full or not. Prepare yourself accordingly.
In many cases, you'll need to return each drawer to the same cavity when re-assembling the piece. Many of these drawers will be labeled with number decals to assist in that process, and the top drawer is usually labeled with the number ""1.""

, If the metal tracks continue sticking out of the front after you've removed the drawer, you should push them straight back into the piece of furniture before working with it further.

Organize your closet.,

Organize anything else you have, such as your bedside table(s) and your bookshelf.",How to Make Your Room a Place to Be Proud of2," Usually the most unorganized place in the room is the closet. Take everything out, try it on if you're not sure it will fit, and put everything away in an organized fashion. Donate anything that doesn't fit or you don't wear anymore.

, All the shelves, drawers, everything. Take everything out, throw out old papers, donate or sell old books. Then put everything back. Make sure you know what's in each drawer, if you want you could label them.

, If you don't have one, you can skip this part. Do the same thing you did for the closet- take everything out, try on as necessary, and put everything away.

, Just organize them in a way that makes sense to you-everybody has a different way that works for them.

If it's OK with your parents or whoever owns your room, you can go ahead and paint your room a different color.,
Decorate!",How to Make Your Room a Place to Be Proud of3," It is their house though, so make sure to ask first. Before you do any painting, make sure you really like the color.  You could buy a sample, paint a posterboard, and hang it on your wall to leave there for a few days, just to be sure you like it before you make any commitments.

, Only you know your style. If you don't have a ton of money to spend, check out garage sales or thrift shops. Usually they can have some nice stuff for a lot less money then it would be to buy it new.

Transfer your clean clothes to the dryer.,
Add static-reducing balls to the dryer.,
Run your dryer.,
Make a scented vinegar.,
Create a DIY fabric softener.,
Make your own scented dryer sheets.",How to Naturally Soften Laundry," This method works particularly well for natural fibers like cotton, but you do need to soak the clothes for several days. To soften clothes with a salt soak:Fill a large bucket or laundry sink with lukewarm water. Add ½ cup (150 g) of salt per quart (946 ml) of water. Stir the mixture.
Add the clothes, sheets, or towels that you want to soften to the bucket and press them down to saturate them with the salt water.
Set the bucket aside and soak the laundry for two to three days.
You can skip this step if you don’t have two days to pre-soak your laundry. Instead, move on to washing and drying the laundry using the other natural fabric softening methods.;
, When you're ready to wash your load of laundry, add your regular detergent to the machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sprinkle in ¼ to 1 cup (55 to 220 g) of baking soda to the drum as well.


Use ¼ (55 g) of baking soda for small loads, ½ cup (110 g) for medium loads, and a full cup (220 g) for large loads.
Baking soda acts as a water softener, so it will help to soften your laundry as well. It’s also a deodorizer, and will kill smells and odors in your laundry., Remove the clothes from the salt water bath and gently wring them out to remove excess water. Transfer the load of clothes to the washing machine.


If you skipped the soaking method, simply place your load of dry clothes into the washer.
Check the tags on your laundry items to make sure it’s safe to put them in the washing machine, and take note of any special care instructions.

, Normal fabric softeners are incorporated into the wash during the rinse cycle, and you can use a softening alternative for your wash to get the same effects as a commercial product. Either add the softening alternative to the fabric softener compartment, or fill a fabric softener ball and add it to the drum. Good fabric softener alternatives include:


¼ to ½ cup (59 to 119 ml) of white vinegar (which will also help reduce stiffness if you line-dry your clothes)¼ to ½ cup (102 to 205 g) of borax, Set your washing machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and according to the garment care labels on your clothes. Use the right temperature, wash and soil settings, and load size based on the load and the type of clothes.


For instance, if you're washing delicate items, be sure to select the Delicate or Hand Wash setting.
Make sure you select the fabric softener setting if your machine has one, otherwise it won’t incorporate your softening alternative into the wash.

, When your washing machine has gone through its full wash, rinse, and spin cycles and come to a stop, remove the clothes from the drum and transfer them to the dryer.


To help reduce the time your clothes will need in the dryer, you can run a second spin cycle on the washing machine before transferring your clothes., While these balls won’t necessarily make your clothes softer, they will make them less clingy, less likely to cause shocks, and more comfortable to wear. You can either put two to three wool dryer balls in with your load of laundry, or you can make aluminum foil balls.To make an aluminum foil ball for the dryer, measure out about 3 feet (91 cm) of aluminum foil from a roll.Scrunch the aluminum foil into a small sphere with a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 8-cm) diameter.
Pack the foil ball as tightly as possible to make it smoother.
Add two to three balls to the dryer with each load of laundry.
Aluminum foil balls can still have jagged edges, so you may want to avoid using them with delicate fabrics.

, Select the dryer settings according to your load of laundry and the manufacturer’s instructions. Be mindful of heat settings, as some fabrics (such as cotton) can shrink in the dryer if the temperature is too high.


If you're using a time dryer setting and ran your laundry through a second spin cycle, be sure to shorten the timer accordingly.
You can also use a moisture sensing setting instead, which will automatically stop the dryer when the clothes are dry.

, Instead of adding plain vinegar to your rinse cycle to soften your clothes, you can make a scented vinegar that will add some extra freshness to your laundry.


To make a scented vinegar, add about 40 drops of essential oils to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of white vinegar.Store the mixture in a clearly marked container so that you don’t use the vinegar for cooking by accident.
Popular essential oils for laundry include lemon, orange, lavender, and mint.
You can also make essential oil combinations to customize the smell of your laundry. For instance, you can combine mint oil and a citrus oil, or lavender oil with another floral oil.

, Instead of adding baking soda and another softening alternative separately to your laundry, you can also make your own homemade fabric softener to use in place of those two ingredients.


To make a homemade fabric softener, combine the Epsom or sea salt and essential oils and stir until fully combined. Then stir in the baking soda.
Store the mixture in a jar with a tight-fitting lid.
To use, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of homemade fabric softener per load of laundry. Add the mixture to the fabric softener compartment on your machine, or to a fabric softener ball., To add even more fresh scent to your laundry, you can also make your own scented dryer sheets. While these won’t soften your laundry the way commercial dryer sheets do, they will infuse your laundry with wonderful smells. To make homemade dryer sheets:Cut four or five 4-inch (10-cm) squares from an old cotton or flannel shirt, towel, or blanket
Place the sheets of fabric into a bowl or jar
Add 20 to 30 drops of your favorite essential oils
Let the sheets rest for about two days, until the oil has soaked into the fabric and then dried out
Add one sheet to each dryer cycle
Wash the sheets and repeat when they begin to lose their scent

Let it stand for 5-10 minutes before rinsing with water.The vinegar's smell will dissipate shortly after it has been dried away, so be careful to dry the surfaces thoroughly with a cloth after using the vinegar.

, Baking soda also works well alone as a degreaser. To make it into a usable form, mix it with water to form a paste. Depending on how strong you want the mixture to be, you can add up to 5 parts water to 1 part baking soda, although adding less water will give you a thicker, more potent paste. After applying the baking soda paste with a cloth, rinse the surface with water to avoid leaving a granular residue.


This natural degreaser cannot be easily applied using a spray bottle, as the baking soda may clog the spray mechanism. It works better when you smear it onto the surface directly.

, Another option for a homemade natural degreaser can be prepared easily in an empty dish soap bottle. Fill the bottle about halfway with ammonia and fill the remaining portion with hot water. Add a few drops of natural castille soap. Cap the bottle and shake it well. The solution can be squirted directly onto the greasy surfaces from the bottle, or it can be applied with a cloth.

, Pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water into a large bucket. To the water, add a cup (240 ml) of ammonia, half a cup (120 ml) of vinegar, and a quarter cup (60 ml) of baking soda.

You shouldn’t apply heat to the carpet. Just make sure no one walks on it in that area until it dries naturally.
If the stain is a tough one or more deeply ingrained, you may need to leave the vinegar and water mixture on the stain for a few minutes before rubbing it away.

, After you're done with using the water-and-vinegar mixture, try using a steam iron to remove the stain faster.


Put a towel over the carpet on top of the water stain. Don't apply the iron directly to the carpet or you could burn the carpet.

, It's important to know what material the carpet is made from so that you can choose the correct cleaning solution and application method.


Check on the underside of area rugs for a label. The label should list the carpet material.
Contact the manufacturer if you need to find out from which material wall-to-wall carpeting is made.

, You will need 3 to 4 white cloths or a roll of non-patterned paper towels, a gentle non-bleach detergent, lukewarm water, 2 to 3 bowls, 2 spray bottles, white vinegar, and a heavy, flat-bottomed object you can use as a weight.

,


Mix together 1/4 tsp. (1.23 ml) detergent, such as a dishwashing liquid, with 32 oz. (.94 L) lukewarm water in bowl or measuring cup if the soda spill is fresh. Use only 8 oz. (.24 L) water if it is a set in soda stain.

,


Add white vinegar and water to a bowl in a 1 to 2 ratio.

,


Dab a little of the detergent and vinegar solutions on an inconspicuous area of the carpet.
Wait until the solution dries and then check to make sure there is no stain or lightening of the carpet.

,,,,,,, Place a heavy, flat bottomed object like a glass cooking dish on top of the cloth/paper towel. The vinegar solution will help remove the detergent from the carpet.

,, Start blotting at the outside of the wet area and work inwards until the spot is dry.

, Repeat the process if the stain is still visible.

,;
,,, Use another dry cloth or paper towel to blot the area where you sprayed the solution.

,, You may need to allow the area to dry between applications to make sure the stain is still there.

Pour a thick layer of salt over the soot stain on the carpet.,
Leave for five minutes.

,
Sweep the salt and soot up together.",How to Remove Soot from Carpets,";
,, Do this very carefully so as not to spread the stain any further. Use as coarse a brush as the carpet can stand to help pick up the particles.

"
"
Blot up the spilled wine right away.,
Apply some cold water and keep blotting.",How to Remove Red Wine from Carpet1," The longer you let red wine sit in your carpet, the harder it will be to get rid of the stain. Do yourself a big favor by acting fast! As soon as you notice the spill, grab a paper towel or rag and blot the stain to pick up as much liquid as possible before it can set.


Always use an up-and-down blotting motion, not a side-to-side rubbing one. Rubbing will pick up some of the wine but force the rest deeper into the carpet fibers, making it much harder to remove the stain.This can also make the stained area from the wine even larger by spreading the liquid to the sides.
Work from the outside in, blotting the edges first and then moving to the center. This helps prevent the stain from getting any larger than it already is.

, Eventually, it will get difficult to blot more of the wine out. At this point, try getting the stain wet again with a small amount of cold water. This helps dilute the wine remaining in the carpet. Continue blotting (not rubbing) until the carpet is dry again.








"
"
Pour salt over the stain while it's still wet.,
Let the salt sit.,
Discard the excess salt and vacuum up the carpet.",How to Remove Red Wine from Carpet2," A good dabbing job will take most of the wine out of the carpet, but usually not all of it. To help get the rest out, try covering the stained spot with a generous portion of salt. The salt granules will gradually draw the moisture in the stain out of the carpet over the next few hours.








Since the salt works by absorbing the stain's moisture, this is much less effective for dried stains. If your stain is getting dry, pour a little water on it first before adding the salt.;
, As it absorbs the wine, the salt will gradually turn pinkish. You're ready to proceed when the stain seems almost completely dry. However, longer treatments aren't going to make things worse, so if you have time to spare, feel free to let the salt sit overnight.








, Scoop away the loose salt with a spoon and throw it out. Use a vacuum to suck up the fine particles that remain and get your carpet looking brand-new again. The stain should be gone or at least greatly diminished.









If a salty residue remains after the first vacuuming, just dampen the area with a little cool water and vacuum again to restore its natural texture.

"
"
Make your cleaning solution.,
Wet the stain with the mixture.,
Wet the whole stain with cold water.",How to Remove Red Wine from Carpet3," In a large bowl, mix 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of dishwashing liquid, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, and 2 cups (236 milliliters) of warm water.Stir to combine the three ingredients.









Only use white vinegar for this method. Other vinegars (like apple cider or balsamic vinegar) can cause their own stains.

, Soak a clean rag in the vinegar mixture, then dab it on to the stained part of the carpet. The mixture will seep into the carpet fibers, loosening the stain.









Use a second dry rag to blot up the liquid as you go. Alternate between dabbing on the vinegar solution and drying it up.

, Now, soak a third rag in cold water and press it into to stain to dilute the wine. Alternatively, pour a little water directly onto the stain. Soak up the water by dabbing with your ""drying"" towel once again.









Repeat as needed. For maximum effectiveness, you may need to run through the steps above several times. Alternatively, you can follow this method with one of the other tricks in this article.

"
"
Mix a little dish soap with hydrogen peroxide.,
Blot the stain with the solution.,
Spray with cold soapy water.,
Blot with lukewarm water to rinse.",How to Remove Red Wine from Carpet4," Add a generous squirt of soap to the peroxide and stir to combine. The exact amount you need will depend on the size of your stain, but you shouldn't need much more than a half cup (118 milliliters) or so for any stain.










Note: Hydrogen peroxide is a mild bleaching agent, so this method is best for light-colored fabrics.If you're worried about discoloring your fabric, try putting a small amount of the solution on part of the carpet that can't be seen. If the carpet lightens or you notice dye transfer when you sop up the peroxide with a paper towel, avoid this method.Lower concentrations of peroxide (like 3%) shouldn't affect most carpets., Soak the corner of a clean rag in your peroxide solution. Dab the stain gently, allowing the mixture to seep into the carpet fibers. Repeat as needed until you've applied the solution to the entire stain. As always, don't rub — blot.









When you're done, let the mixture sit for a few minutes. This allows it to penetrate the deeper fibers and reach deep stains.

, Fill a clean spray bottle with cold water, then add a few drops of standard dish soap. Screw on the cap and shake to combine. Give the entire stain a light spritzing. Blot with a dry towel when you are done.









If you don't have a spray bottle, you can repeat the blotting technique above with a fresh towel.

, By now, the stain should be looking better. However, if you stop, you'll be left with a soapy, sticky residue from the cleaning solution. Soak a clean rag in room-temperature water (no soap), then blot the carpet to loosen up the cleaning materials. Finish by blotting with a dry towel.








"
"
Pour a little white wine onto the stain.,
Blot the stain with a sponge.,
Apply a baking soda paste.,
Cover the stain with a clean cloth overnight.,
Vacuum up the baking soda once it dries.",How to Remove Red Wine from Carpet5," It may seem like the last thing you want to do is to pour more wine on your carpet, but clear-colored white wine can actually be a lifesaver if you don't have water handy. White wine dilutes the color of the red stain much like water, lessening the impact of the stain.









Some sources recommend clear, plain vodka if you don't have white wine.Try to avoid moscato and sweet dessert wines, which can leave a sticky, sugary mess.

, As long as you do it lightly enough, this will soak up some of the color without pressing the stain into the carpet fibers.









If your sponge is already wet, wring it out before using it.

, Baking soda can remove a ""loosened-up"" stain similar to the way salt's used in the section above. Instead of using dry baking soda, most sources recommend making a watery paste, then spreading it generously over the stain. Three parts water to one part baking soda should work well.







, Set a heavy weight (like a dictionary) on top of the cloth while it sits. This constant, gentle pressure pushes the baking soda down into the stain so that it can clean more deeply.









The cloth you use will get a little damp, so you may not want to use a weight that's vulnerable to water damage.

, The baking soda should soak up the moisture from the stained area and form solid clumps on the surface. You can easily remove these clumps (and with them, the stain) using a vacuum.









As with the salt method above, if your carpet still has a powdery residue after the first vacuuming, pour a little cold water on it to dissolve the baking soda, then vacuum again.

Separate the shower curtain and the shower curtain liner.,
Set your washing machine for a small to medium sized load with cold water.,
Let the washer start filling up and pour in about a cup of vinegar.,
Add as much soap as you deem appropriate.,
Do not use fabric softener on your liner.,
Choose a gentle, regular cycle.,
Once washed, hang it right back up to dry.",How to Wash Your Shower Curtain Liner1," You can wash them both the same way, but, depending on what the actual shower curtain is, that could change. You might want to add something to the soap, or wash at a different temperature, for a cloth curtain as opposed to the plastic-y liners. It is ok, however, to wash them together if they are the same material.






;
, No need to waste water or electricity. Furthermore, cold water is better for the materials in the long term, as hot water can cause some melting and issues. Place the liner in the wash.








, You can pour this right where the soap is supposed to go.








, A half-portion of your normal soap amount should be fine, as this is about half the size (or less) of a normal load of laundry.








, The liner is not fabric -- it is plastic. The softener will do nothing but give a strange, chemically smell to your liner.








, Because the liner is the only thing in the wash, you could choose a shortened cycle if you have the option. Otherwise, just let the washing machine do its job.








, You must, however, be prepared for the dripping water. Do not put the liner in the dryer to heat dry it. While you could stick it in the drier for a few minutes on cool to shake off excess water, be careful. Hot air can melt the liner and ruin both it and your dryer.

Remove the shower curtain liner and throw it in the wash to remove surface stains.,
Add a towel to the load.,
Run the wash, adding a little vinegar or soap to kill bacteria.,
Hang back up on the shower rod to dry everything off.",How to Wash Your Shower Curtain Liner2," Simply take it off, remove the big plastic cuffs, and put it in the washing machine. This method is more for surface stains, not removing mold.








, This will be used to ""scrub"" your liner. Again, this method is more to wipe up surface stains than do a deep cleaning.








, You won't need nearly as much as needed for a full load. A cup of white vinegar or a 1/3 cup of detergent should do.








, You can put it in the dryer, too, but only on cold and only for 4-5 minutes to get the big bits of water off.

Disinfect with water and alcohol.",How to Take Care of Granite Countertops," Most granite countertops do not require a sealant, but they may benefit from a quality sealer product. The sealant will give your countertops extra protection against spills by making a moisture-resistant surface even more moisture resistant.Make sure your surface is not already sealed. If your countertops are a part of a newly built home, the builder probably already sealed them.;
, The sealer product should last ten to fifteen years and be oleophobic (resistant to water and oil or fat based stains). Find one that will penetrate the granite to seal any grooves or spaces in the stone, instead of sitting on the surface. Do not use lower-priced, lower-quality sealants that are less than ten dollars., Make sure your work area is well ventilated before you seal the countertop. Open windows, doors, and turn a fan on.

, Wipe the granite down with a damp, soft cloth and a bit of dish soap, or multipurpose cleaner. Dry the surface with a dry, soft cloth and buff it as much as you can. If you don't know your countertop's history, like if it's used, consider using a commercial degreaser product first.

, Your countertops must be bone dry, before you apply a sealant. Let them sit for 24 hours after you wipe them down and clean them. Use a fan to cut down on the drying time. The colors in granite should look less deep after it’s completely dry.

, After you purchase a high-quality sealant, make sure you follow their directions. Every manufacturer will have slightly different instructions for sealing the surface of granite.

, Spread the sealer over the counter top with a paper towel, foam brush or rag. Allow the sealer to penetrate 5 to 10 minutes; if the sealer is completely absorbed in 5 minutes, add more. After 5 to 10 minutes, blot any remaining sealer.

, Use a clean, dry terry cloth to buff the sealer left on the surface off. Wipe the stone using small, circular motions. Use a cordless, orbital buffer if you have one and want to get the job done quicker.

, Don’t use harsh cleansers or scrubbers. While granite is very durable, acidic cleansers and sponges that can scratch will wear down a sealant. Use ph neutral soap to clean your countertops and steer clear of windex or vinegar. Stone cleaner works as well as simple dish soap., Keeping the surface free of dirt and grime will help preserve granite. Clean your countertop regularly with warm water and a few drops of dish or antibacterial detergent using a soft cloth. Rinse the surface thoroughly with clean water and dry with a soft cloth.

, If you spill something on the surface, blot with a paper towel or soft cloth right away. Do not wipe spilled liquids, like juice or milk, because this can spread them around your countertop.

, Granite countertops and properly sealed stone will repel most stains if the spills are cleaned promptly. Use a dry, dishcloth to dry your granite after any spills, so moisture does not seep into the pores of the stone.

, Hot cooking pots will not damage the surface and granite can withstand high temperatures, but extreme or constant temperature changes can harm your stone. For instance, avoid leaving hot pans sitting on granite in a chilly room., Protect your granite from moisture absorption by using coasters under anything filled with liquid. Be especially careful with dark colored liquids, like red wine or juice., If your granite countertops are properly sealed and maintained, you only need to wipe them down thoroughly with water, a rag and a gentle cleaner.

, If you spill oil-based liquids on your granite, like milk or grease, you may need to remove some stains. Make a paste out of baking soda and water, slather it on the oil marks, cover it and let it sit for several hours or overnight. , Coffee, juice and wine may leave marks if it’s not cleaned up immediately and penetrates the stone. Add just enough hydrogen peroxide to baking soda to make a paste. Apply it to any water-based stains or marks, cover it and let it sit overnight.

, Granite naturally repels bacteria, but if you want to disinfect your countertops more than what soap and water can, use water and 91% isopropyl alcohol. Mix the solution up with a 50/50 ratio, spray it on the countertops, and let it sit for three to five minutes. Rinse with water and dry with a soft dishcloth.

Press the basket into the sink.,
Thread on the gaskets and nut.,
Scrape out excess putty, tighten further, and repeat.,
Reattach the tailpiece with new gaskets.,
Assemble the rest of the plumbing.",How to Replace a Sink Basket Strainer," Unscrew the T-junction or pipe segment closest to the sink and set it aside. Leave the water trap (U-bend) in place to keep sewer gases at bay.;
, Approach the basket strainer from below and unscrew the lowest nut. This should free the flanged tailpiece (a straight, collared tube) and top hat gasket (a small circle with a flat rim). Set these parts aside.

, There's one more large nut for you to unscrew. Remove this and you'll have complete access to the basket strainer.

, Once the nut is removed, several smaller gaskets and washers will fall down or hang loose around the basket strainer. Your replacement basket strainer should include replacement parts for these, so you can safely discard them. Remove the old basket itself as well, lifting it out from the top of the sink.

, Scrub the top and bottom of the sink around the empty hole using a clean, soapy sponge or cloth. It is vital to get the area as clean as possible so the plumber's putty can form a good bond. Dry thoroughly once finished.


If there's old sealant or other gunk in this area, scrape it off with a putty knife. Serious buildup may require paint thinner or another solvent. Always follow the product's safety label instructions when using solvents., It's possible your leaky sink was caused by a puncture in the basin, rather than the basket strainer. Inspect the sink carefully, especially next to the hole where the old strainer may have obscured a puncture. A large hole or network of cracks may require a full sink replacement, but you can repair small holes as follows:


Stainless steel sink: Sand the surface around the hole and wipe with an ammonia-based cleaner. Mix, apply, and let cure a two-part stainless steel epoxy according to label instructions.Ceramic sink: Drill any small cracks to create a rough surface. Fill completely with waterproof ceramic putty. Let dry according to label instructions, smoothing it out with a little water just before it dries completely.These repairs may not last forever, but they can last years if properly applied over minor damage.

, Your basket strainer most likely comes with all the parts threaded on. Unscrew the nut and set aside everything but the basket itself. Note the order these parts were threaded.


There may be minor variations for your model of strainer, but they should be easy to figure out. For example, your strainer may have two screws on the underside.
You don't need to do any measurements to choose your new strainer. At least in the United States, all basket strainers and sink drains are manufactured to the same size., Plumbers can have strong opinions on this topic, but plumber's putty is generally a good default choice. However, putty can weaken plastic sinks and stain stone or other porous materials. If your sink is made from one of these substances, use silicone sealant instead.If using silicone sealant, load it into a caulk gun and apply a small bead to the underside of the basket rim. This is a very strong bond, so expect your next replacement to require some force.
If using putty, continue reading below for detailed instructions.
You can also buy ""stainless putty"" which is designed to be used on porous materials without staining them.

, If you are going with putty, make sure your hands (or gloves), putty knife, and work surfaces are bone dry and absolutely clean, as moisture or dirt will make the bond less effective. Roll out a piece of putty into a snake shape, long enough to fit around the new basket. Start with a lump about the size of a golf ball.If the putty is hard and difficult to work with, warm your hands on a heat source, then use your warm hands to soften the putty., Coil it beneath the rim and use your thumbs to flatten it evenly against the surface. Use just enough putty to cover the underside of the rim completely. Apply too much, and you won't be able to push your basket flush with the sink., Use moderate pressure to squeeze the basket down into the sink drain, pressing a little putty out the sides.

, Return to the underside of the sink. Slide on the rubber gasket, cardboard gasket, and nut that came with your basket strainer assembly. Screw in the nut with moderate pressure using a wrench.


The flat rim of the basket nut should be on top as you screw it in.

, When you screwed in the basket nut, some of the putty squeezed out into the sink basin. Use a putty knife to scrape away every scrap of this excess putty, and throw it away. For good measure, tighten the nut further and scrape out the additional putty that emerges. Clean the basin with a rag to remove the last flecks.


Avoid extreme force when tightening the nut, or you may break it.

, Slide a new top hat gasket onto the tailpiece, followed by a new beveled gasket. Thread the tailpiece back onto the basket strainer.

, Put back the pipe you removed and reattach it at all points. It may be easiest to attach all points loosely at first, then cycle through them tightening in small increments.


If you need to remove the water trap (U-bend) to fit the piece back in, take care not to spill the water on yourself. If you dump out the water, run the sink to make another water seal, blocking sewer gas. (If your plumber's putty label specifies a dry curing time, stuff a rag in the water trap until you can use the sink.)

Don’t leave coffee in the pot for extended periods.,
Rinse the pot when you're finished with it.,
Wipe up drips immediately.,
Clean the pot daily.",How to Remove Coffee Stains from a Stainless Steel Pot," There are a few different products you can use to remove stains from your coffee pot. Whichever one you choose, simply pour the cleaner into the bottom of the pot. Don’t use bleach, as it can corrode the metal.Ideal cleaners to use include:½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar and ⅛ cup (38 g) of coarse salt
½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar and ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda
½ cup (118 ml) of hydrogen peroxide and ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda
½ cup (110 g) of baking soda
Four denture cleaning tablets (these are designed to dissolve food particles and stains)
2 tablespoons (30 ml) of liquid dishwasher detergent or powdered detergent
One dishwasher detergent pod;
, Fill a kettle with water from the tap. Turn on the kettle and boil the water. When the water is boiling, add enough water to the pot to fill it. The boiling water will mix with the cleaning solution and help lift the stain from the metal., Coffee stains on the inside of the coffee pot are most common, but it’s also possible to get stains on the outside of the pot. To clean these, place a tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda into a small bowl. Add boiling water a few drops at a time until you have a smooth paste. Use the tip of a butter knife to apply the paste to any stains on the outside of the pot., Set the coffee pot aside somewhere safe where there's no risk of somebody knocking it over or spilling the water inside. In the sink is a good place. Let the cleaning solution inside and the baking soda paste soak for 30 minutes.Letting the cleaning solution and paste soak will give them time to attack the stain, which will make it easier to scrub away.

, After 30 minutes of soaking, it’s time to scrub away the stains. Put on a pair of kitchen gloves to protect your hands from the hot water. Use a cloth, brush, or non-abrasive scrubber to scrub away coffee stains on the inside and outside of the pot., Pour out the dirty cleaning water from the coffee pot. Rinse the inside and outside with fresh water to remove excess cleaner. When the pot has been rinsed, inspect the inside and outside to ensure that all the stains are gone.If there are any stains left, try a different cleaning solution. Add the cleaner of your choice to the pot, fill it with boiling water, and let it sit for another 30 minutes before scrubbing and rinsing.

, Pour a teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid dish soap into the coffee pot. Fill the pot the rest of the way with hot water from the tap. Use a clean cloth or brush to scrub the inside and outside of the pot with the soapy water.This is an important step in the cleaning process because it will remove any leftover traces of the original cleaning solution, which could give your coffee a funny flavor.

, When the stain is gone and the coffee pot has been cleaned, rinse the pot thoroughly with warm running water. Once all the traces of soap have been rinse away, use a clean lint-free cloth to dry the coffee pot.


Drying the pot with a towel instead of letting it air dry will help prevent water marks and mineral deposits from forming on the metal., Coffee contains oils, and it’s these oils that can stain your pot, especially if you leave coffee sitting in the pot for extended periods.To prevent stains from forming, don’t leave coffee sitting in the pot for more than 30 minutes.


This is especially important if there's only a small amount of coffee left in the pot, because the burner can make the coffee evaporate faster, and this will leave baked-on stains in the bottom of the pot.
To avoid having leftover coffee in the pot, make only enough coffee to serve each person one to two cups at a time.

, Trace amounts of coffee left in the bottom of the pot can dry and bake on, and this will leave those annoying and hard-to-clean stains in the bottom of the pot. As soon as the coffee pot is empty, rinse it out with hot water to remove leftover coffee traces.


Rinse the inside and outside of the pot so that spilled drips don’t stain the exterior of the pot.

, When you pour a coffee, there are often a few dribbles that spill down the side of the spout and onto the outside and bottom of the coffee pot. Over time, these can cause stains if they aren't addressed immediately. To prevent stains on the outside and exterior bottom of the pot, use a damp cloth to wipe drips from the outside of the pot after you pour each cup.

, Cleaning the coffee pot every day with soap and water will help to prevent difficult stains that can build up over time. Each morning, after you've made your final cup of coffee for the day, clean the inside and outside of the pot with hot soapy water and a cloth or brush.


When the pot is clean, rinse it with clean water and towel dry it to prevent water and mineral stains.If you don’t have time to clean the pot in the morning, just rinse it out and clean it when you get home from work or school in the afternoon or evening.

, Although this approach may remove the actual food spill, it may not lift the stain. Check the manufacturer’s directions for ways to remove stains.

, For grease splatters you may need to arm yourself with additional tools (also natural).

, Loose or easy to remove debris should be lifted with ease using a washcloth or sponge and a little soap and water.

, If you don’t own a tea kettle you could fill a mug with water and microwave on high for approximately two minutes. Another alternative is to simply boil a small pot of water.


Make sure the water comes to a rolling boil before using it.

, Only a very small amount, enough to saturate and cover the spill will do the job. Don't flood the area--its not the amount of water, it's the water temperature that will loosen the debris.

Give it a good minute or so under the heat. You need to really heat up the metal. This process will cause the metal to expand. Once you let it cool, the metal will contract, and it may pop back smooth., As you probably know, dry ice is very, very cold. Because it's so cold, you may be able to get the metal to contract with it, fixing the dent.

Finishes and grime will let the glue peel right off.Cleaning it may remove the finish, so you may want to save this method for a last resort.

, You can find these online, at big box stores, or auto parts stores. These tools have small suction cups that you glue on to the dent with a hot glue gun., Heat up your hot glue gun. Pick a suction cup that is a bit bigger than the dent. Add a dab of glue to the cup, and place it on the dent.You can use any hot glue gun for this step, though a high temp gun may work better.

, The suction cup will have a screw coming off the back of it. A bar goes over it, and it has two plates on each side. Once the bar is on, add the knob that screws into the back of the suction cup. Screw it lightly into place. Don't push down too hard right now. Everything's not quite in place., Most of these tools have a way to adjust the two plates that give you leverage for pulling. Put them as close to the middle suction cup as possible. That will keep it from pulling up the metal too much on the outer edges., Now that everything's in place, all you have to do is keep screwing in the knob in the center. This process puts pressure on the suction cup, slowly pulling it out. Eventually, the whole piece will pop right off., This method will eventually lessen the ding. Unfortunately, it's not a quick process. So pull up a chair, and get comfy. You may need to repeat the process as many as ten times to make that ding less noticeable., Plan suction without glue will sometimes pull the dent out of your refrigerator. A simple suction tool is a toilet plunger. Place a (clean!) toilet plunger over the dent, and plunge away. If you're lucky, it might pop out."

Prevent future smells.",How to Remove a Fish Smell from a Refrigerator," The easiest way to clean the refrigerator thoroughly is when it’s empty. It’s also important to clean the freezer too, because the fridge and freezer share the same air, meaning the fish smell could have invaded the freezer too. To preserve the food while you work, you can:Store it in coolers with ice packs
Transfer it to a friend’s or neighbor’s fridge
Leave it outside if it’s cold enough;
, To ensure that the fish smell, or some other bad smell, doesn’t come back when the fridge is clean, locate the source of the smell and throw it out. While you're at it, throw out any food that’s gone bad, moldy, or rotten.


Smell every morsel of food in the fridge to check for fish smell as well. Items that weren't sealed and stored properly could have picked up the odor.Throw out anything that smells like fish.

, Getting rid of a fish smell in a refrigerator means some serious cleaning and airing out, and you don’t want to waste electricity while you do this. The best way to conserve electricity is to unplug your fridge once all the food is out.


Once you turn the fridge off, make sure you leave the doors open until it has completely defrosted, otherwise you could get mold.

, Fish smell could have permeated the entire fridge, and the best way to get rid of it is to clean every surface. Fridge drawers, shelves, and racks are removable, and they’ll be much easier to clean if they're out of the refrigerator.


To keep these items out of the way, place them on the counter or on top of the fridge until you're ready to tackle them., Fill a bucket with hot water. As the water is running, add about five drops of a liquid dish detergent. Swish the water around so suds form. Dip a sponge or cloth into the soap and water. Wring out the excess, and clean every inch of the interior surface of the fridge and freezer with the soap and water solution.Re-soak and wring out the sponge frequently as you clean.
When you're finished, fill a bucket with plain water. Use a clean sponge to wipe down the surfaces with the clean water.

, There are a number of cleaning solutions you can use to clean your refrigerator, and most of them are basic household cleaning products. Depending on what you have available and your preferences, you can mix in a bucket:Equal parts water and white vinegar
½ cup (118 ml) of bleach mixed with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water
Baking soda mixed with enough water to make a paste
1 quart (946 ml) of water mixed with ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda and a few drops of liquid dish detergent, Dip a sponge or cloth into your cleaning solution. Wring out the excess. Inside the fridge and freezer, wipe the sides, top, bottom, and any shelving, trays, and other surfaces. Dip the sponge back into the cleaning solution frequently to keep it saturated.When you're finished, fill a clean bucket with water. Wipe down the surfaces with plain water to remove excess cleaner.

, Use a dry microfiber cloth, rag, or towel to wipe down all the interior surfaces of the refrigerator and freezer. This will help prevent water spots from forming, and speed up the air-drying process.

, When the fridge and freezer have been thoroughly cleaned and wiped with water, leave the doors open and let them air out. You may need to tie the doors to something nearby to secure them in the open position. Air out the fridge and freezer for at least two hours, and as long as two days if you can.


When the doors are open, don’t leave children and pets unattended in the room to prevent them from getting stuck., Follow the same process for the drawers, shelves, and racks that you used for the rest of the fridge. Start by cleaning the surfaces with a soap and water mixture, and then wipe them with water. Wipe the surfaces with the disinfectant solution, followed by water. Finally, rinse the components under running water.


When you're finished, set the drawers, shelves, and racks aside to air dry. Leave them out of the fridge while it airs out.

, When the refrigerator and freezer have had sufficient time to air out, return the drawers, shelves, and racks to their original positions. Plug the appliance back in and let it cool down.


Most refrigerators will need about six hours before they're at the correct operating temperature, and up to 24 hours before they're ready for food.

, An odor absorber will help remove any traces of fish smell that may still be lingering. Place the odor absorber in the fridge as soon as you turn it back on. Close the doors and leave the odor-absorber inside for 24 hours before replacing the food. Odor-absorbers you can use include:Baking soda sprinkled on two large plates. Place one plate in the fridge and one in the freezer.
Two bowls filled with fresh coffee grounds. Place a bowl in the fridge and in the freezer.
Newspaper sheets crumpled up and stuffed into the open spaces of the fridge and freezer.
Bowls filled with lighter-fluid free charcoal. Place one bowl in the fridge and one in the freezer.

, After 24 hours, pull the odor absorber out of the refrigerator and freezer. Return the food you’ve had stored to the fridge. Once the fridge is organized, you can put a bowl or plate of baking soda or coffee grounds back into the fridge.


If you continue to use baking soda or coffee grounds as odor absorbers in the fridge, replace the odor absorber with a fresh batch every month., There are a few ways you can keep your fridge clean and odor-free, and one of the most important is to clean spills immediately. You should also use foods before they go bad, and throw out foods as soon as they start to go off. Another important element in fighting fridge odors is storing foods properly:Store leftovers in airtight containers
Transfer open foods like fish and meat to airtight containers or sealable bags
Make sure all lids are secured properly
Seal freezer bags and other bags properly before storing them

Avoid over-packaged food. In the same grocery display, you may find loose tomatoes and also tomatoes both boxed and packed in non-recyclable cellophane. The tomatoes that are loose take far less packaging, so it is a better choice for the environment.
Bring your own veggie bags. You bring your own grocery bags, so it is not so different to assign one as the vegetable bag. Some people like to have several small bags to keep things like melons from squashing the grapes.
Try to choose recyclable containers. Whenever feasible, choose packaging that can be recycled.
Buy what you need, not just because it is a good deal. There is nothing wrong with buying in bulk. But if you do not use what you buy, or it spoils, it is wasted money and resources. It may be more sensible to buy a smaller container, even if it is a bit more expensive by weight.

Make food you will eat. It is easier to reduce waste if the people in your house eat what you purchase. If your children hate the strawberry cereal, do not buy it even if it was on sale.
Buying in bulk makes a lot of sense if one has a large number of people to cook for: a large family or a backyard barbecue.
Bulk buying also makes sense if it is something shelf-stable. Salt, sugar, flour, vinegar and so on will last a long time, so unlikely to actually go to waste.
Try buying meat in bulk packaging. You will have to put in a little effort and time! For example: a 10 pound bulk pack of ground beef is easily turned into 10 1-pound packages of ground beef with some baggies and about 15 minutes.The 1 pound bags are easier to use and you use and defrost as you go. A big whole package could take forever to work through, increasing the possibility that you will have waste.

;
, Kitchens tend to produce a lot of grey water (which is defined as all the waste water from houses and offices except for that from toilets) and most of this can be reused, thus conserving water. For our purposes, we are going to divide kitchen grey water into two subcategories: ""clean"" (such as the water that is left over from boiling vegetables or pasta) and ""dirty"" (such as the water used to wash vegetables).


Dirty grey water can be used for:

Washing other vegetables or dishes
Cleaning counters/floors
Adding to swimming pools
Watering plants


Clean grey water can be used for all of those things plus:

Boiling vegetables/pastas
Drinking- although it may have an unusual taste depending on what it was used for



, The typical method of scrubbing fruits and vegetables under a running faucet uses much more water than filling a pot or large bowl with water and scrubbing it in there. This is especially useful (and much easier) when you are washing something like blueberries or grapes, and there are a lot of tiny objects, since you can dump them all in and rub them around.

, Try to use what you have before buying more food, or incorporate what you need to use up in your food planning. Squeezing one more meal out of your pantry and refrigerator reduces waste, saves money, and sometimes inspires new meals!


Try using Google.com to find recipes using ingredients you have. For instance, if you are looking for a meal using spinach and chicken, use the keywords ""chicken"", ""spinach"" and ""recipe"".
Some meals are time-tested to use up leftovers and odd bits of foods, such as pizza, meatloaf, pasta dishes, and stir-fry.

, Contrary to common belief, the dates on food products are not typically government-mandated or regulated. ""Use by"" dates usually just relate to taste and texture.Your cereal just does not suddenly goes bad at midnight on January 23rd.This means that often products can be used after that date has passed. Use smell, sight, and your good judgement to decide if something is edible--you can usually tell if the milk has gone bad. However, some guidelines in eating ""expired"" food:


Opened cans, jars, and bottles will remain relatively safe a long period of time. However, once opened the quality will deteriorate.
Never eat from a can that looks ""inflated""...this is a sign botulism may have crept in.
Throw out food that is more than a year out of date. A few things, like salt or honey can remain almost indefinitely edible. However, there are a lot of variables: how it was stored, the moisture content, preservatives, and so on.
But remember: food poisoning is a real danger, and after a certain point, eating a can of 2 year old pork and beans is not worth your health!

, Leftovers make a great lunch, and can mean you do not have to cook the next day if you have enough left! You could even have one day a week, like Leftover Friday, where for dinner you eat the leftovers from the week's meals.

, Vegetable stock, chicken stock, and other kinds of stock are all a great reuse of stuff that would be otherwise thrown away. Chicken stock is made by boiling the bones, and vegetable stock can be made from any of the odds and ends of vegetables you have in the house- celery leaves, parsley stems, broccoli stems, the last of that huge bag of carrots you bought, etc. You just have to make sure a good variety is used (or it will end up tasting like just the one vegetable.) You can even make it in the grey water that you get when you boil the vegetables to eat!

, Can that salad become burger fixings? Can those leftover vegetables from the stuffed peppers be made into vegetable broth? Can the vegetables from the broth be made into omelette filling, or chicken soup?

, Raspberries go bad faster than apples, and the leftovers from Monday will probably spoil before the leftovers from Wednesday.

, If you can freeze it, many items last longer— and almost anything can be frozen. This is particularly good if you are going away and need to empty the fridge, and it often means you have an easy meal some day you're too busy to cook! Even some things you may not have thought of can be frozen!


Bread
Spaghetti sauce
Soups and stews
Almost any prepared food that needs to go in the oven, before you put it in the oven (like unbaked chicken Parmesan, or baked pasta dishes)

, Oil needs to be disposed of in a container- why not the cream cheese container? Need to send your kid on a field trip with an all-disposable lunch? Pack the sandwich in the Cool Whip container! If you do not have a use for it, recycle it! You can keep a recycling bin next to your garbage can, or under the sink to make recycling easy.

, Look into what your local food pantries accept, and every once in a while go through your kitchen and take things to them. There are even some charities that do things like collect Halloween candy to give to underprivileged kids in the winter holidays. Great things to donate are things you don't really eat, or things that you know will go bad before you would get around to eating them, but could be eaten by other people. And maybe you're thinking that there shouldn't be food in your house that you don't eat, but it often happens, like:


The buy-one-get-one free sale on a product you rarely use.
The product that you thought you liked but decided you don't.
The thing you bought for a party that no one ever opened.
The thing that your child developed an allergy to.

, Bring home your leftovers, and if you can remember to, bring your own reusable containers to use instead of their Styrofoam or plastic ones.

, Composting is an excellent way to keep solids out of the waste stream, and make sure that inedible or unwanted food is not wasted.


Consider investing in a composter if you are a gardener. Compost can help old food become new food.
Many municipalities collect composting materials. Not all have curbside pick-up, but many have it at recycling or transfer centers.

Place the curtain in the washing machine with a load of towels.,
Choose a warm water setting.,
Hang the shower curtain over your bathtub.,
Allow the curtain to dry.",How to Remove Fold Marks from Vinyl Shower Curtains1," Another easy way to get out fold from a vinyl shower curtain is to place it in your washing machine with a load of towels. The heat and water in the machine will help to massage out the folds in the vinyl, with little manpower or work on your end.





;
, Select the gentle cycle and turn on the washing machine. You will then need to watch the machine until it hits the rinse cycle. Once the machine hits the rinse cycle, remove the curtain from the washing machine.It will be dripping wet at this point, but that’s okay as you are going to let it dry over your bathtub.

, Take the dripping shower curtain and gently hang it up over your bathtub using the shower curtain rings. Make sure the bottom of the shower curtain is inside the bathtub, not on the outside, so the dripping water will go into the tub.







, Once you have hung up the shower curtain, let it dry overnight. The weight of the dripping water as well as the exposure to air should flatten out any folds in the curtain."

Lay the curtain on a flat surface.,
Set the hair dryer to the low heat setting.,
Hold the hair dryer or iron ½ - 1 inch from the curtain.,
Remove the folds in sections.",How to Remove Fold Marks from Vinyl Shower Curtains2," Start by spreading out the curtain on a flat surface, such as a wood table, a clean floor, or a clean counter. If you are trying to remove folds from a large curtain, you may need to work in sections, moving the section on to the flat surface to remove the folds.


You may lay down a piece of cardboard or a clean towel underneath the curtain to protect the surface from heat if you are concerned about damaging the surface. You could then move the piece of cardboard underneath each section as you apply heat to it.

, Use a low heat setting so you do not risk melting or damaging the vinyl shower curtain. If you are using an iron, select the low heat setting so you do not risk scorching the curtain., Make sure you keep the hair dryer or iron hovering over the curtain and do not place it directly on the curtain. Holding it ½ - 1 inch from the curtain should be close enough for the heat to straighten out the folds.Run the hair dryer or iron over the folds slowly in small circular motions. Let the dryer hover over the fold for a few seconds, shaking the hair dryer or iron slightly. This will let the hot air disperse over the vinyl without burning it.

, Focus on one section of the curtain at a time, hovering the dryer or iron over the folds. Once one section is flattened, move on to the next section.


It may take a few minutes for the fold to straighten out so be patient and work slowly. You may place your hand on the fold lightly to check that the curtain is not too hot or sticky as you remove the folds.
You may need to let the curtain sit out flat and cool once you have removed all the folds. You can then hang it up and use it.

"
"
Spread out the curtain on a flat surface.,
Use a squeegee or a flattening tool over the curtain.,
Press and pull lightly on the curtain to remove the folds.",How to Remove Fold Marks from Vinyl Shower Curtains3," To use this method, you will first need to spread out the curtain on a flat, even surface, like a clean floor or a clean table top.You can work in sections if the shower curtain is very large and has many folds. You may use the squeegee on a section and once the folds are removed, shift the curtain so the new section lays on the flat surface.

, You can use a commercial squeegee made to clean windows from a hardware supply store or online. You can also use a flat piece of cardboard or a curved flattening tool, often used to crease and fold paper.Make sure the tool does not have any sharp edges or sections, as they could cut or damage the curtain.

, Use the squeegee or the flattening tool to remove the folds by pressing and pulling lightly over the folds. Hold the top section of the curtain or tape it to the surface so it stays in place as you press and pull the folds out of the curtain.Work through each fold carefully. You may need to press and pull with the squeegee over the fold several times to flatten it out. Once you have removed a fold from a section, move on to a new section until all the folds in the curtain have been removed.

Spray the tile with a targeted tile cleaner.,
Allow the cleaner to sit on the tile for several minutes.,
Wet a sponge and wipe down the tile.,
Rinse the tile with warm water.,
Dry the tile.",How to Remove Soap Scum from Tile1," A commercial bathroom or tile cleaner is often the easiest way to get rid of soap scum because it is formulated specifically to get rid of the stubborn residue. Apply a generous coat of the cleaner to the dirty tile according to the bottle’s instructions.Tile or bathroom cleanser typically comes in two formulas: a liquid or foam spray. A liquid spray is effective on horizontal tile surfaces where you don’t have to worry about it dripping.The foam is often easier to use on tile walls because it stays in place without dripping off.
Always read the instructions on a commercial tile or bathroom cleaner before using it on any tile.
Before applying the cleaner all over the tile, test it in a small, inconspicuous area to ensure that it won’t damage the tile.;
, Once you apply the tile cleaner to your tiled surfaces, you must allow it to sit for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. That gives the cleaner time to cut through the soap scum and residue so you can easily remove it.Some cleaners may need to be left on longer than 5 minutes. Consult the bottle’s instructions to determine the proper amount of time.

, After the cleaner has sat on the tile for several minutes, run a sponge under warm water. Use it to carefully wipe down the tile and remove the soap scum and cleaner residue.Make sure to use a non-abrasive sponge or you may scratch the tile. You can substitute a damp cloth for the sponge if you prefer.
If there are areas of the tile where the soap scum is particularly stubborn, you may need to use a soft scrub brush to remove the residue. Be careful not to scrub too hard, though, or you may scratch the tile.

, When you’ve wiped away all of the soap scum and cleanser residue with the sponge, fill a spray bottle with warm water. Spray the tile with the water to rinse the surface until it’s clean.If you don’t have a spray bottle, you can wet a cloth with warm water and use it to rinse the tile.

, To keep the tile from developing more soap scum or mildew, it’s important to dry it completely. Use a squeegee or towel to thoroughly dry the entire surface."

Measure equal parts of vinegar and dish soap.,
Warm the vinegar in the microwave.,
Combine the vinegar and soap in a spray bottle and shake it to mix.,
Spray the mixture over the tile and let it sit.,
Wipe the tile down with a damp sponge and rinse it clean.,
Dry the tile.",How to Remove Soap Scum from Tile2," To make homemade soap scum cleaner, you’ll need equal parts of white vinegar and dish soap. You can make as little or as much of the cleaner as you’d like, so adjust the amounts accordingly to have 1 part of each.If you want to make enough of the cleaner to use repeatedly, it’s best to measure between 1 and 2 cups (237 to 473 ml) of both the vinegar and dish detergent.

, Once you’ve measured out the vinegar and dish soap, transfer the vinegar to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until it is hot but not boiling.Heating the vinegar makes it easier to blend it with the thick dish soap.

, After you’ve heated the vinegar, pour it into a spray bottle. Add an equal amount of the dish soap, and secure the lid on the bottle. Shake it well to mix the two.Test the spray after you’ve mixed it. If it’s too thick to spray, you can mix in a little bit of warm, distilled water to thin it out.

, When you’re ready to use the cleaner, spray a generous amount over the affected tile. Allow the spray to sit on the tile for at least 30 minutes so it has time to cut through the soap scum.If the tile has a particularly thick layer of soap scum, you may want to leave the spray on the surface for an hour or longer.

, After you’ve let the cleaner sit on the tile for a half hour or longer, use a damp sponge to wipe the soap scum and residue away. Next, spray the area with warm water to rinse it completely clean.If the soap scum isn’t wiping away on the sponge, you can use a soft scrub brush to work on the stubborn areas. Scrub lightly, though, to avoid scratching the tile.
If you don’t have a spray bottle to rinse the tile, wet a clean cloth or rag with warm water to rinse it.

, Once the tile is rinsed clean, use a clean towel or rag to wipe down the surface so it is completely dry. Keep the bottle of cleanser with the rest of your cleaning supplies, and use anytime that you notice soap scum buildup.The homemade soap scum cleaner should stay effective for 6 months to 1 year.

Mix the baking soda and vinegar.,
Apply the mixture to the tile and let it sit.,
Wipe the mixture off with a sponge and rinse the tile off.,
Dry the tile.",How to Remove Soap Scum from Tile3," If you prefer an all-natural tile cleaner, add 1 cup of baking soda (180 g) to a bowl. Drizzle in just enough white vinegar to create a thick paste.It’s normal for the mixture to fizz when you combine the ingredients.

, Once the baking soda and vinegar mixture stops fizzing, apply it the dirty tile with a damp sponge. Allow the mixture to sit on the surface for at least 15 minutes so it has time to break down the soap scum.You may want to leave the baking soda paste on the tile for up to a half hour if the soap scum is particularly thick.

, After you’ve allowed the baking soda paste to sit on the tile for at least 15 minutes, wet a clean, non-abrasive sponge and wipe it away. Next, use a spray bottle filled with warm water to thoroughly rinse the tile so it’s completely clean.If there are some areas where the soap scum hasn’t come off, you can scrub them with a soft-bristled brush.

, When the tile is completely clean, use a clean towel or cloth to wipe down the surface. It’s important to dry the tile completely if you want to keep the surface free of soap scum and mildew."

Add a layer of newspaper to the bottom of the trash bag.",How to Reduce Liquids from Dripping Into Your Trash Can," Before you toss items into the trash make sure you aren’t using a bag that has a hole. You don’t need to spend a tremendous amount of time inspecting the bag, especially if its new from inside a box, but just a quick once over to ensure it is in tact will save you time and effort should it break.;
, This initial layer of newspaper will provide an additional absorbent layer against liquid mess.

, Push the bag all the way down to the bottom of the can and be sure you carefully secure the sides/edges around the brim of the trash can (so when you place items in the bag it doesn’t collapse).

, Lay at least one thick section of newspaper on the bottom of the trash bag. Be sure the newspaper covers the entire base of the bag so if liquid seeps from a container the newspaper can absorb it no matter the container’s location inside the trash bag.

Run some hot water over the paint spot.,
Soak the spot in laundry detergent.,
Scrub the stain gently by hand.",How to Remove Paint from an Acrylic Tub or Bath1," If the paint spill is relatively fresh, you might be able to get rid of a good amount of it by flushing the spill with hot water. Use a detachable shower head (if you have one) or a separate container to pour the hot water over the spill so that the runoff flows in the direction of the drain. If you simply turn on the tub’s faucet and let it fill, the paint may mix with the water and stain other areas of the tub.If a lot of paint has been spilled, it might be safest to first wipe up as much as you can using paper towels, rinsing immediately afterward. This way, there will be less chance for the paint to mix with the water.
Never use cold water when cleaning, soaking or rinsing your tub. This can actually cause grime and stains to set in faster, whereas warm or hot water will keep messes from taking hold on the tub’s surface.;
, Fill the tub a few inches deep with hot water and pour in a liberal amount of liquid laundry detergent. Unlike most powdered laundry soaps, liquid detergent does not contain abrasives that might take the finish off your tub. The detergent will spread evenly throughout the water and create a concentrated sudsy solution. Let the spot soak in the solution for a few hours, or overnight, if the stain has dried and set in.Laundry detergent is designed to cut through stubborn dirt and stains while acting gently on clothing fibers, making it ideal to treat an easily-damaged material like acrylic.
2-3 ounces of detergent per inch of water in the tub should result in a solution of sufficient cleaning strength.

, Using a washcloth or soft sponge, go over the stain vigorously. Drain the tub first, or leave the detergent solution in it to act on the stain as you scrub. Softer scrubbers are preferable for use on acrylic because scouring with abrasive items like steel wool or stiff-bristled brushes might permanently scratch the tub.Since a washcloth won’t have the scouring efficiency of an abrasive scrubber, you might have to scrub the area long and hard. The detergent should have dissolved enough of the stain to allow you get the worst of it out by hand.

Wet the stain with warm water.,
Sprinkle baking soda over the area.,
Spray the stain with vinegar and allow it to sit.,
Wipe away the solution.",How to Remove Paint from an Acrylic Tub or Bath2," Once you’ve given the stain an initial work-over, wet the area again with warm or hot water. The point is to keep the area moist to ensure that the paint isn’t allowed to dry on the surface of the tub. Run the water over the entire floor of the tub and give it time to warm the acrylic.

, Dust the floor of the tub with a coating of baking soda. Use an especially heavy hand in the area around the stain. Wetting the tub beforehand will allow the baking soda to stick. The baking soda will act as a mild abrasive which will help remove set-in stains without damaging the surface of the tub.A natural chemical compound like powdered Borax will also work in the place of regular baking soda.
The wet baking soda will form a paste and will start to loosen the stain on its own. Leave this paste to sit on the stain for 5-10 minutes before adding the vinegar.

, Fill a spray bottle with vinegar and apply it to the baking soda paste. The vinegar will activate the baking soda (think of the volcanoes you made as a kid) and form a frothy layer on the tub. Allow the mixture to sit and bubble for a 5-10 more minutes. Together, the two will eat away at any accumulated grime or discoloration.If you prefer, you can soak a sponge in vinegar and use it to treat the area directly. The vinegar and baking soda will begin to react as you scrub, enhancing the effectiveness of manual cleaning., Again, use a washcloth or sponge to scrub the area. Make sure the vinegar and baking soda mixture has had ample time to work on the stain. If need be, repeat this process once more to make sure that no traces of the paint stain remains.

Use non-abrasive cleaners only.,
Perform a test on your tub first.,
Apply the cleaner to the stained area.,
Scrub and rinse the tub.",How to Remove Paint from an Acrylic Tub or Bath3," Because acrylic is highly susceptible to scratching and may react negatively when exposed to certain types of chemicals, you should be selecting non-abrasive cleaning products to treat your bathtub. Ordinary cleaning products like Comet and Ajax that are recommended for bathtubs made of ceramic and other materials will likely be too harsh for use on your acrylic tub.Look for cleaners that are non-acetate, as well, as these chemicals can eat away at an acrylic surface.Mild all-purpose cleaners like OxyClean, Scrubbing Bubbles Bathtub & Shower Cleaner, Fantastik and Kaboom have been shown to produce good results cleaning acrylic bathtubs., Spray or dab a small amount of a chosen cleaning product onto a corner of the bathtub and make sure that it wipes away clean before using it on the rest of the tub. Remember to use non-abrasive cloths as well as cleansers. If you have any doubts, do a little research on gentle cleaning products that are suitable for use on acrylic.If the cleaner you’re testing has no effect on the tub’s surface, or if it causes small cracks or discoloration, discontinue use immediately and flush the spot with warm water., Hit the stain with the cleaner and allow to sit for a few moments. By now, little of the original stain should remain. The acrylic-safe cleaner will work on what’s left.While you don’t want the stain to dry, give it a quick wipe with a towel before using the cleaner so that any standing water left in the tub doesn’t dilute the chemicals.
You can and should reapply cleaner to the stained area frequently. Acrylic tubs need regular cleaning, and even if the stain doesn’t come out with the first few attempts, it will continue to fade with future cleanings.

, Go over the area once more with your sponge or washcloth. Really dig in: be forceful and use small swirling motions with the cloth to coax out lingering stains. After you’ve done all you can, rinse the entire tub with hot water. With any luck, you’ll never be able to tell the spill happened.

, If you’re looking for a very quick and very easy way to keep your mirrors from fogging, simply drape a towel over the mirror to protect it from moisture. If you can’t drape the towel because of the way your mirror is hung, try sticking it to the wall using putty or thumb tacks. Just watch out for holes in your wall!

, If your mirror is fogging up, the easiest way to counteract it is to cool down the room. To do this, open any available windows or doors to allow in a cross-breeze. This will prevent the water vapors from forming on your mirrors, causing the fog to appear.


This method is generally more unpleasant in the winter and should be reserved for warmer months so you don’t get sick.

, If you forgot to defog your mirror before climbing into your shower, don’t fear. There is an easy way to defog it after the fact.

Use a multi-surface chemical cleaner.,
Allow the cleaning solution to sit for 5-10 minutes.,
Scrub the inside of the bowl thoroughly.,
Flush the toilet to rinse it clean.,
Turn off the water to your toilet.,
Place duct tape around the rim of the toilet bowl.,
Fill the toilet tank with vinegar.,
Flush the toilet.,
Remove the tape and scrub the jets.,
Clean your toilet regularly.,
Pour some toilet cleaner into the tank.,
Disinfect your toilet brush.",How to Keep Toilet Bowl Clean," For best results, choose a cleaner that promises to both disinfect and cut through difficult stains on ceramic surfaces, such as mildew and hard water deposits. Spray or sprinkle the toilet bowl cleaner liberally around the interior of the bowl. Focus on areas with especially heavy staining or mold buildup.You also have the option of treating your toilet with a homemade cleaner made from a combination of ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, borax or hydrogen peroxide.Switch on the overhead fan in the bathroom to keep it well-ventilated and whisk away overpowering fumes.;
, After a few minutes, the cleaner will begin to dissolve stuck-on gunk that won’t come off with a simple brushing.


It may be necessary for the cleaner to sit on especially heavy or stubborn stains for an hour or longer, or even overnight.To deal with residue that’s higher up on the sides of the bowl, douse the spot with cleaner, then cover it with a paper towel to hold it in place.

, Use a stiff-bristled nylon toilet brush or long-handled scrubber to go over the walls and bottom of the bowl. With a little elbow grease, the stains should come out with ease, leaving behind a polished, sparkling surface.Scrubbing in tight circles will release more grime than using a back-and-forth motion.
If you need something a little more heavy-duty to scour unsightly toilet rings with, try a disposable sanding block or pumice stone. Both materials should be perfectly safe on porcelain., When you’re finished scrubbing, hit the plunger a couple times to run fresh water through the toilet. This will help whisk away any loose debris or dingy water left behind as a result of cleaning. Afterwards, the bowl should be sparkle like new.Deep-clean the toilets in your home roughly once a week, or more frequently if they receive a lot of use.

, In order to successfully clean the siphon jets around the inner rim of the bowl, you’ll need to make sure they’re not emitting water. Locate the small water shutoff valve on the wall near the base of the toilet. Rotate this valve clockwise to stop the flow of water to the tank, then flush the toilet to drain it. You’ll now be able to clean the toilet bowl unobstructed.To ensure that the water is completely off, keep turning the handle of the valve until it won’t go any farther.
Find a time to unclog your toilet’s siphon jets late at night or during another time when shutting off the water won’t be an inconvenience.

, You’ll be able to find the siphon jets just underneath the toilet’s inner lip. Work your way around the bowl, covering each of the jets with strips of tape. Smooth the tape down with one hand to make sure it will hold.Dab the rim of the bowl dry with a clean towel to help the duct tape stick.
You may have use several pieces of tape in order to cover every jet.

, Lift the lid off the tank and set it aside carefully. Add roughly a gallon of pure distilled white vinegar to the empty tank. Replace the lid and let the vinegar sit for 10-20 minutes.As an added bonus, the vinegar will help remove hard water stains from the inside of the tank as well.You’ll need to pour in enough vinegar to submerge the flapper at the bottom of the tank.

, As you flush, the vinegar will flow from the tank down into the bowl as usual. Because of the tape, however, it won’t have anywhere to go, and will instead become trapped in the jets. There, it will break down accumulated grime and mineral deposits that prevent the toilet from flushing at full power.If you don’t get a satisfying flush the first time, add a little more vinegar and try again.
Wait until the vinegar has had at least an hour to work before turning the water back on.

, After several hours, you can peel off the tape and observe the effects of the vinegar. Chances are, it will have erased most of the gunk clogging the siphon jets. Run a stiff-bristled brush over the outside of the jets to rid them of any lingering residue, then refill and flush the toilet a few times to rinse it.For best results, allow the vinegar to sit in the jets overnight.
Clearing the siphon jets is something that needs to be done approximately once a year., The best way to keep your toilet bowl clean is to not let it get out of hand in the first place. Get in the habit of swirling the walls of the bowl with a toilet brush once or twice a day after every few uses, using a squirt of toilet bowl cleaner or a misting with a spray bottle of vinegar as needed. This will cut down significantly on the need for more frequent cleanings.Plan on giving the inside of your toilet a good scrubbing at least once every couple of weeks.Stash some toilet bowl cleaner in a nearby spot so that you’ll always have some on hand.

, Most people are already familiar with this simple trick, but it’s one that goes a long way in minimizing the amount of attention your toilet bowl needs. Following a routine cleaning, add a few ounces of liquid toilet cleaner to the tank. The cleaner will run into the bowl with each flush, killing bacteria and eliminating residue even after repeated uses.If you do this consistently enough, you’ll find that there’s hardly anything to worry about when it comes time to clean again.
Running toilet bowl cleaner through the tank will also help break down mineral deposits and other gunk collecting in the siphon jets.
Toilet cleaners are sold in dissolving tablet form, as well. Simply drop one of these into the tank every so often and go about your day.

, It won’t make a difference how often you scrub your toilet if you’re doing it with a dirty brush. To revitalize a toilet brush that has seen better days, fill the brush holder with a mixture of all-purpose cleaner and water. That way, it you’ll be able to effortlessly sanitize it between uses.Hydrogen peroxide will also provide a useful option for disinfecting toilet brushes that see a lot of action.
Replace the toilet brushes in all of your bathrooms once a year, or as soon as they start looking like they’re in bad shape."

Buy a gnat fogging spray at your local hardware store.",How to Get Rid of Gnats in the Kitchen," Look out for fruits and vegetables that are sitting out. Place them inside the refrigerator while you rid yourself of the gnat problem.


Gnats are called fruit flies because they love to eat ripening, rotting fruit. Even if the produce doesn't need to be refrigerated, that is the best place to put it while you get rid of gnats.
Place dry goods in sealed containers. Then, place them in your cupboards.;
, This can include water glasses, pet water and plant water. These are breeding grounds for hundreds of gnat eggs per day.


Move your pet's water to a room that does not have any food in it. Tell your family not to leave water glasses out while you work on your gnat problem.

, Rotting garbage is also a common place to feed and breed gnats. Remove it regularly and fit it with a tight lid.

, Empty the compost into a heap immediately after preparing a meal. Rinse out the compost basket thoroughly.

, Gnats like to live in and near wet, rotting flowers and houseplants. Check your plants roots for signs of rotting, and throw them out if they are dying.


Make sure never to over water your plants. The build up of water at the bottom can house gnats and cause plant roots to rot and die.
Transplant any plants that do not have well-drained soil. Always use pots that have drainage holes. Place pebbles at the bottom of the pot for extra drainage.
Place your plants in a sink or bathtub when you water them. Pour water into the soil and let it drain through the bottom. Then, place them on the trays in your home. This will reduce the amount of water that ends up standing in the pot's saucer.

,, Allow it to sit long enough to disinfect.

,, Remove the possibility of standing water immediately.


Pay attention to areas around the sink. Low points can fill with standing water after you do dishes. If you have any mildew in these areas, it is likely they are too moist and need to be cleaned and dried more often.

, Run plenty of water through the disposal as you clean it. Gnats like to live in the food particles that build up in garbage disposals.

, Let it sit for an hour before rinsing well. This will kill gnats that are colonizing the area.

, Place several drops of dish soap into the bowl. Mix the vinegar and soap.

, Gnats will be attracted to the smell of the vinegar, but be trapped by the sticky soap.


Pour out the gnats and rinse them through the drain. Replace the contents of the bowl each morning. Place a gnat trap in each room that has food and/or a gnat problem.

, Plan to leave the house for a day, if you must use chemical insecticide.


Place all food in the refrigerator or airtight containers inside shelves. Spray the product around the kitchen. Wear a mask and leave immediately. Take all pets with you.
When you return, clean all surfaces thoroughly. Chemical insecticides can be deadly for children and pets.

Be sure to check the label to ensure the cleaner contains this material. Spray the countertops down with the cleaner, rinse with a wet rag, and dry with a soft cloth.


Do not use window or glass cleaners on the countertops. While many of these cleaners contain ammonia, they’ll leave streaks on your Corian.If you prefer to avoid chemical cleaners, you can explore plant-based cleaning options. Many natural cleaning lines carry products specifically made to clean granite, quartz, and Corian countertops.

, It’s a good idea to disinfect your kitchen countertops at least once, and possibly twice, per week. This helps prevent the spread of bacteria. Make a diluted mixture of bleach and water by mixing one tablespoon (14.78 mL) of bleach with one gallon (3.78 L) of water. Wet a cloth with the solution and rub it over the entire surface by using small circular motions. Be sure to protect your eyes and skin from bleach while cleaning. Wear a pair of rubber gloves while you perform your disinfecting.
If you prefer to avoid bleach, use natural disinfectant sprays and wipes instead.

, Give the solution time to do the work of disinfecting. For maximum disinfecting, it’s best to let the solution simply air dry on the countertops. If you prefer, you can wait a few minutes and then use a soft cloth to dry the countertops., Corian countertops come with matte, semi-gloss, and high-gloss finishes.

Prevent spills of paint remover and oven cleaner.",How to Maintain a Corian Countertop2," Be careful to protect Corian from heat, as it’s a relatively heat-sensitive countertop. Never move pots or pans directly from the stove or oven onto the countertop. Use heat-safe buffers under any of these items.Be sure to place buffers under crockpots as well.

, Some toasters and small ovens have outer surfaces that can get quite hot. These heat-generating appliances may slowly damage your countertop if they’re left directly on the surface of the material. Trivets come in all shapes and sizes, so you should be able to find ones that fit beneath these items., Knives will make marks in Corian countertops. While these scratches can generally be repaired, it’s better to avoid making them in the first place. Use a cutting board whenever you need to chop or slice something., Abrasive cleaning tools will dull the surface of Corian countertops. This may make the color appear faded, especially if your countertop has a glossy finish. While these items likely won’t scratch the material, it’s best to avoid them., Corian is slightly less durable than granite or quartz, so it’s more susceptible to dents. If you drop something heavy on the surface, you may cause a bit of damage. Exercise caution when moving and lifting these items., If Corian experiences prolonged exposure to these strong chemical cleaners, they may eventually damage your countertops. If a spill does occur, immediately wash the spot with soapy water and a wet sponge.

Rinse and dry the countertop after you clean with this solution., Pour a small circle of liquid mild abrasive cleaner on a damp sponge. Wipe the damaged area with the cleaner in small circular motions, going forward and backward as well as side to side. Clean the entire area, and then thoroughly rinse the spot down with warm water. Dry it with a soft cloth, and check if the damage has been removed. This should take care of most stains and blotches as well.You may need to repeat this process a few times before the blotch or scratch is removed. Apply more pressure with the sponge the second and third times.

, For a natural abrasive cleaner, mix distilled white vinegar with baking soda and clean in the same way you would with a chemical cleaner. Add enough baking soda so that the mixture is more of a paste than a liquid. Do not, however, use this solution as an alternative to cleaning your counters with soap and water., DuPont recommends using Micro-Mesh Soft Touch Pad kits on Corian countertops. These kits include several different “grit” options that allow you to slowly move from low-grit to higher-grit options, depending on the severity of the scratch.Be sure the area is thoroughly washed before you begin sanding. Leave the surface wet during sanding. Repeat the cleaning process once you’re finished sanding.
Start with the peach-colored 1500 AO material. Next, try the blue 4000 AO pad, and finally the gray 12000 AO option. Lightly rub the pad over the scratch in a single-line motion, rather than a circle. Change your direction about 90° periodically, so that you’re making a box with your sanding motions. Rinse and dry your pad if too much residue builds up.Avoid pressing too deeply, as this may cause an indentation or deeper scratch."

, If required, unscrew the inside-back of the freezer and expose the cooling coils.

, (Make sure your wet/dry Vacuum doesn't blow out the contents, most don't) Use the ""Car"" adapter that funnels the air flow into a very powerful jet of air. The motor heats up the air only slightly, but what it lacks in heat, it makes up for, several times over in sheer volume! This one tip speeds up the process considerably. What literally can take 2 hours with a hair dryer (if it doesn't break due to prolonged use, or you electrocute yourself water & electricity don't mix), now takes 5 minutes!

, (Remember to take out the paper filter when sucking up liquids otherwise you will ruin your filter) This also speeds the process, as it removes ice chunks, rather than melting them all.

, Do large pots and pans by hand or place them in the dishwasher. If the dishes need to soak, place them in the sink with some soap and hot water right after you use them, to decrease the amount of time the cooked food or burnt bottom can be pungent.

, If you are cooking with oil, fish, garlic, onions or other pungent odors, place a small wastebasket or plastic bag close by. Use this garbage for scraps that should be taken out immediately after food preparation.

, Make a plan to wipe down surfaces while you cook and to deep clean weekly. Grease spots will attract more food, leading to more kitchen odors if left too long.

, Wash your dishtowels, potholders and rugs every week. All these items can get wet and breed bacteria or mold.

, Close the containers and place them in the refrigerator. This will help to prevent food smells from permeating into the house.

, Not only do ventilation systems remove bad odors, but they also improve the quality of the air in your kitchen. Unless you are experienced with home construction, you will need to get a consultation and advice from a professional venting company.


If you cannot afford to install a range hood or fan above your range, open your windows. Although this is not possible in all climes, cooking with the windows open will remove bad odors and allow them to drift outside, rather than through the house.

Use baking soda and vinegar.,
Rinse with a little bleach.,
Use Borax.,
Only put biodegradable food items in your garbage disposal.,
Run your garbage disposal for longer each time you use it.,
Avoid getting grease in your drain.,
Cut large food items into smaller pieces.",How to Clean Your Garbage Disposal," If a large object has become lodged in your garbage disposal, you will need to remove it before proceeding with the cleaning process. First, it is important that you turn off the fuse that supplies power to the disposal unit. This is to ensure that it does not turn on during cleaning.


Use a pliers or tongs to remove the trapped object (you may need to shine a flash light down to see) , being careful to avoid damaging the grinder.Avoid putting your hands down the garbage disposal if at all possible. If you do need to use your hands though, make sure to double check that the grinder won't turn on first.;
, Simply flushing out the garbage disposal with water will help to remove any loose dirt or grime. Stopper the garbage disposal, add a squirt of dish soap and run the hot water until there is 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) sitting in the sink. Pull out the plug and turn on the garbage disposal, allowing the water to flush through.Make sure to use hot water rather than cold, as the hot water will liquefy any oil or grease in the drain, allowing to to be flushed away.
Flushing your drain using this method is much more effective than simply running the tap, as it allows the entire garbage disposal to be rinsed out and purged of any built-up debris.

, Grinding ice cubes and salt in your garbage disposal is a great way to remove tougher sludge and debris that has attached itself to the grinding elements. Pour two cups of ice into your garbage disposal, followed by one cup of rock salt.


Turn on the garbage disposal, run some cold water, and allow the ice and salt to be crushed by the blades.An alternative to the ice and rock salt combination is to make freeze some white vinegar into ice cubes and crush these in the garbage disposal instead.
In addition to cleaning the garbage disposal, grinding ice will sharpen the blades and remove any unwanted odors.

, It is also possible to manually clean the inside of your garbage disposal using an old toothbrush or even a scrub brush designed for garbage disposals. If possible, remove the screen from the top of the drain first, this will make it both easier to see and easier to clean., A great natural way to freshen up your garbage disposal and leave your kitchen smelling great is to grind up a handful of citrus peels. Any citrus fruit will do -- orange, lemon, grapefruit, lime. The citric acid in the peels will clean the blades and eliminate odors.

, Baking soda and vinegar make a great odor-busting combo. Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda into the drain, then gently pour a cup of white vinegar on top. The mixture will fizzle and bubble. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then rinse it down with very hot or boiling water, with the garbage disposal running., Bleach is very effective at killing germs and will quickly freshen up your drain., however you don't want to use too much of it as it can also harden any grease in your disposal unit, making it difficult to remove.


Dilute a tablespoon of liquid chlorine bleach in a gallon of water and slowly pour it into your garbage disposal.
Allow the bleach to sit there for a minute or two, then turn on the hot water tap and leave it running for several minutes to flush away the bleach., Borax is a safe and natural cleaning product which will effectively clean the garbage disposal and minimize odors. Simply put 3 or 4 tablespoon of Borax into the garbage disposal and allow to sit for about an hour. Then flush away with very hot or boiling water. , The number one rule when it comes to garbage disposals is to avoid putting anything down there which is not biodegradable. The garbage disposal is not a trash can, and using to get rid of unsuitable items is a recipe for disaster. You can minimize damage and cut down on cleaning time by only using the garbage disposal for biodegradable food items. Things you should avoid putting down there include:


Fibrous materials such as onion skins, corn husks, artichokes and celery stalks. These can get tangled in the motor.
Starchy materials like potato peels. The starch may form a thick paste, causing the blades of the garbage disposal to stick.
Expandable food such as rice or pasta. These may expand from the water and clog the drains. Coffee grinds can also clog the drains.
You can however grind up items such as egg shells, small fish or chicken bones, and small fruit pits, as these will actually help in cleaning the garbage disposal., A mistake many people make is turning off their garbage disposal as soon as the grinding noises stop. It is better to leave the garbage disposal on (with the water running) for several seconds after the grinding noises subside, as there may still be small particles in the disposal unit which have not yet been cleared away.

, It is not a good idea to pour any kind of oil, grease or fat into your garbage disposal. The grease can accumulate in the disposal unit, slowing down the motor and causing the drain to clog. Try to wipe off as much grease as possible from pans and roasting tins using paper towel, before rinsing., You can prevent large pieces of food from becoming stuck in your garbage disposal by cutting them into smaller pieces first. This is true for pieces of fruit and veg, or anything else you think your garbage disposal might have a hard time processing."

Make a vinegar solution.,
Wipe the outside of the cabinets after cooking.,
Dry the cabinets with a clean cloth.,
Regularly clean out the inside of the cabinets.,
Dust the cabinets regularly.",How to Clean Wood Kitchen Cabinets1," Mix a cup of white vinegar with a cup of water. This mild cleaning solution is perfect for everyday use on wooden cabinets. It won't warp the wood or take off the finish.


If you dislike cleaning with vinegar, you can use a light soap solution instead. Mix a teaspoon of dish soap with a cup of water.
Do not use harsh all-purpose cleansers on your cabinets. They may cause discoloration and warping.;
, Grease and food particles can accumulate on cabinet surfaces every time you cook. Wiping down your cabinets every time you cook will go a long way toward keeping them in good shape. Dip a clean washcloth or cleaning rag into the vinegar solution and use it to wipe down the cabinet doors and underneath the cabinets.


You don't want to get the cabinets soaking wet, because moisture may warp the wood. Wring out the cloth you're using so that it's damp, but not dripping.
The vinegar smell will go away as soon as the cabinets dry.

, Since moisture sitting on the cabinets can cause the wood to warp, go back over the cabinets with a clean, dry cloth to remove all traces of cleaning solution.

, Spices and other foods you store in your cabinets are likely to spill sometimes, so keep the inside of your cabinets clean by wiping them out every few weeks. Remove everything from your cabinets, and wipe the cabinets out with a gentle vinegar or soap solution. Dry the cabinets with a clean towel, then put everything back on the shelves.


If you deal with a lot of spilled food in your cabinets, you might want to invest in some good food storage containers. Using glass or metal jars to store spices and dry goods protects the food from bugs and keeps spills to a minimum.
Cabinet liners can make cleaning the inside of your cabinets easy. Consider lining your cabinets with rubber liners; when it's time to clean out your cabinets, you can just remove the liners, rinse and dry them, and put them back in the cabinets.

, For mild dust accumulation and buffing, use a soft and dry cloth to clean both the cabinet’s interior and exterior surfaces. It’s particularly important to dust the outside of your kitchen cabinets regularly, because the grease and steam produced during cooking will cake the dust onto cabinet surfaces, making it harder to clean off if you do it infrequently.

Go back over the cabinets with a clean cloth.,
Use baking soda to handle thick caked-on substances.",How to Clean Wood Kitchen Cabinets2," This product is designed to remove grease and other caked-on substances without damaging wooden surfaces. Oil soap is stronger than vinegar or a simple dish soap solution, so it's a good product to have on hand when you want to give your cabinets a deep cleaning. If your cabinets have a layer of caked-on, sticky grease, oil soap is what you want to use to clean them., If the varnish turns white or hazy, then do not use the cleaner and test an alternative mild soap solution.

, Use a soft cloth to rub the oil soap on your cabinets using a circular motion. Avoid pressing too hard, since you don't want to scrape off the varnish. Continue rubbing the oil soap into the cabinet surface until all the caked-on grease has been removed.

, Remove all residue from the grease and oil cleanser so that the surface of your cabinets is entirely clean.

, Food spills left unattended for a long time can harden and become quite difficult to remove. Baking soda acts as a mild abrasive that will remove the dried substance without ruining your wood. Mix baking soda with enough water to make a thick paste. Dip a cloth in the paste and use it to scrub off the caked-on substance.

Use vinegar for most floor types.,
Opt for a neutral pH cleaner for stone, hardwood, or bamboo floors.,
Do not mop waxed wood or laminate floors.,
Use a steam cleaner for a very dirty floor.,
Vacuum your floor first.,
Use a dry mop on laminate or wood floors.,
Apply the cleaning product one section at a time.,
Get rid of any set in stains.,
Let the floor air dry.,
Clean your floor regularly.",How to Clean Your Kitchen Floor," The majority of floors can be cleaned with a mixture of vinegar and warm water. Place a quarter cup of white vinegar in a 26 ounce (780 mL) water bottle to clean the following floor types:Cork
Vinyl
Porcelain;
, Hardwood, stone, and bamboo floors need a gentle cleanser. Purchase a mild to neutral pH cleaner at a department store. Apply it to your floor as directed on the bottle. Most pH cleaners are diluted with water. About a quarter cup of a pH cleaner (60 mL) mixed with water should adequately clean a bamboo or hardwood floor., If you have a wax wood or laminate floor, mopping is unnecessary. Such floors only need vacuuming and dry mopping to stay clean., For the most part, you can wash your floor with detergent, warm water, and a rag, mop, or sponge. However, you can use a steam cleaning mop on some occasions. A steam cleaner is a special type of mop that automatically fills with water and your chosen detergent. While steam cleaners are pricier, they tend to remove unseen bacteria better than a conventional mop and bucket. They may also remove set-in stains easier. If your floor is very messy, steam clean your floor with your chosen cleaner., Regardless of your floor type, the first step to cleaning your floor is giving it a good vacuuming. On a weekly basis, vacuum and then mop your floor. This will remove any dirt, debris, or hair that may get plastered to the floor during the mopping process. Run your vacuum over the floor, using the upholstery attachment to get into nooks and crannies.While vacuuming provides the most thorough cleaning, it's okay to use a broom and dustpan if you don't have a vacuum cleaner.

, You can purchase a dry mop at most department stores. If you have a laminate or waxed wood floor, you should not expose it to liquids. Instead, run your dry mop over the floor once a week to remove dirt and stains., Dilute your cleaner in a spray bottle or bucket. Use a rag, sponge, or mop to clean your floor one section at a time. Get your cleaning tool wet, wring it out slightly, and run the rag, mop, or sponge across the floor to remove any stains or dirty spots.The cleaning utensil is mostly a matter of personal preference. However, microfiber cloths tend to work well on most floor types.
Never use an abrasive cleaning tool on any type of kitchen floor. Things like steel wool can damage a kitchen floor.

, When you finish cleaning, look for any stains that did not come out with a routine cleaning. Use a butter knife to gently ply any set in gunk off the floor. If any residue is left behind after removing the gunk, wipe it away with your rag and cleaner.Never use anything sharper than a butter knife. Remember, abrasive cleaners can harm your floor.

, Stay off the floor until it's completely dry. Most floors will air dry on their own. You do not need to wipe up liquid with a rag or towel.Some floors, however, should never have water sitting on them. If your floor's manufacturer's instructions indicate they should always be free of water, pat these floors dry with paper towels.

, Mark when you cleaned your floor. Strive to clean your floor about once a week to keep it looking clean and fresh.


If you wipe up minor spills, like splattered food, as they occur, it's easier to clean your floor during routine mopping.

Freeze the gum with an ice pack.,
Use a butter knife or metal spatula to scrape the frozen gum off the carpet.,
Clean the spot to remove any remaining residues.",How to Remove Gum from Carpet1," Place several ice cubes in a resealable plastic bag and lay it on top of the gum wad. Alternatively, spraying the gum at close range with compressed air from a computer duster, or placing a piece of dry ice on the gum can also freeze it quickly.








Freezing gum is most successful when the gum has just gotten into the carpet and is not ground deeply into the carpet fibers.
Be sure the gum is frozen solid and not just cold before moving on to the next steps.;
, Gently lift the gum up off of the carpet fibers with a scraping motion. Allow it to crack and break into fragments and remove as much as possible. Rub ice over stubborn areas that won't lift off and repeat as necessary.








, Dip a rag into a soapy solution containing a small amount of white vinegar and gently rub the spot where the gum was to finish the cleaning process. Blot dry with a thick towel and don't walk on the area until it is completely dry.

Test an inconspicuous area of the carpet before using any oils to remove gum.,
Apply oil to the gum with a cloth.,
Scrape the gum off gently using a butter knife.,
Clean the area with dish soap and water.",How to Remove Gum from Carpet2," Some oils may discolor or bleach fabrics. Ensure that you aren't going to make a bigger stain by applying a small amount of oil in a hidden location and inspect for any discoloration. Oil reduces the stickiness of gum which will allow it to release from the carpet fibers. Try one of these oils to get the gum off your carpets:

Eucalyptus OilOlive Oil
Peanut Butter
NOTE: You will need to thoroughly clean the oils out of the carpets after the gum is removed.

, Do not pour the oil directly on the gum; it is much easier to control where you are applying the oil when it is placed on a cleaning cloth first. Saturate the gum wad with oil by repeatedly applying oil with the cleaning cloth.








, Gently lift the gum off the carpet by scraping a knife over the gum in the same direction each time. Wipe the gum off the knife blade after each pass to avoid re-applying the gum to the carpet. Rubbing back and forth may damage the carpet fibers and cause more damage to your flooring.








, Once the gum has been removed there may be some residual oils left from the cleaning process. Mix a teaspoon of a grease fighting dish soap with a quart of water and scrub the carpet with a cloth dipped in the soapy solution.

Apply Dry-Cleaning Solvent, Citrus Based Degreaser, or Mineral Spiritsto the gum.,
Allow the solvent time to absorb into the gum.,
Scrape off the gum with a butter knife.,
Sponge the area with a solution made from 1 teaspoon of mild detergent and 1 quart of lukewarm water.",How to Remove Gum from Carpet3," These solvents will help dissolve the gum polymers making them less sticky and easier to remove from the carpet. Use a cleaning cloth to directly apply the solvent to the gum wad. A muscle rub product containing methyl salicylate can also be used as a solvent.









Always test a small amount of solvent on a hidden area of your carpet to ensure that no staining will result from using the solvent to remove gum.

, Wait 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the hardness of the gum, before attempting to remove the gum. During this time the solvents will work their way into the gum polymers and loosen the structures thereby releasing the gum from the carpet., Use a scraping motion in the same direction with each pass to avoid damaging the carpet fibers.








, Finish the cleaning process by removing any traces of the solvents with soap and water. Blot dry with a towel, and enjoy your gum free carpets.

Place a bag of ice over the stain.,
Grab a butter knife and chip away at the stain.,
Spray the area with cleaner once the wax is gone.,
Vacuum the area.",How to Remove Wax from Carpet1," This will harden it and solidify it, making it easier to pick off. When it's completely solid, remove and set aside.









Get the stain as cold as possible. Ice packs, a frozen slab of meat -- whatever you have handy, apply it to the wax. Let it set for a few minutes until you're positive the wax is frozen.;
, Getting rid of as much of it as possible prior to actually cleaning it will make the process ultimately more successful. The less wax you have to tackle in the end, the better.









If you can't get much up, don't worry. That's fine. Move to method two (uses an iron and melts away the wax) if a substantial amount is left over.

, Either a carpet spray or cleaning solvent is fine. If a bit of a stain is left from the dye, rub with rubbing alcohol to remove the color. After applying any solvent, blot with a clean rag and fresh water to remove any leftover residue.








, The carpet has just been through a pretty harrowing experience. Vacuum it to return it to the texture it was originally.

Grab a pair of rubber gloves.,
Be quick about it.,
Rinse non-electronic items under hot water.,
Wash your hands thoroughly.",How to Disinfect Something That Fell in Your Unflushed Toilet Bowl1," If you’re lucky enough to drop something into a toilet in your own home, be prepared and have some rubber gloves on hand. Pulling these on before you stick your hand into germ-filled toilet water will make the task a lot more bearable. If you’re out somewhere and don’t have the benefit of gloves, you’ll have to decide whether it’s worth taking the plunge.Don’t flush anything that’s too big to fit through the pipes of the toilet. Then you’ll just have an additional mess to deal with.Assuming gloves are not an option, think on your feet and use some other object, such as a wad of paper towels or a plastic bag turned inside out, to protect your hand from the worst of the mess while you go after the dropped item.
If you just can’t stand the notion of getting your hands dirty, certain objects, like jewelry or house keys, may be retrievable using a coat hanger that’s been bent into a hook.;
, Whether you’re wearing protective gloves or not, try to minimize the amount of time your hand spends in the toilet. In one quick motion, reach into the bowl, grab the item and pull it out, letting excess water drip into the bowl. Toilets are breeding grounds for all sorts of bacteria and viruses, so the less you’re able to expose yourself, the better.


Take a firm grip on the object so that you don’t drop it. If it slides further down the drain opening, you might never get it back.

, Assuming the thing you dropped wasn’t your smartphone or the remote control, you’ll want to rinse off as much of the water from the toilet as you can. Turn the sink on as hot as it will go. If soap is available, lather the item up to start superficially cleaning it right away. Run the item under the hot water, turning it over so that the stream bathes every part of it.


Electronics and objects that are easily damaged by water should be dealt with by other means.
A strong antibacterial soap and hot water may be all you need to disinfect items that have fallen into a clean toilet, but you may still feel better employing other methods.

, Before deep-cleaning the object, take a few minutes to wash your hands with soap and warm water. After all, they’ve just been inside the potty. If you were lucky enough to have latex gloves or dish gloves nearby, peel them off and throw them in the garbage before washing up.Be sure to scrub between your fingers and beneath your fingernails, where bacteria is good at hiding.It’s probably also a good idea to wipe down anything that the toilet water or salvaged item has touched with a disinfectant.

Scrub the countertops with a sponge.,
Spray the countertop with vinegar.,
Scrape off food residue.",How to Clean Wood Countertops1," Use the rough side of a scrubbing sponge to remove any stains. Wet the sponge with hot water and use a bit of mild dish soap to clean the wood countertops while you scrub.Once you finish, be sure to rinse off any soapy residue with fresh hot water.;
, Pour some undiluted white vinegar into a spray bottle and spray the surface of your wood countertop with it. Let the vinegar sit on the surface for several minutes. Then rinse it off with a clean sponge or damp rag. This will help sanitize your wood countertops.Use hot water to rinse the vinegar off the countertop, as this will help clean and maintain your countertops even more effectively.
Don’t let the vinegar sit for more than a few minutes, as the acidic properties can make the wood glue deteriorate over time.

, One important way to keep your wood countertops looking clean and new is to make sure you regularly clean off any gunk or food residue that builds up. If you have any residue that is particularly difficult to remove, consider using a spatula or metal pastry scraper to remove any additional buildup.Be sure to use these tools gently to avoid scraping the wood and leaving a permanent mark.

Place a sheet of brown paper bag (not plastic!),
Set iron at a warm setting.,
Iron over the paper bag, slowly.,
Rub any remaining stains with rubbing alcohol.,
Spray the area with carpet spray or a cleaning solvent for good measure.",How to Remove Wax from Carpet2," over the spot. A bag from the grocery store or a lunch bag will do the job. Place it at the edge of the stain.









Place a towel under the part of the bag that's not on top of the stain. You'll be moving the bag as the wax saturates it and don't want to spread the mess any further.

, Do not get it too hot as it will melt the bag. Also, do not use a steam setting. You just want the heat.








, Wax will absorb onto the paper bag and out of the carpet. As it saturates, slide it out onto the towel, exposing the wax to a new part of the bag that's not covered in wax.









Move to a clean part of the paper bag as the spot is saturated. Don't leave the iron on any spot for too long; you don't want to end up burning anything and exacerbating your problem. When the stain stops appearing on the paper, lift it up carefully and see what you're left with.
If there's more wax to be gotten, repeat. It should all come up eventually.

, Place a cloth over the stain and reapply the iron with the steam setting on. The dye should seep into the cloth and away from the carpet.








, You can then either take a cloth to it to blot it or lay the cloth on top of the sprayed area and iron it with the steam setting on, just the same as you would with the rubbing alcohol in the aforementioned step.









If the carpet seems a little worse for the wear, try vacuuming it. That may rejuvenate it to its former, healthy-looking state.

Use a disinfectant spray or wipe.,
Clean all exposed parts of the item.,
Let the item sit before drying.",How to Disinfect Something That Fell in Your Unflushed Toilet Bowl2," Buy a potent chemical disinfectant to kill whatever bacteria might be clinging to the dirty item. If the item has a smooth, solid surface, scrub it down with a disinfectant wipe. If the item is porous or has a lot of irregular angles or protrusions, spritz it with a cleaning spray to ensure that the disinfectant is distributed over its entire surface area.Products like Lysol Disinfectant Foam Cleaner, Clorox Disinfecting Bathroom Spray and Scrubbing Bubbles Super Concentrated Bathroom Cleaner can be found in most stores and will get the job done without the risk of any damage to your belongings.Disinfecting wipes can be used to clean anything from toys to jewelry to sunglasses. Sprays will do a better job of cleaning things like hair brushes and non-machine-washable clothing items.
Try to find a disinfectant that doesn’t use bleach as an active ingredient. Bleach can discolor and even eat through some materials.

, While applying the disinfectant, make sure that you’re covering as much of the retrieved item as you can. Bacteria can linger in hard-to-access nooks and grooves, and if not eliminated entirely could continue to reproduce and possibly make you sick. Don’t take any chances. Go over the item as many times as you need to to make sure it’s been properly sanitized.Stay away from electronics with wet sprays and soggy wipes. These items are best restored using a small amount of rubbing alcohol.
The fumes from disinfectant cleaners can be overpowering. Always handle them in an open, well-ventilated area. Point the nozzle or hold the wipe away from your face as you work.

, Don’t rinse or towel off the item right away after you’ve treated it with disinfectant. Instead, set it aside and allow it to sit for a few minutes. The disinfectant will continue working on the bacteria resting on the surface. Afterwards, wipe the item down with a dry towel, being sure to remove all traces of the disinfectant chemicals.Rinse and dry the item once more after applying a disinfectant to make sure that it’s completely clean.

Grab a bottle of rubbing alcohol and some cotton balls.,
Saturate a cotton ball with alcohol.,
Wipe down the dropped item.",How to Disinfect Something That Fell in Your Unflushed Toilet Bowl3," Run down to your local pharmacy or supermarket and pick up a bottle of isopropyl alcohol and a package of cotton balls. Isopropyl alcohol, also known as a rubbing alcohol, is a great way to sterilize objects like cell phones, remote controls and other electronics that you can’t afford to get wet (or wetter).Choose an alcohol with a high purity (60-90% or higher) that is free of additives or fragrances.
A small bottle of rubbing alcohol only costs a few dollars, but is useful for innumerable cleaning tasks.

, Remove the cap from the bottle of rubbing alcohol. Take a cotton ball and dip it into the alcohol, letting it soak into the fibers throughout. Shake the cotton ball a couple times to remove excess alcohol, then press it firmly against a clean cloth or the palm of your hand.You don’t want the cotton ball to be too wet, or alcohol could leak out and find its way into the sensitive openings of a phone, watch or pair of earbuds.
This method of sterilization has long been used in medicine and is proven to be effective., Use the alcohol-soaked cotton ball to swab whatever it was that was claimed by the latrine. Disinfecting with a damp cotton ball makes it possible to eradicate bacteria from the outer surface of the item without the risk of exposing delicate parts to any more unnecessary moisture. After you’re finished, pat the item with a clean towel to wick up any standing alcohol residue and let it air dry.Rubbing alcohol evaporates very quickly and doesn’t form a residue.

Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.,
Submerge the infected item.,
Set the item aside to dry.",How to Disinfect Something That Fell in Your Unflushed Toilet Bowl4," Run some water into a spacious pot or saucepan (depending on the size of the item you’re trying to sanitize). Place the pot over medium-high heat until the surface of the water just begins to bubble. The heat from the boiling water will instantly destroy microbial bugs on durable, hard-to-clean items.Boiling is a good way to thoroughly disinfect solid, one-piece objects that aren’t easily broken, such as toothbrushes, combs, drinking containers and just about anything made out of plastic or glass.

, Using a pair of tongs or a strainer, lower the tainted object into the boiling water. The item will need to stay immersed for 1-20 minutes, depending on the size and material—any longer and it may be in danger of being warped by the heat. Whisk the item through the water to flush away bacteria concentrated on the surface.Make sure you have a way of protecting your hands from the heat. Consider taking the precaution of wearing a pair of dish gloves or oven mitts, even if you’re using tongs.
Leaving plastic and fragile metal items submerged in boiling water for too long could cause them to melt.

, Pull the infected item out of the pot and give it a shake to remove excess water. Wrap the item in a clean, dry towel, then leave it out to air dry. Once the remaining moisture has evaporated, it should be as good as new.


If the item has a lid or cover, leave it off to allow airflow and prevent mildew from forming inside."

Clean stains with lemon juice.,
Iron the stain through a piece of cloth.,
Sand the wood countertops.",How to Clean Wood Countertops2," Cut a fresh lemon in half and rub the stain with the juicy inner side of the lemon half. The acidic nature of the lemon juice should help remove the stain from your wooden countertops.Consider sprinkling lemon juice on the stain and scrubbing with a sponge if you don’t have any fresh lemons.
You can add a dash of salt for extra abrasion when scrubbing with the lemon.

, Empty your iron of any water that might be left inside and turn it on to the lowest possible setting. Place a clean dishrag, or any other type of thin, clean cloth (like a clean, old t-shirt), over the stain. Apply the iron to the area of the cloth covering the stain and leave it there for a very brief moment.Be careful not to leave it for too long, as this could create a burn mark on the surface of your wood countertops.

, Use a piece of 120-grit sandpaper to gently sand your wooden countertops. Remember to sand with the grain, not against it. After giving it a good once over with the 120-grit paper, switch to a piece of 180-grit sandpaper and sand the countertops, again keeping with the natural grain of the wood.This should help remove any tough stains on the surface of the wood.
Once you finish sanding, you’ll need to apply mineral oil and rub it into the wood grain with a clean rag. Let it soak into the wood for about 30 minutes, and then wipe away any excess mineral oil residue with a paper towel.
Be sure to choose a food-safe mineral oil. You can also use walnut oil for the same effect.Avoid using culinary oils because they can oxidize and become rancid over time.

Avoid wet spots.,
Clean up after every use.,
Re-oil the wood.",How to Clean Wood Countertops3," Even with protective oil or varnish coverings, wood countertops can stain and warp over time if they are exposed to water quite often. Take care when using liquids in your kitchen and try to soak up any spills on the countertops as soon as they occur.This means you should also avoid leaving your wet dishes to dry directly on the wood countertop. Even with a dishtowel underneath them, this could potentially damage your countertops over time. Place a plastic (or absorbent) mat under your wet dishes as they dry.

, Whenever you finish in the kitchen, give your wood countertops a quick once over with a sponge and some mild dish soap. If you clean your counters regularly, they will be less likely to stain and will require sanding/re-oiling less frequently.This is especially true for any liquid spills or if there are lots of food scraps left on the countertops.
Consider using a plastic mat when completing messy tasks in the kitchen. But if you do make a mess on the wood countertops, clean up as soon as you have finished.

, Pour a bit of mineral oil onto a clean rag and rub it into the grains of the wood countertops. Let the oil sit for about 30 minutes, and then wipe off any excess with a paper towel or clean cloth. Apply a second coat using the same method.Be sure to only use high quality mineral oil for this task. Other types of oils, like cooking oils, can become rancid over time.

If your products contain chlorine or ammonia you're at risk for respiratory sickness and irritation to the skin, eyes, nose, and throat.Make sure air can flow through the room. Wear a rag, mask, or ventilator over your mouth and nose.
Wear gloves to protect your skin from contact with any hazardous chemicals.

, In a waterproof container, like a pitcher or larger measuring cup, pour in one half cup of baking soda. Next add a small amount of water and mix the two thoroughly. You want a paste-like consistency.If your solution seems watery, add more baking soda. If it's chalky and still dry in some bits, add small amounts of water and mix completely to get a smooth paste.


Baking soda, sodium bicarbonate, is a mild alkali and so when mixed with water is really good at dissolving dirt and grease. It is also a natural deodorizer and will cut some of the smell in your bathroom.Look at the size of your shower doors. Depending on how big they are, you will want to make more or less of your cleaner.

, Pour one cup of white distilled vinegar in a glass container. Consider the size of your shower doors and decide whether you need more or less. Vinegar is acidic by nature and kills fungus, germs, and bacteria which makes it a great cleaner.Although effective on its own, many online cleaning enthusiasts recommend mixing equal parts dish soap into your solution.In this case you will want to warm your vinegar in the microwave first. This will help the soap dissolve.
Adding a few drops of essential oil can bring a nice new fragrance into your bathroom. Some, like tea tree oil, are antimicrobial and will help clean.Vinegar will also help prevent streaks in your glass., Spray bottles, sometimes called atomizer bottles, can be purchased at hardware or home remodeling stores, and florists. If you want to save some money look for better deals online.


It's also possible to dunk a sponge in either of the non-toxic solution, and then rub down your shower doors.

, The warmth and humidity will make it easier to remove any soap scum.If you don't want to take a shower, simply let the water run with all entrances to the room closed.

, Shake the bottle before spraying to make sure the solution is coming out properly mixed. Coat the interior and exterior of your shower doors, from top to bottom, hitting all areas you want to clean.Remember to keep the space well ventilated if you are using a commercial product with toxic chemicals. Keep all windows and doors open for several hours after cleaning and don't use more of the product than is necessary., If you use a sponge, dunk it and begin scrubbing. Start on the exterior of the doors and work around; then clean the interiors.


Look for areas where your shower doors might overlap. Remember to wipe down those areas as well.
An added benefit of scrubbing is that it will help remove tougher patches of scum and grime.

, Depending on how long it's been since the last time they were cleaned, you will want to wait longer.

, Use a sponge that hasn't absorbed any of the baking soda, vinegar, or other cleaner and wipe down all the surfaces. Wash until there isn't any cleaning solution left on the doors.

, Finish by wiping all remaining water with paper towels to completely dry the doors. This is especially important if you choose to add a rain-repellant.


Keeping one squeegee specifically for the shower is a good habit. Regularly squeegeeing in the doors and walls after every shower will prevent the same soap scum from building up. And over time you will have to do less cleaning.
Squeegees will prevent hard water stains.
If you don't want to use a squeegee, microfiber towels are also well suited for glass walls and doors. Wring it out when it's gotten full of water, then continue to use it just the same.

, If your shower has sliding doors, then it also has metal tracks; soap scum and grime often collects here. If there are holes in the metal tracks, plug them up with paper towel or scrap cloth, then pour in your chosen solution to sit. It is suggested you let this sit overnight.In the morning, you can soak anything up with a sponge or rag, and then wipe the tracks down with water and a sponge.


Wash thoroughly all the rags, sponges, and cloth you used in this step, as well as anything that came in contact with toxic chemicals.

, Ensure the doors are completely dry and clean. Spray the product of your choice on all surfaces of your shower door. Wait three minutes and then wipe it all off using paper towels.


Commonly used on car windows to make rain-water bead off more effectively, water-repellants will help in your bathroom too. Less moisture will be able to collect and therefore soap scum and grime will take longer to build up.
For best results, do this once a week., Although this may seem tedious to do all the time, it will help you in the long run. Consistently using a squeegee will keep water off the doors and prevent soap scum from building up too quickly.Using a squeegee makes your walls and doors dry faster. This will prevent mold and mildew from growing.
Some companies make squeegees that mount directly on shower walls.
Owning a squeegee can be handy in other ways. Consider using it to maintain car windows, and windows around the house.

, When condensation sits in a closed space it is more difficult to evaporate off. Keeping the bathroom ventilated will prevent condensation build-up and help keep shower doors soap scum free.Proper ventilation in the bathroom also promotes general hygiene and a cleaner airspace in the room.
If you live in a cold climate, close the door and leave any windows open so the room can aerate without lowering the whole house's temperature.

Clean thoroughly or quickly.,
Dry bathmat when done cleaning.",How to Clean Rubber Bathmats1," An easy and effective way to clean your rubber bathmat is to soak it in a diluted bleach solution in your bathtub. If you have a deep or utility sink, that may be preferable. Be prepared to measure the amount of bleach to be used in making your solution and have more than enough room for a proper soaking., Bleach may splash when being poured and can irritate your eyes or skin. Wear protective cleaning gloves before pouring bleach. You may also wish to use goggles to cover your eyes. , Before preparing a diluted bleach solution, open a window or leave the bathroom door open. Fumes from using bleach or making a bleach solution can be noxious and cause dizziness. , Add one gallon of water to the bathtub. Do not pour bleach directly into the bathtub. Do not make a diluted bleach solution with hot water. Hot water may intensify fumes as bleach is added. , Have a measuring cup or tablespoon handy. Do not pour bleach indiscriminately into the cold water. Unequal parts of bleach to water may create a more potent and dangerous solution and cause dizziness or breathing problems. Some recommended measurements are as follows:Add 1 teaspoon (4.9ml) chlorine bleach to 1 gallon (3.8L) water for normal cleaning.Add 1 cup (240ml) of chlorine bleach to 5 gallons (18.9L) of water for heavier cleaning., You may decide a more thorough cleaning is in order, or you might just want to keep your bathmats fresh.

Squeegee the doors after each use.,
Keep the area ventilated and dry.,
Apply a glass protector.",How to Clean Glass Shower Doors," Wipe a damp dryer sheet or Mr Clean Magic Eraser over the mineral stain and it may come off directly.This won't always work, but is often a quick and convenient option to start with. Either way, rinse off the door afterward to remove the cleaning product.


Be aware that some dryer sheets may leave scent on the shower door.;
, Light stains from hard water or soap scum are typically easy to remove with white vinegar. Warm ½ cup (120 milliliters) of vinegar in the microwave for 30 seconds, use it to dampen a sponge or clean rag, and scrub it over the scum. Let soak for five minutes, then rinse off with warm water.The vinegar may leave an unpleasant smell, but this should wash away after a shower or two. If your bathroom has poor ventilation, dilute the vinegar with equal parts water to prevent irritation of your eyes and sinuses.
The soft side of the sponge is usually sufficient. The abrasive side is more effective, but can scratch some types of glass, especially if used repeatedly.

, If vinegar alone won't cut through the mineral deposit, try mixing warm white vinegar with an equal amount of dish soap.This should remove just about any stain in one or two scrubs, rinsing with warm water after each one.

, A glass cleaner spray is typically less effective than acidic cleaners such as vinegar, but some specialized ""shower scum removal"" products may be worth a try.Most of these contain ammonia, which produces toxic and irritating fumes, so use only in small quantities and in well-ventilated areas.Spray on, scrub hard with a sponge, and rinse off thoroughly.


If your bathroom has poor ventilation, use an eco-friendly citrus-based glass cleaner. These tend to be less harmful to the eyes and lungs., Use this as a last resort, since baking soda is abrasive and can scratch some types of glass, especially when used repeatedly. Pour about ¼ cup (60 mL) baking soda into a cup and slowly mix in white vinegar one tablespoon (15 mL) at a time until a thick paste is formed. Scrub this onto the glass with a sponge, let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse off.The two ingredients will fizz when they come into contact with each other, but the gas produced is harmless. Don't pour the vinegar directly into the baking soda, or it could messily spray out of the container.

, Available at drugstores, hydrogen peroxide is an effective way to kill mold. Spray it onto the mold with a spray bottle and let sit for a few minutes, then dry with a clean towel. No scrubbing is necessary, but you may need to apply it up to three times., Bleach is another effective mold killer, but can irritate the skin, lungs, and eyes if used in poorly ventilated areas or when mixed with other cleaning products. Spray on a cleaning product that contains 4 to 6% bleach, let sit for a few minutes, then wipe off.


You can dilute concentrated bleach yourself, but wear gloves and eye protection, and work in a well-ventilated area., If the mold on your shower caulk cannot be scrubbed off, it has most likely penetrated the surface. Remove the caulk with a putty knife or utility knife. Clean the area with more hydrogen peroxide or bleach, then again with a cloth dampened in rubbing alcohol.Ventilate the bathroom for 24 hours to ensure completely dry surfaces, then put in fresh caulk using a caulk gun.


A caulk removal product will soften the caulk and make it easier to remove.

, A shower squeegee is an excellent prevention tool, wiping water and soap off the doors before water spots, soap scum, or mold can get established., Open the windows or turn on the fan during a shower, to speed up drying and minimize the time available for mold to take advantage of the moisture. Wring out washcloths and towels after use, and spread them out on the rack to dry evenly.


If ventilation to the area is poor, consider installing a heat lamp in the bathroom.

, Typically sold for use on car windows, glass shield protectors or rain repellents will repel moisture on your shower doors as well.Wipe on a light layer with a paper towel or microfiber cloth, let dry to a slight haze, then rub on in circular motions. Depending on the product, the type of glass, and the humidity in your bathroom, this may provide protection for anywhere from two weeks to several months.


Read your product's label and follow the specific application instructions if they differ from these.

Pour the cleaner on the grout and let it sit.,
Scrub the grout with a toothbrush.,
Rinse and dry the grout well.,
Squeegee the grout after you shower.,
Use a sealing product on the grout.,
Replace the grout if it becomes damaged.",How to Clean Grout with Toilet Cleaner," Many toilet cleaners contain sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite. These two ingredients help to remove stains and grime on porcelain or tile surfaces as well as grout. Though they can be toxic in large amounts, they do work to effectively clean grout.You may look for common brands of toilet cleaner at your local hardware store or in the cleaning aisle at your grocery store.;
, To avoid exposing yourself or others to harmful chemicals, you may opt for a toilet cleaner that is eco-friendly. There are several toilet cleaners on the market that do not contain harmful chemicals. However, they may not be as effective for cleaning grout, or your toilet bowl, if they do not contain chemicals like sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite.Many eco-friendly toilet cleaners are made with plant and mineral based products. They may also be scented with lemon, mint, or pine, a bonus for making your grout smell less wet or dirty.

, Though you may opt for toilet cleaner that contains bleach to better clean the grout, using bleach can be toxic to your health and possibly damage the tiling around the grout.Bleach can also strip the water repellant materials that are in the grout, leading to damaged grout in the future, especially in showers or bathrooms.If you do go for a toilet cleaner that contains bleach, make sure you wear rubber gloves, eye protection like safety goggles, and a respirator mask so you are not at risk of inhaling the bleach. You should also wear clothing that you would not mind throwing out, as bleach can damage your clothing.

, Before you dive right into cleaning the grout with the toilet cleaner, you should spot test it first on a portion of the grout. Choose a spot that can be covered up or hidden if it gets damaged.Use a small amount of the toilet cleaner on the grout and leave it on for five minutes. If the grout does not appear damaged, you can proceed to use the toilet cleaner on the rest of the grout.

, Do this by pouring the cleaner on the area with grout that is furthest from the door. This way, you can clean the grout in small sections, moving towards the door and cleaning each section as you go. If you are cleaning grout along a bathtub or a faucet, you do not have to worry about doing this.Pour a small amount of the cleaner on the grout. Do not pour too much cleaner on the grout or lay it on too thickly. You want an even amount dispersed on the grout so the cleaner can soak in and remove any dirt or grime.
Allow the cleaner to stay on the dirty grout and soak in for five minutes. Do not touch or disturb the cleaner when it is sitting on the grout.

, Once you have let the cleaner sit on the grout, take a toothbrush or a grout cleaning brush, and gently run it over the grout. You should not have to scrub the cleaner off the grout very hard to remove any grime or dirt. Often, the grime will come off easy by running the brush over the grout.Scrub all of the grout that is covered with the cleaner. You should notice the grout appears clean and grime-free once you scrub it with the brush.

, It is very important that you rinse off the toilet cleaner as soon as you are done scrubbing the grout with the brush. Do not let the cleaner sit on the tile or the grout once you are done scrubbing it, as this can lead to a built up of residue. This may also lead to a stain on the tile or the grout. Use a wet mop or a wet cloth to rinse off the cleaner.You should then dry the grout and the tiles well once the cleaner has been rinsed. Use a towel or soft cloth to do this. Do not use cloth that will scratch the surface of the tile or the grout.

, Try to get in the habit of using a squeegee to remove water from the surface of the tiles and the grout in your bathroom after you shower. Drying the shower doors and the tiles in the shower helps to prevent a buildup of grime or mineral deposits in your grout.You can attach a squeegee to the inside of your shower with a suction cup so it is right there at the end of your shower. Encourage others in your household to squeegee off the shower once they are done to keep the grout dry and clean.

, You can also maintain the grout so it looks its best by using a sealing product on it. Seal the grout once or twice a year so it remains water repellent. This will ensure the grout stays clean and grime-free.You can find sealing products for grout at your local hardware store or online.

, If you notice the grout in your bathroom or kitchen is shrivelled, full of mildew, or damaged in any way, try to get it replaced as soon as possible. Replacing the grout will ensure it does not get worse or you do not experience other home repair issues as a result of damaged grout.You may try cleaning the grout before you consider replacing it. If it does not respond well to cleaning, it may be time to switch it out for new grout.

, You will need a flat weave microfiber cloth to wipe down the mirror. Start by folding it into quarters, so you can economize on the number of cloths you use. When one section gets dirty, simply open up the microfiber cloth to find a clean section.








Terry cloths have too much texture, so they tend to accumulate grime and contribute to streaking.Avoid using paper towels since they will leave little bits of lint on your mirror.
Newspapers are a traditional option but should be avoided because they will cause streaks and may leave ink on your mirror.

, If you own a squeegie, it is a great tool for cleaning your mirrors.

Leave the egg to absorb the salt.,
Scoop up the raw egg and throw it out.,
Sanitize the area of the spill.",How to Clean Up Spilled Egg," Use enough salt to cover the entire area of the spilled egg (about a handful of salt). The salt provides a surface for the gooey egg to stick to, and makes gathering the egg a lot easier.Any kind of salt works just fine, so you can use iodized table salt, or kosher salt.
Animals could be attracted to the raw egg on the floor, so if you have any pets, you probably want to keep them away from the spill.;
, Let the salt sit for about 10-15 minutes.This ensures that the salt will congeal the majority of the gooey egg, making it easier to collect.


A piece of bread can also absorb the spilled egg if you don’t happen to have any salt around.

, Use a paper towel or a spatula to place the salt-covered egg on a newspaper. A newspaper is a good alternative for clean-up rather than using a dustpan, because a newspaper can be thrown out along with the egg.

Make sure to wash new sippy cups before using them.,
Separate all of the parts of the cup.,
Use the dishwasher to clean your sippy cups.,
Hand wash your sippy cups.,
Use instruments like a toothbrush to get into the nooks and crannies of the cup.,
Avoid using abrasive cleaners.",How to Clean Playtex Sippy Cups1," Before giving a new Playtex Sippy Cup to your child, wash it to remove any dust or dirt that may have come from the packaging. Even sippy cups that appear clean can contain germs and bacteria; washing the cup before use gives you a clean and fresh start.


Different ways to wash the cups will be covered in the following steps.;
, This includes removing the lid from the body of the cup, which can be removed by simply twisting the bottom section. Remove the straw or plastic spill-proof valve from the lid of the cup.

, All parts of a sippy cup are safe in the top rack of the dishwasher—simply add them to a normal load.


To keep the parts together and to help them from falling down into the belly of the dishwasher, put the pieces together in a mesh bag or in a special plastic holder that is available from most dishwasher manufacturers.

, If you don’t have a dishwasher or just prefer to hand wash dishes, separate all of the parts and clean them individually. Fill the sink with warm water and your favorite brand of dish soap—any kind is safe for cleaning sippy cups.


Wash the sippy cup pieces with a sponge or washcloth and then rinse with warm water and let air dry.

, For a more detailed clean, you can also use a bottle cleaner (available at any baby store), toothbrush, or a q-tip to clean into the smaller pieces of the lid, especially around the straw and valve areas, as these are the places where the most junk and debris builds up.

, Abrasive cleaners such as undiluted bleach or other toxic chemicals, as they will break down the plastic and cause the sippy cup not to last as long.


Bleach is safe to use to sanitize the cup when mixed with water, but is unsafe on its own, especially for babies.
Avoid using sippy cups multiple times without washing. This is especially if you are switching the contents of the cup without a wash.

, Wash the sippy cup like normal (either in the dishwasher or by hand), and then create a solution by mixing together 1 tablespoon bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) water.Disassemble the sippy cup and let it soak in the bleach solution for two minutes.


Rinse the sippy cup well to remove all of the bleach, and let the pieces air dry before putting the parts back together.

, You can also use a microwave sterilizer, which are available at baby stores in the bottle section. Follow the device’s specific instructions, which will typically involve filling the bottom of the sterilizer with water, then placing the sippy cup parts into the device and microwaving them for a few minutes. Remove the pieces from the sterilizer and let them air dry.


These sterilizers are designed to safely kill germs without melting the sippy cup or releasing chemicals.
Read all of the instructions before using to make sure you aren’t missing important steps that could cause the process to be harmful.

, Fill the sink with hot water and squirt a few drops of dishwashing liquid into it. Submerge the sippy cups in the water and wash the cups thoroughly, using the brush that you prefer. Cotton swabs and pipe cleaners are perfect for the small crannies that are hard to reach with a regular brush.


However, avoid using dishwashing soap that will leave an after taste on the sippy cup; your child may refuse to use the cup if it has a bad taste.

, Place some denture cleaning tablets in a bowl or container. Full the container with water and immerse the sippy cups in the mixture. Let the cups sit in the water while the tablets fizz.You can purchase denture tablets over-the-counter at your local pharmacy.

Give the container a quick preliminary rinse with hot water. Drain and shake out the excess water and place the container on the kitchen counter.


If there’s any dried or sticky residue inside the container, it may help to wipe it out with a paper towel before you begin cleaning.;
, For best results, use pure distilled white vinegar. If most of the stains are concentrate around the bottom, you’ll only need to add in an inch or two; if they reach up the sides, fill it to the top. Place the lid back on the container to keep the vinegar from spilling.Vinegar is strong enough to make an effective cleaner and disinfectant, but not so strong that it needs to be cut it with water.If you don’t happen to have any vinegar handy, try using a little diluted rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer. The alcohol in these products will produce an effect similar to the vinegar., As it soaks, the acidity of the vinegar will help break down any discoloration present while neutralizing persistent odors. It will also help clear away hard water deposits from previous washings. For heavier messes, you can leave the vinegar in the container for an hour or longer before cleaning it out by hand.Vinegar is naturally antimicrobial, which makes it useful for killing the bacteria that’s had time to begin growing on old food.
Adding a squeeze of fresh lemon juice can help brighten dull, discolored plastic and leave it smelling more pleasant., Once half an hour has elapsed, lift the lid and pour out the vinegar. Then, squirt a few drops of liquid dish detergent into the container and go over the inside using a kitchen sponge or stiff-bristled nylon dish brush. The rough surface of the scrubber should be enough to deal with any remaining stains.You may not be able to erase certain stains (like the infamous tomato sauce) entirely. Once these have set up in the plastic, it can be nearly impossible to get them out.Avoid scouring the container with anything more abrasive than a sponge. A device like steel wool or pumice stone may leave behind scratches in the plastic.

By doing the exit to the room last, you can leave without stepping on the newly mopped floor., There is no need to towel your newly washed rubber floor. Simply let it air dry. If your rubber floor is in a poorly ventilated area of your house, open a window so the mopped floor will dry more quickly.

, Some solvents and acids can soften or erode rubber flooring if used regularly. While rubber is very durable with normal wear and tear, using harsh chemicals for routine cleaning can crack and deteriorate your rubber. Stick to plain soap and water whenever possible., Rubber flooring is softest immediately after installation. It cures, becoming harder and more durable over time. Manufacturers typically recommend not cleaning it for the first 72 hours after installation. Attempting to do so earlier could cause permanent damage to your floor."

Stir the two ingredients together with a spoon until they’re about the same consistency as peanut butter. If the paste seems too thin, add a little more baking soda. If it’s too thick, stir in another half ounce of water at a time until you achieve the desired texture.Baking soda is prized for its ability to cut through stains and absorb unwanted odors. It’s also slightly astringent, which will come in handy when it comes time to scrub the container.It may be necessary to mix a bigger batch of baking soda paste if you’re trying to clean multiple (or especially large) containers.

, Coat the walls of the container with a thin layer of the baking soda paste. Scoop whatever is left into the bottom. Try to use all of the mixture.The paste will have an easier time sticking if the inside of the container is completely dry.

, Put the lid on the container and find an out of the way place to leave it. As it sits, the combination of baking soda and water will begin chipping away at messes that have taken hold in the plastic without the need for scouring or scrubbing. In the morning, you can come back and observe the results of the baking soda.Make sure you give the paste at least an hour or two to take effect.

, Remove the lid and clear the container, using the corner of a washcloth to scrape out the rest of the baking soda. The container should now be stain and odor-free. If you want, you can go one step further and wash it out with soapy water.Keep rinsing the container until the water runs clear.Use baking soda periodically to restore old and heavily-used containers.

, After cleaning, drain all water from the container and wipe it down inside and out with an absorbent towel. You can also simply leave it sitting with the lid off and allow it to air dry.

For your own safety, be sure to wear rubber gloves any time you’re working with bleach.Chlorine bleach is a highly-toxic chemical that can be extremely harmful if it’s accidentally ingested or comes into contact with your skin.Due to the hazards that bleach presents, this solution is best reserved as a last ditch effort for when other cleaning methods are unable to cut it.

, Do this carefully to avoid spills or splashes. Once you’ve got the bleach inside, close the lid and give the container a gentle shake. Then, set it aside and allow the stain-fighting chemicals to begin working their magic.


Leave the bleach-filled container somewhere that it won’t be mistaken for something else.
Never mix bleach with any other cleaners, chemical or natural., Bleach is exceptionally potent, so this will likely be all that’s needed to do away with even the worst odors and discoloration. Avoid moving or otherwise handling the container unnecessarily while there's bleach inside.Set a timer so that you don’t forget to empty the container. If you leave the bleach in there for too long, it can eventually eat away at the plastic.
If the lid of the container is also stained, you can place it in the sink and pour a small amount of the bleach solution over it., Pour the bleach down the drain and rinse out the container with fresh, clean water. Squeeze in some dish soap and work it around with a soft kitchen sponge or washcloth until you’re satisfied that no oily residue or bleach remains. When you’re finished, your plastic containers should sparkle like new!Most plastics are somewhat porous.

",How to Clean Granite Countertops1," Before you begin to actually clean the countertop, remove excess debris and move appliances or items so you can reach all areas.


Wipe up any spills or sticky residue on counter. The best way to avoid staining your countertop is to remove liquids or sauces immediately from your countertop. If the liquid has set, use a hot wet rag to loosen and remove the caked on debris.
Wash with warm soapy water and remove crumbs or other debris. Use a basic soapy rag to clear countertops of remaining crumbs, debris or other matter before you thoroughly clean your countertops.;
, Be sure you use cleaners that are pH balanced and include no acid or acidic type chemicals.


Fill a bucket or your sink with warm clean water. If you can use filtered water, even better.
Combine mild dish detergent with rubbing alcohol. Mix three parts dish detergent with one part standard rubbing alcohol. Alcohol works well because it has antiseptic and cleaning properties but contains a pH level of 7.0--the same pH level in water. Keep in mind that using too much alcohol can break down sealers, as it is a strong solvent.
Mix well and allow water to cool slightly. You want water to be very warm, but not scalding or extremely hot. Make sure your soap and alcohol are well mixed for a nice balance.

, Although granite is an extremely tough surface, it is susceptible to acidic formulas, which eat away at its surface. Vinegar, and lemon all contain more acid than is safe for granite.

, For best results, use a white cloth, free of excess fibers that could become loose and be left behind on the counter. One possible solution is to use a clean cloth diaper or microfiber cloth.


Immerse the cloth in the cleaning solution and wipe counters thoroughly. Soak your cloth in the solution, allowing the cleaning fluid to permeate the cloth. Before cleaning the counter wring cloth out to remove excess fluid.
Run hand over the counter to ensure you’ve removed all debris. Due to the nature of granite counter designs, some stains or leftover debris and stains may not be apparent to the naked eye. However, if you run a clean hand over the countertop surface you may be able to pick up stuck on debris that your cloth may have missed.

, Although your counters will be clean, most cleaners may leave streaks if not dried immediately.


Use a microfiber cloth to dry and buff counters. This will not only remove streaks, but enhance the countertop finish and shine.
Use a new dry microfiber cloth if the other cloth becomes soggy or wet. A wet cloth won’t allow you to dry the counter so exchange the original cloth for something new.

Keep your bathroom well-ventilated.",How to Clean Moldy Grout4," Mold is typically created when there is a leak in your showerhead which can cause continual moisture in your tub. Locate where the mold is growing and fix the source of the moisture to prevent it from happening in the future., Wiping down your shower after you use it will soak up the moisture that encourages mold growth. The more diligent you are keeping the area dry, the less chance mold will form., If you have cement based grout, resealing it every 3-5 years can help close up the pores in the grout and prevent mold growth in the future. Apply the sealer to clean grout and wipe up any excess that spills onto your tiles. Allow the grout to dry for at least 3 hours before using your shower or bath again.Do not seal epoxy, urethane and other types of synthetic grout.

, Whenever you take a shower or bath, make sure to turn on the bathroom fan and open up a window to reduce the amount of humidity in your bathroom. Having a steamy bathroom accelerates bacterial growth and will result in more mold."

Use baking soda poultices for tough stains.,
Find out what type of stain you think you have.,
Mix a baking soda poultice using baking soda.,
Apply the poultice to the spot of the stain on the countertop.",How to Clean Granite Countertops2," What happens when a dirty spot becomes a stubborn stain, not capable of being washed away simply with your homemade granite cleaner? Use baking soda for more stubborn stains that won't do away after a rub or two.


Baking soda is renowned as a cleaner. Also called sodium bicarbonate, this versatile cleaner is used for everything from a deodorant and pool cleaner to a toothpaste and fabric cleaner. In addition to these uses, it's an effective cleaning agent on granite.

, Treating water- and oil-based stains with baking soda works in different ways. If you can, try to find out if your stain is water- or oil-based. This will make your job a lot easier when it comes to mixing your baking soda poultice.

, ""Poultice"" is a fancy word for a soft, moist mixture. Depending on what type of stain you have, here's how you mix your poultice:


Water-based stains: 1 cup of baking soda, 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of liquid dish soap, and enough hydrogen peroxide to make the mixture into a yogurt consistency.
Oil-based stains: 1 cup of baking soda, 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of liquid dish soap, and enough water to make the mixture into a yogurt consistency.

, Cover the countertop with the poultice, cover the poultice with plastic wrap, and let stand for at least a day before wiping off.

Seal your granite countertop to prevent stains from seeping into the porous stone.,
Clean your granite countertop thoroughly with a granite cleaning formula.,
Let the granite dry completely after cleaning before sealing.,
Spray the sealant evenly over the entire surface of the granite.,
Wait 10 to 15 minutes for the sealant to penetrate the countertop.

,
Wipe away any excess sealant after 15 minutes.,
Finished.

",How to Clean Granite Countertops3," Sealing your granite countertop every couple of years is a good way of making sure that you don't have to clean very much. A granite countertop is properly sealed when water splashed on the surface beads up. When water no longer beads up on the surface of the countertop, it's time to give it a good seal.

, You can make one of your own, as you might have in Method One, or you can buy one from a specialty store.

, Give the granite a good 10 to 15 minutes to make sure all moisture has evaporated before moving on to the next step.

, Make sure the sealant covers each area of the granite. In order to ensure this, it's best to use a sealant that has been transferred to a spray bottle.


Do not wipe the sealant into the granite. Wiping the sealant with a cloth or paper towel absorbs the sealant into the cloth, not into the stone. For best results, resist the urge to wipe the sealant. Let it do its own thing.

,, If you see a haze effect on the surface of the granite, be aware that it cleans off — it won't be permanent. Your granite countertop is now expertly sealed!

Prepare the detergent solution.,
Apply the detergent with a dishcloth.,
Wipe the cabinets clean of grease.,
Wipe remaining surface moisture from the cabinets.",How to Clean Greasy Kitchen Cabinets2," Fill a bucket with warm water and add a moderate amount of oil or grease cutting dish soap to it. If you plan to use a laundry detergent, in most cases you'll need to add a cup (237 ml) of detergent for every 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Stir the solution to distribute the soap in the water.Some detergents or soaps may be in concentrated form. In these cases, you may need to reduce the amount used. Follow the label directions of your cleaner for the best results.

, Dip a soft, lint-free dishcloth into your detergent solution. Wring out excess solution in the bucket. Wipe all surfaces of your cabinets with the wet cloth to distribute a light coating of solution on the cabinets. For severe grease, allow the solution to sit for about five minutes.


Take care to only lightly apply cleaner to the surface of your cabinets. Using too much solution may cause damage to the finish of your cabinets., Wet your dishcloth again in the detergent solution and wring out excess moisture. Wipe the cabinets thoroughly with the cloth to remove grease and any other buildup. When your cloth becomes dirty, rinse it by dunking it in the water and wringing it out again.


Stubborn grease may need some scrubbing action to remove. Only use scrubbers that aren’t abrasive. Always test scrubbers on an inconspicuous part of the cabinet before scrubbing visible portions., Use a fresh, lint-free cloth to wipe away any leftover detergent solution or water. After that, inspect your cabinets for missed grease or grime. Reapply the cleaning solution in the process described to remove lingering grease."

Create a paste with baking soda and vegetable oil.,
Cover the area beneath your cabinets.,
Apply the paste to the cabinets with your clean fingers.,
Scrub the paste to remove grease.,
Remove the paste and wipe the cabinets dry.",How to Clean Greasy Kitchen Cabinets3," In a small mixing bowl, combine two parts baking soda with one part vegetable oil. With your clean fingers or a kitchen utensil, mix the soda and oil until it forms a thick, well blended paste. Make enough paste to lightly coat all greasy surfaces of your cabinets.As an example, if you plan on using 2 tbsp (30 ml) of oil, you’d need to use 4 tbsp (59 ml) of baking soda.
Alternatively, you could substitute mineral oil in place of vegetable oil. Use the same amount of mineral oil as you would vegetable oil.Test this paste on an out of sight spot on your cabinets. Some finishes may react negatively to baking soda’s mild abrasive properties.

, The cleaning paste should be quite thick. While cleaning your cabinets, it’s likely that some of this paste will fall onto the area beneath them, along with absorbed grease and grime. Lay out a cover, like newspaper, a drop cloth, or an old towel, under your cabinets to catch falling paste., Scoop up a small amount of the paste with your fingers. Gently rub the paste onto all dirty surfaces of the cabinet in a thin coat. Pay close attention to handles, where grease and buildup collect naturally., Use a non-abrasive sponge or soft, lint-free dishcloth to lightly scrub the paste on your cabinets. Work it into nooks, crannies, and cracks in the grain. For narrow spaces or detail cleaning, use a toothbrush., Cleanse your sponge or dishcloth by rinsing it in clean water. When clean, wring it out so it is damp. Wipe away any paste still on your cabinets with the sponge or cloth. Dry the surface of the cabinets with a soft, lint-free drying cloth.If any grease remains, spot clean it with leftover paste in the fashion described. When your cabinets are clean, remaining paste can be thrown away.

Wipe the area with a dry mop or duster.,
Use warm distilled water and mild dish soap.,
Work in a methodical way so you don’t miss any spots.,
Dry the granite thoroughly to avoid water spots.",How to Clean Granite Tiles1," Before you begin cleaning your granite tile, it is important to remove surface dirt. Doing this will keep any bits of grit or grout from scratching your granite, which can trap bits of dirt deep in the stone and dull its finish., If your granite is just a little dirty, first try cleaning it with warm distilled water and some mild dish soap. Dilute a few drops of the soap in a bucket of water, wringing a soft cloth to remove excess water before each wipe of the granite tile. Standing water can stain granite if left too long. Avoid soaps with lots of dyes and fragrances. Dyes can stain light colored granite.
Microfiber cloths you can buy at the hardware store specifically designed for stone are best. Don’t ever use anything abrasive such as scrubbing sponges or steel wool to clean granite. Though the stone is durable, it is vulnerable to scratching., For example, you could clean all the tiles left to right in one row before moving to the next. If your granite tiles are on the floor, be sure not to clean yourself into a corner.

, Use circular motions to dry, as if buffing a car.If you don’t have a soft cloth, you can use an old T-shirt without screen prints.

Employ a granite-safe cleaning solution for more difficult jobs.,
Try a baking soda poultice on deep stains.,
Clean grout with a granite-safe choice.",How to Clean Granite Tiles2," If your floor is very dirty or has not been washed in a long time, it can be helpful to use a granite-safe cleaning solution, such as Method Granite Cleaner Spray or Weiman Granite Cleaner. Never use “all-purpose” household cleaning products on granite.


Ventilate the area. If you choose to clean your granite with a store-bought granite solution, it likely will give off fumes from the chemicals. Open a window to maintain better airflow while you work.Spray the cleaner on one tile at a time, wiping with a soft cloth. If you spray on many tiles at once and the solution is left standing, it may stain your granite.Dry thoroughly with a soft cloth to minimize water stains.

, For deep or set-in stains, apply a poultice to draw the stain out of the stone. Mix baking soda and water until the mixture has the consistency of sour cream. Spread the paste on the stain and cover with plastic wrap. Leave it covered for 24 hours.After 24 hours, wash the paste off as you would normally clean your granite tiles, with soap and warm water.

, Grout is a magnet for dirt and dust. If dirty grout is making your tiles appear less clean, seek out a granite-safe grout cleaner, such as Granite Gold Grout Cleaner or Tile Lab Grout Cleaner. Many normal grout formulas are abrasive and will damage your granite tile.


Use a toothbrush or other small brush to clean the grout between your granite tiles. This will ensure the grout cleaner is applied in a more targeted manner. Always avoid using harsh scrubbers of any kind on your granite tile."
"
Establish a regular cleaning routine.,
Clean tiles as soon as something spills.,
Inspect grout and tiles for damage.,
Seal your granite once a year.",How to Clean Granite Tiles3," Wiping your tile with a dry cloth every other day will help minimize surface dirt. The more often you do routine cleanings, the less frequently you will need to do serious deep cleans with soap and water or cleaning solution.


Creating a calendar reminder can help you remember to wipe your tile..

, Whether it’s a glass of wine or some salsa, food and drink are full of acids and natural juices, which can deteriorate granite tile. When something spills, clean it up right away with soap and water, drying your tile completely. This will keep any potential stains from setting., Bits of grout breaking off can scratch your granite and trap dirt and grime. Cleaning is a great time to get up close and personal with your tile, examining the integrity of each stone and grout line. Be sure to replace chipped or broken tiles and have your grout touched up wherever necessary.

, While sealant is no substitute for cleaning, it can make your granite more resistant to water damage and other spills. Seal your granite once a year with a high-quality granite sealant, such as Rock Doctor Granite Sealer or Stone Pro Granite Sealer, to keep your tiles in good condition.

Inside, use the screwdriver to turn the screw and remove the main part of the handle.Once you get it open, scrub the inside well with soap and water. You can use a toothbrush and a cotton swab to get into the hard-to-reach places. If the top has a label inside, use a pin to pry it out to clean.
Dry all the pieces thoroughly. Let them air dry. You don't want to put them back together until they are completely dry because they may grow mold if left wet.

, These sponges use microscopic abrasion to clean with just a bit of water, sanding down the grime. You just add water and scrub the handle with the sponge. However, always test an area first to make sure these sponges won't damage the surface of your handle, as they can be harmful to some surfaces.You can buy these sponges in almost any grocery store or big box store. You can also find them online.

Mix a heavy-duty cleaning solution for remaining stains.,
Apply the cleaning solution with a clean, soft rag.,
Cleanse the area with water.",How to Clean Cultured Marble2," Soak a clean, soft rag with hydrogen peroxide. Wring excess peroxide out of the rag over your sink. Position the rag so its peroxide dampened parts directly touch and cover the stain. Keep the rag on the stain for several hours or overnight.Avoid using this technique if your marble is dark colored. Hydrogen peroxide on dark colors can lead to lightening.Less serious stains may only need 15 minutes to a half hour of time before the stain can be wiped away. Check less serious stains at regular intervals for this reason.
If, at a glance, you can tell the stain you are working on will require heavy-duty techniques, you may want to skip the peroxide treatment and move straight to mixing a heavy-duty cleaning solution.

, Fill a cup or small bucket with cold water. Pour water onto the treated area of the marble. Use a clean, dry, soft cloth to wipe up standing water and any dirtiness.


Heavy-duty stains may remain after cleaning the surface with peroxide, in which case you’ll need to mix a heavy-duty cleaning solution., In a medium sized bucket, combine ¼ cup (59 ml) baking soda, ¼ cup vinegar, ½ cup (118 ml) ammonia, and 8 cups (1.9 L) of hot water. Agitate the mixture with a kitchen implement, like a spoon, until the ingredients are consistently blended. The mixture will foam slightly.Although this cleaning solution is made with household products, it can be harsh on your skin. Wear gloves when using this solution to prevent dry skin and irritation.

, Douse your rag in the heavy-duty cleaning solution. Wring out excess solution over the sink, then lay the saturated rag on the stains. Wait roughly five minutes for the stain fighting action of the solution to go to work, then wipe away remaining liquid with a clean, dry, soft rag.


Some stubborn stains might require a longer soak time. However, soaking your marble too long in this solution may be harmful to its finish., Rinse the cleaned area with cold water in the same fashion as previously described. Wipe up water remaining on your marble and any dirtiness with a clean, dry, soft rag. Your cultured marble should now be clean."

Avoid harsh cleaners and anything abrasive.,
Test cleaning products on an out of view part of the marble.,
Soak stubborn stains in bleach.,
Identify engrained stains in your marble.",How to Clean Cultured Marble3," Some cleaners may strip your marble of its finish. Check the label of all cleaners to ensure they are suitable for marble. Abrasives in cleaners and abrasive cleaning tools, like scouring pads, steel wool, or scrubbers, can also cause damage to the marble.


The surfaces cleaners are intended for should be clearly marked on the label. Abrasives, too, are generally marked on the label., Even if the label says a cleaning product is suited for marble, it’s always a good idea to test the cleaner first. Choose an out of sight location on the marble, like under a stationary appliance, and use a small amount of cleaner on the marble. If the finish or color is affected by the cleaner after it dries, refrain from using the cleaner., Although bleach is a generally accepted cleaning agent for marble, it’s relatively harsh. Only use bleach sparingly to clean your marble. Same as when using vinegar or hydrogen peroxide, dampen a clean, soft rag with bleach, wring out excess, and drape the rag over stains.


Only use this technique for marble that is light in color. Bleach may cause discoloration in dark colored pieces., If you’ve cleaned a spot time and again with various cleaners, it’s likely the stain you are attempting to clean is engrained in the marble. To remove spots like this, the marble will have to be buffed and refinished. For the best results, this should only be attempted by a professional."

Remove large pieces of lipstick.,
Test a cleaning product on a corner of your carpet.,
Blot with the cleaning product.,
Repeat if you are seeing good results.,
Hand wash the cleaning product and stain remnants.,
Rinse and dry the area.",How to Remove Lipstick From Carpet1," Use a spoon or dull knife to carefully scrape and remove any large pieces of lipstick from the carpet. Try to avoid pushing the pieces further into the carpet.;
, Lipstick stains attach to the carpet fibers with grease, so you will need a cleaning product that dissolves grease or oils.Most all-purpose stain removers will work, as will dry cleaning fluid. However, these may discolor your carpet. Apply the cleaning product to an inconspicuous corner of the carpet first and let sit five minutes before blotting dry with a clean cloth. If the discoloration is severe, you may wish to find another product.


Dry cleaning fluid is especially likely to discolor your carpet.If you do not have any stain removers or dry cleaning fluid, see the section on alternate cleaning solutions for other products or homemade mixtures you may have access to.

, Apply the cleaning product to a clean sponge or cloth. Press repeatedly over the stain, switching to a clean side if the cloth becomes heavily stained. Avoid rubbing, which may work the lipstick further into the carpet fibers or spread it to a wider area. Depending on the cleaning product, lipstick, and freshness of the stain, this step may remove the lipstick on its own.


Alternatively, you may spray the cleaning product onto your carpet and let sit five minutes before blotting. This may be more effective at removing the stain, but has a greater risk of discoloring your carpet.
Even if the stain is removed, skip to the end of this section for instructions on cleaning up traces of the solvent.

, If most of the stain has been removed, launder or rinse out the sponge or cloth, then apply more of the same cleaning product and blot. Two or three attempts may be enough to remove the stain, although you should stop and choose another product in the alternate cleaning solutions method if you see no major improvements.

, Whatever product you used, wash your carpet afterward to remove traces of cleaning product that could discolor your carpet or damage its fibers. Hand wash the area with a white cloth and a small amount of laundry or dish detergent mixed with warm water. Depending on how much stain is left, you may opt to use only a few grains of detergent in a glass of water; use 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) for a stronger mix or even form a granular paste that you can rub thoroughly against the carpet.Check the detergent ingredients first. Avoid products that contain lanolin or bleach, as these may damage your carpet.If you're uncertain, test the product in an inconspicuous area of the carpet, such as a corner usually underneath furniture.
If you do not own detergent, skip to the next step.

, Rinse the carpet with clear, cool water, then blot it dry with a clean cloth. This should remove the detergent along with the traces of cleaning product and stain it picked up.


If the last residual traces are persistent, you may need to blot several times. Alternatively, leave a few wet paper towels in the area, weight them down with a heavy object, and wait for them to dry."

As soon as possible after the spill, grab a clean cloth and some rubbing alcohol.,
Dab the wet rag over the ink spot repeatedly, occasionally re-wetting the cloth with more alcohol.,
To avoid damage, rinse the area with warm water and vinegar.,
If the stain persists, cover it with shaving cream.",How to Remove Ink from Carpet1," Wet a corner of the cloth with rubbing alcohol and blot the ink stain. It's imperative that you do not scrub the stain -- that will exacerbate your problem. Dab gently at it, absorbing it up into the fibers of your cloth.


Start at the edge and work your way to center, preventing the stain from spreading and become a larger problem. Work in a clockwise twisting motion with your rag.;
, Get comfy, because the alcohol needs to sit on it for about 30 minutes.It needs to literally eat it away, which can take time. Keep at it!

, A quarter cup of vinegar for a quart of warm water is a good ratio (that's 1:16). The rubbing alcohol may dry out your carpet, depending on its texture, so it's a good idea to give it this rinsing.


If the stain is gone, rinse finally with clean water and let dry. Vacuum the area if the fibers are a bit wonky.

, Let it sit for 15 minutes. When the clock is up, scoop it away and blot with the aforementioned vinegar and water mixture.


By now, the stain should definitely be gone. Rinse it with plain water and marvel at your spotless carpet!

Gently cover the paint with a soapy water mixture (1 cup of hot water and ¼ - 1 teaspoon of mild dish soap) or a solvent such as vinegar, acetone, or WD40.Allow the solvent to sit on the paint for approximately 20 minutes., Use a putty knife or some sort of blade to push down into the carpet, and scrape away at the paint.Continue to add your solvent solution and scrape away at the paint. Every once in a while, blot the area with a clean towel to absorb any dissolved and loosened paint.


Remember, try to scrape from the outside of the stain toward the center.You don’t want to spread the paint any further from the spot that is already stained.

, If the paint is particularly stubborn, consider using a steam iron to steam the stained area from above.Don’t place the iron on the paint and carpet. Simply hold the iron over the carpet and allow the steam to further loosen the paint.


Continue to use a putty knife to scrape away at the paint., Use clean paper towels or rags to blot the area dry. You could also lay a few layers of towels or rags over the affected area, place a heavy object on top of the towels, and allow the area to dry overnight.Once the area is completely dried, consider vacuuming the area to pick up any loose pieces of paint either onto of the carpet, or in between the carpet fibers."

Use these options in place of commercial cleaning products.,
Sponge the stain with rubbing alcohol.,
Remove stains with nail polish remover.,
Try white vinegar.,
Use hairspray if rubbing alcohol is not available.,
Spot check for discoloration in an inconspicuous area.

,
Stream spray if you can.,
Dab until the stain disappears.",How to Remove Lipstick From Carpet2," The basic cleaning section gives instructions for applying any cleaning product. If you use any of these solutions, follow the instructions in the cleaning section, blotting the carpet with a sponge or cloth dampened with one of these materials instead of a commercial product.

, Rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol, is a powerful grease solvent, and may be your best bet if a commercial cleaning product does not work. Be careful not to use too much alcohol, as it could reach the backing of the carpet and damage it.Avoid circular motions while rubbing, which could damage the carpet texture by tearing its fibers.
If you do not own rubbing alcohol, skip to the next step. It may be necessary to purchase some if you have persistent stains, however.

, Check that the nail polish remover is pure acetone, as other ingredients may have unexpected results on your carpet. While you are unlikely to suffer any harm when exposed to small amounts of acetone on skin or inhaled as fumes, it's a good idea to work in a ventilated are and keep the acetone product away from children and pets.You may apply acetone directly to the stain and let sit five minutes before blotting.Test in a less obvious corner of the carpet first to check for damage or discoloration.

, Vinegar contains a small quantity of acetic acid, which can be effective at dissolving grease. Only use white vinegar, not a dark or red variety, or you may add an additional stain.

, One of hairspray main ingredients is alcohol, but as with any complex product not intended for cleaning, the other ingredients could have an unpredictable effect. If other methods do not work and you do not have rubbing alcohol, spray a small amount of hairspray onto the stain and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Wipe the area with a wet, warm cloth.

,, However, if the stain has spread, then use the spray application.

, Blot with water to diffuse the cleaning solution.

Use 3% hydrogen peroxide to hide stains that blotting won't pick up.,
Test old hydrogen peroxide to see if it still works.,
Moisten the carpet tufts.,
Check back after one hour.",How to Remove Lipstick From Carpet3," This method is best used to bleach the last traces of stain after you have removed the majority of it with other methods. Hydrogen peroxide can be found at most drug stores, although you should check the labeling to make sure it is a 3% solution. Weaker solutions (lower percentages) will not be as effective, while stronger ones could damage your carpet.

, An old bottle of hydrogen peroxide may have lost its potency, breaking down into water and oxygen. Pour a small amount onto your sink basin; if it fizzes, it is still effective., Apply just enough hydrogen peroxide to wet the stained tufts of the carpet. You may wish to use a clean, dry cloth or sponge to apply this, as pouring by hand could result in applying too much and bleaching unstained carpet as well.

, The hydrogen peroxide should lightly bleach the carpet tufts to hide the remaining traces of stain within one hour. You may add additional hydrogen peroxide if you see improvement, but the stain is not completely gone. There is no need to rinse the carpet afterward, since the hydrogen peroxide will break down into water.

Spray lubricant such as WD-40 or Triflow on the stain.,
Wipe the stain down with a sponge and warm soapy water.,
Rinse with warm water.,
Let dry.",How to Remove Ink from Carpet2," Let this sit for a few minutes. Note: It is highly advised that you do a test patch on a piece of carpet out of sight first, as the lubricant might stain the carpet permanently, in which case you'll end up with a stain worse than before.


WD-40 seems to be a pretty safe bet though.If you have a selection of lubricants to pick from, choose it.

, A carpet cleaner will also work, but why waste the extra product when soap will be just fine? Massage the soap into the stain, removing both the lubricant and the ink.

, Even soap can leave an unpleasant residue, so give it a rinse with clean, warm water. Be especially concerned with the edges of the stain, as that's the easiest part of it to miss.

, Your carpet should be good as new! Run it through your fingers or vacuum it up to return it to its natural texture.

Rinse with clean water and let dry.",How to Remove Ink from Carpet3," Into 1 cup (8 oz) of water, mix in just a teaspoon (5 g) of translucent dishwashing liquid. Spray this solution onto the stain generously.


Dawn or Joy works very well for this step, though most dish soaps will do., As with both previous methods, do not scrub the stain; that'll just set the stain further into the recesses of the carpet. Dab at it gently, in an up-and-down motion.

, Just like you did with the detergent, spray on a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 g) of ammonia in 1/2 cup of water. Blot the stain with a different, clean cloth.


If you don't have a spray bottle on hand, try to create a makeshift one from an old hairspray bottle or body spray. If not, do it the old fashioned way and drizzle it on.

, Then what do you do? You got it -- blot with a clean cloth. The stain's virtually gone, huh? Great!

, Basically, you're giving your carpet a wash after the ammonia-ridden torture it's just been through. Otherwise, you risk damaging your carpet if those chemicals stay put.

, To get all the ammonia, vinegar, and soap out of the carpet, rinse with clean water, blot it, and leave it to dry. If you come back to it and it's overly stiff, rinse it once more.


Run it through your fingers. How does it feel? Not perfect? Haul out the vacuum and go over it a few times -- that oughta do the trick.

Cover the stained area with baking soda or corn starch.,
Rub the baking soda or corn starch into the carpeting.,
Allow the baking soda or corn starch to set, and then vacuum it up.,
Squirt a few drops of liquid dishwashing detergent onto the stained area.,
Allow the carpeting to dry completely.",How to Remove Oil Stains from Carpeting1," Sprinkle the powder liberally and don’t worry about using too much. Both baking soda or corn starch are absorbents that will “soak up” moisture, especially oil. They will not stain or damage carpeting.


One advantage of baking soda or corn starch is that they are very inexpensive.
Another advantage is that they are non-toxic and made from organic materials. Neither baking soda nor corn starch will have a negative effect on the environment or on your body.;
, Avoid rubbing too softly or too harshly. Use just enough force for the baking soda or corn starch to penetrate into the carpet’s fibers. Use a utility brush for larger oil stains, and an old toothbrush for small stains.

, This means leaving the powder alone for at least 15 minutes. Now that the baking soda or corn starch has absorbed the oil, use a vacuum cleaner to suck it out of your carpeting.


Vacuum very thoroughly to remove every last bit of powder.

, Rub the detergent into the carpeting with a utility brush or an old toothbrush. Pour a small amount of warm water over the area and immediately blot up the detergent with a clean cloth or sponge.Don’t be alarmed if the process creates soap suds, just keep blotting until all of the detergent is removed and the carpet is relatively dry.
The more detergent and water you use, the longer the process will take.

, Inspect the fibres carefully for traces of oil. Repeat the process if the stain is still visible.

Gently press white paper towel over the affected area in a downward motion. Continue blotting the carpet with fresh paper towel until you no longer see any juice transferring to the paper.








You can use a cloth or rag to blot the juice, but make sure that it’s white. Dyes from colored fabric can transfer to the carpet.
If a large amount of juice has spilled, you may want to soak up the excess with a wet vacuum before blotting the stain.;
, After you’ve blotted the juice from the surface of the carpet, it’s important to remove any liquid that may have seeped into the fibers. Fill a spray bottle with water, and lightly mist the stained area to moisten it again.








Use bottled or distilled water to spray the area to avoid any additional staining.

, Once you’ve moistened the stained area of the carpet again, use fresh towel paper to blot the stain again. Continue blotting with fresh towel paper until you no longer see any juice transferring to the paper.








If the stained area is particularly large, you may need to repeat the blotting process several times.

, To make a detergent solution for the stain, mix 1 tablespoon (20 ml) liquid hand dishwashing detergent with 2 cups (473 ml) of warm water. Stir the mixture well to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined.








Be sure to choose a dishwashing detergent that does not contain bleach or lanolin.

, Dip a clean white sponge into the detergent solution, and use a pressing motion to work it into the carpet. Next, blot the area with a clean paper towel until the excess liquid is removed.








Wring out the sponge before applying it to the carpet to ensure that you don’t use too much of the detergent solution.

, You may not be able to remove all of the stain with just one application of the detergent solution. Continue wetting the sponge, applying it to the stain, and blotting away the excess liquid until the spot is removed.








Depending on the type of juice and how long the stain has set, it may take three or more applications of the detergent solution to remove it completely.

, When the stain is removed, you need to rinse out the detergent mixture. Use the spray bottle to moisten the carpet again, and blot away the excess liquid with clean towel paper.








If there still appears to be some detergent in the carpet, repeat the process.

, After you’ve rinsed the carpet, spray the area with water once again. Do not blot it this time, though. Place a pad of paper towel over it, and set a heavy item, such as a book or brick, over it to absorb the excess moisture and help the area to dry.







, If the stain doesn’t lift when you use the detergent, you may need to use a stronger solution. Combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of ammonia with 2 cups (473 ml) of warm water and mix to ensure that they’re fully incorporated.








Do not use an ammonia mixture on your carpet if it is wool or a wool-blend. If you’re not sure what type of fiber your carpet is, check with the manufacturer.
Mixing ammonia and chlorine bleach will create hazardous fumes, so make sure that the detergent you used on the carpet did not contain bleach before applying the ammonia.

, Dip a clean, white sponge into the ammonia solution. Next, press it into the stained area to work it into the fibers.








Wring the sponge out before blotting it into the carpet so you don’t apply too much.

, After you’ve applied the ammonia mixture, blot the area with white paper towel. Continue blotting the area with fresh paper until the stain has lifted completely.







, Once the stain has been removed, wet a fresh white sponge with cold water. Press it into the carpet to rinse it, and blot the area with paper towel. Keep blotting the area with fresh paper towel until it is mostly dry.








You can place a stack of paper towel or clean white towel over the area and weigh it down with a heavy object to help the carpet dry more quickly.

, It's essential to use the right stain-removal techniques for a type of carpet. For example, natural fibers, such as wool or grass, can react badly to liquid stain removers (see the warning below concerning these chemicals), and you should always think twice before cleaning antique carpets or valuable rugs. If in doubt, call a professional carpet cleaner.

, Put some lukewarm--not hot--water in a spray bottle and lightly dampen the stain. You can also dab some water on the stain with a sponge.

, Add ¼ teaspoon mild, non-bleaching detergent or carpet shampoo to 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of cold water. Stir the solution in a bowl to mix thoroughly.

, Before you apply any cleaner--including the one in these directions--to your carpet, test the cleaner on a small patch where no one will see it. Wait a few minutes. If the cleaner discolors or otherwise adversely affects the carpet, remove it immediately with cold water and a sponge. If it ends up causing permanent damage, at least it won't be right in the middle of the room.

, Moisten a clean, white cloth liberally with the cleaning solution, and simply lay the cloth over the stain.

, Use the bottom of a spoon to gently press down on the cloth. Gradually work your way all over the cloth, starting on the outside and working your way toward the center in a spiral to prevent spreading the stain. This process works the solution into the carpet without rubbing the stain in or damaging the carpet fibers.

, Blot the stain gently with a paper towel and apply the solution again as in the previous two steps. Keep reapplying and blotting until no trace of the stain is evident on the towel when you blot.

, Open windows to ventilate the room, and put on rubber gloves. Add 1 teaspoon household ammonia to a liter of warm water, and do a patch test as above. If no adverse reaction occurs, apply the solution with a cloth and massage it in as above.

, Lift the cloth off of the carpet, and spray warm water onto the stain. Alternatively, you may moisten a clean sponge with warm water and gently dab the stain.

, Blot the stain with a clean dishtowel or sturdy paper towels. Blot, don't rub.

, Add a little white vinegar to a bowl of warm water. Perform a patch test. If no adverse reaction occurs on the patch, apply the neutralizing solution in the same way you applied the cleaning solutions. Blot with some paper towels.

, Spray some warm water on the stain, and blot to remove excess moisture.

, Place a clean, dry dishtowel or sturdy paper towels over the damp spot. Place a plastic bag over them, and then place a heavy object, such as a large book, over the bag. Wait several hours or overnight before removing the towels. The stain should be gone and, because the drying process lifts even deep stains out, it won't reappear.

Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a clean cloth or paper towel.,
Press the rubbing alcohol onto the stained carpeting.,
Remove excess rubbing alcohol from the carpeting.",How to Remove Oil Stains from Carpeting2," Be aware that rubbing alcohol is toxic and flammable. Always use rubbing alcohol in a well ventilated area and wash your hands thoroughly after handling it. Keep it away from children and pets. If handled with caution rubbing alcohol is entirely safe.
One benefit of rubbing alcohol is that most people already have it in their medicine cabinet.

, After doing so thoroughly, let the carpeting dry. If the oil stain is still visible, repeat the process using more rubbing alcohol.


As rubbing alcohol is a solvent, it will help to dissolve the oil and separate it from carpet fibers.

, Once the carpeting has sufficiently dried and the stain has been erased, rinse the entire area with water, and blot the water out with a fresh cloth or paper towels. This should take care of any residual alcohol and reduce the odor.


Do not use air fresheners or fragrances to deal with the smell, as this may only make matters worse.
Open windows and turn on a fan; improving ventilation is the best approach. "

Remove soap scum with baking soda and water.,
Use an acid to dissolve stubborn soap scum.,
Bleach dark stains with hydrogen peroxide.,
Use acetone or paint thinners on extreme stains.",How to Clean Fiberglass Bathroom Surfaces2," Once soap scum accumulates, it can be difficult to get off with regular bathroom cleaners. Mix water and baking soda until it has a paste-like consistency and apply the paste to the soap scum areas. Leave the applied mixture alone for a couple of hours and then rinse it off with warm water., More challenging soap scum might need an acid, such as vinegar, to help dissolve it. For best results, soak a cloth with vinegar and cover the stained area with it for about an hour. After removing the cloth, clean the area with warm soapy water and a soft sponge.Stronger acids, such as diluted muriatic acid, should only be applied while wearing rubber gloves and as a last resort., Deeper, darker stains may be challenging to get rid of with regular cleaning products. Place several layers of clean white cloths over the stained area and pour hydrogen peroxide on top. Let the hydrogen peroxide soak in over night and in the morning, rinse and dry the area., Difficult stains can be removed with acetone, which is the main ingredient in nail polish remover, or paint thinners such as turpentine. Soak a clean white cloth with the solution that you’re using and gently rub the stained area until it returns to its natural color.These solutions are fine to use occasionally on stained fiberglass, but should be used sparingly.

Aim the nozzle at the grout lines, apply continuous steam, and follow the grout lines with the steamer.Even if the steam cleaner doesn’t get the grout perfectly clean, it will clean it somewhat, and help loosen the rest of the dirt and debris to make it easier to clean with other products. ;
, Take two tablespoons (30 g) of baking soda and add enough water to make a thick paste. Dip a clean toothbrush or grout brush into the paste, and then use the toothbrush to scrub the grout with the paste.


For the best results, use a new toothbrush with hard bristles, and scrub the grout in a circular motion, rather than back and forth.When you have finished scrubbing the grout, use a spray bottle to spray the area with a half-and-half mixture of vinegar and water.Let it bubble for about half an hour.
Use the toothbrush to scrub the baking soda paste and vinegar into the grout again. Rinse the area with clean water.

, In case the baking soda and vinegar mixture didn’t to the trick, try hydrogen peroxide instead of vinegar.

Investigate the location of the stain.,
Cleanse oil based stains with a household detergent or ammonia.,
Eliminate mildew and algae with a heavy-duty cleaner.,
Erase organic stains with hydrogen peroxide and ammonia.,
Use a stone poultice for metal stains.,
Buff out water spots and rings with 0000 steel wool as necessary.",How to Clean a Stone Tile Shower2," This can provide useful information for what caused the stain. Certain stains will need special cleaning procedures to be removed from the stone. Note the color, size, shape, and pattern of the stain, along with anything in the area that might have caused it., Some common examples of oil based stains include grease, tar, or cosmetics. These will cause your tile to darken. To dissolve oil based stains, clean the area by gently wiping it with a soft cloth and a household detergent, like dish soap, or ammonia. Afterwards, dry the area with a soft towel.


If detergent and ammonia fail to remove the stain, try mineral spirits or acetone. Use these sparingly and as a last resort. Flush these cleaners with water after applying, then dry the area., Mix a diluted cleaning solution containing a half cup (237 ml) of ammonia, bleach, or hydrogen peroxide with a gallon (3.8 L) of water. Clean the surface with the solution with a soft cloth, rinse the area well, then dry it with a soft cloth or towel.


Never mix bleach and ammonia. Doing so will create toxic fumes that can result in serious harm or death., The most common kinds of organic stains come from bodily fluids, like urine or feces, tobacco, paper, and food. These may create a brown-pink stain. Clean these areas as you would normally with 12% hydrogen peroxide and a couple of drops of ammonia.


In some cases, you may be able to get rid of an organic stain just by removing its source. After removal, wait a few days to see if the stain disappears.
Hydrogen peroxide may fade or lighten the color of your stone. Test it on an out of sight location before you use it. Only use this technique occasionally to prevent color loss., Mix the poultice according to its directions. Usually this will result in a paste that is the consistency of peanut butter. Wet the stain with distilled water. Apply the paste to the stain so it is roughly ¼ to ½ in (.64 to 1.3 cm) thick. The paste should extend beyond the stain by roughly an inch (2.5 cm). Tape plastic over the poultice, wait the time indicated on the label, then remove it according to its directions.


For severe stains, you may have to reapply the poultice a few times before it is fully removed. Some stains may take five applications or more.
Stain removing poultices can be purchased from your local hardware store or home center. Look for it among stone care products.
Some kinds of poultice are sold as pre-made strips of treated paper. These are generally applied to stains similarly to paste poultices., Hard water can leave rings, a white film, or scale on your stone. When the stone is dry, buff the surface in a circular motion with a dry piece of 0000 rated steel wool. Wipe the surface with a clean, dry, soft cloth or rag after.

Avoid abrasive and acidic cleaners.,
Remove excess moisture from the tile after showering.,
Protect the condition of the tile with a non-slip mat.,
Polish out etch marks.,
Hire a professional to deep-clean your stone tile.",How to Clean a Stone Tile Shower3," Cracked tiles will accumulate buildup and dirtiness more quickly than those without any. These may need to be replaced or repaired. Uneven tiles may require a professional to grind, hone, and polish them flat. Note any stains and try to determine what caused these.


Knowing the source of a stain will make it easier for you to eliminate later if general cleaning techniques don’t work., Abrasive and acidic cleaners will damage to your stone. Check the labels of all cleaners before using them to make sure they don’t contain either of these. Before using a cleaner, test it on an out of sight part of the stone to verify that it won’t damage or discolor.


Cleaners that are specially formulated for the kind of stone used in your shower will likely be the safest to use., Water remaining on your tile will eventually evaporate, leaving behind minerals that cloud your stone, dirtiness, and more.

This way, your squeegee will be easily accessible after showering.

, Your feet can grind small debris, like dirt, into your stone tile, wearing it down over time. This can cause it to lose its luster. Place a non-slip mat on the tile and vacuum under it occasionally to suck up these small particles.Clean mats at least once a month to prevent stains from hiding underneath them and increasing in severity over time.

, Etch marks are usually caused by an acid. Remove any dirtiness first with general cleaning methods. Apply a suitable stone polishing powder to the tile. Use a damp cloth to rub the powder into the stone in a circular motion. Continue rubbing until the etch mark disappears.


Some of your shower products may contain acids. Take care to keep these off your stone to prevent etching.
Etching that is especially deep may be impossible to remove with polishing powder. In these cases, call a stone repair or maintenance professional., Professional cleaners have special tools and techniques that can extract dirt or grime that may have impacted the pores of the stone, which causes dullness. Have your tile cleaned by a professional when thorough cleaning fails to restore the stone’s luster.

Wipe down the toilet with a damp sponge.,
Apply toilet cleaner to the inside of the bowl.,
Scrub the bowl with a toilet brush.,
Flush the toilet.,
Clean the rest of the toilet with a disinfectant cleaner.,
Clean the handle thoroughly.",How to Clean a Toilet1," Use a dedicated pair of waterproof rubber gloves to clean your toilet. Toilets can be a haven for bacteria - you'll want to keep your hands as clean and dry as possible when you're cleaning yours.









Keep these gloves separate from your other gloves. It's handy to buy your toilet gloves in a different color than your other rubber gloves - you don't accidentally want to mistake them for your dish-washing gloves.;
, It can be handy to give your toilet an initial once-over with hot water. While you're cleaning the rest of the toilet, this will sink in, loosening up dirt and grime and making your later efforts easier. Moisten a sponge with hot water and wipe around the tank, lid, seat, base, and exterior of the bowl. Often, this will be enough to completely remove dirt without the need for special cleaning products.








, Specially-formulated toilet cleaners can help you eliminate stains, rings, and mineral deposits in your toilet. Squirt or dab cleaner on the inside of the rim of the bowl, allowing it to drip down the sides of the bowl and into the water. It's important to apply cleaner to the inside of the bowl's rim - this area is often ignored, which can lead to gross brown mineral buildup along the rim.









Read the manufacturer's instructions for the cleaner you use. Many cleaners work best if you allow them to soak into the bowl before proceeding. If so, take a short break before the next step.

, Using a firm-bristled toilet brush, scrub the entire bowl thoroughly, paying special attention to any mineral stains that may accumulate along the water level and at the back of the bowl. The more thoroughly (and firmly) you scrub the bowl, the cleaner it will get.









Make the most of your toilet cleaner - since it's accumulated in the water at the bottom of the bowl, dip your brush in it a few times to work up some suds, which will give your scrubbing extra cleaning power.

, Flushing rinses the bowl and the brush. Continue to scrub as the water drains from the toilet, as the motion of the water may not be enough to rinse all of the dirt away.









If you have persistent stains, repeat the cycle of applying toilet cleaner, allowing it to sit if needed, scrubbing, and flushing until the stain is removed.

, After you've cleaned the bowl, you should clean the rest of the toilet, even if it's not as dirty. When you're done, not only will your toilet have a beautiful, even sheen - it'll also be free of harmful bacteria. Use a spray bottle of ""all-purpose"" or ""bathroom"" disinfectant cleaner to mist the entire toilet. Make sure to get both the top and bottom of the seat and the entire exterior of the bowl, including its base. Use light pressure with a cloth or paper towel to work in and wipe away the cleaner.








, The handle needs to be extra-clean because you touch it every time you use the toilet. If it's a breeding place for bacteria, that bacteria will be on your fingers after you flush! Be sure to give the handle a generous coat of disinfectant spray. You're more likely to give yourself germs from the handle than you are from any other part of the toilet, so clean it well.

Grab your tools.,
Put on your gloves.








,
Scrub the bowl.,
Clean the lids.,
Give the body of the toilet a quick wipe-down.,
Flush!",How to Clean a Toilet2," If you're repulsed by the thought of cleaning a toilet, you'll want to have everything you need ready to go beforehand so the process is as quick as possible. Grab rubber gloves, which are essential, plus as many of the following things as you can find: a toilet brush, sanitary wipes, an old, out-of-use toothbrush, clean rags (or paper towels), and/or toilet cleaner.









Here's a sanitation tip - keep a pair of rubber gloves solely for the purpose of cleaning the toilet. Buy them in a distinct color that's different from every other pair of gloves you own. This way, you won't accidentally use them for washing dishes, etc.
You may also want to have some all-purpose cleaner handy. You can find this at the grocery store, but, if you want to save cash, you can also make your own cleaning solution by adding 1 tbsp dish soap to 6 oz of water.,, You can clean the different parts of the toilet in any order you like, but, if you're in a hurry, you may find that it's smartest to start with the bowl. This way, if you splash any dirty water out of the bowl while you're cleaning it, it won't get parts of the toilet that you've already cleaned dirty. Use a toilet brush to scrub away any stains or mineral deposits you see. You may need to apply some pressure to eliminate caked-on stains. For added cleaning power, drop a little toilet cleaner or all-purpose cleaner into the water, then dip the brush in it.








, Now that you've cleaned the bowl, it's time to clean the main points of contact - the top and bottom lids. Use all-purpose cleaner and rags/paper towels (or disposable sanitary wipes) to give both the lids a quick but thorough cleaning on both sides. If you want to, use an old toothbrush to scrub the hard-to reach spots between the lid and the body of the toilet as well as the hinges.








, Finally, it's time to give your toilet's porcelain a squeaky-clean shine. Using a spray bottle, mist the exterior of the toilet with all-purpose cleaner. Use a rag or paper towel to wipe down the toilet's porcelain, paying special attention to the handle. Alternatively, you may simply dip a rag or paper towel in cleaning solution or warm water, re-dipping the rag or towel when it is soiled.









Start cleaning the highest point on the toilet first - this way, if dirty water or cleaning fluid drips down, it will only touch areas you haven't cleaned yet.
Don't forget to clean hard-to-see areas like the base of the toilet and the back of the tank, which faces the wall. To successfully clean these areas, you may need to use pipe cleaners or a tooth-brush.

, Your toilet should now be looking much better than it did before. Give your toilet a flush to dispose of any dirty water that's accumulated in the bowl. If you used any toilet tissue while cleaning your toilet, this is also a good chance to get rid of it, provided you used an amount small enough that you're sure your toilet won't clog.









As a precaution, wash your hands after taking your gloves off. Small amounts of water may have splashed inside the gloves while cleaning.
If your toilet only needed a quick, ""light"" clean, congratulations - you're done! If, however, your toilet has serious stains or hasn't been cleaned in a long time, you may have more success with the ""deep cleaning"" method below.

, You don't want to make your sparkling clean toilet impure by transferring dust onto it from an unclean picture frame or tissue box. Put on clean gloves, then give the items that were on or around the toilet a quick clean. Wet and lightly scrub them if they're waterproof, or, if they're not, just give them a quick pass with a brush. Wipe the items clean with a paper towel and put them back in their places.


When you've finished, take your gloves off and wash your hands as a precaution against the spread of bacteria.

, Often, if your toilet's dirty, the floor around it is too. You don't want to get your feet dirty every time you use the toilet, so take the opportunity to clean the surrounding section of floor.

",How to Clean a Kitchen Table," Lightly moisten a washcloth and wipe it across the surface of the table. Use a microfiber cloth or an old t-shirt so that the cloth will collect dust and not leave any lint behind., Dirt can fall into hairline cracks within the wood, so find an old toothbrush or buy one to use just for cleaning. Brush the bristles into the cracks in long sweeping strokes to try to eject the dust and dirt.For tough grime, go back with the toothbrush a second time. Wet the bristles and add a drop or two of mild liquid soap, then scrub until the cracks are clean.

, Either buy a commercial wood cleaner, or make a solution of warm water and a few drops of dishwashing soap. Dampen a microfiber cloth or old t-shirt with the cleaner and wipe the table down, focusing on areas that look and feel grimy.Do not allow any moisture to linger on the wood for long. Wet areas should be dried immediately with a clean, dry cloth.

, If soap or commercial cleaners won’t remove all the residue on the table, try dampening a cloth with mineral spirits and scrubbing at tough stains. Mineral spirits are generally safe for use on wood, but try testing it on an inconspicuous area first to be sure., Purchase a wood wax at your local hardware or home improvement store, avoiding any products with silicone, since silicone can absorb into the wood and damage it. Use one cloth to wipe the wax on and another to polish and buff the table.You only need to wax your table about twice a year, or as often as you’d like to in order to restore shine.

, Use a lint-free cloth to wipe any dust, dirt, or food off the table. If you have a glass table that’s completely transparent, wipe the underside as well., For a basic cleaning, dampen a cloth with warm water and wipe down the surface of the table. If the table is heavily soiled, mix a bowl of warm water with a few drops of dish soap and use this soapy solution to dampen the cloth before you wipe the table., Create a solution that’s equal parts white vinegar and water and pour it into a spray bottle. Squirt the table with the solution and then wipe it down with a microfiber cloth until the surface shines.Don't use vinegar if your tabletop is made of granite, marble, or any other natural stone. The acid in the vinegar can etch the stone, so just stick to dish soap and warm water., Create a separate area to catch mail, newspapers, magazines, and receipts. Use a sideboard or bookshelf near the door and outfit it with baskets or small file boxes. Sort mail as soon as you walk through the door, and keep a recycling bin near the door to catch catalogs and junk mail before they can hit the table., Install hooks on the wall or get a coat rack so you have a specific place to hang coats, bags, and hats. Find small hooks and place them near the door to hang your keys on as soon as you get home. Create special bins for kids so they know where to put belongings like backpacks and mittens., Having a trash can nearby will make it even easier to toss garbage that’s been left on the table. Find a creative way to store the can, either by tucking it under a sideboard or sticking it in a cabinet right next to the table.,"

Clean soft stains with water.,
Use a gentle cleaner to remove harder stains.,
Use vinegar or bleach to disinfect.,
Dry off excess water.",How to Clean a Kitchen Faucet1," You should be able to remove small smudges without any cleaning solution. Simply wiping the faucet down with a wet rag should be enough to remove most soft stains. Always blot the faucet dry after it gets wet.





;
, For heavier stains, use a wet rag and a gentle cleaner to wipe down the faucet. Vinegar or all-purpose cleaners should work well.For a natural cleaner, mix equal parts white vinegar and water and apply it to the faucet. Do not use vinegar on iron. If you are unsure if your fixture is made of iron, test it on a small portion and see if the metal is rubbed off.Acceptable store bought cleaners include Formula 409, Windex, and Fantastik.

, When your faucet has likely come into contact with germs and bacteria, you can use either bleach or vinegar to disinfect. Do not use a sponge to apply the solution, because sponges collect bacteria and germs rapidly.


For vinegar mix equal parts white vinegar and water and use a clean rag to apply the solution. Vinegar is a safe, natural disinfectant that is kills most problematic bacteria.For a bleach solution, mix one tablespoon of bleach with a quart of water. Use gloves so that your skin does not come into contact directly with the bleach., When your facet is wet from use or cleaning, wipe it down with a dry rag to wipe off water. Blot water off gently.








If you don’t blot off water, minerals can accumulate, creating a build-up that can be hard to clean.

Clean red or reddish brown deposits with lemon juice.,
Clean green deposits with ammonia.,
Clean black and brown build-up with cream of tartar.,
Clean soap scum with white vinegar.",How to Clean a Kitchen Faucet2," Rust and iron need to be cleaned with acid scouring rubs. Try mixing lemon juice with borax to create a paste. Then use a rag to rub off the build up with the paste.








Alternatively try mixing one part oxalic acid to ten parts water.

, For green or bluish green deposits, mix equal parts water and ammonia. Use gloves and a rag to apply the mixture. After you finish, rinse the area well and flush out the pipes with water to remove excess ammonia.







, To clean darker build-up, mix cream of tartar with hydrogen peroxide to create a paste. Use a rag to rub it onto the faucet and remove build up., To pick up soap scum and particularly bad water marks, use white vinegar. Mix it with baking soda to create a paste. Apply it and let it sit. Then rinse it off and dry."

Disassemble the filter.,
Scrub the filter with a toothbrush.,
Boil the filter in vinegar to remove calcium.,
Reinstall filter.",How to Clean a Kitchen Faucet3," Most faucets have a small removable filter at the end. Wrap it in a towel so that it does not get scratched up. Then use a wrench to turn it counterclockwise and loosen it. Once it is loose, you can finish unscrewing it with your hand.







, There should be several components of the filter. Take it apart, observing how the parts fit together. You will need to remember how to put it back together before reinstalling it.







, Run the filter through warm water. Use a tooth brush to get in the hard to reach spots and remove build up.








Alternatively, you can put a pin through the holes in the filter to remove build-up in the small holes.

, Put white vinegar on the stove and heat it to a near boil. Let it sit for about an hour and then rinse it off after it cools.








This step should only be necessary if you see a red build-up on the faucet.

, Put the filter back together as it had been. Use your hand to turn it clockwise and tighten it. Then, use a rag and wrench to tighten it back up.

Make a vinegar solution.,
Spray the vinegar on the scummy surface.,
Wipe the surface with a towel.,
Rinse and squeegee the area clean.,
Clean the faucets and shower heads.,
Clean the toilet, too.",How to Remove Hard Water Spots1," Vinegar - cheap, natural, white vinegar - is the best tool you can use to combat those every day hard water spots that keep your surfaces from gleaming. Prepare a 50/50 mixture of water and white vinegar in a spray bottle.


If you're using a spray bottle that used to contain chemicals or other ingredients, make sure you wash it out thoroughly before you add the vinegar and water mixture.
Be sure to use regular white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar and other types of vinegar won't do the trick.;
, Whether it's your glass shower door, the sink or your floor tiles, go ahead and spray those spots with vinegar. Vinegar has a pungent smell but it's completely safe to use on surfaces other than wood. Spray the area thoroughly, making sure you don't miss any spots.

, Light hard water stains should come right off. If you'd prefer you can instead pour the vinegar solution into a bowl and soak a rag in the solution, then use that to clean our surfaces.

, Then buff dry with a clean cloth. Make sure it's totally dry - otherwise, the water will leave more spots!

, Remove faucet aerators and shower heads periodically and soak them in vinegar. A brush will help to loosen stubborn deposits.

, The toilet bowl may also be stained with hard water spots. Vinegar works to clean these stains, too. Pour 1 1/2 cups of vinegar in the toilet bowl. Use the toilet scrubber to scrub the spots until they're gone. Flush the toilet to get rid of the vinegar.

"
"
Try letting the vinegar sit on the hard water spots.,
Use a cleaner with hydrochloric acid.",How to Remove Hard Water Spots2," If you let it sit and soak in for a few minutes instead of wiping it off right away, it'll have more time to break down the mineral deposits holding the scum in place. Let it soak in for a good 5 - 10 minutes before you try to wipe it off. Use a scrub brush to loosen thicker deposits.


You can also soak a towel in the vinegar solution and drape it over the stained surface. This works well for shower floors and bathtubs.

, Look for a bathroom cleaner made for getting rid of hard water stains and soap scum. This should be a last resort, since hydrochloric acid is a harsh chemical.Make sure the room is well-ventilated - open the windows and turn on the fans - then spray the stained area with the appropriate cleaner. Wipe it away, then rinse the surface with water and dry it.


Be sure to wear gloves when handles hydrochloric acid.

"
"
Dry your surfaces after use.,
Use water softener powder or liquid.,
Get a water softener system.",How to Remove Hard Water Spots3," After you take a shower or bath, or splash water in your kitchen, use a dry towel to wipe the surfaces. This will mop up the mineral deposits before they can dry out and leave spots., You can add a water softener to your washing machine to prevent calcium deposits from building up. Powder or liquid water softeners are available at hardware stores.

, If your water is extremely hard and you're tired of dealing with the mess it leaves - it's hard on hair and skin as well as bathroom surfaces - consider getting a system installed that will remove the mineral deposits from your water. This is an expensive option, but it might be worth the trouble.

Rinse it off.,
Pour a bleach solution into the knife slots.,
Let the mixture sit.,
Rinse and dry.",How to Clean a Knife Block," One simple way to start removing some of the crumbs or debris that may have built up in your knife block is to simply turn the whole thing over. Spend a minute or two shaking it over the trash to help remove crumbs.To help the process along, try using a blow dryer to dislodge crumbs.;
, Attach the crevice tool to the hose, and use it to get down as far as you can into the knife block. That should suction out most of the debris., Stick it in there, using it to get far into the corners. You may need to twist or swirl it around a bit to capture the grime. Clean your tool off from time to time so you are still removing dirt instead of adding it., Using hot, soapy water, scrub the outside of the block down. Don't forget to get the underside, too, as that can build up bacteria. You may need to scrub harder to get off any grease or sticky spots., For this part, you'll need a slender brush. A baby bottle nipple brush works, but you can also try a pipe cleaner. Use it to scrub inside the knife slots, getting as far down in there as you can., Starting with the inside, flush the block with warm water to rinse off the soap. Move to the outside, making sure to rinse off all sides of the block thoroughly with water. You may need to rub it with your hands a bit to make sure the soap is gone., Mix a tablespoon of bleach with a gallon of water. Pure bleach is too strong for this purpose, and this mixture will efficiently sanitize the block. Wipe the solution around the outside of the container, and then pour the mixture into the slots, filling them up all the way.Instead of bleach, you can use undiluted vinegar or hydrogen peroxide.

, The block needs to sit with the solution on it for about a minute, which will help sanitize the block. You can leave it for longer, but try not to let it dry on the block. , Rinse the block thoroughly. Make sure you get water into the slots, as well as all around the outside to rinse off the bleach. Once you're done, place it upside down on a clean towel, and leave it to air dry. Wait until the slots are dry before putting the knives back in."

Choose the right cleaner for your specific hood.,
Wipe the outside of the hood.,
Dry the hood.",How to Clean a Range Hood1," Range hoods can be made from a variety of materials. When choosing what to clean with, pick a cleaner that's safe to use on that material in order to avoid damaging it. For instance:


For plastic or vinyl hoods, use an all-purpose cleaner or warm soapy water.For stainless steel, go with warm soapy water.For copper, use copper cleaner.;
, Expect the hood’s exterior to be a pretty easy job since it’s aimed away from your stovetop. Simply spray it with your cleaner. Follow the cleaner's directions if it advises letting it sit for any length of time before wiping it off., Wipe it down with a dry, clean cloth or paper towels. Remove all traces of the cleaner. If the hood's material has an obvious grain, wipe with the grain for a more effective clean and polish."
"
Steam the inside if needed.,
Test-spray the inside.,
Spray and wipe.,
Wipe again with wet towels.,
Repeat frequently.",How to Clean a Range Hood2," First, take a peek under the hood. If it looks like you have your work cut out for you up there, fill a large pot three-quarters of the way with water. Bring it to a boil, uncovered, on the stovetop and keep it boiling for a half hour or more, as needed. Let the steam soak into the crud so it starts to loosen from the hood.Wait for the stovetop to cool before proceeding. Keep in mind that you’ll probably have to lean over the stove to reach up and under the range hood. If you boiled water to work the crud loose with steam, remove the pot to a heat-safe surface. Wait for the burner to cool down before moving on.

, If the dirt is light enough for your regular surface cleaner to work, great. If, however, you need a tougher chemical for degreasing (like Super Clean, OxiClean, or Mrs. Myers’ All-Purpose Cleaner) to get the job done, give a small area of the hood a test spray before using it all over. Make sure it doesn’t cause any adverse reactions with the hood’s paint or other materials.Again, always double-check the cleaner's recommendations regarding which materials it's safe to use on.

, First, read your cleaner’s instructions for proper use. Wear safety gloves if advised. Open windows and turn the exhaust fan on if strong ventilation is recommended. Then spray the hood’s interior as directed and wipe it down with a sponge, cloth, or paper towels.Some cleaners may recommend wiping down immediately. Others may advise letting it sit for a period of time so it can soak into the dirt, grease, and crud., Expect strong cleaners to leave streaks and odors if any traces are left to linger. Once the area is clean, dampen a cloth or paper towels. Wipe the interior again to remove any chemical residue. Then repeat with a dry cloth to dry it., Expect the job to be tougher the longer you wait in between each cleaning. Make washing the hood part of your daily or weekly routine when doing the whole kitchen. If a particular meal used a lot of oil or caused a lot of splatter, clean it up immediately afterward, as soon as the stovetop is safe to work around."
"
Check it monthly.,
Remove the filter.,
Replace fabric and charcoal filters.,
Soak metal filters in cleaner and water.",How to Clean a Range Hood3," Clean the hood itself on a daily or weekly basis, but don’t worry about dealing with the filter that often (unless you happen to deep-fry a lot of foods on a regular basis). Inspect it once a month. If it appears stained or splattered, plan on cleaning or replacing it ASAP., Filters can be secured into place in a number of different ways. Give yours a look over. It will probably be attached by:A fastener that you can rotate in and out of position.
A latch that you need to press and lift.
Rim supports that just need to be pushed up and rotated.
Screws.

, If you have either of these types, do not attempt to clean them. Simply switch the old one out and install a new one. However, with charcoal filters, keep in mind that you only need to replace these if you have a ductless range hood.A ductless range hood means the exhaust fan is recirculating air right back into the kitchen. If the exhaust is being ventilated out of the house through ducts, you shouldn’t need to replace your charcoal filter.

, Fill your sink with hot water. Add dish soap or the recommended amount of a stronger cleaner (like Super Clean or OxiClean) to degrease it. Let it soak for ten minutes up to a half hour, then agitate it in the water to shake off any loose dirt. Use a bristle brush to scrub any stubborn bits.Then rinse clean under a strong jet of water (like your faucet’s sprayer attachment).After that:


Set the filter on a clean towel or drying rack and allow it to air-dry before reinstalling.

Start cleaning immediately after use.,
Feed bread into the grinder.,
Disassemble the grinder.,
Soak the parts.,
Scrub the parts.,
Dry the parts.,
Oil any metal parts.,
Bag each part individually with rice.,
Store in your freezer if possible.,
Sterilize oiled parts with bleach before use.,
Keep parts and meat cold.,
Slice off sinew before grinding.,
Sharpen or replace blades as needed.",How to Clean a Meat Grinder," Expect meat to leave oil and grease behind as it passes through your grinder (as well as stray bits of meat). These will dry and crust over if given time, so don’t wait too long before cleaning up. Make life easier by dealing with it promptly after each use., Before you disassemble the machine, grab two or three slices of bread. Feed them through the grinder just as you did with your meat. Use these to absorb the meat’s oil and grease, as well as push out any stray bits that are lingering inside the machine., First, unplug the machine if it’s electric. Then break it down into its parts. These may vary according to type and model, but generally a meat grinder consists of:A pusher, feed tube, and hopper (usually a single piece through which the meat is fed into the machine).
A screw (an internal piece that forces the meat through the machine)
A blade
A plate or die (the metal piece with holes where the meat comes out)
A cover for the blade and plate

, Fill a sink or bucket with warm water and add some dish detergent. Place the disassembled parts inside once full. Let them sit for about a quarter of an hour to loosen up any remaining grease, oil, or meat.If your grinder is an electric model, do not soak any motorized parts. Instead, use this time to wipe down the outside of the base with a damp cloth and then a fresh one to dry it.

, Use a sponge to clean the screw, cover, and blade. Be careful when handling the blade, since this is sharp and can easily cut you if mishandled. Switch to a bottle brush to clean the inside of the feed tube, hopper, and the plate’s holes. Rinse each part with clean water when finished.Don’t rush through this process. You want to remove all traces so you don’t end up with a breeding ground for germs and bacteria. So once you think you’ve scrubbed something enough, scrub it just a little bit more.

, First, wipe them down with a dry towel to get rid of excess water. Then lay them on a fresh towel or wire rack to air-dry. Avoid rust and oxidation by waiting until they are totally dry before putting your grinder away., Keep your grinder well lubricated and prevent rust from forming during storage. Fill a spray bottle with food-grade mineral oil. Then mist all of your grinder’s metal parts (excluding an electric parts) with an even coat of oil.Pay particular attention to the pusher and screw, since these come into the most contact with your meat as you feed it through the machine.

, Place each part to your grinder in its own sealable plastic bag. Then add a handful of rice to each bag. The rice isn’t strictly necessary, but it will absorb any present and future moisture, which makes it a good idea if you store your parts in the freezer and/or live in an area with high humidity., Keep in mind that your grinder works best when its parts are cold. Keep any non-electric parts in the freezer if there’s space. However, if you can’t devote that much space for long-term storage, don’t worry. Instead:Store your parts somewhere dry in the meantime. Then simply place them in the freezer long enough to chill them before your next use (roughly an hour)., Mix a tablespoon of bleach with one gallon (3.8 L) of water. Fill a spray bottle with this solution. Then spray each metal part that you oiled before storage to ensure that they are disinfected. Then thoroughly rinse them with clean water to remove all traces of bleach., Expect warm meat to make a bigger mess when you’re grinding it. Make clean-up easier by keeping both the meat and the grinder’s parts well chilled before use. If you need to grind the same meat multiple times:Fill a large bowl with ice. Place a second bowl inside the first and grind your meat into that. Repeat as needed to keep the meat relatively chilled between each grind.

, Expect any sinew in your meat to dull your grinder’s blade over time. Carefully cut this away with a knife or cleaver before feeding the meat into your grinder. Ensure a better grind (and thus less mess to clean up inside)., Remember: a dull blade will create a bigger mess inside. If your machine seems to be consistently smearing meat around instead of grinding it into small pieces, sharpen the blade or replace it with a new one. However:As long you keep your grinder well maintained and avoid feeding sinew into it, the blade should get sharper and sharper the more you use it. At most, you should only need to sharpen or replace it annually, if that.

Dry the potato off.,
Push the potato into the broken light bulb.,
Use the potato as a handle and twist the broken light out.,
Dispose of the potato and the broken light bulb.",How to Remove a Broken Light Bulb with a Potato," After you've broken a light bulb, it's very important that you turn off the power to that bulb. Without the protective glass bulb, it can be easy to electrocute yourself if you touch the exposed wires of the light bulb. Make sure that the broken light bulb is no longer receiving any power before proceeding.If you aren't sure the power is off, you can try turning off the power at your house's circuit box.
You can try turning off your main breaker to stop the flow of power to the entire house.
Do not remove the light bulb when the power is on. You should be confident that the bulb is turned off.;
, Before you get started removing the broken light bulb, it's a good idea to clean the area up. You don't want to work in a space that has any small pieces of glass laying on the floor. Make sure that the area is glass free and throughly cleaned up before removing the light bulb with a potato.

Broken glass is very sharp and can cut you easily. Make sure you've picked up all the broken pieces of glass.
Put pieces of broken glass into a sturdy container before putting it in your garbage. Loose pieces of glass can cut and injure sanitation workers.

, Once you've turned the power off and cleaned the broken glass away, you can prepare to remove the light bulb. Setting up your workspace can help make the job go smoothly and will let you know if you are missing anything you might need. Make sure you've got the following key items before you get started:

You may need a ladder to reach the bulb.
You will need one potato.
Get a knife ready to cut the potato in half.
Wearing heavy work gloves can help protect you from cuts.
Using safety glasses can help protect your eyes.
Having some basic first aid items can be a good idea.

, In order for this method to properly work, you will need to find a potato that is the right size for your broken light bulb. The potato should be larger than the broken bulb, leaving enough room to comfortably hold onto the potato when it comes time to unscrew the bulb. A potato that is too small might not grip the entire bulb or may be difficult to handle.


If you are unsure of what size potato you might need, pick the largest one you have handy.
You will be cutting the potato in half. Make sure that half of the potato will be large enough to cover the broken bulb.

, Once you've got the perfect potato for the job, you'll need to cut it in half. Don't worry if the cut isn't exactly half of the potato. It's only important that you expose the soft inside area of the potato and that there is enough of it to grip the broken light bulb with. Keep the other half of the potato as a backup.Be careful when cutting the potato.
Don't worry if one half of the potato is bigger than the other. Start by using the bigger half of the potato first.

, Potatoes will often hold a lot of water inside them. Cutting a potato in half will likely release some of this water. A wet or damp potato can be difficult to hold onto when using it to remove a broken light bulb. It's always a good idea to dry the potato off as best you can before taking the light bulb out.


Focus on drying off the parts of the potato that still have skin on them.
You won't be able to fully dry off the exposed, inner part of the potato. However, it can help to get it as dry as you can.

, Now that your potato is ready, you can use it to remove the light. Gently push the cut face of the potato onto the broken part of the light bulb. Slowly apply pressure until the broken parts of the bulb stick firmly into the potato. The potato and the light bulb should feel securely connected.The potato should cover most of the broken areas of the bulb.
Don't smash the potato onto the light. Always use a gentle pushing motion.

, After you've pushed the potato into the light bulb, you can begin twisting the potato and removing the bulb. Twist the potato as if it were part of the bulb and the light bulb will begin to unscrew from the socket. Keep turning the potato until the bulb is fully released from the socket.Work slowly and carefully while remove the bulb.
You will likely need to twist in a counter-clockwise motion.
Be ready for the broken bulb to fall out of the socket.

, Once the light bulb has come out of the socket, you can dispose of both the potato and the bulb. It's a good idea to put both the potato and the bulb in a secure or sturdy container. Both the bulb and the potato are likely to contain shards of broken glass and a sturdy container can help keep everyone safe. After you've wrapped up the potato and the bulb, you can throw them both out as you normally would.Some areas will not recycle broken glass.
Check with your local recycling rules and regulations.

Do a patch test on the carpet with the cleaner.,
Blot the area with cleaner.",How to Remove Fingernail Polish From Carpet1," A fresh nail polish spill is much easier to clean than a dried one, and the trick is to get as much of the polish off the carpet as possible before it dries out. For large spills, use a spoon to scoop up as much of the wet nail polish as you can from the carpet.








Once the spoon is dirty with nail polish, wipe it off before going back to the carpet to get more. This will prevent the nail polish from spreading.;
, Once you’ve picked up as much nail polish as you can with the spoon, absorb even more with an old towel, rag, or cloth. Wrap the cloth around a couple of your fingers and dab the nail polish with the cloth. Do not rub, or you will spread the polish around and work it deeper into the fibers of the carpet.








After each blot, use a new section of cloth to avoid spreading the stain.
Continue dabbing in this way until no more color is coming off on the cloth.

, There are a number of different cleaners you can try to remove fresh nail polish spills from carpet. Avoid using bleach and acetone, as both of these can damage and discolor the carpet. The most effective cleaner will be non-acetone nail polish remover, but you can also try:Rubbing alcohol

Hydrogen peroxide (for light carpets only)
Window cleaner

, It’s important to perform a patch test on fabric before applying new cleaners or products. Dip a cotton swab in nail polish remover or another cleaner, and dab a tiny area of carpet in an inconspicuous area.








A good inconspicuous spot for a test patch includes an area of carpet that’s normally hidden under furniture.
Check back in a couple minutes to see if the area has been discolored or otherwise affected by the cleaner. If the cleaner you chose did discolor the carpet, try something else.
If the carpet hasn’t been damaged or discolored, proceed with cleaning the nail polish.

, Dampen a fresh clean rag or cloth with the nail polish remover or cleaner. Blot at the stain the way you did with the dry towel. Switch to a fresh section of cloth regularly to prevent spreading. Add more nail polish remover to the cloth as necessary, and keep dabbing until the stain is gone.








Avoid pouring nail polish remover and other cleaners directly onto the carpet, as they can soak through and damage the backing.

You can also try trimming out the surface layer of nail polish with scissors, as long as you don’t trim too much. Trimming too wide or too deeply will leave a noticeable mark in the carpet.

, Suck up all the remaining flecks of nail polish that are stuck in the fibers of the carpet after scraping. This will give you a cleaner surface to work with, and make it easier to dissolve the nail polish that’s stained into the carpet.


Vacuuming is particularly important if you used scissors to trim out the nail polish, because bits of carpet and nail polish will be stuck in the fibers.

, Acetone-free nail polish remover will be your best bet for removing the nail polish, because it was designed to dissolve nail polish.

, If you're worried about your carpet, you can dilute it with a little bit of water. A bit of peroxide is another possible additive, but only if your carpet is white -- you don't want to risk making the stain worse.


The smell may seem like it's getting stronger at first. This is only because it's getting wet, rising to the surface, and escaping. Don't freak out yet!

, If you don't have a vacuum, soak up the liquid with a dry towel. A wet-vac will be much more efficient, but a towel can work -- it just may take an hour or two sitting on the stain for the towel to absorb everything.

, Brush it in gently, lifting the soap to the top if any has become entrenched in the fibers. This step may have to be repeated several times to remove the soap from the carpet fiber.


If soap does get left in the carpet, it could harden and lead to slight discoloration. So while this step seems harmless, not doing so may prevent your carpet from returning to good-as-new.

, Don't jump to any conclusions yet -- you don't know what the carpet will be like until it's completely dry. So if the stain or smells persist, give it a bit of time and then try some alternate methods. It may just be a waiting game.

, Why settle for no smells when you can have good smells? Spray some Febreze over the area if you'd like, to seal the deal.

Your first step is to grab some paper towels. If it is a very large spot, you might want to use a cloth towel that you can either immediately wash or throw away.Using paper or cloth towels, wipe up the urine. If the spray has already dried, pour a cup of cold water on the dried spot, then wipe that up with your towels.
If the spot is on the carpet, pour some cold water on the spot. Blot that up with the towels before adding cleaning products.
Blot the stain. Do not rub the stain into carpet, furniture, or other material, such as clothing. That will cause the stain to set, which you want to avoid.;
, There are many products you can purchase that will help you get rid of cat spray odor. It is important to choose a product that does not contain ammonia, so read the ingredients before purchasing. The smell of ammonia can cause cats to repeatedly mark that spot.Choose an enzymatic cleaner. Several different brands make these cleaning sprays. The enzymes effectively break down the compounds in cat urine that create lingering odors.
If you are unsure whether a product is enzymatic, ask a store employee. Most pet stores now stock several brands of these cleaners.
Follow the directions on the bottle. Spray the soiled area, allow to soak in, then blot with clean towels.
If the sprayed area is on carpet or a rug, follow the same instructions. Then vacuum the area to help thoroughly remove the stain.

, If you don't want to use a chemical cleaner, you can make your own natural cleaning solution. Mix 100 ml of white vinegar with 200 ml of warm water. Place in a clean, empty spray bottle and shake well.After you have wiped up the urine, spray your cleaning mixture on the soiled area. Blot dry with clean cloths or paper towels.
You can also mix 5.5 oz of hydrogen peroxide with 1 tablespoon of baking soda. In a clean plastic container, such as a small bucket, add 1 squirt of liquid hand soap.
Mix well with a wooden or plastic spoon. Using a clean cloth, apply the mixture to the stain. Then rinse the area well with warm water.
Do not apply a mixture containing hydrogen peroxide to carpet without doing a ""spot test"" first. In an inconspicuous area, such as a closet, apply the cleaner to make sure that it does not bleach or discolor the carpet.

, Cat spray stains are among the most stubborn. If the odor is not gone, you may need to repeat the process. Simply make sure the spot is thoroughly dried, then repeat the above steps with your chosen cleaning product.Sometimes the problem might be that you are not sure where your cat sprayed. If you don't know the location of the spray, you might not be able to clean as thoroughly as you would like.
Use a portable black light to help you find the stain. Cat spray will appear on furniture or walls as a yellow spot or splatter. Many pet stores sell small, inexpensive black lights.

, If the cat spray has not been regularly cleaned, it might be a good idea to seek outside help. For instance, maybe you have moved into a ""new"" apartment where a spraying cat used to reside. It's going to be very difficult to remove the smell on your own.Look for a cleaning service that lists ""pet odor removal"" as a specialty. Professional cleaning services will have equipment and chemicals that are more effective at removing set in stains.
Ask friends or co-workers to recommend a reputable cleaning service. When you contact the service, don't hesitate to ask for a free estimate.

, The best way to get rid of cat spray odor is to remove the scent by cleaning thoroughly. However, that can sometimes take several attempts, and even professional help. In the meantime, there are several things you can do to help reduce the odor and make your home livable.Use an air freshener that contains baking soda. The main component, sodium bicarbonate, is very effective at absorbing odors.
You can make a homemade air freshener to sprinkle on your carpets. Combine 1 cup of any dried herbs (such as lavender, rosemary, etc.), 1 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon baking soda.
Sprinkle the mixture onto carpet and allow to sit for 20 minutes. Then vacuum up the remaining powder. You can make this mixture at any time and store it in an airtight container.

, Fresh air is one of the most effective ways to get rid of any household odor, including cat spray. Open several windows around your home. Try opening some at each end of your home to create a cross-breeze.Make a habit of opening your windows for at least a few minutes each day, even when it is cold out. The fresh air will help keep scents from lingering.
You could also invest in an air purifier. Many of these devices will help keep your household smelling fresh. Check out several models to see which would work best for you.

, Candles won't remove cat spray odor, but it can help you cover it. For example, maybe you need some relief from the smell while you are cleaning. Or perhaps company arrives unexpectedly and you need to freshen the air quickly. A candle can work well in these situations.When purchasing a candle, sniff before you buy. If you can't detect a strong scent from the jar, you likely won't get a strong scent when the candle is burning.
Consider a scent that smells fresh. Many candles are available in scents such as fresh linen or ocean fresh. These would likely cover cat spray odor most effectively.

, An important part of keeping your home smelling fresh is to keep it as clean as possible. If you don't know exactly where your cat is spraying, you should make it a habit to keep hard surfaces very clean. This will help keep odors from setting.Make it part of your daily routine to wipe down counters and bathroom surfaces. Once a week (or month, depending on need), wipe down walls and hard floors.
You can make your own cleaner by mixing equal parts white vinegar and water. Use clean clothes to apply the mixture to hard surfaces.

, The most effective way to keep your home from smelling like cat urine is to prevent spraying in the first place. One of the best ways to do that is to make sure that your cat is happy with his litter box situation. Cats are very particular about their bathroom needs.If your cat is spraying, ask yourself if his box is clean enough. You may need to change the litter more often and scoop the box more frequently.
If your cat started spraying after you switched litters, he may not like the new brand. Try a new product to see if he reacts more favorably to a different kind of litter.
Consider getting another litter box. If space allows, give your cat another option for elimination. This may reduce his desire to go elsewhere.

, Most cats who spray are males who have not been neutered. It is a way to mark territory. If your cat has not been neutered, ask your vet about the procedure. It will likely stop the spraying. Cats may spray because of health issues. If this behavior is unusual for your cat, consult your vet to see if there is an underlying problem.

, Cats often spray because of stress or anxiety. For example, if you have recently moved or introduced a new pet into the home, your cat might react by spraying. Try to give your cat some extra affection.If the cause of anxiety isn't immediately evident, ask yourself some questions. Has your cat's routine changed? Is it possible that he is being bullied by another cat in the neighborhood?

Allow to air dry.",How to Get Rid of the Smell of Vomit in a Carpet2," Using 100% detergent isn't safe for all types of carpet, so create a solution that's 1 part detergent to 2 parts water. Using a bristled brush, gently scrub the detergent into the stain, making sure to get the edges as well as the inside.

, Or use your shop vac, whichever. But if you only have a towel, apply it to the stain, keeping constant pressure on it. Continue applying pressure until the stain is virtually dry and the towel has soaked up everything.

, This type of cleaner can be found in pretty much any cleaning aisle or with the pet products -- it's stuff that will say something along the lines of, ""Blasts away bad smells!"" on the label; Kids ‘n Pets and Nature’s Miracle are two well-known examples. They break down the proteins that cause odors and can help with stains, too.


Be sure to leave it on for a few hours, giving it time to take hold. And when we say ""wet,"" we mean wet. Thoroughly saturated. Don't worry about rationing the bottle for the next time. The entire area should be bordering on soaked.

, After those few fateful hours have passed, dry the area with a towel or your wet/dry vacuum. Again, if you're using a towel, be patient. It may take applying constant pressure for an hour or so to truly dry the area.

, As it dries, brush it in with a bristly brush (use an old toothbrush if you're in a tight spot). Make sure to get the edges as well as the inside -- sometimes the ring of the stain is the hardest to treat area.

, It's dried, done its business, hardened, and now it's ready to scrape up. Take a butter knife and get what solid bits you can -- hopefully the smell will go with it!

, What you can't get with your hands will need to be vacuumed up. If it all comes up well and good and the smell is gone, wahoo! But if not, wet the area with a damp cloth and vacuum again. That ought to do it!


Febreze the area to cover your bases. If the smell persists, wait until it's completely dry before you jump to any conclusions. Wet carpet can smell very bad, but the smell can (and probably will) disappear when dry.

Dab the stain with rubbing alcohol.",How to Get Tar out of Carpet2," Even if blotting and scraping removed most of the chunks of tar in your carpet, your carpet still may be stained a dark black from the pigment of the tar. To begin to target this pigmentation using dry cleaning solvent, pour water over a cloth rag, then add a few teaspoons of dry cleaning solvent to one area of the wetted rag.Dry cleaning solvent is a powerful agent that is designed to remove especially stubborn stains from a variety of surfaces, including carpet.

, After you have applied the water and dry cleaning solvent to the cloth, dab gently at the stain. Be sure to dab the tar with the area of cloth on which you poured the dry cleaning solution.

Keep children and pets away from carpeted areas topped with store-bought solution, as the chemicals can be bad if inhaled or ingested.

, The stain should blot away. If you can still see it, apply the solution again and continue blotting once it has soaked for the recommended amount of time.


Keep a dry cloth or rag nearby if you have to keep applying solution to the stain. Frequently blot the area with your dry cloth to prevent the carpet from getting soaked.

, Blot the area dry with a clean paper towel or washcloth to dry the carpet.


Dab and blot the stained area to lift the stain. You don’t want to rub the area as that may soak the stain into the fibers of the carpet.
Mix in 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of white vinegar to your water if the stain is proving tough to remove.

, Quickly go over the area with a vacuum to straighten the carpet back up and to prevent any part of the stain still remaining deep in the carpet from rising up to view.

Remove hair from the drain.,
Apply a drain cleaner.,
Rinse with hot water.",How to Clean a Shower1," Take apart a wire hanger or use a thin, long item such as a knitting hook. Grab a garbage can or a plastic bag to put the hair in. Then unscrew the cap on your drain or just reach in, depending on the style of your drain. Pull the hair out and throw it away. Keep pulling the hair out until the drain is clear.








Hair should be removed from drains on a weekly basis to keep your drains clear.;
, You can opt for a commercial brand, or you can make your own by adding ¼ cup (59 milliliters) of ammonia to a quart (1 liter) of boiling water. Pour in the cleaner to dissolve any remaining clogs.








Use a drain cleaner about once a month to prevent major clogs. With proper cleaning, your drains should continue to work well. If a drain becomes too clogged, you may need to call a plumber., Turn on the faucet and clear the drain with clean water. If the drain backs up again during rinsing, repeat the steps to remove the clog.








"
"
Understand why the clogging has happened.,
Unscrew the swivel ball nut that holds the shower head to the mounting collar.,
Before you disassemble the shower head, make a note of how it went together.,
Completely immerse the disassembled parts in white vinegar or a lime cleaning solution.,
If, after soaking, you discover that some areas still need some attention, scrub stubborn deposits with a small wire brush or the straightened end of a paper clip.,
Use the diagram to reassemble the shower head.",How to Clean a Heavily Clogged Up Shower Head1," Mineral deposits collect in the fine mesh and holes of the shower head's screening material and disk, disrupting water flow. This usually consists of hardened lime and particulate matter.;
, Then remove it. The internal parts will come apart easily, but getting the shower head off the pipe may require a wrench.

, This will let you know how to reassemble it once the parts have been cleaned. The washer will seat with a specific orientation, so be sure to note which way it was turned. Draw a diagram of the parts and where they go, to ensure you don't forget (take a digital photo of this diagram and you'll always be able to find it for each subsequent clean).

, If you see a large buildup of lime, heat the vinegar in the microwave beforehand until it's hot to the touch. The cleaning process will probably take five or six hours, so plan on performing the repair when the shower won't be needed. Most of the lime will dissolve, although there may be residue caught in the screen's mesh, embedded in the threads, and in the small holes around the disk.

, Soak the parts again for a few minutes and rinse.

, Apply silicone grease to the threads. Turn the water on and inspect for leaks. In order to keep the shower head flowing freely, plan on making this a yearly chore. This procedure will also work on faucets, toilets, and your refrigerator's water dispenser. If you can't immerse an object in vinegar, saturate a cloth and wrap it around the area you want to clean.

Get your carpet cleaned every year.,
Place mats in high-risk areas.,
Vacuum frequently.,
Keep a dehumidifier running in your house.,
Clean all prospective stains immediately.",How to Get Stains Out of Carpet6," While stains are one thing, taking time to care for your carpet as a whole will ensure it gets its best possible longevity. Getting your carpet cleaned every 12-18 months is optimal. You can either hire a professional cleaning company or buy a carpet cleaning machine. It's generally recommended you hire a pro if you can afford the expense. A professional job will ensure the carpet is as clean a it can be, and minimizes the risk of complications. , The best way to solve a stain is to prevent it outright. Unlike a carpet, a mat can be easily thrown into the laundry or cleaned by hand. Placing mats in areas with a high risk for stains and you may well save yourself time and stress in the future.


The front door to your home is a choice area to place a mat; not only is it one of the most highly-trafficked areas in your home, it'll also come with the threat of dirt and mud trailed in from the outside.
Placing mats beside kitchen and bathroom sinks is a good way to trap water. The same goes beside baths and showers, as anyone using the shower will track water and suds with them when they get out.

, If you have carpets, vacuuming is an absolute must. Dust and dirt can get trailed in and make your carpet feel gritty pretty fast. Vacuuming every day or two will ensure your carpet's always looking and feeling its best. If you don't have the time to vacuum regularly, investing in a robotic automatic vacuum is relatively inexpensive and a great way to keep your carpets clean without having to invest a great deal of time into it.

, Left for more than 24 hours, wet or damp carpet will encourage mildew and bacterial growth. Needless to say, this isn't the sort of thing you want in your home. A dehumidifier will help suck up excess moisture if your home has a tendency for such.

, Stains become much more permanent the longer they're left unattended. If you solve them as soon as they first happen, you'll be saved a lot of trouble in the future.

Blot the stain.,
Mix your ingredients.,
Mix baking soda and white vinegar.,
Use hydrogen peroxide instead of bleach.,
Blot your stain with your solution.",How to Clean Carpet Stains2," With a dry or slightly damp rag or paper towel, blot your stain as soon as possible. Work from the outside of the stain in.


Make sure that you have a white rag or paper towel that doesn’t have any printing on it. Any color on your rag or paper towel could rub off and get into your carpet.






Use lukewarm water to blot the stain if you dampen your rag. Warmer water will be more effective for dissolving materials., You can make an effective stain-fighting solution with many products that may already be in your home. Items like baking soda, white vinegar, and hydrogen peroxide all contain chemicals to fight stains.


Either use an empty spray bottle, or mix in a large bowl that you can dip your cloth in.

, Add equal parts of baking soda and white vinegar, about ¼ teaspoon of each for every 1 cup (240 ml) of water. Stir thoroughly, or pour into a spray bottle and shake.


Use warm water. Warm water will help the baking soda and vinegar to dissolve faster.
Add a drop or two of lemon essential oil to add a nice smell.
This mixture is great for everything from chocolate stains to urine., For tougher stains and brightening of your carpet, mix a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution in with clear dish soap and warm water.Add equal parts of hydrogen peroxide and water.
You can also substitute 2-3 drops of non-bleaching laundry detergent to your solution instead of dish soap.
Hydrogen peroxide is especially effective against blood stains.

, Either spray your cleaning solution onto the affected area and let it sit for 1o-15 fifteen minutes, or dip your rag into the solution and begin blotting.If you are blotting with a damp cloth, have another cloth nearby which is dry. After you see the stain starting to lift, blot the stain with your dry cloth or rag so the carpet doesn’t get too wet.
Once your stain is lifted, you can vacuum the area to further clean and lift the carpet fibers. Pour some baking soda or powdered carpet cleaner down for further cleaning before vacuuming.

, Using a bucket or cup, splash the shower walls and tub with hot water. If you have a handheld shower head, they work very well. You don't need to be perfect with this step; you just want to get all the hair, dirt, and other particles down the drain and out of your way.









Rinse your walls and tub once a week between deep cleanings to maintain cleanliness. For best results, use a cleaner that helps prevent mildew and soap scum.
Deep clean your shower and tub once a month.

, If you have a window, open it as well for extra ventilation. Cleaning products can be dangerous if you inhale them, so leave the room if you start to feel lightheaded or nauseous.If your bathroom has a fan, turn it on to help with ventilation.

, Mentally divide your shower so that you can make your cleaning task more manageable. Cleaning in sections will prevent the product from drying before you have a chance to work it into the surface.If you have a bathtub, include it in your sections.

, Let it soak for 5-10 minutes, unless the package recommends a different amount of soak time.








Make sure that your cleaning agent is appropriate for the type of material that your shower is made from. Never use acids like vinegar, ammonia, and normal bathroom cleaners on marble. Only use products that are labeled for use on marble.
Make your own cleaning agent by mixing 1 cup (237 milliliters) of vinegar, 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) baking soda, 1 cup (237 milliliters) ammonia, and 1-1/2 gallons (5.5 liters) of hot water.

, Use a sponge, cloth, or soft bristle brush and make tight, circular strokes. If your shower is very dirty, then you may need to rinse your sponge, cloth, or bristle brush in-between passes.








Don’t use hard bristle brushes, and never use metal scrubbers. These can scratch your walls and tub.

, Use your cup or bucket to splash water on the wall, removing the remaining cleaning agent and the grime.








If you have a detachable shower head, then use that to rinse the shower wall instead.
If your shower wall still looks dirty, then re-apply the cleaning agent and repeat the process.

, Spray the next section, let it soak, rub in the cleaner, and rinse for each of the three to four sections., If you have grout, clean it with bleach and a small scrub brush. Mix two parts water and one part bleach. Use a grout scrubber to clean the grout with your mixture.

Run clean water through your shower head.",How to Clean a Shower4," The amount of vinegar that you need will depend on how big your shower head is. You need just enough vinegar to cover the end of the shower head where the water sprays out.








You can use any plastic bag, but a storage bag is more likely to be leak-proof.
Clean your shower head once a month to keep your water flowing well and to prevent mildew.

, Make sure that your shower head is submerged in the vinegar. If you need to, remove the bag and add more vinegar to cover the spray area.







, Place your rubber band above the shower head so that the bag stays in place while allowing the shower head to fully soak in the vinegar.








If you don’t have a rubber band, you can tie off your bag with anything that will hold it in place.

, Let your shower head soak in the vinegar overnight. In the morning, pour the vinegar down the drain and throw away or recycle the bag.

If you have any empty or worn-out items, throw them away.
If you have a shower curtain, it’s best to take it down and clean it.;
, A pre-rinse will ensure that you do not accidentally grind dirt or debris into the surface of your tub. It also allows the cleaning product to work directly on the stuck-on grime., Open the bathroom door to prevent the air from building up. Then turn on your fan. If you have a window in your bathroom, open it as well. While you’ll be using a natural cleaning solution, it’s still strong and will release fumes that you’ll want to air out., The dish detergent will cut through the oils and grease that make up your soap scum, making it easier to wipe away the stuck on grime.You can use any dish detergent that is formulated to cut through grease.
If you use too much detergent in your cleaning solution, it will not ruin your cleaner; however, the cleaning solution will be harder to wash away.

, In addition to attacking bacteria and mildew, white vinegar is great for clearing away soap scum and lime deposits.While the smell may be off-putting, it evaporates away once the vinegar dries.

If the smell of the vinegar really bothers you, try adding a few drops of a pure essential oil, such as lemon or orange oil.

, Set the timer for 1 minute to warm the vinegar. Warm vinegar is easier to mix than cool vinegar, so it will help you create a better cleaning solution.You don’t need to boil your vinegar.
Depending on the strength of your microwave, you may want to warm your vinegar in 30 second intervals to make sure that it reaches a slightly warm temperature rather than getting too hot or not getting warm enough.

, Blend the two ingredients using a swirling motion. Continue moving the bottle until they are completely blended. Avoid shaking the bottle because it will cause excessive sudsing. Your end result should be a slightly foamy substance that is lightly tinted the color of your detergent.You can increase or decrease the quantity of cleaner that you prepare by adjusting the amount of the ingredients as long as you maintain the 3 to 1 ratio of white vinegar to detergent.
If you’d prefer, there are several non-abrasive commercial options available that are safe for fiberglass. Check the label to make sure that the product does not contain abrasive cleaning agents or bleach.

, Spray your vinegar-detergent mixture onto the shower and tub surfaces. Allow it to set for 10-15 minutes so that the ingredients have time to penetrate the dried on soap scum, mildew, and mineral deposits.If your shower doesn’t have soap scum, mildew, and mineral deposits, then you don’t need to let the product set.

, Scrub your shower surfaces with your non-abrasive applicator, paying special attention to areas with thicker grime. As you clean, apply additional cleaning solution as needed. For example, if your cleaner dries before you get to that section, you can apply additional cleaner.Do not scrub with hard-bristle brushes, scouring pads, or metal pads because they will scratch your fiberglass.

, Use a cup to splash cold water onto all of the surfaces to remove the cleaning solution and the grime. You will likely need to rinse areas more than once to remove all of the product.If you have a handheld shower head, you can use it instead of a cup.

, Pour 1 cup (237 milliliters) of baking soda into a bowl. Add a few drops of water at a time, blending until you have a paste. Your paste should be spreadable but still sticky enough to stick to shower surfaces., Smoothe on a generous amount of the paste to any remaining soap scum, which includes tub rings or rings around the drain in your shower pan.Pretend you are icing a cake. Your paste should be spread on in a thin layer.

, The baking soda needs time to break down the soap scum. While it dries, avoid spraying water or other cleaners in the shower., Add a little water to the paste to re-moisten the baking soda. Make tight, circular movements with your scrubber as you work in the paste., Use your cup to splash water onto the paste. With a clean cloth, wipe away the baking soda. Rinse the cloth frequently to remove the baking soda residue.When all of the baking soda is gone, do a final rinse with cold water.

, If you weren't able to address a spill immediately, you can use one of any number of standard household cleaners after checking the back label to make sure they are compatible with laminate. If you don't have a solution you can mix soap with warm water, or add several tablespoons of vinegar to a cup of warm water.Most standard cleaners will be compatible. Laminate usually tolerates everything from soap to vinegar to even bleach.If you are ever unsure about any cleaning solution, test it in an inconspicuous spot first. , Use a non-abrasive sponge or towel to clean the laminate.If you are using your own solution, wet your sponge and spread it over the laminate. Allow it to sit and soak in a moment before scrubbing. If you are using a pre mixed solution, spray it over the laminate and give it a moment before scrubbing.


Use a soft used toothbrush to scrub along seams and metal edging. , Once you have washed the laminate, you should rinse the surface with water to remove any remaining residue of your cleaning solution. Warm water and a soft towel are great for this.

, Use a soft dry towel to dry the laminate if you desire. You could also let it air dry, but drying it yourself will help you see whether or not there are any remaining stains. Assuming that there aren't any stains left, you are done!

Run the jets for another 10 minutes.,
Drain the tub.,
Get ready.",How to Clean a Jetted Tub1," If you didn't panic and drain that tub the moment you saw the gunk, don't! If you did, no problem—fill the tub with hot water to approximately 4 inches (10 cm) above the highest jets.;
, This will ensure that only water is going through the pipes instead of being mixed with air. Some feel that opening up the air induction port is more effective, as it increases the turbulence. If your tub has cleaning instructions, follow the guidelines listed there.

, Use about 1/4 cup (50ml) of a low-foaming surfactant such as powdered dishwasher detergent to the water. Cascade Complete is a good choice—it's based on enzymatic action rather than acidic action. Acidic detergent will eventually strip the sealant on the brass, and it will tarnish. In an emergency, though, any dishwashing detergent will work.

, Bleach is an excellent disinfectant. Some manufacturers do not recommend bleach as it may eventually dry out the internal gaskets. In an emergency, it'll work well. Then check with your tub's manufacturer to see what they recommend for ongoing maintenance.

, Set the jets to the highest pressure, and turn it on. Be of strong stomach—you will probably see some nasty stuff jetting out. This is good: it's better than lingering in your pipes.

, Clean out the residue, and refill it with cold water—above the jets again.

, You want to rinse everything out, thoroughly.

, Clean it thoroughly—it should be ready to use now.

, Fill the tub back up with steamy water. (You can hit the jets for a test, if you like—no more surprises!) Dim the lights, relight the candles, turn on the music, pour another glass of wine, power up the jets, and slip into bliss. You earned it!

Consider flushing the lines of your tub before draining.,
Turn off power to your hot tub.Forgetting to cut power to your tub could result in its pump kicking on when there's not enough water, which could do damage to the motor of your hot tub pump and filter mechanism.,
Drain the water in your tub.,
Apply a hot tub cleaner to the surface of the tub.,
Remove and thoroughly clean your filter(s).,
Run your filter(s) through your dishwasher.,
Reinstall your filters.,
Isolate problem areas with effective cleaners.,
Add water to the designated water line for your tub.,
Return power to your hot tub.,
Treat the water with the chemicals recommended for your tub.,
Sanitize the hot tub on a weekly basis.,
Clean the hot tub filter once every month.,
Clean the hot tub shell every three months.Most acrylic shells are resistant to bacteria, mold, and other kinds of buildup.,
Clean the hot tub cover monthly.",How to Clean a Hot Tub," Hot tubs run at a temperature at which many kinds of mold, bacteria, and other organisms can flourish. These substances can build up in the inner workings of your hot tub. You can keep your tub cleanest by regularly running special cleaner through its lines, a process called ""flushing the lines,"" to eject and cleanse bacteria and gunk.


A line flush for your hot tube should be available at your local pool supply store, but may also be available at your local hardware. Be sure you specify that you need a line flush for a hot tub, as many different kinds of line flush exist.
Depending on the line flush you purchase, the procedure for application may vary. Generally, you'll add the flush to your hot tube while it is running for a period of time indicated in the instructions of the flush treatment.
Lines that have build up can result in decreased jet pressure, cloudiness in the water, or increased pressure (and strain) on your pump motor. Flushing your lines will help your tub run smoothly and efficiently.;
, To ensure your tub is completely off, you may want to go to the fuse box and flip the breaker for the circuit that's supplying it power to the ""OFF"" position.


Turning off the circuit breaker as well as switching your tub to off can prevent others from accidentally turning it on if you take a break when cleaning or have to leave to pick up more supplies. A damaged pump can be an expensive and unnecessary expense.

, This should be done according to the directions that came with your hot tub. Most often this involves the use of a built in sump pump or a drain plug to remove the water from the reservoir of your tub.Many manufacturers also recommend leaving the foot-well of your tub full of water.If flushing your lines has released a cloudy discharge into the water, you may have to completely empty your hot tub of water. After doing so, you should rinse your tub to remove any remaining line particles. Then you can fill the foot-well of your tub, if necessary.

, In many cases, specially formulated hot tub cleaners will easily cut through dirtiness. These special cleaners will also protect the shell of your tub from damage that can be caused by abrasive particles in other cleaners.Spray down the interior of your tub with a hose to moisten it, and then scrub with your cleaner and a rag or sponge.


Acrylic hot tub shells are resistant to buildup and germ aggregation. If your tub has an acrylic shell, you may be able to clean your hot tub with a mild, general purpose bathroom cleaner.For more thorough cleaning you can mix a batch of chlorine solution that is 50 parts per million (ppm). You can create this mixture simply by mixing ¼ teaspoon of dichlor into 5 gallons (19 L) of water.After cleaning the inner shell of your hot tub, you should thoroughly rinse it out and wipe it down with an old towel. Leaving behind cleaner can affect the chemical balance of your hot tub, which can hurt your water clarity or create an environment where mold or bacteria could grow., These are often accessible through an access panel or cabinet located around your pump. Some filters may require you to unscrew or unfasten catches that hold the filter casing in place. You may want to take a picture of the filter assembly before you begin to take it apart so you know how it's supposed to look when fully assembled. After you have removed your filter(s) you should:


Spray your filter(s) off with a jet of water. A normal, high-pressure garden hose nozzle should be sufficient to remove most residue from the filter. Do not use a brush on your filter; this can cause dirt to become deeply entrenched in it.
Scrub the inside of your filter cabinet with your tub cleaner or a 50 ppm dichlor/water solution. Bacteria or organic matter, like mold, can grow in the housing of your filter. Even if it appears clean at a glance, give it a good scrub to keep it that way.
Place your filter for at least an hour in an oil cutting solution. The appropriate solution for your tub make and model will likely be in your hot tub instruction manual, but if not a representative at your local pool supply store can help you find the right one for your tub.
Disinfect your filter(s) in a chlorine solution. A 50 ppm chlorine solution works well to disinfect and break up any grime that remains after your oil cutting soak. You can create this mixture simply by mixing ¼ teaspoon of dichlor into 5 gallons (19 L) of water., This is an alternative to soaking your filter(s) in an oil cutting solution and disinfecting with a dichlor/water rinse. First you'll want to remove as much grime from it as you can by spraying the filter(s) with a high-powered stream of water from a hose. Once you have removed as much grime as possible, put your filter by itself into your dishwasher. Then:


Use the normal amount of detergent and turn off the heat-dry cycle. Run your filter through the dishwasher twice for best results.
In between wash cycles, you'll want to turn your filter over. This will ensure that your filter gets cleaned all over thoroughly and completely.
Check your instruction manual before attempting to clean your filter in your dishwasher. Some hot tubs might not be designed to withstand the sanitizing temperatures of your dishwasher., This may be as easy as sliding the filter(s) into a coupling and pressing the covering panel back in place, but you may need to consult the picture you took of the filter fully assembled for more complicated designs. Be sure that all necessary parts and fasteners are in place and secure.

, Some dirtiness in your hot tub can be most effectively cleaned by the use of specific cleaning agents. For example, white water lines can be dissolved with a 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water. Simply apply the vinegar/water solution to the afflicted area with a sponge or rag and scrub or wipe it clean. You should also:


Use baking soda for busting up gunk and and organic goo. The extra abrasion of baking soda in addition to its cleaning properties will help your rag or sponge cut through the dirtiness, but is gentle enough that it should leave your acrylic shell unaffected.
Apply olive oil to sap or pitch that has gotten on your hot tub or hot tub cover. Rub the oil into the stained area until the sap/pitch begins to break up, then wipe the surface clean with a rag, mild soap, and water., You'll want to run the water you are adding to your tub through the filter(s) of it first. Place your hose inside the well of your filter housing so that the water flows through the filter(s) of your tub, into its lines, and finally into the reservoir of the tub., If you have turned the circuit breaker for your hot tub off, you'll need to set this to ""ON"" before reactivating your tub. Allow your hot tub to run a few minutes while you listen to the pump/filter for any odd noises. These can be indicators that you've improperly reinstalled the filter or haven't fastened the catches holding it in place properly.


You'll also want to turn all the air valves of your hot tub off. This will prevent your hot tub from aerating too much when you treat your hot tub water., The recommended combination for your hut tub will vary according to your model, but you can generally assume the need for a shock agent, a sanitizer, and potentially a pH balancer. Cover your now clean hot tub after adding your treatment chemicals and wait the time designated on the treatment instructions.


Test your hot tub after the shock/sanitization wait time has elapsed. Make sure that the chlorine and pH levels are acceptable for your hot tub. The appropriate levels are usually indicated in your hot tub user manual/instructions., Depending on the size of your hot tub and the chemicals you are using to treat the water, there are many small differences in how you might do this. In most cases, you will only need to add a chlorine or bromine tablet to the hot tub every week to keep the water clean and sparkling.



Never mix treatments that are not specifically indicated as compatible. Using the wrong mix of water treating chemicals can result in serious danger., The filter is a part of the hot tub intentionally designed to trap particles. This being the case, you should clean your filter at least once a month, though you might consider cleaning every two weeks for heavily used tubs. A clean filter will not only ensure proper hot tub function, it will also prolong the life of your filters., However, by wiping down your hot tub regularly, you'll be preventing buildup from happening before it becomes thick and difficult to remove.

, The outside part of the hot tub cover is the most exposed to sunlight and the elements, so it's prone to collecting things like dirt and sap. Wipe down the cover at least once per month. Vinyl protectant is available for the outside of your hot tub cover and will help keep it from developing unsightly cracks.


Clean the underside of the hot tub cover by taking the cover off the tub, and spraying it with a hose. Cleaners are not needed for this side of the cover."

, Separate the curtain and liner, then spread them out. Drape each around the agitator in your washer, or loosely place them in the tub if you don’t have an agitator.








, Towels will help remove some of the stains from your curtain and liner because they will scrub against them in the wash. Use medium to large bath towels.







, Unless the label specifies otherwise, you can wash your shower curtain and liner with your normal laundry detergent. Avoid using fabric softener., If none is recommended, wash on a normal setting. If you are washing your (non-color) liner without your shower curtain, then treat it like you would your whites, washing it on hot with optional bleach.

, Shower curtains and liners can easily shrink, so follow the care directions on your items. If you choose to tumble dry your liner and curtain, do it in 15 minute increments because they will dry quickly."

, It's essential to use the right stain-removal techniques for a type of carpet. For example, natural fibers, such as wool or grass, can react badly to liquid stain removers (see the warning below concerning these chemicals), and you should always think twice before cleaning antique carpets or valuable rugs. If in doubt, call a professional carpet cleaner.

, Dry stains need to be prepared for cleaning, so simply moisten a clean cloth with warm--not hot--water, and gently dab it onto the stain.

, Add ¼ teaspoon mild detergent or carpet shampoo to 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of cold water. Stir the solution in a bowl to mix thoroughly.

, Before you apply any cleaner--including the one in these directions--to your carpet, test the cleaner in a small patch where no one will see it. Wait a few minutes. If the cleaner discolors or otherwise adversely affects the carpet, remove it immediately with cold water and a sponge. If it ends up causing permanent damage, at least it won't be right in the middle of the room.

, Moisten a clean cloth liberally with the cleaning solution, and simply lay the cloth over the stain.

, Use the bottom of a spoon to gently press down on the cloth. Gradually work your way all over the cloth, starting on the outside and working your way toward the center in a spiral to prevent spreading the stain.

Allow the sealer to soak for 15 minutes.,
Wipe off excess sealer on the surface of your shower.,
Allow the sealer to set for 24 hours.",How to Clean a Marble Shower3," Unless you have a white marble shower, you should not seal your shower.You should also not seal your shower if there is already an existing seal on it. Test to see if there is sealer by putting a couple of drops of water onto the surface of the shower and allowing the water to dry for ten minutes. If the area is dark, it means that your marble has absorbed the water and most likely needs to be sealed again. If the sealer has pooled on top of your marble, it means that it's already sealed.If your shower is already sealed, there's no reason to do it again, and it can actually be detrimental to your marble.

, The first step before you seal your shower is to make sure that all the dust and dirt that may be built up is removed before you seal it in. Wipe down your shower with a damp rag and water, then dry it with a clean rag. Make sure that your shower is dry and free of dirt before you start sealing.

Stir to ensure that the solution is evenly mixed., Dishwashing detergents and liquid laundry detergents are gentle enough for use on fiberglass shower pans. They are also generally cheaper than specialized bathroom cleaning products.Do not use bleach based products or scouring powders to clean fiberglass.

, Mix half a cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water. Mix the water and baking soda until it develops the consistency of paste., Bathroom cleaners and all-purpose cleaners are generally gentle enough for use on fiberglass surfaces, but are sometimes reputed to be unnecessarily expensive., Magic Erasers are soft sponges with cleaning solutions inside. They only need to be wet to be used. They are gentle enough for fiberglass and very good at picking up heavy stains. , Use a sponge made of nylon, polyester, or polyethylene. Other cleaners can be too abrasive for fiberglass. If you are using a Magic Eraser, wet it instead., Depending upon the solution, either spray it on the sponge or dunk the sponge in it. If you are using a Magic Eraser, skip this step., Rub the pan with a set pattern, to ensure that you do not miss any spots. Begin, for example, in the far right corner, then work your way to the far left corner. Scrub back and forth this way, moving closer each time you hit the end of the pan until you reach the corners on the opposite end., Squeeze your sponge out into a nearby sink and then rewet it. Apply more cleaning solution to the sponge before going back to cleaning the tub. Clean the sponge like this a couple of times during the process of scrubbing the tub.

, After you have scrubbed the entire tub, turn on the water to wash out the cleaning solution. If this does not sufficiently clean out the pan, use a new sponge to wipe up the remainder of the solution.

, Use a sponge to spread the cleaning solution you selected throughout the entire pan. Follow all the preceding steps, except washing out the pan. , If you allow the solution to sit, it will continue to remove dirt. This will get the pan cleaner than if you remove the solution immediately after wiping it down. , After the solution has sat for about an hour, turn on the water to wash off the solution. Use a clean sponge to pick up any of the solution that remains in the pan.

, If there is a stain that remains despite all your best efforts, cover a white cloth with nail polish remover. Rub the spot lightly with the cloth until the spot has been removed. Then, wash the nail polish remover off the pan with a clean sponge or cloth.Although nail polish remover is not bad for the fiberglass, it should be used as a last resort because it can be bad for you. It is highly flammable, so do not use it near fire, or a heat source.
Because the substance is toxic, do you not allow it to wash down the drain. Use a cloth to pick it up after you are done.

, To maintain the shiny finish of the fiberglass, apply automotive white wax. Wash the pan down with a wet rag and then use a rag to lightly apply the wax to dull or scratched areas.Some manufacturers recommend that you perform this treatment twice a year.

, If you want your pan to keep its shiny appearance all the time, keep a squeegee in the shower. When you finish taking your showers, use the squeegee to pick up moisture and dry off the pan., Fiberglass is fragile and can easily be scratched up. Never use scouring powders, scouring pads, steel wool, scrapers, or bleach to clean fiberglass."

Make sure to wipe around the drain.
If your sink is especially dirty, you may need to switch out for a fresh cloth.
In many cases, it is best to wipe the sink down when it is dry, so you’ll be able to remove hair, grime, and other debris easily.
Wipe down the sink on a daily basis, if needed.;
, Make sure to rinse the sink before you use a bathroom cleaning product. If you don’t rinse the sink, you’ll have to contend with a lot of dirt when you spray the sink down.









Turn on the faucet and run hot water into the sink. Hot water will loosen soap scum, grime, and dirt.
Splash the water around the surface – including the sides – of the sink.
You may need to use a clean cotton cloth to wipe down the sides of the sink with hot water., Choose a bathroom cleaner of your choice and liberally spray the sink. Make sure to get all parts of the sink, including the faucet and behind the faucet.









Most bathroom cleaners are formulated to clean bathroom sinks. You may be able to use a tub and tile cleaner or a cleaner formulated for the type of material you sink is made of. In most cases, this is porcelain.
Make sure the cleaner is a disinfectant. This is important as bathroom sinks can potentially accumulate a variety of germs., After spraying your cleaner, take a clean cloth and wipe down the entire surface of your sink. Pay special attention to especially dirty areas and apply pressure when you need.









You may need to use several clean cloths.
If you need to spray more cleaner while you’re wiping the sink down, do so., If your bathroom sink is still dirty after you’ve done a light clean, you should sprinkle baking all over the sink. Cover as much of the surface as you can. The abrasive force of the baking soda will help remove tough stains.









Make sure the sink is dry before you sprinkle the baking soda.
Use as much baking soda as you need to cover the surface area of the sink. Take care to sprinkle some baking soda into the grout ring around the drain., Take a clean cloth and scrub the sink down. You may have to apply a lot of pressure in areas that are particularly dirty. Without scrubbing your baking soda into the sink, you won’t be able to remove all stains.









Swirl your cloth around in circles while you rub the baking soda into the surface of the sink.
Consider using a regular cotton cloth. Microfiber may not have the abrasive power you need to remove some stains.
In some instances, you may need to use a mildly abrasive dish sponge., After you’ve scrubbed the sink, you need to thoroughly rinse it to remove all leftover baking soda. If you don’t rinse it immediately, some of the stains may re-set and all your work will be wasted.









Make sure to run the water until all the baking soda has washed down the drain.
If your sink doesn’t drain properly, you may need to wipe the baking soda out with cloth rags or paper towels., By rinsing the sink after every use, you’ll make sure that dirt and soap residue are washed out of the basin into the drain. This is important, as the dirt in your sink accumulates on a day-to-day basis.









Run the water after you brush your teeth, otherwise toothpaste and toothpaste residue will build up in your sink.
Make sure you use enough water to wash soap and soap residue down the drain after you wash your hands.
If you notice any grime in your sink after you use it, run the water., One of the easiest ways to keep a bathroom sink clean is to avoid washing hair shavings down it. Hair shavings not only dirty your sink, but they can partially clog your pipes. As a result, normal dirt and grime will build up in the basin.









If you shave in front of the sink, put a towel over the sink so your hair falls into the towel.
If you do wash hair down the drain of the sink, your sink will eventually clog up. When this happens, you’ll have to remove the accumulated hair with a coat hanger, or use a chemical clog removing product., One of the toughest stains to get out of a sink, especially porcelain bathroom sinks, are rust stains. As a result, don’t lay any metal in your sink. Because of the presence of moisture, metal will quickly rust and leave a stain.


If you have a rust stain, take an old eraser and wipe it against the stain.
If the rust stain won’t come out with baking soda or an eraser, you may need to use an abrasive cleaner like Comet cleaning powder. However, make sure whatever product you use is safe on the material your sink is made of."

;
, Put the toilet brush inside the bowl, helping to sanitize the brush for cleaning.









Make sure the door is open and the fan is on to ensure proper ventilation.
For a green alternative, mix a tablespoon of baking powder into about a quart of 75/25 mix of white vinegar and water.

, In general, when cleaning any room, start from the top down. Clean cobwebs in the corners of the bathroom, and brush other dust and dirt directly onto the floor to sweep up later. A duster works great for this, but you can also use the broom.









If you've got delicate wallpaper, wrap the bristles in some toilet paper or paper towel and slightly wet it too.

, If you've got lime and build-up in the tub, sink, or around faucets, damp those areas slightly and sprinkle with scrubbing powder like Comet. Letting it sit for 10-15 minutes while you do other things will help to work loose the dirty patches and make your scrubbing go much more smoothly.









Be sure to read the label and ensure that you're using an appropriate product and won't damage your surfaces. Test it out on a non-visible spot before you actually use it.

, If you have mold on the ceiling start with spraying a water bleach/disinfectant solution on it and let it rest for a couple of minutes, do the same with the walls ( if they are tiles) or use another cleaning product. With a sponge or a clean rag, scrub the tile surfaces you've sprayed. Rinse it carefully to avoid any stripes and dry it with a clean rag.









It's a good idea to wear rubber gloves while you're scrubbing, to keep your hands from drying out if you're using harsh products.

, Spray cleaning product on the shower walls, and the shower head and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Spray cleansers made especially for getting rid of soap scum work very well on tubs that haven't been cleaned in a while.









For hard water areas that are prone to green and rust-colored stains, a cleanser made for eliminating calcium, lime and rust is probably what you need. Never use abrasive cleaners or green abrasive scrub pads or steel wool on porcelain fixtures, as they will quickly dull the finish.
Soak the showerhead. If eventually the showerhead becomes quite clogged with hard water build up or soap scum, you can remove it and soak it overnight in a vinegar/water mixture, and then clean with a toothbrush.
Go back over the shower and scrub the walls, faucet and shower head, rinse well with the hottest water and or dry with a towel. You can shine the faucet with a paper towel or a towel.
Don't forget the shower curtain; it is also prone to mildew. A solution of about 2/3 water, 1/3 bleach in a spray bottle can be handy for getting rid of mildew spots. Or you can take it down and wash it in hot water with a small amount of soap and bleach.

, Scrub all the soap scum and toothpaste off with a small amount of cleaner, rinsing your sponge thoroughly as you go along. Don't forget to clean your trashcan, tissue holder and other items which regularly remain in your bathroom. An old toothbrush or cotton swabs can be handy for getting the junk out from between the tap and handles.









Be sure never to clean the sink and counter area with the same rag or paper towel you used to clean the toilet. This can spread leftover disease-causing germs to your sink and counter area. To prevent this you can use a specific rag which you use to clean only the toilet.
Wipe off the fronts and tops of cabinets and drawers. You'll probably want to use hot, soapy water for this purpose. If you're worried about germs on these surfaces, add a bit of bleach to your soapy water.

, Use cleaner, rinse it and wipe the excessive water off with a towel or squeegee. To add a shine to your mirror add a bit vinegar to the water. if just cleaning with water wipe with a towel after.








, Wipe the outside, starting with the flush handle so as not to re-contaminate it, with a cloth soaked in disinfectant cleaner. Thoroughly wash and rinse all exterior surfaces of the toilet bowl, including the underside and flared base, the top and underside of the seat and lid, and the hinges and their mounting area with a cloth and detergent or similar cleaner.









Don't forget to use a cloth specially assigned for cleaning the toilet, or a paper towel (throw it away, don't flush it).

, You probably won't have to scrub hard: let the soapy water and patience dissolve the problem. Coat the inside of the bowl with a viscous acidic cleaner generally sold in an angle-necked bottle. Take special care to cover the entire inside edge of the rim; it'll run down toward other areas.








Allow the cleaner to soak for half an hour or more before scrubbing the entire bowl including under the rim with a toilet bowl brush, let it soak a little longer after it's been well-distributed though thinned by the initial scrubbing, then scrub some more and flush it away.

, Start with the farthest point from the door. Sweep up all the dust and debris you've cleaned so far and let fall on the floor, then mop using hot soapy bleach water. Remember to rinse the floor with clean water to remove slippery soap residue. Be sure to get along the sides of your toilet bowl where it is anchored to the floor. This area is notoriously dirty. Don't forget to clean the base boards or base molds these places usually accumulates a lot of dust.








, Get rid of all excess toothpaste gunk that may be on it. Apply a small amount of bleach or other counter-safe cleaning product to the toothbrush. Scrub away! The toothbrush helps to get in areas that are narrow or need very detailed scrubbing.








, Keeping your bathroom ventilated will discourage the growth of mildew, keeping your big cleaning sessions few and far between. Always run the fan after you get out of the shower, to dry out the bathroom and keep the moisture from clinging.

, To make sure mold and mildew doesn't build up in the shower in between big cleaning sessions, take time to wipe it down every time you take a shower. Combined with running the fan, this should keep your bathroom mildew free.








, Much of what we call ""mess"" is really just clutter. If clothes accumulate in your bathroom, put a hamper, or even a cardboard box in the bathroom to collect dirty clothes. Use a toothbrush holder or a cup to keep your toothbrushes in order. Keep other supplies in an old shoebox under the sink to keep the surface tidy.

, Even if it doesn't look dirty, minerals in the water can stain the bowl, so it's a good idea to brush the toilet down with a sturdy toilet brush fairly regularly. If you do this even just once a week, your bigger cleanings will be much easier and infrequent.

, Toothpaste stains and build up in the sink and even on the mirror can make a bathroom look dirtier than it needs to be. Make sure you clean up after your toothpaste, washing it down and rinsing the sink out, then drying the bowl of the sink when you're finished.









To consolidate tasks, do this while you mouthwash for an added dental benefit.

, Force yourself to clean. Head up, and toughen up, soldier!

, Search for it while cleaning up along the way.

, You can make an On-the-Go playlist on your iPod, or burn a CD. Even a happy, upbeat song that makes you feel good will help to pass the time while you tidy.

, Then, choose a new song and focus on a different area of your room. Start with a long (about seven minutes) song, then move on to a shorter song, but move faster. Use a playlist with about 10 or more upbeat songs and take a break every 5 songs.

, For instance, only clean or straighten up things that are green, then move on to the next color until everything is put away.

, Write down the sections, e.g. clothes, shoes, bags, books, magazines, things you used in the last 3 days, other. Don't have too many and as you tick them off it will motivate you if you see there's not much left.

, Pretending the floor is lava and only stepping on things is fun, and you get safely to ground when there's nothing left on the floor. You can pretend you're on a game show, and if you complete a section in time, you get a prize (e.g. a snack or text to a friend.) Breaks you take can be commercial breaks. Or you can pretend you are a slave to an evil lord (if you like books, try Kalona from House of Night, James from Twilight, or Voldemort from Harry Potter) and if you're not finished by the time he gets back he'll destroy you. You can also do it with a princess who is out shopping, and if you don't finish in time, she'll throw you in the dungeon.

, (e.g. Oh no! I gotta clean this place up before the evil Pink Menace blows this place off the cliff!)

, Time how long it takes to clean one section of your room, then move on to another section. Try to beat your previous time with each new section. Win gold by cleaning the whole room in a certain amount of time, win silver by going less than 5 minutes over the limit, and win bronze by going between 6-10 minutes over the time limit. Or you could assign each section of the room (i.e. bed, floor, desk, closet etc.) a category-neatness, speed cleaning, putting things where they belong, etc. Have a family member or friend ""judge"" each section on a scale of one to ten, add up the points, and determine how many points deserves a gold. Have a family member chip in for the prize, something as simple as $5 or doing a chore for you.

, Ok... so the treasure may just be loose change or whatever is the source of that weird smell. But you don't have to tell them it is just a ruse to get help cleaning up your mess.

, Well-placed shots are cause for celebration!

, It helps to take out all the junk that's under your bed, in the bottom of your closet...etc then organize it and dump it where it needs to be!

, Make sure nothing in this pile is broken, and check to see if there's anything someone you know could have, then put all these items into the bag. Take it to a charity later.

, Think whether you really need to keep them. If they have no functional use and you don't really want them on show, yet are of sentimental value then put it in the 'storage' pile. A good way to test whether you really need something is checking if the last time you used or looked at something was in the past few months. If it wasn't, then you probably don't need it.

Follow the directions for your rust-removal product, as application may vary between products.
These chemicals often need to set for a long time and require scrubbing afterwards, so be ready for a little extra work.
These products can be expensive and only work for small-scale projects, not larger rusted items., Purchase a rust converter which works to stop rust from eating away any more of the metal. It is similar to a spray paint, and acts as a primer for a coat of paint over the top as well.









Although this stops rust from expanding, it may not be as effective as completely removing the rust from the metal.
This is only an option if you plan on painting over the metal. It will also leave a rough texture under the paint, as you are essentially just adding a covering to the rust.

, This method requires a lot more elbow grease, but you can effectively remove rust by simply scraping it off. Use tools from your garage like a screwdriver, or rent tools from a local hardware store.









Steel wool is easy to use and something you may already have in your home.
Use an electric sander to remove rust on large pieces. Always start with the roughest grain and slowly move to finer grains to minimize the roughness of the metal.
Any metal tool can be used to scrape metal, but use a fine grain sandpaper afterwards to try to remove any marks the scraping may have made.

, Buy a small box of citric acid in the powder form from your favorite supermarket in the baking/cooking goods area.









Put some citric acid in a plastic container and pour in hot water, enough to cover the item being cleaned. For fun you can watch the bubbles reacting!
Leave overnight then rinse and dry.

Place shorts, pants, and leggings in their own drawer, or their own section of a single drawer, setting aside a separate drawer or section for shirts. Do the same for pajamas, socks, and underwear. This way, when you need an article of clothing, you know exactly where to find it.

, The bed can serve as an excellent focal point for the room, and creates a useful workspace as you organize. Smooth the sheets, comforter, and pillow, and place any decorative elements such as throw pillows, blankets, or stuffed animals in their proper place. , Identify any unused or unwanted toys or articles of clothing, and place them into a designated donation bin. Donation items can look different each time you clean the room. Some days, you might find a large number of toys or clothing items your child no longer needs or wants, and other days, you might not be able to find any. Look for toys covered in a thin layer of dust. If dust has enough time to accumulate, your child has likely lost interest in the toy.
Similarly, look for clothing items that have remained folded and untouched through 2-3 weeks of laundry. These items are not being worn, and someone else may be able to benefit from them.

, Throw away or recycle any unneeded items, such as old school papers, food and drink items, broken toys, or irreparable clothes. Be sure to thoroughly examine problem areas, such as under the bed, under dressers or shelves, and in the closet.

, Everything should have a designated place, down to the last sock. As you glance around at all of the askew items, identify the basic areas in need of organizing and tidying. Clothes should go into closets and drawers, toys into toy chests, books into bookcases, and so on. , Select a basket for toys, and place between 5-10 objects in this basket, separating toys into additional baskets of 5-10 toys. Keep one basket in the room, and the remaining baskets in a closet or other storage space. Once per month, switch baskets. This will keep the room neatly organized, and clutter-free. , Books can be arranged according to author’s name, color, size, or subject. Ask your child how they would like their books to be arranged, have them help arrange their books, and place them back into their bookshelf.

, Although the tendency is to think less is more where school and craft supplies are concerned, children benefit from limited options. For desks, place only 2-4 writing utensils, and 1-2 notebooks, along with some erasers, paperclips, etc. Make sure all of the desk’s contents are age-appropriate.
For craft spaces, provide your child with 2-3 types of writing utensil (a box of crayons, a single set of watercolors, and a handful of markers, for instance), and some construction paper.
Keep hazardous materials such as glue and scissors on a high shelf easily accessible to you, but impossible for your child to reach.

, You might be tempted to hold onto sentimental items, but these can stack up quickly and create a mess. If you came across several broken toys, torn-up books, or damaged clothing items, either set them aside to be fixed, or place them in your trash or recycle bin.


The most common source of clutter is surplus. Taken inventory of your child’s room, and set aside duplicate items, as well as waste and donation objects; children do not need the same toy in five different colors or incarnations.

, Remove errant items from the closet, under the bed, and all surfaces in your child’s room. Place rogue toys, escaped books, or neglected pillows on or in their designated space.

, Rather than doing an all-over organization every month, rotate your area of focus each week. Take 10-15 minutes per week, and focus on the desk one week, following by the closet the next, and so forth. This will keep the room tidy and organized, without the need to set aside a large chunk of time. , Show your child age-appropriate chores, and encourage them to engage in these chores every day. A toddler can be encouraged to fold their pajamas and make their beds each morning.
A school-age child is capable of putting books away, arranging work areas, and putting laundry away.
Children 7 and older are capable of helping with laundry, throwing away trash, and performing routine cleaning tasks.

Utilize unconventional storage spaces.,
Remove any furniture that is not being used or is taking up too much space.",How to Organize Your Bedroom," Make piles for like items, focusing on items such as clothes, books, tissues, magazines, shoes, papers and anything else that you may have laying around. The first step to getting an organized bedroom is cleaning up the mess that you've already created.


When you're done, the only things touching the floor should be your furniture. This is an important first step — you'll have a much more difficult time cleaning around your clutter rather than you will have simply getting it out of the way.;
, Once you have your floor completely clear, gather the items you picked up and decide whether you want to keep each item or get rid of it.


Place the “keep” items in the box for things to keep and place the “get rid of” items in the box for things to throw away.
Don't be afraid to part with items you haven't used in years and that don't hold any sentimental value. Saving an antique keepsake given to you by your grandmother may make more sense than saving a stack of last year’s junk mail.
To determine which items of clothing in your closet you need to get rid of, turn around all the hangers in your closet so the hooks are pointing towards you (the wrong way). When you wear something, hang it back up the normal way. In three to six months, any hangers facing the wrong way are holding clothes you haven’t worn, and should go in the donation box., Consider the items you threw into the “get rid of” box when you gave your room an initial clean. Look them over and determine if they are worth donating or need to be thrown away.Give your used clothes and furniture to a secondhand store. Charities like Goodwill and the Salvation Army usually accept used items in good condition.
Give your books to a library. By donating used books to a library, you give others the chance to discover new books.
Sell or give away possessions online. Classified ad sites like Craigslist usually have sections devoted to getting rid of used goods for cheap or for free.

, Sort the items on shelves and in your closet by grouping them in it into neat, tidy piles. Not only will this it look less cluttered, but it will also be an efficient use of limited space on your shelves or in your closet.Add shoe storage like shoe racks, shoe cubbies or hanging shoe organizers.
Add closet storage like plastic bins, woven baskets, or even milk crates for out of season items or small items like socks, undergarments, and scarves.
Add hooks on the wall to hang up bags and belts so they are not lying in a pile on the floor.

, Keep your socks, ties, underwear, and tank tops or undershirts organized so you don’t have to sort through piles of clothing to find what you need.You can find drawer tidies at your local office supply store or furniture store. However, you can also make them yourself. Simply join together pieces of cheap wood or plastic to divide your drawers as you wish. Be sure to measure the depth of your drawer first so that your homemade tidie fits., Keeping large machines on the floor, as well as their many cables and wires, can be a fire and tripping hazard, and can clutter up your space.Look for a desk for storage solutions like pull out drawers for printers and keyboards, and shelving above your computer to keep any files or papers in order.
Thread cords through your desk or drill a hole into a nearby cabinet to store your power cord and keep it out of sight.
Bundle cords together with velcro strips or electrical tape. Always label your cords with a piece of tape so you can figure out where it leads to without having to unbundle the cords.

, Place small electronics like your phone, your iPod, and your camera together in one place in your room, as well as their chargers.


You can also purchase a multi-device charging station to keep your chords from getting tangled and disorganized., If you keep forgetting where to put your possessions once you've cleaned up your room or you're having a hard time sticking to your approach to cleanliness, labeling your storage areas will help you know exactly where things go.


Not only will it be easier for you to remember to put your things away in the right spots — it will also be harder for you to create a mess again.
Don't worry about spending money on ""nice"" labels — simple post-it notes and masking tape will work just fine.
If you are using decorative boxes to hold electronics or other odds and ends, make sure you label them so you know what each one contains.

, Keeping your room clean isn't just about shoving your belongings into your closet! There are other ways to keep your room clean and organized that fall outside your closet, such as:Sliding baskets or bins under your bed for linens, blankets, and towels.
Making space for items on wall shelves like small pictures or figurines.
Hanging a coat rack over your door so you aren’t tempted to throw your coat on your bed at the end of the day.
Placing items between books on your bookshelf to add some interesting detail as well as keep your books in order.

, Stand in your de cluttered room and consider the furniture you have. Are there any tables or chairs that you aren’t using or are taking up space to may work better with another item of furniture? Is your bed or desk too big or too small for your daily needs?Walk around your room and consider how hard or easy it is to get around your furniture. If it is a tight squeeze between your bed and your desk, or your door and your bedside table, it may be a good idea to invest in furniture that better fits the space or remove items of furniture for now to create more room.

Keep metal dry.,
Apply a primer.,
Apply solid coats of paint.",How to Remove Rust from Metal8," Rust is a chemical process in which iron oxidizes and begins to flake away the metal. This is caused by water that soaks into the metal or comes in contact with the metal frequently over time.









Try to keep the metal in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture buildup.
Always thoroughly dry metal after it comes in contact with water.

, If you plan on painting your metal, use a paint primer to help the paint to stick and keep the metal away from moisture.

Contrary to popular belief, outdoor air can be less toxic than indoor air, where things like lead dust, radon, and other toxins can build up. Open your window(s) once a day for at least five minutes., Wash your sheets and pillowcases once a week, and clean your comforter at least once a season (every three months). Bedding can be odorous if you don't wash it regularly.









Instead of making your bed immediately after getting up, pull the sheets down so that the mattress can air out for at least 30 minutes. We release moisture when we sleep, which can dampen the bedding, making it a breeding ground for mold and bacteria.

, Use a microfiber dust rag to trap dust, or consider using the homemade lemon rags for an added fresh scent. Make these dust rags in advance, and use them to dust your bookshelves, window sills, electronics, etc.









Mix 1 cup (236 ml) water, 1 cup (236 ml) white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon (14 ml) olive oil.
Soak a few dust rags in the solution. (Old t-shirts, underwear and socks can gain a second life as star cleaners!)
Wring out the rags so they are damp-dry, and then place them in a glass jar, layering them with the rind of one lemon cut into a few pieces. Close the jar tightly., After cleaning your room, vacuuming ensures that you have cleaned everything off your floor. Don't forget the corners, under the bed, upholstered furniture, and even the walls, where dust can accumulate.









The HEPA filter helps trap allergens like dirt and dust, preventing them from being released into the air.
Vacuum two to three times a week if possible, and wash out the HEPA filter regularly., The walls of your room can trap and store many odors, which vinegar helps to kill. Mix 1/4 cup (60 ml) of vinegar with 2 quarts (2 liters) of water. Dip a sponge or washcloth into the mixture and clean your walls.









Don't worry about the smell of the vinegar: it goes away once it dries.

, Cigarette smoke clings to clothes and furnishings, and is a major contributor to air pollution in the home. Consider quitting altogether for maximum health benefits to you and those around you. Or, at the very least, limit smoking to outside., Also try spraying it with some air freshener to get rid of all the smelly toxins.








, Shoes can track in a whole host of unsavory things, from traces of fecal matter to toxic chemicals that settle on city sidewalks. Leaving your shoes at the door helps keep your bedroom a healthy and better-smelling place., Carpets can often be the source of odors. Sprinkle a commercial carpet freshener onto your rug and vacuum up (follow the instructions for the specific product you're using). Alternatively, consider making this homemade solution, which gets your rug or carpet smelling fresh in no time.


Mix 1/2 cup (110 g) baking soda with 1/2 cup (100 g) borax in a plastic bowl, and then add 1 teaspoon (20-25 drops) of your favorite essential oil (wild orange is a natural flea repellent) or 1 teaspoon of cinnamon or cloves (the latter deters moths). Stir together until the mixture is free of lumps.
Sprinkle the solution onto the carpet and let it sit 15-20 minutes, then vacuum it up.
If you're worried about staining a light-colored carpet, skip the cinnamon or cloves. You can use cinnamon or clove essential oils instead.
If you or someone else is sensitive to smells, use plain baking soda instead. Simply sprinkle on the carpet, let sit for 15-20 minutes, then vacuum., If you share your bedroom with a pet, make sure that you clean their living spaces, as well. Dispose of solid waste on a daily basis, and clean litter boxes, cages, and aquariums regularly.

, Not only do plants liven up your decor, research shows that they also filter out toxins released by synthetic materials.


If you have pets or children, make sure that the plant is not poisonous if ingested.Make sure you choose plants that are right for the conditions in your room. Some plants need lots of direct sunlight, while others like shadier spots. Check temperature and humidity needs as well–these are often included in a care tag when you buy the plant.

, When you turn the light on, the warmth from the bulb will release a pleasant smell.







, While commercial air fresheners can contain a whole host of harmful chemicals, a simple mix of essential oils and water is a great alternative. Simply combine 1/4 cup (60 ml) distilled water and 10-15 drops of your favorite essential oil in an empty spray bottle.


Lavender is known for its calming properties, while citrus scents like lemon, tangerine, wild orange, and grapefruit can be very refreshing.A variation on this is to add 1 tsp (4 g) baking soda to the mix: this makes a great deodorizing spray for furniture., Candles add atmosphere and fill the air with an inviting scent. That said, you need to be choosy when picking your candles. Many contain paraffin, which releases carcinogenic chemicals when it burns; plus, material for the wick often has lead, and artificial scents may contain harmful toxins. Look for soy candles scented with essential oils, or beeswax candles, which release a subtle honey fragrance.You can make your own candles at home, too.

, Potpourri is a mixture of aromatic things like dried flower petals, leaves, and spices that fill your room with a long-lasting scent. You can buy potpourri at a drugstore, home décor store, or online. Alternatively, it's easy to make your own: just mix together star anise, cinnamon sticks, and cloves into a small jar or dish, and place the dish in your room.


If you're feeling ambitious, you can dehydrate apples and oranges in the oven and add them to the mix. Cut the apple and orange into very thin slices, place on a cookie sheet in a single layer, and bake in the oven at 250 F (120 C) for about 1 1/2 hours, or until dry."

Doing so will also make it easier to sort through the items in your closet.;
, Sort through all your clothes, shoes, accessories, and anything else you may have been hiding in your closet.Form three separate piles: things you need to keep, things you might need to keep, and things you can get rid of.


Get rid of clothing that is damaged or clothes that no longer fit you. You should also get rid of clothes you no longer wear, even if they are in good shape.
If you are not sure about whether or not you should keep an item, flag the item with a ribbon or marker. When you use the item, remove the flag. If that flag is still there the next time you organize your closet, however, get rid of the item.
Donate or discard items you do not need. Letting go of clothing and other items you no longer have a need for will free up more space in your small closet, thereby making the rest of your items easier to organize. Items that are in good shape should be donated, while items that are damaged should be discarded.

, If you have a place for long-term storage, like an attic or trunk, remove most of your seasonal clothes and other seasonal items from your closet once they fall out of season.If you have a garage, basement, or attic, you can store your seasonal items there.
Make sure that your items are kept in plastic boxes with airtight lids to prevent damage from moisture or insects.
If you do not have extra storage space outside of your closet, at least consider keeping seasonal items up high or in an area you will not be utilizing for items you need ready access to.

, Before you begin putting everything back into your closet, measure the space. Taking precise measurements with a measuring tape can make it easier for you to determine how to best fit everything into the area.


When picking out storage containers to use in your closet, measure them, as well. Doing so will help you calculate how many you can fit into the small space.

, Adding shelf space to your closet allows you to stack items more effectively, thereby letting you make use of the vertical space in your closest as well as the horizontal space.

You can use fixed shelves if you so desire, but adjustable shelves offer the added benefit of being easily altered if and when your needs change.

, You can store smaller items in small containers like these and rest them on the shelves in your closest. Doing this makes it easier to access your items as you need them while also getting the most out of the space.


If using wicker, opt for a linen or canvas lined basket, especially if storing items made from cloth. The lining should prevent your items from getting snagged or ripped.
Clear bins are especially helpful because they allow you to see your items, making it easier to recall what is contained in each bin.
If you end up using bins or storage containers that do not have see-through sides, you should label those containers so that you can remember what each one holds.

, If you keep your shoes in your closet, keep them organized with a shoe rack that either sits on the floor or hangs from the closet rod. This will make better use of your space and help you keep your shoes more organized.You can use an actual shoe caddy, or you can buy stackable plastic shoe boxes. No matter what you use, the idea is to organize your shoes into pairs while minimizing the amount of space you use to do this.
As with everything else, rotate your shoes according to the season. Bring boots toward the front during winter and sandals toward the front during summer.

, If you have empty space inside the closet, just above the door, you can install hooks or pegs there and use the area to store suitcases or other hangable items you use infrequently.

, As long as there is space for it on the inside of the door, you can add hooks or bins to the inside of the door for extra storage space. You can use this space to hang small, flat objects like scarves, hats, or gloves.""Catch all"" baskets also work well when attached to the inside door. You can place small items like handbags or scarves inside these baskets.
When all else fails, you can at least add a hook to the back of the door. This hook can be used to store your everyday purse, your pajamas, your robe, or your outfit for the following day.

, Installing a second rod halfway in between the floor and the original rod in your closet can allow you to make use of any empty space not taken up by a storage bin or other hanging clothes.

, Since these items are all fairly flat, you can store them on one of the side walls in your closet without taking up too much valuable or usable space.

, If you do not have much space for bins or other stackable storage containers, you could hang bags up and use those for storage purposes instead.


Keep the contents of each bag unique and separate from the other bags. For instance, keep your underwear in one bag, your socks in another, hair accessories in another, and so on.

, Space bags (also known as vacuum bags) allow you to organize clothes for long-term storage while minimizing the amount of empty air space those clothes take up. Place the folded clothes inside the space bag and use a vacuum hose to suck all the air out of the bag, leaving it as flat as possible.Most of these bags work with your own home vacuum cleaner, so there is no need to go out and buy a special machine.
Another advantage offered by space bags is that they protect your clothes from mold, mildew, and insect infestations.
This option is especially good for seasonal clothing, winter coats, blankets, and pillows.
When you remove the items from storage, they should ""fluff up"" to their original thickness.

, Tiered hangers are essentially hangers with multiple hanging rods on them. They allow you to store more than one shirt or pair of pants on each hanger. As a result, you can use more empty vertical space in your closet.


For added convenience, use hangers with grips or a cloth lining to prevent your clothing from sliding off.
Create DIY tiered hangers, if necessary. You can place soda can tabs over the hanger hook and attach additional hooks through the second slot on the tab.Alternatively, you could also hang a heavy chain from the closet rod and insert the hook of each hanger through a link in the chain., For the sake of easy retrieval, you should organize your clothing by color and type. Organize the rest of the items in your closet by whatever sorting system seems the most reasonable. <


Divide your clothes into as many different types as possible. Separate sweaters from sweatshirts, pants from skirts, and casual shirts from dressy shirts. Further divide your organization into color or material., Clothes and other items you plan to use most often should be front and center in your closet, while items you have less use for can be placed up high or on the floor.

Rotate these items as necessary. If, for instance, you store both long-sleeve and short-sleeve shirts in your closet, place the short-sleeve shirts up front during the warmer months but hide them away up high during the cooler months, when your long-sleeve shirts should shine.
Take a step up. Do not forget about the space you have above your head. Even if you cannot readily access this space, you should grab a stepladder or stool and stack items you do not frequently use in that spot.

, If you still have an empty side wall available for use, place a hook on the wall and hang up a tie hanger or other hanging device that can be used to store these fairly flat accessories.You can create your own make-shift scarf or tie hanger by lining shower curtain rings along the bottom bar of a standard clothes hanger. Feed your scarves or ties through these rings, arranging them side by side along the bottom bar of the hanger, and hang the entire thing up on a hook on the side wall.

, If there are any clothes on the floor, pick them up and sort them into dirty laundry and clean clothes. Put the dirty clothes into your wash basket and the clean clothes into your drawers and cupboards.


It might be safe to assume that all clothes found on the floor need to go into the dirty pile.

, Put them where they are meant to be.


If these items don't yet have a home, you'll need to spend some time making one for them. This can include clearing away items you no longer want or use, to make room for the homeless new items.

, Ensure that it is nice and clean before moving on to the next sections., Sort everything out into groups and make sure you have space for everything to go back into the cupboard. Put the heaviest clothing in the bottom of the wardrobe and work your way up to the lightest.


This is a good chance to color coordinate your clothes. This can make it easier to see combinations.

Plan one or two days a week that you pick-up, dust, vacuum, and re-organize your items.,
Ask for rewards.,
Reward yourself in some way every time you clean your room.",How to Keep a Bedroom Tidy," Is a friend coming round? Are you moving/going on vacation anywhere? Are you having difficulty finding your possessions beneath the knee-high pile of clutter covering your floor? Or maybe you don't have an incentive, you just want to make your bedroom a peaceful place you can escape to after an exhausting day at school or work? Whatever reason you have for cleaning your room, just follow the steps below to have a fun and functional room.;
, Do you like the feeling of your room being clean? Do you like that feeling that everything is fine, and you can relax? That's not so strange, since the state of your bedroom does affect your state of mind.This is just another incentive to fix any messes and keep it tidy.

, If you like your room being tidy then when events come up like birthdays, Christmas etc., try to get rid of your old stuff. You can donate them to charities, hospitals, etc.

,, This will help you to prioritize what you want sitting out, and what you can afford to stash away most of the time! Throw away some stuff that you think is not essential to you.

, Dresser/desk drawers, closets, space under the bed, attics/basements, spare rooms. Whatever works, put your extra stuff there. Create a system for storing clothes, both clean and dirty. Try buying a pencil holder for pens and pencils.

, The main thing in your room is usually your bed. Thus, when the main thing is tidy, it will make the rest seem better. So just pull the covers over your bed and make sure the cases are on the pillows. Also its great if you can take everything off your bed but not necessary.


Make it every morning. A small amount of time goes a long way to making the room feel tidy and encouraging a good night's sleep at the end of each day.

, Start with large items first, then move on to papers, etc.

, Follow the simple rule of ""taking something out and then putting it right back"". Sing the cleanup song, if you must! Putting on music can help this process go a lot faster.

, If your stuff starts accumulating again, just take a few minutes each day to put everything where it belongs. Take a few minutes every night before you go to bed and make sure everything is in its place or neatly put away. You should also make it a habit to make up your bed every morning before you leave the house.

, This can make a huge difference to how you feel, as you can't see yawning gaps of more stuff.

, Clean it at least once a week to keep it from getting too messy.

, It can be that all your papers about hobbies can go in a green folder and the green folder goes into the white binder and goes on the first shelf. Whatever works best for you, do it.

, As you complete a task, stop and look to see if it is correct. You don't want to not have done something correctly and start something else. So when the task is complete go on and finish cleaning. For example, your dresser is disorganized, you cleaned it all up, then check to make sure everything is in its correct spot.

, Is under your bed dirty? This is what you should do. Slide and remove everything from under your bed and put it in the middle of the floor. Go through the things you'll need. If you really love something, keep it but put it in an organized place. Do not keep everything like a slob, force yourself to throw it out because you won't have anymore junk. If there is food under your bed, then immediately remove it before pests come and take over.

, If your desk is cluttered with pots and cups and brushes, pencils, paints, homework, papers anything like that, just neatly put them to one side stack and papers and move them to somewhere they would seem neat, like the side of your desk or in drawers. Like the bed, when the desk is tidy, a lot of the space will seem better.

, This will help you to cope. However, don't make them too long, as you may find it difficult to go back to cleaning.

, After cleaning your room, get some lights. String lights look the best and hang them up and turn them on. Soft lighting brings a comforting place that's easy to focus in. Don't make your room too bright it makes it harder to focus, and harder to keep clean.

, Or each night before bed, examine your room to make sure everything is in its correct place. If you have a carpet, vacuum it or if you have a laminate floor sweep and mop it.


Everyone goes about tasks differently. Some people prefer cleaning a bit everyday; others like to attack everything in one sitting. Find out what works best for you.

, Try to make a deal with your parents concerning your getting a reward every week for keeping your room clean, neat and organized; even if it is just a small treat, it's still worth it!

, This might be anything from having a cookie to seeing your favorite program on TV. Rewards don't always have to be big. They are simply something you can enjoy that you wouldn't normally.

, When you're busy with work, school, and other things, it can be easy to let garbage pile up in your room. Go around the room with a garbage bag and pick up wrappers, food, old papers, and any other trash you find around the room.When you’ve collected all the garbage, empty your bedroom garbage bin into the bag and take the bag down to wait for collection day.

, Keeping plates, cups, and old food in your room can attract bugs, cause spills, and make your room messy. Collect anything that belongs in the kitchen and take it downstairs to the sink or dishwasher. Items to watch for include:Plates and bowls

, Strip the comforter, sheets, and pillow cases from your bed. Throw all washable linens into the hamper and take the linens to the laundry room for washing.


If you can do a load of laundry on your own, wash your linens in the washing machine using your regular cycle. Otherwise, leave the linens for an adult to wash.

, Grab a fresh set of linens for your bed, or wait until yours are washed and dried. Put the fitted sheet on the mattress first, followed by the top sheet and any blankets you regularly use. Put the pillow cases back on the pillows. Put the pillows on the bed and pull the blanket, comforter, or duvet up and over the pillows.

, Bedroom desks are magnets for messes because that’s probably where you read, do your school work, and spend time on the computer. To tidy up your desk:Pick up all the papers, notes, and other loose sheets that are lying around
Organize and file your papers away. Throw useless paper. It is a great idea to Reuse paper in different ways.
Collect your pens, pencils, and other writing tools and store them in a cup, pencil case, or special drawer
Put away any books or magazines that are lying around. Give useless magazines to paper recycling centers.

, Your night table is probably a dumping ground for anything you’re doing right before bed, like reading, listening to music, taking off accessories, and other stuff. Clean off your night table and put away anything that doesn’t belong there.To keep your room looking clean and neat, store common bedside items, like tablets and books, inside the drawers of your night table rather than on top of it. Keep the top of the night stand for some simple items, like a lamp or a single picture.

, Your dresser may also be a dumping ground for books, toys, accessories, jewelry and knick-knacks. Put jewelry back in a case or drawer, return books to the shelf, toss out garbage and junk that’s accumulated, put makeup back in the vanity or makeup case, and put accessories and other objects back where they belong., Closets tend to be where you throw everything that you don’t want to deal with right away, and now it’s time to address all those things. Tidy up your shoes, hang up clothes, throw out junk, and organize the shelves., Use a duster or damp microfiber cloth to dust corners and wall joints, the ceiling fan, light fixtures, shelves, where the wall and ceiling meet, and all the furniture in your room.


As you dust, pick up objects that are obstructing your work, such as a lamp on the dresser, and dust underneath them., Use a vacuum to suck up dirt and dust from a carpeted floor, or use a broom or vacuum to clean up a tiled or wood floor. Use special attachments on the vacuum to clean the corners where the floor and wall meet, the baseboards, and other cracks and crevices.


Don’t forget to move furniture so that you can clean under and behind the bed, dresser, and desk., Spray the mirror with window cleaner, or with a solution of one part vinegar and three parts water. Use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe the mirror dry. Repeat with all the interior windows in the room, and any dusty or dirty picture frames., One of the most important things you can do to keep your room clean is making your bed every morning when you wake up. Straighten the top sheet and tuck it under your pillows. Straighten and fluff your pillows. Straighten the blanket or comforter and pull it up and over your pillows.Once your room has been thoroughly cleaned, keeping it clean is the simple part. It’s all about doing a few things every day, like making your bed, to maintain the cleanliness.

, Many people like to change into comfy clothes when they get home after a long day at school or work. When you do this, hang up your coat, throw dirty clothes in the hamper, and fold and put away clean clothes that you're going to wear again.After a long day, it can be tempting to come home and just throw your coat and clothes on the floor or bed. But if you want to keep your room clean after all that hard work, you have to put your clothes away.

, Never leave dirty clothes on the floor, on the bed, or lying around in the bathroom or laundry room. When you take off dirty clothes, throw them right into the hamper.To make this job easier, consider leaving a few laundry hampers around the house in areas where you regularly change, like in the bathroom, in your closet, and near your dresser.

, It can be just as easy to leave your clean laundry piled in a basket instead of putting it away. But again, this will quickly lead to a messy room, and it'll cause wrinkles in your clothes. When your clothes are fresh from the dryer, fold them neatly and put them away, or hang them back in the closet., Having food in your room can attract bugs, cause spills, leave crumbs all over the place, and lead to a buildup of plates and cups in your room. Instead, make your room a food-free zone, and do all your eating and snacking in the kitchen.


Take plates, cups, utensils, and food waste back to the kitchen immediately if you ever do eat in your room.

, One of the biggest contributors to a messy room is having too much stuff. To prevent this, go through all your things, including clothes, toys, accessories, and other items and decide what you want to keep and what you want to sell, donate, or throw away.To help you decide what to keep and what to get rid of, ask yourself what items you haven't used or worn in over a year. If you haven't used something in over a year, there's a good chance you can get rid of it without missing it.
Good items to sell or donate include clothes, toys, shoes, and books. Only throw things out if they're broken, have holes, or can't be reused or recycled.

, When you have stuff that you don’t have a place for, you tend to just leave things lying around, because there's no special spot where you can put it back when you tidy up. Go over each item in your room and make sure each one has its own special spot.Use baskets or other storage containers to keep extra stuff organized if you don’t have a spot for it.
Create a random drawer in your desk or dresser for small objects that have no fixed place.

, Once everything has a special spot in your room, tidying up will be easy, because you'll know where everything goes. Here are some ideas for putting things back:Put books and magazines back on the shelf when you're done reading them
Hang up clothes in the closet when you're done wearing them
Put toys back in the drawer or on the shelf when you're done playing
File away papers and notes in a drawer or binder when you don’t need them
Return office items, like pens and paper clips, in the desk drawer when you're done

, Keeping your room clean is about getting into a good routine, and there are some things you should be doing every day. Make a list of these daily chores, and post the list somewhere visible. Set aside about 10 minutes every day to address these cleaning tasks. Daily chores should include:Making the bed
Putting away clothes
Tidying up toys, papers, and other items
Throwing out garbage

, On top of your daily chores, there are other cleaning tasks you should address regularly. Make a list of all those tasks, and make a schedule where you tackle a different weekly cleaning task each day of the week.Here's a sample list:


Monday: vacuum and dust
Tuesday: strip the bed and wash the linens
Wednesday: wash, dry, fold, and put away laundry
Thursday: clean the mirrors and windows
Friday: take out the trash
Saturday: tidy up the desk, dresser, and night table
Sunday: clean and organize the closet

, Pull the blankets, top sheet, fitted sheet, pillow cases, and other linens from your bed. Throw them in the hamper and take them to the laundry room for washing.


It’s important to wash your linens weekly to control dust, dirt, and other allergens., It can be easy to just let the dirty laundry pile up for weeks. However, keeping your room clean means staying on top of dirty laundry. As soon as you have a full hamper or enough for a load of laundry, get to the laundry room and wash a load.

, Garbage is another reason rooms get messy quickly. To stop this from happening, keep a garbage bin in your room, either beside the bed or desk, and make sure you always throw trash out rather than leaving it lying around.


As soon as the garbage can is full, take it to the garage or shed until collection day.

, Use a damp microfiber cloth to dust all the surfaces in your room, including furniture, fixtures, fans, pictures, shelves, and tables. Vacuum the floors and baseboards to suck up dirt and dust.


If you have pets or allergies, vacuum and dust two to three times a week.

, Ignoring your cleaning duties for just a few days can create an overwhelming list of chores. Before you know it, your room will be messy again and you'll have a major cleaning job on your hands. Once you create your daily and weekly cleaning schedules, keep to it to make sure your good cleaning habits sink in and stick.


If you miss a day of cleaning for whatever reason, address the chores you missed as soon as possible the next day to prevent duties and messes from building up.

Place the bed effectively.,
Use the space underneath.,
Consider a loft or murphy bed.",How to Organize a Small Bedroom2," The bed should be the focal point of your room.Being thoughtful about where you place it can make the room feel larger or smaller.


If you have a double bed, place it in the center of the room's most visible wall, with space on either side to get out. This leaves the most free space along the walls. If you have a dresser, place it on the wall opposite the foot of the bed.If you have a twin bed, put it in a corner. The head and one side of the bed should be along perpendicular walls. This maximizes the remaining floor space in the center of the room., Chances are, your bed takes up more floor space than any other item in the room. Don't let this space go to waste! Store as much as you can under the bed.


Consider some risers. For a small amount, you can buy risers that go under each leg of your bed. They raise it further off the floor, allowing you to store larger items underneath.Some tubs, bins, or baskets can help you make the most of the space under the bed, keeping your possessions organized.
You can also install drawers under your bed. You can use the drawers of an old dresser, or you can buy a bed with drawers already installed. This can be a great place to store clothes, shoes, or small knickknacks.
Alternatively, if you don't need to store anything under your bed, it can be a good idea to choose one that is low to the ground. This creates a smaller appearance and can make the room look more spacious.

, If you are in a position to consider buying a new bed, another option is to get a loft or murphy bed.A loft bed is a like a bunk bed without the bottom bunk. This allows you to use the space under the bed for another large piece of furniture, like a desk or dresser.
A Murphy bed is a bed that folds up off the floor, sometimes right into the wall. You won't be able to store things in the area the bed folds down into, but you can fold the bed up when not in use to create more floor space.

"
"
Use wall-mounted shelves.,
Use dual-purpose furnishings.,
Use stackable containers.,
Make a window box.",How to Organize a Small Bedroom3," Shelves can help organize any room by allowing you stack your possessions vertically. In a small room, wall-mounted shelves that hang are often the best choice.


Mounted shelves allow you to store items against the wall without taking up floor space.
You can also mount shelves above your bed, allowing you to store items both above and underneath.

, When possible, use furniture that doubles as storage. For example, instead of a bedside table, use a cabinet or trunks that can double as storage.Trunks can be attractive nightstands. You can use them to store winter blankets that you only need to access once a year when the weather starts to get cold., If you use baskets or tubs to store your belongings, use attractive containers that stack on top of each other.


These container get your things off the floor and hide clutter

, Windows create storage problems. You can't hang shelves or place large furniture items in front of them. A window box provides storage space as well as seating.


Get a large wooden box with a lid. It should be slightly shorter than the bottom edge of your windowsill. Fill it up with your possessions. Then, close the lid and cover it with some large pillows. Now, you have a place to sit and enjoy the sunshine, and you can store things there.

Install a second closet rod.,
Use coordinated hangers.,
Put shelves in the closet.",How to Organize a Small Bedroom4," Small bedrooms often have small closets. To maximize your space, you want to make the most of the closet you have. One good way to to do this is to install a second rod below the one that's already installed.


You can buy an adjustable closet rod in any home improvement store. This will allow you to hang clothes on a second level, doubling the amount of hanger space.

, Another way to increase your hanger space is with coordinated hangers. These are hangers that hang on one another. They allow you to hang two or more items together, each on its own hanger.You can also buy slimmer hangers. These take up less space on the rod. They are often designed to be coordinated as well.

, Another option is to install shelves or place storage furniture in the closet. This allows you to get more items up off the floor.If you can fit storage furniture such as your dresser in your closet, this also frees up space in your room.If you have a lot of shoes, consider a shoe storage unit that hangs on the inside of your closet door. This is another great way to save floor space.

Remove grates and burner caps.,
Wipe the stove with a dry cloth to remove loose food particles.,
Clear the fuel ports and remove any blockages.,
Scrub the stovetop with dish soap and water.,
Rinse the stovetop with water and dry with a clean towel.,
Scrub grates and burner caps with soap and water.",How to Clean a Gas Stove Top1," Fill your sink with a few drops of dish soap and run some warm water. Then, remove the grates and burner caps from the stove and place them in the water to soak. This will help soften any stuck on food particles.Use mild dish soap such as Dawn or Palmolive. Any soap you would typically use to hand wash dishes will work.;
, Use a paper towel or dry dishtowel to wipe up any loose bits of dried food on the stovetop itself. There is no need to scrub at this stage, the goal is simply to clear any food debris from the area you want to clean.

, Examine the fuel ports of all the burners. Sometimes, burnt bits of food can clog the fuel ports, preventing your stove from lighting properly or creating a burning hazard. To clear any food material, use a small object such as a paperclip to pick any burnt food out of the port. If there are lots of food bits blocking the port, you can use a dry toothbrush to gently brush debris away from the port., Use the scrubbing side of a wet sponge and a few drops of dish soap to scrub the stovetop. Work in circular motions to remove stubborn spills, wringing and rewetting sponge as it gets dirty. Be careful not to use too much water when cleaning the stovetop, as it can make the fuel ports saturated. Wring your sponge regularly while cleaning. If the fuel ports get too wet, they will temporarily have trouble igniting. When they dry out, this problem will resolve.

, When you’re finished cleaning the stove with the soap, rinse the sponge completely. Then wipe the stovetop once more with just water to rinse. Dry with a clean dishtowel.

, Use your scrubbing sponge to clean the grates and burner caps that have been soaking in the soapy solution in the sink. The food bits on them should have softened and will come off easily. Rinse them with plain water once you’ve scrubbed off all food bits, drying with a clean dishtowel.

Heat a wet towel.,
Cover stuck-on grime with your warm towel.,
Use a solution of white vinegar and water.,
Rinse the vinegar-water solution.,
Employ a commercial oven cleaner.",How to Clean a Gas Stove Top2," If the crust of food on your stove isn’t coming off with soap and water, try a towel “mask.” Wet a dishtowel, wring it, and warm it in the microwave for 30 seconds. If your microwave is particularly powerful, be careful of any hot steam coming off the towel when you open the microwave., Use the damp, warm towel to cover any stuck on bits on the stove, leaving the towel in place for 15 minutes. You can repeat this step several times.


The warm steam helps loosen stuck on gunk on the stove. When the mess on the stove is loose, scrub as normal with warm water and soap.

, If soap and water alone aren’t cutting the grime on your stove, you can create a mix of 50% white vinegar and 50% water as a homemade cleaning solution. Scrub your stove using the solution with the rough side of a sponge.

, When finished, rinse your sponge and clean the stove with plain water to cut the strong smell of the vinegar. Dry the stovetop with a clean kitchen towel. It may help to open a window for ventilation., If your stains have been set for months, you may want to try a commercial over cleaner on the stovetop, such as Easy-Off Oven Cleaner or Goo Gone Oven Cleaner. As most stovetops and ovens are made of the same materials, a solution that is cleared for your oven should be no issue on the stove. Follow the cleaner’s directions carefully, ventilating the area if necessary.

Clean your stovetop once a week.,
Clean food right when it spills or boils over.,
Spend 10 minutes cleaning at the end of the meal.",How to Clean a Gas Stove Top3," Cleaning your stove once a week will minimize surface grime. The more often you do routine cleanings, the less frequently you will need to do serious deep cleans with a hot towel or commercial cleaning solution. Put a regular cleaning reminder on your calendar so you don’t forget.

, Stovetops can be difficult to clean because food that spills or boils over usually gets charred onto the stove by the heat. This sets the stain and makes it more difficult to remove. Make a habit of wiping up any spilled messes right after they occur to keep food from getting fused to the stovetop by the heat.

, When you’re cleaning pots at pans at the end of a meal, run your sponge over the stovetop to clean up the mess created by your cooking too. By implementing this simple 10-minute routine, you can avoid marathon cleaning sessions."

Make your bed each morning.,
Hang up clothes or put them in a hamper right away.,
Dust and sweep.,
Tidy up for 15 minutes each night.,
Clean out closets and hard-to-reach spaces weekly.,
Put things away as you use them.",How to Keep Your Room Tidy1," Making your bed will instantly make your room look and feel tidier. Your bed is a central figure in your room's space. If your bed looks tidy, the rest of your room will as well. Make a conscious effort to make your bed each morning after waking up.A good way to launch this habit is by completing it first thing. Before heading to the shower or the kitchen, for example, simply straighten the sheets and blankets right away.
Making the bed really only takes a minute or so, but if time is still an issue, pull the blanket right over your pillows to at least give the illusion of tidiness. You can skip tucking in the corners and such if you're pressed for time.;
, Before bed at night, you may quickly undress in your room and then slip on pajamas. To keep things neat, try to hang anything that can be worn again. If it can’t, drop it right into the hamper.


If you don't already have a hamper or laundry basket in your room, it's a good idea to move one into the bedroom. You're more likely to remember to toss dirty clothing in the hamper if it's sitting right next to you as a reminder.
If you don’t have the space to hang more items, folding works just as well. Neatly fold all items and store in a designated space like a drawer or closet shelf.

, Bedrooms accrue a lot of dust and dirt, as with any room in your home. Make a point of dusting and sweeping your bedroom a few times a week to keep the floors and shelves looking tidy.You can keep a small broom in your bedroom. You can use a broom with microfiber cloths, allowing you to simply run the broom across the floor to clean up excess dirt.
You should also strive to remove any dust from places like the bedpost, drawers, and bookshelves. To make things easier for yourself, keep a dust rag or brush in your room so you'll remember to periodically dust when you have the chance.

, If you incorporate cleaning into your daily routine, you're more likely to keep your room tidy. Add 15 minutes of nightly cleaning to your bedtime routine. Sometime before brushing your teeth and slipping into your pajamas, do a quick 15 minute clean of your bedroom.Pick up any items off the floor, like clothing or books. Put them in their proper space.
If a surface is looking dusty, quickly dust it off. You can also do a quick sweep before bed if there's any dirt or debris on your floor.
It may also help to set out the clothing you'll be wearing tomorrow. This way, you'll make less mess in the morning when getting ready to head out the door.
You may find you'll fall asleep better when you start cleaning before bed. You may feel more settled and relaxed going to bed in a freshly cleaned room.

, In addition to basic cleaning, you'll want to clean out closets and other hard-to-reach spaces. Closets can become messy and cluttered quickly, as you often neglect to clean space you cannot directly see. Floor spaces blocked by your bed and other furniture also get messy.Open up the closet and look for any clutter. Some clothing may have fallen off the hanger. You may have tucked an unwanted item in the closet temporarily. Put these items in their proper place. Vacuum or sweep the closet floor and dust off the shelves.
Clean under furniture. Move your bed, desk, and any other furniture aside. Retrieve any items that were caught under these pieces of furniture and put them away. Then, vacuum or sweep the floor space.

, If you want to keep your room tidy, you'll need to stay on top of cleaning. A good way to do so is to make sure you put away items as you use them. If you read in your room, put the book back on your shelf when you're done. If you had a snack in your room, put the dishes back in the kitchen when you finish eating. If you make an effort to clean up as you go, your room will stay tidy without too much extra work.

, It will waste some electricity, but as long as you don't take forever and you try your best to save electric, it should be okay. Turning on the lights will help you see different areas of the room so you don't miss any spots when cleaning.

, This may help cool you down if you're starting to become exhausted from all the cleaning. Also, it will cool down your room and keep it fresher smelling while you're going through all the areas.

, Start with your bed. Take a broom or something long and sweep everything out, no matter how much there is, and put it in a pile. Don't organize the pile yet. Then go to your dresser. Then all of the other furniture, putting everything into the same pile.

, It may seem ridiculous but now you can dust easier. Put all of this in the same pile as the stuff from under the bed and other furniture. If you would like, you can even take out the stuff from in your drawers. This will totally clear your room.

, Go through the pile and gather everything that's trash. Make a trash pile, clothes pile, other room pile, stay-in-here pile, give away pile, and/or any other pile you need to make.

, It may be more convenient if you keep a trash bag in your room but it's up to you. You're just throwing stuff out, not organizing yet.

, This way you will have less stuff on your floor and it will be easier for you to maneuver your way around.

, Sort the clothes from what is dirty and what is clean. Then put your clothes in front of the dresser so you don't start organizing them yet.

, For example, if you have books put them in front of your bookshelf. Do not start putting it away yet. If you have stuff that doesn't belong anywhere, keep that in the middle of your room.

, Grab something to dust with, whether it be a rag or feather duster, it doesn't matter, just something to get the job done.

, Go to the biggest pile and start putting it away. You want to dust it before you put it back in the place where it belongs. Now is the time to organize. After you are done with the biggest pile, move to the next biggest pile, and so on.

, Now is the time to fix your bed. Take off the sheets, wash the sheets, flip the mattress, do anything else pertaining to your bed.

, Wipe off the walls with a wet rag.

,, You've been working hard so give yourself a break. It should be about 10-20 minutes long. Don't forget to turn all electronics such as lights and music off.

, Look around the room. Check your closet. Clean out your closet if it needs it. Then check your bathroom if you have one. Focus on the finishing touches.

, What type of floor you have will change what type of tool you will use to clean it. If you have carpet, vacuum then use carpet cleaner. This can make a room look a lot different. If you have hard wood flooring, mop it.

, Now that your walls are clean hang up posters or pictures of things that you love. For example, a picture of your favorite band or a picture of your family.

, You don't want to miss any spots so go over some of the steps above and have a good check of your room.

, Don't use to much, but a little spritz here and there will definitely make your room smell inviting to those who come. You can use all sorts of brands, but don't combine. That gives a weird odor to your room. Make sure to spray where your shoes are because it can become very smelly over there.

, Now that your room is clean, take a second and sit down. Enjoy the looks of your room and try your best to keep it that way for as long as possible. Every week try to go through this list and make sure your room is thoroughly clean.

Use boxes and baskets for storage.,
Hang up certain items.,
Invest in a hanging shoe rack.,
Clean out your closet.,
Tidy up drawers.,
Store items under your bed.",How to Keep Your Room Tidy2," Your room will look more tidy if it's well-organized. Haphazard organization, where items are stored in random places, can fuel stress. Make sure there is a space for everything in your apartment.


If you have a desk with drawers, each drawer can hold a different type of item. One drawer on your desk can hold photographs, another can hold papers for work or school, another can hold office supplies, and so on.
Divide up your closet space. Put formal clothing in the back, and every day clothing and sleep wear towards the middle.
It may help to divide your bedroom into different sections. One corner can be for recreation, and you can put things like a stereo and fun decorations there. Another corner can be for studying, where you can keep your desk and bookshelf.

, If you do not have a lot of drawers or storage space, make use of boxes and baskets. Small items can be stored in boxes and baskets, which you can arrange neatly throughout your room.


Wicker baskets, which you can purchase at most craft stores, can be a cute edition to your bedroom. You can fold and store extra linens in a wicker basket and position it near the foot of your bed.
You can also use cute, decorative boxes that you can purchase at a craft store. You can store mementos, like old photographs, in such boxes. You can also keep supplies that do not fit in your desk drawers, like pens and papers, in a box that you can tuck under your desk.

, Your room will feel more tidy if you maximize floor space. Therefore, try to hang up what you can. In addition to hanging up clothes in the closet, consider installing a peg rail above your bed. You can hang up mementos from a peg rail, as well as wardrobe items like hats and jewelry. This will keep such items from clogging up desk and floor space.

, A hanging shoe rack is a device, made from malleable material, that you can hang vertically from your closet. It comes with individual compartments where you can place shoes. If you have a lot of shoes that you keep in the bedroom, consider storing them in a hanging rack. This will free up floor space, making your room look much tidier., If you want your room to be tidier, it's a good idea to clean out your closet. A lot of clutter gets pushed into the closet, and it should be periodically cleaned out.Go through your clothes. If you have anything that's out of season, consider storing it in a container under your bed or somewhere else in your home. It can also help to arrange clothing in your closet. Keep dressy items in the back, while pushing every day items forward.
You should also look for any items you placed in the closet without thought. You may have, for example, shoved old school supplies or knick-knacks into the closet. Throw away what you no longer want and find a better place to store the items you want to keep.

, You should also strive to tidy up drawer space in your room. Even if you don't always see inside your drawers, knowing they're cluttered can cause stress. Open your drawers and clean them out to give your room a tidier feel.


A lot of times, drawers end up cluttered with old papers. You may have old homework assignments, receipts, bills, or other unneeded mess in your drawers. Throw away such items.
Strive to make the space inside the drawers as tidy as possible. Stack papers. Organize space. For example, keep photographs stacked in one corner, old postcards in another, and so on.

, If you want to maximize floor space, a great trick to doing so is storing certain items under your bed. Push boxes full of items under the bed, as well as instruments, bins of clothing for a different season, suitcases, and other larger items. This can create a lot more floor space, leaving your room feeling a lot tidier.

Relocate items to other areas.,
Review your wardrobe.,
Donate old items.,
Purge old papers and mail.,
Cancel unnecessary subscriptions.",How to Keep Your Room Tidy3," Reducing clutter can make your room feel tidier. To start, relocate items to other areas of your home. There may be a lot of items you're storing in your bedroom that could be stored elsewhere. For example, do you keep your DVD collection on your bedroom bookshelf? It may be better suited to be stored in the living room, near your television set. This will free up more space on the bookshelf.

, You probably have a lot of clothing items you no longer need or want lying around your closet. Go through your closet and find items you no longer wear. You may find items you bought for a special occasions, items that no longer fit you, and items that are worn out.


You can donate items you're simply not going to wear anymore. If you go to a local thrift store, you may get some money for older items if they're in good condition.
If items are torn or stained, you may be better off tossing them than trying to repurpose them. However, if you're into crafting, you may be able to use the material from old clothing items for projects.

, In addition to old clothing items, a variety of items can be donated to charity. Instead, donate things like old toys, electronics, jewelry, bags, and shoes to local charities. Make sure any items you choose to donate are in decent condition. If anything is badly damaged or stained, you may be better off throwing that item away., Paper mess counts for a lot of bedroom clutter. Old papers from work or school may be stacked on your desk, as well as unwanted mail. Take a day to look through old papers and throw out what you no longer want.


If you throw out any old bills, make sure to shred them first as they may contain sensitive information.
If you decide you want to keep some papers, invest in a folder or binder for them. This will feel more organized than just having them stacked on your desk.

, A lot of clutter in the bedroom comes from old magazines and newspapers being stored there. If you no longer read your New Yorker every month, or if you read news online more than you read it in the paper, consider dropping these subscriptions. You'll save yourself some money while also reducing clutter in your home.Decide what subscriptions to cancel. Go through your existing subscriptions and see what you do and do not read anymore. Cut out anything that's not necessary.
Schedule time during the week to call and cancel subscriptions, or cancel them online.
While in the process of canceling subscriptions, throw out or recycle any magazines or newspapers you no longer want.

Wear rubber gloves.,
Dilute calcium remover in water.,
Pour the mixture into a plastic baggie.,
Attach the baggie to the faucet.,
Remove the baggie.,
Scrub off the loosened buildup.,
Dry the faucet with a microfiber cloth.",How to Clean a Faucet2," They'll protect your skin from the chemicals and irritants in many calcium removers. Make sure they're free of dirt before you start to clean. Use gloves that cover all or most of your forearm, in case the cleaner splashes.

You can skip this step if you're using vinegar.

, Mix one part calcium remover, such as CLR, and one part water in a bowl or old plastic container. Choose a container bound for the recycling bin. For most taps, 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of each ingredient is enough.If you don't have much calcium buildup, you can use undiluted white vinegar instead of CLR and water. This method will take much longer, about 24 hours, but it's harmless to bare skin and safe for most faucet finishes.Avoid using calcium remover or vinegar on iron or nickel faucets. These cleaners will remove the finish along with the gunk you're cleaning. Read your owner's manual or contact a local plumber for advice., Use a regular-sized sandwich bag. It doesn't matter if the baggie has a zip seal. Pour carefully. If you're concerned about spilling the mixture, pour it into the baggie through a funnel., Hold the baggie at a slight angle so that the mixture builds up in one of the corners. Carefully slide the open end of the baggie over the faucet. Then submerge the tap in the mixture. Securely fasten the baggie to the faucet with a rubber band. Let the tap soak for one to two hours., Undo the rubber band. Carefully slide the baggie off of the faucet. Do this slowly. Read the label on the cleaner to check for disposal instructions. Cleaners like CLR are biodegradable and can be poured down the drain or toilet., Use an old toothbrush or magic eraser. Scrub in a gentle back-and-forth motion. Periodically rinse the toothbrush or magic eraser if it gets too gunky. Continue to do this until the buildup is completely removed., Move in a gentle circular or back-and-forth direction. Pay special attention to the tap to slow future calcium buildup. Continue until the faucet is completely dry."

Dry the faucet with a clean dish towel.,
Use white vinegar.,
Drape the cloth over the affected areas.,
Scrub the faucet with a scrub sponge.,
Repeat the process for stubborn buildup.,
Dry the faucet with a microfiber cloth.",How to Clean a Faucet3," A wet surface will dilute the vinegar and result in an incomplete cleaning job. Move the towel over the entire base of the faucet. Make sure every last drop of water is absorbed., Fill a small bowl with undiluted white vinegar. Soak a washrag or old piece of clothing in the vinegar until it's saturated. Don't wring out any excess., Cover them completely. Press down on the cloth to make sure it has complete contact with the surface. Leave the cloth in place for at least an hour.

If any vinegar is left in the bowl, pour it over the cloth to further saturate the calcium-coated area., Use the textured side of the sponge. Use a back-and-forth motion. Don't scrub too hard, since this can scratch the finish. You should see the calcium deposits start to come off., Resaturate the rag in vinegar and let it sit on the deposits. Cover only the areas where you still see calcium buildup. Let the cloth sit for another hour and scrub the affected areas to remove the calcium., Use gentle circular or back-and-forth strokes. This will polish the surface in addition to drying it. Continue until no water remains."

Put the filter back in place.,
Figure out how often your furnace filter needs cleaning or replacing.,
Keep records of when you cleaned your filter.,
Replace your filter regularly.",How to Clean a Furnace Filter," Never remove a furnace filter while the furnace is running. Make sure to switch the furnace off before you begin.There is usually a handle somewhere near the furnace that can be switched off.If you're unsure how to turn off your furnace, contact your landlord or the manufacturer.;
, Inside the furnace, you should see a filter. Usually, the filter is either just inside the furnace or just inside the air vent. The filter should have an arrow on it indicating airflow direction., Before you remove the filter, take a sharpie. Draw an arrow pointing in the direction of airflow somewhere on or near the furnace. This way, you will reinsert the filter in the right direction., Once you've located the filter, you can remove it. You should not need any special tools. Simply grab the filter with your fingers and slide it out of place., If your filter has a plastic frame, it's a reusable model. You can clean it out and place it back in your furnace.Disposable filters tend to have cardboard frames. For disposable filters, discard the old filters. You will have to get the same type of filter at a hardware store to replace the old one.Make sure to note the type and size of filter if yours is not reusable. You will need to purchase the same type/size to replace it.

, Filter cleaning is actually very simple. No special cleaners are required. You simply rinse your filter under running water water to remove any dirt, dust, or debris caught in the filter. When necessary, turn the filter around to get all the sides clean., Set the filter somewhere to dry once you've cleaned it. It's best to let the filter air dry. Drying times will vary depending on the temperature of your home, but make sure the filter is completely dry before reinserting it in the furnace., Again, no special equipment is required to reinsert the filter. You simply need to slide it back in place.Make sure to pay attention to the arrow you drew. Place the filter in the right direction of airflow.

, Different types of furnace filters should be cleaned more or less often. Check your filter's label to see what type it is and clean it accordingly.Electrostatic filters need to be cleaned every three months.
Electronic filters should be cleaned weekly.
Mechanical filters are not reusable and should be replaced once a month.

, Each time you clean your filter, make a note of it. Write it down on a physical calendar or one in your home. Make a note of when the filter needs to be changed next. This will help you stay proactive about cleaning your furnace filter., Even reusable filters have a shelf life. Check your filter's label or read your furnace's instructions manual. This will tell you how long your filter will last. Electromagnetic filters, however, do not need replacing unless they are severely damaged."

Choose a moderate abrasive.,
Rub in the direction of the finish lines.,
Rinse the stainless steel cleanser off.,
Wipe away hard water spots and rust with vinegar.,
Buff with flour if the sink is still grimy.,
Consider buffing with oil.,
Keep the sink dry for 24 hours if feasible.",How to Clean a Dull Stainless Steel Sink1," Abrasives can scratch your sink's finish, so use them only for an occasional restoration project, or to remove stubborn stains. Try stainless steel polish, whiting, talc, or baking soda. Apply one of these to a slightly damp cloth., Most stainless steel sinks have a brushed finish.Wipe parallel to the brush lines to reduce the chance of a visible scratch.


Use a toothbrush with a bit of the cleanser to clean the tight areas around the faucet, and the area around the drain.

, Wash the cleanser off of everywhere you used it. If your sink's shine is restored, dry the sink completely with a clean towel, dabbing instead of rubbing to avoid streak marks. If your sink still looks dull, browse through the steps below for additional solutions to specific problems.

, If your sink is clean but covered in dull white spots, dip a soft cloth in white vinegar and wipe them away.This also works on rust spots., Flour is a cheap, very mild abrasive, which makes it a good choice for cleaning a large area. If your sink still looks dirty and you have some spare time, follow these steps:Dry the sink thoroughly. Any water left on the surface will turn the flour into glue.
Sprinkle a light dusting of flour over the sink. Use about ¼ cup (60mL) flour for an average kitchen sink.Buff the sink in a circular motion with a soft cloth, focusing on the rim and drain where food might get stuck.
Once grime is removed, brush the flour into a container and throw it in the kitchen trash. Too much flour can block the drain., Olive oil can boost the shine and remove streaks from your sink, but overdoing it can leave the stainless steel sticky or eventually make the appearance duller than before. If you try it, put just two or three drops of olive oil onto a soft cloth. Wipe the dry sink evenly until the entire surface is coated very lightly. Buff in small circles with the same oiled cloth for a couple minutes until you've achieved an even shine., A major clean can leave the surface of your sink temporarily damaged, especially if there was rust on the surface. Give the steel a day to restore its protective anti-rust layer, or at least dry it thoroughly after each use during this time."
"
Clear out the sink.,
Choose a non-abrasive cleaning tool.,
Scrub with warm water and gentle soap.,
Disinfect the surface occasionally.,
Rinse with hot water.,
Wipe the sink dry.,
Dry scrubbing tools on a different surface.",How to Clean a Dull Stainless Steel Sink2," Wash and remove any dishes. Dispose of solid food debris.


Wash steel and cast iron cookware promptly. These materials may cause rust if left in the sink too long., Sponges, soft cleaning pads, cloths, or bristle brushes are the best tools for scrubbing stainless steel. Abrasive pads and wire brushes may scratch the finish, especially if your sink has a shiny, reflective finish.Never use steel wool or carbon steel brushes. These materials can leave behind small metal particles that cause rust.

, For everyday cleaning, mild soap or dish detergent is enough to prevent discoloration or dulling.Scrub until you've removed all debris and stains from the sink surface.

, Kitchen sanitizer products with quaternary ammonia are among the most effective disinfectants for stainless steel, and should not damage your sink's finish.However, they may irritate skin or cause asthma, and in some cases can damage aquatic life when washed down the drain.White vinegar is a fairly effective alternative if you are concerned with these issues.In either case, use a spray bottle to coat the surface of the sink.


Most kitchen sanitizers that are not bleach-based contain quaternary ammonia. To confirm this, check the ingredients list for a chemical name ending in ""ammonium chloride,"" or for an abbreviation such as BAC, BZK, BKC, or ADBAC.Bleach-based cleaners are not recommended, as they can corrode your sink if not rinsed off thoroughly.Never let bleach come into contact with residue from other cleaners, as the reaction can produce dangerous gas.

, For best results, let the disinfectant sit for a least ten minutes before rinsing it off with hot water., Water that evaporates on the sink surface can leave behind white spots, especially if you live in a hard water area. Wipe away moisture with a soft, dry cloth to preserve the sink's shine., Wet sponges, clothes, or dish mats can trap water on the sink surface. This can cause stains or dull spots.Squeeze out excess water, then place them on a windowsill or waterproof counter to dry instead.

Turn on the griddle.,
Mix your water and soap.,
Scrub your griddle.,
Move on to stronger scrubbing devices if necessary.",How to Clean a Griddle1," With your griddle warm, caked-on bits of grime should come off more easily during cleaning. Turn your griddle to the appropriate setting. Different griddles are meant to be cleaned at different temperatures. Different griddle soaps, likewise, are intended for use at different ideal temperatures. Check both your griddle’s user manual and the griddle soap you obtained to determine what temperature you should set your griddle to.It will be easier to clean your griddle when you’ve just used it, before it’s cooled, than it will be to try and clean the griddle after the bits of whatever you’ve been cooking have caked onto its surface.;
, In a small bowl or bucket, combine griddle soap with warm water. Your griddle soap might have specific directions regarding the proportions of water and soap should be mixed. For instance, perhaps your soap will come in a single packet that must be mixed with two cups of water.Do not submerge your griddle entirely in water and soap. Doing so could damage the electronics inside your griddle.

, After dipping your sponge or cleaning implement into the warm, soapy water you’ve prepared, use it to loosen and remove as much gunk as possible. Use a back-and-forth or up-and-down scrubbing motion when scrubbing your griddle. You could move from top to bottom, or from bottom to top. If you’re scrubbing your griddle with an up-and-down motion, you could move from right to left or from left to right as you scrub.Attach the drip tray if your griddle does not have one permanently attached. Place a bowl or small container beneath the drip tray’s drain to catch the water you use to scrub the griddle.
Dip your sponge or griddle brush into the water frequently during the cleaning process. This ensures the griddle receives a steady application of soapy water.
If a moderate level of force is not removing gunk from the griddle, apply pressure more firmly when scrubbing.

, For instance, if your griddle is not getting clean with a thin griddle sponge, use a thicker griddle sponge. If your griddle sponges have proven ineffective, try a griddle brush. If the griddle brush proves ineffective, try a griddle scraper.Sometimes alternating between different cleaning instruments produces the best result. For instance, you might use a griddle brush to loosen material that has caked onto the griddle, then scrape it off with a griddle scraper.

Season your griddle before use.,
Avoid cooking with non-stick cooking spray and corn oil.,
Wipe your griddle down after light cooking.,
After heavy cooking, wipe your griddle down with club soda.,
Do not use metal utensils.",How to Clean a Griddle2," When you first use your griddle, you can add a protective coating – or “seasoning” – to it to prevent rust and make it easier to clean in the future. To season your griddle, pour one teaspoon (five milliliters) of vegetable oil onto the griddle. Use a paper towel to spread the oil across its entire surface. Let the oil sit on the griddle for one hour. Wipe up any residual oil after an hour has passed. Season your griddle again if you’re using it again for the first time after a long period of disuse., Non-stick cooking sprays have a high water content and burn easily. And if you’re cooking on a griddle with a nonstick coating, they’re completely redundant. Corn oil, likewise, should be avoided. The high sugar content in corn oil tends to caramelize (melt) and coat the surface in a sticky, burnt mess., Use a paper towel to wipe the surface down. The small amount of oil that remains on the griddle after a light wipe-down will help season the griddle., Pour room-temperature club soda directly on the griddle. Pull oil and food scraps toward the grease trough with a metal spatula. Wipe the surface down with a paper towel, then season your griddle., When using your griddle, avoid using metal forks or spatulas. These could lead to scratching or removal of your griddle’s nonstick coating, if present. Instead, utilize rubber, plastic, or wooden cooking implements.One exception to this rule is in the case of ceramic or stainless steel griddles, which can withstand a metal griddle scraper or other implement."

Obtain a griddle brush.,
Get a griddle scraper.",How to Clean a Griddle3," Specialized griddle-cleaning sops will make cleaning your griddle a breeze. If you cannot locate a specialized griddle-cleaning soap from your local home good store, use an extra-strength soap, or one that is designed to cut through layers of grime and grease., A griddle sponge is specialized type of scrubbing device for griddles. Its surface will scour your grimy griddle to remove caked-on bits of grease and burnt material. Griddle sponges are available with varying thicknesses. The more cleaning your griddle needs, the thicker your griddle sponge should be.Do not use steel wool or other abrasive cleaning devices to clean your griddle.

, For larger griddles, or griddles with grime and crust that simply won’t budge even when scrubbed with a griddle sponge, you’ll need to invest in something more heavy-duty. For this kind of cleaning, get a griddle brush from your local kitchenware store. A griddle brush is a stiff-bristled brush, typically with a wooden handle, that will help you remove even the most tenacious griddle grime., A griddle scraper is a kitchen tool that resembles a paint remover. From the comfortable handle, a fan-like blade extends outward to a straight edge. It is this edge which is used to scrape the griddle of residue and stuck-on bits."

Cleaning after every use helps you avoid messing up other beers.If you don’t clean between kegs, microbial infections may occur in the kegerator that will alter the beer.;
, Before you start cleaning, shut down the kegerator completely. Unplug the kegerator. Make sure you turn off the CO2. Then, you want to close the regulator, disengage the tap, and completely remove the keg., Start by cleaning the outside of the kegerator. Make sure to wipe down the tap, lines, spill tray, regulator, and tank. You also should wipe the inside of the cooling unit. Then, clean the inside surfaces, such as the beer lines, the spigot, and the tap. Use soap without any scent and warm water to wipe down all surfaces.Any spilled beer, puddles, or drops can get in your kegerator and cause problems with future kegs.

, You may want to purchase a beer line cleaning kit. They come with a bottle, pump, and hose that connects to your beer lines. They also come with a cleanser that will sanitize your beer lines.You can buy kits that are hand pumped, that connect to your CO2 pump, or that have a pressurized pump.
Some people make their own cleaning pumps with quart bottles or soda kegs and tubes.

, To start sanitizing your kegerator, you need to remove the faucet and keg coupler. Use your faucet wrench that came with your kegerator to loosen the faucet, and rotate it to the right to loosen it. When it is loose, twist it off with your hands.Take the faucet apart. Depending on your faucet, there will be approximately five different parts. The keg coupler will be attached to the opposite end of the beer lines.

, Place both the faucet parts and keg coupler in a bowl of warm water. Add beer line or kegerator cleaner. Let the parts soak. , If the faucet parts or keg coupler have debris caked on them, use a brush to scrub them clean. Any debris left on the parts may carry bacteria and contaminate your brew.Rinse the parts before reassembling.

, The solution used to sanitize the beer lines should be mixed and put into the cleaning bottle or bucket. Read the specific directions for your beer line cleaner and follow them exactly. Mix with hot water for proper sanitizing.Don’t use bleach to clean your kegerator. Instead, use an oxidizing cleaner.

, With the faucet and keg coupler removed and soaking, you should clean the beer lines. Stick one end of the beer line into a bucket so it can empty into it. Then, attach the end of the cleaning bottle tube to the faucet opening., Using the pump mechanism attached to the cleaning bottle, pump the solution through the beer lines. Let the solution stand in the tubes for a few minutes. Then, rinse the tubes with warm water.The solution will run through the beer lines and empty into the bucket.
Rinse the beer lines at least three times. You want to make sure to remove all cleaning solution from the beer lines.

, Before reassembling your kegerator, check the various parts to make sure they are okay. Check the rubber gasket and the O-rings. These wear fast, so if they show wear or have become flattened, replace them.Make sure there is still enough food-grade lubricant on the O-rings.
Also check the washers to make sure they are still in good shape.

, Put the faucet back together and reconnect it to your kegerator by turning the coupling nut counter-clockwise. Make sure the sealing gasket is back in place. Connect the keg coupler to the beer line and CO2 hose.Turn the valve back to on, and then re-tap your keg.

Measure ¼ cup (59 ml) of uncooked white rice into the grinder.,
Run the grinder for about 1 minute.,
Dump the rice flour out.,
Wipe the grinder down with a damp cloth.,
Allow the grinder to dry.",How to Clean a Coffee Grinder1," Buy a package of white rice at your local grocery store, or use rice that you already have on hand. Make sure to use white rice for cleaning purposes. Use ¼ cup (59 ml) to ⅓ cup (79 ml) depending on the size of your grinder.Measure the rice and pour it into the grinder.;
, Plug the grinder in and turn on the power. Turn on the blade and let it grind the rice for at least 30 seconds and up to one minute. This will turn the rice into rice flour.The rice cleans the grinder by soaking up oils and residue left in the grinder by coffee beans.

, Shut the grinder off and unplug it. If your grinder has a detachable hopper, take it off of the base. If not, take the whole grinder to the trash can. Dump the rice flour into the trash can.Even if you use rice flour on a regular basis, don’t use this flour because it is contaminated with old coffee residue.

, Get a paper towel barely damp with warm water. Carefully wipe down the inside of the grinder. Get all of the crevices. Be sure not to cut yourself on the blades as you wipe down the grinder.Rinse the paper towel and wipe the grinder more than once if necessary.
Be careful not to get the grinder soaking wet, as some of the moisture could stay inside it. Get the cloth just wet enough to wipe up the remaining flour.

, Never use your grinder for coffee beans when it is still wet from cleaning. Dry it off with a cloth and allow it to air dry completely before you use it again. It may be helpful to dry the grinder upside down to make sure no moisture settles into it."
"
Vacuum or blow air inside the grinder.,
Remove the hopper and wash it by hand.,
Take one of the burrs out.,
Scrub the burrs with a toothbrush.,
Tip the grinder over and shake grounds out into the trash.,
Wipe inside the grinder with a dry rag.",How to Clean a Coffee Grinder2," Use a vacuum that has a wand attachment to clean out your grinder. Unplug the grinder and set the vacuum up close to it. Poke the wand around the inside of the hopper and around the burrs to remove as much of the coffee dust as possible.If your vacuum has multiple attachments, use the one with the narrowest end that will help you get the nooks and crannies of the grinder.
If you want, use a can of compressed air to blow dust out of the grinder instead of sucking it out with a vacuum.
If you are in a hurry, or don't have a vacuum or compressed air handy, blow in the grinder a few times to dislodge any leftover grounds. Be careful not to blow anything into your eyes.

, If your grinder has a removable hopper where you load the beans, take this off and wash it separately. Wash the hopper and lid by hand with warm soapy water. Make sure you rinse it thoroughly to get all of the soap residue off of it before you use it again.Allow the hopper to air dry upside down. If you are in a hurry, dry it with a lint free cloth or a paper towel.

, On most coffee grinders, either the inner or outer burr can be removed. It may require a tool that came with your grinder. Check the manual to find out how to remove the burr. Take out whichever one comes out most easily.If neither one comes out easily, you’ll have to clean them while they are in the grinder. Be careful using tools to take the burr out.
Make sure the grinder is unplugged for safe cleaning.

, Use a toothbrush or brush made for coffee grinders to carefully scrub all parts of the burrs. Scrub the one you’ve taken out first and then scrub the burr that is still in the grinder. Get all the cracks and crevices of the burrs, anywhere you can reach with the brush.Use a brush with stiff bristles, but make sure they are not metal. Metal bristles may damage the burrs.

, After you have scrubbed the burr in the grinder, dump loose grounds into the trash. Scrub again and dump it out again if any more grounds seem to be stuck in there. Repeat this process as necessary., Take a dry, clean wash cloth and wipe all parts of the grinder where the beans go. Wipe the burrs themselves carefully, and also wipe the chute and catcher where the coffee grounds fall.The “dry” cloth is important. Never use a damp rag to clean the grinder. The metal parts will corrode if moisture gets into them.

Just open the lid to your baking soda container and apply enough to lightly coat the area of the stovetop you wish to clean. If your stovetop is really grimy, apply a heavier layer of baking soda.Old parmesan cheese containers are ideal for sprinkling baking soda. Similar containers with holes punched through the lids are equally useful. If you have such a container, fill it with baking soda. Sprinkle the baking soda from this container over the stovetop.
To make the baking soda even more effective, some people choose to spray the baking soda with a spray bottle filled with vinegar. There’s no need to measure the volume of vinegar you spray over the area you’ve coated with baking soda. Just spray a light coat – enough to get the baking soda bubbling.;
, Place a large dishrag in hot, soapy water. The rag should be large enough to cover the entire area that you applied baking soda to., Remove the rag from the soapy water. Wring it out. It should be damp, not saturated. Lay the rag over the baking soda on the stovetop. Wait 15 minutes.If you’re trying to clean the entire surface of the stovetop, use a rag that covers the entire surface or a series of smaller rags that enable you to cover the whole surface.

, Once you’ve let the dishrag sit on the stove for 15 minutes, use it to wipe the stovetop. Move it in a wide circle that cleans the area where you applied the baking soda. Once you’ve scrubbed the ceramic stovetop thoroughly, use a damp sponge or another damp dishcloth to clean the remaining baking soda residue from the stovetop. Allow it to air-dry.You might want to wear gloves during the wiping stage.

, If you spill something on your ceramic stovetop and don’t clean it up soon, it will be harder to remove later. Leaving a spill on your ceramic stovetop for too long also risks burning whatever was spilled next time you use the stovetop. Therefore, clean your stovetop as soon as you can.If you spill something while you’re using the stovetop, wait until it has cooled before wiping it up. Otherwise, you might burn yourself.

, Cleaning with an ammonia/water mix or a cleaning product formulated with ammonia cannot effectively clean anything but light dirt and fingerprints from ceramic stovetops. Using such cleaners could lead to iridescent stains on the surface.Avoid abrasive cleaning products. Chemical cleaners like Comet and Ajax will damage your ceramic stovetop. Do not use these products.Likewise, steel wool and abrasive scouring pads will scratch the surface of your ceramic stovetop.

Rub the stain with a silicone spatula.,
Make a baking soda paste.,
Wipe the area clean.",How to Clean a Ceramic Stove Top2," Move the spatula around the stain with small circular motions. This will loosen the debris that forms the stain and make the color fade., Mix four tablespoons baking soda and one or two tablespoons of water. Smear the baking soda on the burned area with your finger or with a sponge. Cover the area with a warm, damp rag. Wait 30 minutes., After 30 minutes has elapsed, use a damp sponge or cloth to wipe the stained area. If some of the stain remains, re-apply the baking soda paste and the damp cloth, and try again.The best cloth to wipe the area with is a microfiber cloth. These cloths are specially designed with more fibers than a normal cloth, meaning they can absorb more of whatever you’re trying to wipe up than regular cloths.

Use a magic eraser.,
Use a specially-formulated cleaning product.,
Scrape away remaining debris.",How to Clean a Ceramic Stove Top3," A magic eraser is a special sort of sponge. Its microporous structure allows it to clean surfaces that prove impossible to clean via normal methods. If your ceramic stovetop has resisted baking soda and razor scraper cleaning solutions, try a magic eraser.You can obtain a magic eraser at your local big box grocery store, or online.

, There are a number of products available designed specifically to clean ceramic stovetops. Cerama Bryte and Cook Top are two such specialized ceramic cooktop cleaners. Each cleaning product is slightly different, so consult manufacturer instructions for more detailed information regarding use.Generally, you’ll spray or sprinkle your stovetop with the specially-formulated cleaning agent, then wipe the surface with a damp rag or sponge.
These products are useful for cutting through grease stains and burned-on material.

, If, after wiping the ceramic stovetop down with baking soda and a damp rag, it is still not clean, use a razor scraper to scrape the debris off. A razor scraper is a small tool consisting of a handle and a razor blade with its edge facing out. Run the blade along the burned material at a sharp angle by keeping the blade and its handle as close as possible to the surface of the ceramic stovetop.Wipe the stovetop with a damp, soapy sponge before scraping it with the razor scraper.
Do not move the blade in a direction that runs parallel to the blade or you’ll scratch the surface of the cooktop. Always move the blade in a direction that is perpendicular to it.
Cleaning the stovetop with a razor scraper should be a last resort.

Rinse your board right after using it.,
Clean your board with dish soap and hot water.,
Rinse your board.,
Dry your board thoroughly to prevent cracking.",How to Clean a Cutting Board1," Rinse your board with water right after you use it, rather than waiting until the end of the meal or even the next day when you clean it. This will help minimize bacteria growth and keep your board cleaner. Resist the urge to throw your board in the sink after the meal and forget about it.





;
, To clean your cutting board, scrub it with a few drops of dish soap on a sponge and some hot water. Be sure to remove any food particles as you wash, paying particular attention to any grooves or scrapes in your board. Food can collect in these spots.







, Rinse your board to remove any traces of soap. You don’t want whatever you cook next to taste like your dish soap.








, After you’re finished washing your cutting board, dry it thoroughly with a clean dishtowel, removing any excess water. This is particularly important if your board is made of wood, as they are more prone to cracks.

"
Use a combination of white vinegar and baking soda.,
Disinfect your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide.,
Remove stains with a scrub of coarse salt.",How to Clean a Cutting Board2," To sanitize your cutting board after use, sprinkle it with some baking soda. Then, spray the baking soda–covered board with white vinegar. This will fizz, helping draw stains out of your board and deodorizing it. Let this mix sit for 5 minutes and then rinse your board with water, drying as normal.







, Just as hydrogen peroxide can clean a wound, it can also clean your cutting board. Sprinkle your board with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and let it stand for 1 minute to kill any surface bacteria. Then, rinse your board with water, and dry with a dishtowel as normal.









Hydrogen peroxide can bleach porous surfaces like wood. Don’t let the solution sit too long or it might fade your cutting board., For deep, set-in stains on your cutting board, use a coarse salt, such as kosher salt, as a scrub. Wet a sponge and use a handful of salt to scour your board, focusing on any areas of discoloration. Rinse your board with water when finished, and dry with a clean towel.








Be sure to wash your hands well and moisturize them with lotion after scrubbing your board with salt. It can be very drying. Another option is wearing kitchen gloves.

Wash your board with diluted bleach once a month.,
Rub your board with a lemon to deodorize once a week.,
Condition your cutting board weekly.",How to Clean a Cutting Board3," Especially if you work with raw meats and fish on your cutting board, use a diluted bleach solution to do a deep clean of your board once a month. Make a solution that’s 1/8th bleach and 7/8ths water. Wet a sponge, and scrub your board with the solution. Rinse well with plain water and dry your board as normal with a clean towel., To keep your board smelling fresh, use half of a cut lemon to deodorize your board. Rub the cut-side of the lemon along the length of the board side to side. Then, rinse with plain water, and dry with a clean towel.







, If your cutting board is made of wood, use mineral oil to condition your board after it’s clean. This will keep it in optimal condition. Do not use organic oils or fats, which can turn rancid, to lubricate your board. Look for products labeled kitchen-grade white mineral oil, such as Howard’s Cutting Board Oil.There are other mineral oils meant for lubricating machinery but not for consumption. Look specifically for kitchen-grade oil.
You can condition your board every time you clean it, or a minimum of once a week. Simply rub your board with the conditioner, and let it air try so the oil can soak in.

Store frequently-used objects in easy-to-reach locations.',
Create centers of activity and store related utensils near where they will be used.,
Clear the counter.,
Make a list.,
Tackle the paper.,
Clean as you go.",How to Organize a Kitchen," Pass it along to a friend or relative, add it to a neighborhood garage sale, or donate it to charity. Be honest! When did you last use that melon baller, meatball scoop, or cookie press? Do you even know what the gizmos do? Do you really need two? Could a more general tool do the job? If you get rid of it, you will not have to hunt past it for things you do use or find a space to store it.;
, If the handle on a pot rattles, the spout always gets clogged up, or the pan always scorches the food, fix or replace it! If you can't afford a replacement now, put it on a list and save your pennies, or request one for a birthday or holiday.

, Notice what you use most often. Figure out where you will use them most. Infrequently used items, like the roasting pan that you only haul out during the holidays, can go on high shelves or in the back of cabinets. They can even be stored outside the kitchen in the garage, attic, basement, guest room closet, or a box under a bed. Make sure every item in your kitchen has earned its right to take up your valuable space! Remember: if you use it infrequently enough, it should go out altogether. Just because it is large or expensive, it doesn't mean you should keep it. If you made pasta twice ten years ago, please ditch the pasta machine.

, Here are some common centers of activity, in the order that food will travel through the kitchen:



Storage or pantry. Consider your freezer an extension of this area. Whether you store foods in a true pantry, a cabinet, a closet, or someplace else entirely, don't forget to go through periodically and clear out items that are hopelessly old or will never be used.

Preparation. Cutting board, knives, measuring cups and spoons, and mixing bowls all go here.

Cooking. The stove and oven plus the utensils that go with them. This area should include pots and pans, pot holders, spoons and spatulas (a utensil jar works well for these).

Baking. If you love to bake, you might find it handy to store your flour, sugar, baking powder, a set of measuring cups and spoons, your favorite mixing bowl, etc. together in one convenient spot.

Serving. The table, plus tableware, serving dishes, napkins, trivets, and anything else you need to sit down and eat. Soy sauce? Salt and pepper shakers? Sugar bowl? Ask yourself whether it would be more convenient to store your dishes and silverware near the table or the dishwasher.

Cleaning. The sink, dishwasher and surroundings. Soap, gloves, dishpan, drying rack, cleansers, towels, etc.

Waste disposal. Keep a trash can handy, plus recycling and compost bins, too. Locate them as centrally as possible without being in the way. They should go near the cleaning and food preparation areas.

, Pay particular attention to reducing the number of objects stored permanently on the counter. The counter needs frequent cleaning and it is your primary workspace. Find another place for knickknacks and anything else that doesn't absolutely need to live there.

, Tattered dishcloths? Out of soap? As you go, write down supplies you find lacking or worn out. Also write down side projects that you find as you go (such as fixing a wobbly table leg). Writing them down allows you to tackle distractions later without missing things.

, Do mail, homework, newspapers, phone calls, or bill paying generate paper in the kitchen? Decide between these strategies:



Give paper another home. Create a paper-sorting center, ideally between the mailbox and the kitchen, with bins for sorting paper, a recycling bin and trash can, space to write, and other necessary supplies.

Make a proper space for paper in the kitchen. Admit that it's going to land there and have a tidy place to put it and a system for clearing it out regularly.

, When you clear one drawer or shelf, wipe out the crumbs before replacing the contents. Cleaning a little at a time makes it less of a chore.

Remove the lid and wash it.,
Remove the filter and set it aside.,
Remove and wash the reservoir.,
Wash the pitcher by hand.,
Use a mild dish detergent and a soft cloth.,
Rinse the pitcher and dry it upside down.",How to Clean a Brita Pitcher," Take the lid off the pitcher and wash it in the sink with hot water and your basic dishwashing detergent. Wipe it down with a washcloth or sponge, making sure to get into the crevices of the lid as best as you can. For pitchers with electronics in the lid, be sure to not submerge them in water.

For Brita pitchers that feature a chrome lid, mix one teaspoon of vinegar into a cup of warm water and gently wipe the lid down with a soft cloth dipped in the water.;
, The filter does not need to be washed, but rinse it off with warm water if you want to. Set the filter on a clean surface so you don’t contaminate it., Take the water reservoir out of the pitcher, if it has one, and put it in the sink. Using a mild dish detergent and warm water, wipe the reservoir down with a soft cloth. Be sure to wipe the inside and outside of the reservoir, as well as the cradle where the filter sits., Wash the pitcher in the sink with hot soapy water. Plastic Brita pitchers are not made to withstand excessively hot water, so never clean your Brita filter by putting it in the dishwasher. If you do, your pitcher is likely to melt and warp, making it useless., When you wash the pitcher, use a basic dishwashing soap that is non-abrasive. Any type of liquid dish soap with mild cleaning ingredients works fine. Use a soft cloth or sponge as opposed to steel wool or any other harsh scrubbers.Dawn, Palmolive, and Joy are examples of mild dish soaps which are good to use.

, After you have washed the pitcher, rinse it thoroughly. To let the pitcher dry, set it upside down in a drying rack or on a clean towel on your counter or table. Drying the pitcher with a towel may leave small fibers which will get into your water.If you are in a hurry, dry the pitcher with a paper towel to avoid leaving cloth fibers.

Place an old newspaper on the ground in front of the stove.,
Scoop the ashes out of the fire box.,
Cover the ash can.,
Dispose of the ashes.,
Scrape rust off with a wire brush.,
Apply sandpaper to the exterior of the stove.,
Wipe the stove down with a vinegar cleaning mixture.,
Purchase a glass cleaning solution.,
Clean with a mixture of vinegar, water, and soap.,
Clean the chimney and chimney cap.",How to Clean a Cast Iron Stove," Do this as a protective measure before you begin scooping ashes out of the stove, as they are liable to drop onto the ground. A newspaper will make cleanup much easier. As you’re spreading the newspaper, open the air dampener so that any ash stuck to it will fall into the firebox.The air dampener will be a small knob on the front of the cast iron stove, that you should pull outward to open. If the stove is still warm, use a piece of hooked metal to pull the air dampener open.;
, Open the glass door on the front of the cast iron stove and, using your metal ash shovel, scoop up all of the leftover ash inside of the stove. Place the shovelfuls of ash into a metal ash bucket. Be meticulous when cleaning the ashes out of the stove; you’ll be able to start your next fire much more easily if there are no leftover ashes in the firebox.Before you begin scooping up the ashes, make sure that the fire is completely out, and there are no live coals. If there are still any red-hot coals, wait for them to cool and go out before shoveling them up.

, After you’ve finished shoveling the ashes out of the firebox, place the lid back on the ash can. Set the can on a non-flammable surface, like brick or tile. It’s important to let the ash can sit for at least 48 hours before you dispose of the ashes, in case there are still any live coals in the ash.It’s important to keep the can covered, as a slight breeze could lift ash and soot from the can and send it flying through your house.
Once you’ve tossed the ashes, you can also pick up the newspapers that you initially spread on the carpet. Be careful not to spill any ash on the floor. Throw the newspapers away.

, When the ash bucket is full (after you’ve shoveled out the fire box several times), you’ll need to dispose of the ashes and empty the bucket. If you live in a rural area, you can simply walk a few hundred feet from your house and spread the ashes out on the ground. Alternately, if you have a compost pile or a garden, toss the ashes on top of the soil.If it’s windy outside, wait for the wind to die down before you spread the ashes. Dormant embers may re-ignite in a strong wind.

, Depending on how old the stove is and how much rust and grime has built up on its outer surface, this may take some serious scrubbing. Focus on applying the wire brush to the top of the cast iron stove, and to other areas where rust is visible.Rust is especially likely to have built up if you’ve rested metal on the top of the cast iron stove. People often leave tea kettles on top, or use the heat of the stove to cook pans of food or raise bread dough. These uses will contribute to rust and grime on the stovetop.

, Once you’ve cleaned off the majority of the rust and built-up grime with the wire brush, you can use sandpaper to get of any remaining rust and to generally clean the outside of the cast iron stove. Start with a coarse grain sandpaper, such as 150-grit. Then move on to a more fine-grained sandpaper, even one as fine as 400-grit.Sand the entire outer surface of the cast iron stove. This will remove any marks or scratches made by the wire brush or by the coarse grain sandpaper.

, After you’ve finished sanding the stove, you can clean any lingering smudges of ash or dirt off of the exterior surface using a vinegar cleaning solution. Spray the solution across the surface of the cast iron stove, and wipe it clean using a few old rags.Let the stove dry before you light the next fire inside.


To make the vinegar cleaning solution, find an empty spray bottle, and combine inside two parts water to one part vinegar, then add a small amount of dish soap. Shake the spray bottle, and the cleaning solution will be ready to use.

, The glass doors on a cast iron stove often become entirely blackened with built up soot and smoke, and can be difficult to clean. The best product to use for the task is a glass cleaning solution that has been specifically designed to clean wood stove front doors.Spray the product onto a couple of old rags, and use the wet rags to wipe the glass door clean.


This product should be available at your local hardware store. If you’re having trouble finding it, speak to the sales staff and ask for their assistance.
Glass cleaning solution contains ammonia, so be careful not to get any in your eyes. Do not inhale the solution.

, If you’d prefer to use a non-toxic cleaning solution for the glass door, find or purchase an empty spray bottle. Mix two parts water to one part clear vinegar, and then add a squirt of regular dish soap. Shake the bottle to mix the ingredients. Then, you can spray the vinegar solution directly onto the glass, and rub it clean using old rags.You can find all of these products at your local grocery store or drug store. If you’re already at a hardware store shopping for the other necessary materials, you may be able to find vinegar and a spray bottle there as well.

, Creosote (deposits of tar) will build up at the top of the chimney, and if left long enough, can catch fire and cause a chimney fire. To prevent this and to keep the top of the chimney clean, you’ll need to access the top of the flue via the roof. Remove the chimney cap, and, using a stiff-bristled chimney brush, scrape all of the creosote and deposits of ash and soot.Also brush any built-up creosote off of the chimney cap.


You’ll need to climb up on the roof for this step, so take the necessary safety precautions. Have a second person help you by stabilizing the base of the ladder while you’re climbing up.
Avoid standing or walking near the edges of the roof, and don’t climb up on a windy day.

Dampen your sink.,
Sprinkle baking soda into the sink.,
Scrub the baking soda with a damp sponge.,
Whiten the sink with lemon slices.,
Let the lemon juice sit for 30 minutes.",How to Clean a Ceramic Sink1," Before you apply the baking soda, lightly dampen the basin of the ceramic sink. You can do this by allowing the sink to fill with water and then draining it, or using your hand to splash water around on the sides of the basin. Make sure that no standing water is left in the sink, as this will dissolve the baking soda and render it useless.Also dampen the sponge that you plan to clean the sink with. You don’t want the sponge soggy, so wring it out well before you start cleaning.;
, You can start by adding about ½ cup (0.25 liter). Use your fingers or a spoon to sprinkle the baking soda in the basin of the sink, until the ceramic has been fully coated. Make sure to apply baking soda to any areas that are soiled or stained., Baking soda functions as a mild abrasive, and will be effective at cleaning mineral buildup, leftover toothpaste, and general dirt and grime off of the ceramic. Rinse the sponge as needed, and make sure to wring it out fully before you return to scrubbing the ceramic. Once you’ve cleaned the sink, rinse it well with water.While you’re scrubbing, you should notice the baking soda clumping together into small lumps. This is a good sign: it means that the baking soda is not too wet, and that it’s effectively picking up dirt from your sink.

, To naturally “bleach” your ceramic sink, start by cutting a lemon into several wedges. Take each wedge and rub it around the basin of the sink, making sure to squeeze out plenty of lemon juice on the ceramic. You can use the tough skin of the lemon to scrub at stains or other darkened areas.You’ll need to use at least four or five lemon slices to fully coat the ceramic with lemon juice.

, Once the ceramic is covered with lemon juice, let it sit for 30 minutes. This will give the natural acidity of the lemon juice time to break down stains. Once the lemon juice has set for half an hour, come back and rinse the sink out.Throw away the remnants of the lemon rinds, or grind them up in your kitchen sink’s garbage disposal.

Soak the sink with a bleach solution.,
Apply cream of tartar and vinegar.,
Scrub the stain gently with a pumice stone.",How to Clean a Ceramic Sink2," In an empty plastic spray bottle, combine a 1:1 solution of bleach and water. Lightly shake the bottle to mix the solution. Open the window or turn on your bathroom fan before you start spraying the bleach solution, as this will provide ventilation. Then, spray the bleach solution over the entire interior surface of the ceramic sink. Let the bleach mixture sit and soak for about 10 minutes. Then, use a sponge or an old rag to wipe the sink clean.Bleach is a strong chemical and can be very harmful if ingested or sprayed in the eyes. Use caution when spraying bleach, consider wearing safety goggles or at least rubber gloves, and wear clothing that you don’t care about.
If there are young children in your house, make sure that they’re not near the sink when you’re spraying bleach.

, If you would prefer to not use any chemical cleaners, you can remove stains from the ceramic with a mixture of cream of tartar and vinegar. Combine the cream of tartar and the vinegar at a 1:1 ratio in a small mixing bowl, and stir them together. Then, spoon some of the mixture onto the stains on your ceramic. Let this sit for about 10 minutes, and wipe clean with a sponge.This method will also work if you substitute hydrogen peroxide for the vinegar. All three of these ingredients can be purchased at your local grocery store or supermarket.

, Pumice stone is quite abrasive and can scrub stains off of your ceramic. Before using, run the pumice under water, and make sure that the stone stays wet while you’re rubbing out a stain. Then, lightly scrub at the stained area of your ceramic sink. The pumice should remove the discoloration.Be careful when using this method. If you apply a pumice stone to a ceramic sink, the stone may scratch or damage the surface. Begin by rubbing gently, and stop if you see any scratches forming.

Wash the sink with a soft sponge.,
Clean with a gentle, ceramic-specific product.,
Wash dishes in the sink or in a metal container.",How to Clean a Ceramic Sink3," Although ceramic is a tough, durable material, it can still be damaged if scrubbed with an abrasive material. Do not use scouring pads to clean your ceramic sink, especially any pads made of wire or metal. Also do not use scouring powders to clean your ceramic sink, as they could scratch or damage the surface.Instead of these, clean the sink with a soft, non-abrasive sponge.


Some cleaning companies manufacture scouring liquids. Also avoid using these on the ceramic sink.

, Do not use concentrated drain cleaners in your ceramic sink. Although these products are advertised as being safe on all surfaces, a chemically potent concentrated drain cleaner may damage or erode the surface of your ceramic sink.If you would like to use a drain cleaner, look for a gentler cleanser that is specifically designed for use on ceramic or porcelain.


You may be more likely to find such a drain cleaner at a health store or a natural foods store.

, Be careful to avoid washing dishes in large plastic bowls. Although the plastic bowls themselves will not harm the ceramic, the bowls will likely accumulate grit and dirt on their bottoms through normal use. This grit can scratch the surface of the ceramic on the bottom of your sink, and these scratches cannot be removed.When you wash dishes, either fill the sink itself with soapy water, or find a large vessel that will not collect grit on its bottom. For example, use a large metal saucepan.

Use a drain strainer.,
Avoid pouring grease or oil down the drain.,
Avoid putting tea leaves down the sink drain.,
Pour hot water down the drain weekly.",How to Avoid Kitchen Sink Blockages1," If you do not have a garbage disposal unit installed in your sink, it is very important to avoid letting food scraps go down the drain. Find a drain strainer that fits the opening of your sink and use it collect food scraps.A wide variety of drain strainers are available at hardware stores.
It can be helpful to bring along a photo of your sink and ask a sales associate to help you choose the right one.;
, Never pour hot fat down the kitchen sink. The fat will cool down, congeal, and set in the pipes. The best approach is to let fats/oils cool in a container (such as a coffee can) and place the solid fat into the garbage bin., Tea leaves can accumulate in the drain, expand, and clog at the S-bend. As such, it is important to prevent tea leaves from going down the drain. Throw your tea leaves in the trash, or you can use them in compost if you have a garden., Even if you are careful, a small amount of food and/or fats can make their way down your drain. In order to prevent blockages, it is a good idea to pour boiling hot water down your sink about once a week. Heat some water in a kettle, and pour it slowly down the drain."

Avoid putting ""problem foods"" through your disposal.,
Run cold water while you use your disposal.,
Make vinegar ice cubes.",How to Avoid Kitchen Sink Blockages2," If you have a garbage disposal, you don't need to worry as much about food scraps. However, there are a handful of foods that can cause problems for garbage disposals and lead to blockages in your kitchen sink.These ""problem foods"" include:


Banana peels
Coffee grounds
Potato skins
Rice and pasta
Eggshells

, Even though a garbage disposal is specifically designed to grind up scraps of food, things can still get stuck. One way to prevent this from happening is to run a stream of cold water from the faucet anytime your run your garbage disposal. This helps to clear away any stubborn foods scraps and clear up potential clogs., If you use your garbage disposal frequently, doing a bit of preventative maintenance can help prevent blockages. A natural and effective method is to use vinegar ice cubes. Pour white vinegar into an ice cube tray until it is half-full, and top it off with water (because vinegar will not freeze on its own). Then place the tray in the freezer for several hours. When they have frozen, toss the vinegar ice cubes into your disposal and turn it on. Be sure to label your vinegar ice cubes in the freezer. It would be awful for a family members to use them in a beverage!

Sprinkle baking soda down the drain monthly.,
Pour vinegar down the drain.,
Perform a deep cleaning with salt, baking soda, and vinegar.",How to Avoid Kitchen Sink Blockages3," You can help to prevent drain blockages by regularly flushing your drain. Sprinkle 2-4 Tbs. of baking soda down your drain. Follow this with hot water from your faucet, letting the hot water run for 2-3 minutes.Consider doing a baking soda flush once a month, or any time your drain seems slow.

, Another option for your monthly drain-flush is to use white vinegar. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar down the drain, and wait 30 minutes. Follow with hot water from your faucet, letting the water run for 2-3 minutes. White vinegar contains acetic acid, which is excellent at dissolving built up grime in your pipes.

, If you have experienced clogs in the past, or if it has been a long time since you've done a flush, you may want to do a deeper cleaning. For this you can combine 1/2 cup of salt with 1/2 cup of baking soda and pour this down the drain. Follow this with 1/2 cup of white vinegar, and wait several minutes for the mixture to foam. Then pour 2 quarts of water down the drain to rinse."

Defrost more often.",How to Defrost a Freezer," Turning off the freezer will prevent the freezer from using too much power while the process is going. Keeping the cold food together and in an insulated area should keep everything frozen, so long as you pay attention to your task and get it done quickly.;
, Remove as much of the food from the freezer as you are able to. To prevent items from thawing, wrap them in towels and place them in a cooler bag or insulated box. Store this in the coldest area of your house, away from direct sunlight.








, Set these aside for cleaning. Do not force them out if they are covered in ice. You might break them.








, Some freezers will have a drain at the bottom which leads to a hose. This hose usually comes out below the freezer. See if you can locate this hose. If you do, pull it forward and connect it to a longer hose or otherwise guide the water away from the freezer.









You also might want to place shims under the front feet of the fridge to help encourage the water towards the drain.

, Put old newspapers around the base of the freezer, this will soak up the water as the ice melts. Old newspapers are ideal for this job as they can slide under the freezer and are extremely absorbent. Place shop towels on top of these to catch the majority of the water.








, There are a few different ways to defrost a freezer, each with benefits and downsides. Your options include:









Waiting for the ice to melt. Just allowing time to take its course is the traditional way of defrosting a freezer. This can be slow, especially if you live in a cold area, but this is the safest way to get the job done.
Use a hairdryer. It is perfectly safe to use a hair dryer to defrost a freezer, so long as you practice some basic safety precautions. Make sure to stand clear of the water puddle and keep the cord and hairdryer away from any water or ice. You should also not get the end of the dryer too close to the coils or sides of the freezer, since the high heat can damage the unit. The high heat can also damage the plastic inside your freezer. Focus on one small area at a time
Use a fan. Using a basic fan can help circulate warmer air into freezer, but this only works if it's decently warm in your home to begin with.
Setting bowls or pans of hot water on the shelves. A common method to speed up the process is to place bowls or pans of boiling water on the shelf or shelves and closing the door. The steam should loosen the ice, letting you remove all of the ice by hand after about 20 minutes, if you defrost regularly. However, this method may cause damage to the shelves. To reduce the chance of causing damage, put a thickly folded towel under the pot on the shelf.
Use a hot spatula. Get a metal spatula and heat it up by holding it over a fire. You'll probably want to be wearing an oven mitt. Then, simply press the spatula into the ice to break it up.
Use a hot cloth. You can use a rag dipped in very hot water to loosen some of the ice. Focus on small chunks at the edges, grabbing and wiping at the ice to remove it.

, Speed up the process by removing the ice with your hand, a cloth, or a spatula as it begins to soften up. Do not use a sharp object such as a pick or knife to loosen chunks of ice. This can damage your freezer or even cause a gas leak.








, Use shop towels to wipe up any water as you go. Keep the soaked towels in a bucket or sink to keep the water from getting everywhere.








, You should take this opportunity to clean the freezer if you have not cleaned it recently.








, You should use a hairdryer or towels to get the freezer as dry as possible before turning it back on. This will keep ice from immediately building back up.








, Take the opportunity to check the seal on the freezer. A poor seal is usually what leads to serious build-up of frost.You may want to replace yours if it seems like it's not getting the job done, or is damaged in some way.









Apply oil to the rubber seal of the fridge and freezer doors, making sure all the grooves are oiled. This prevents the rubber seal drying out in the years to come and helps to maintain a strong suction seal when the door closes. After a fresh application there will be stains on the fridge where the door meets but a few wipe downs and the oil itself will eventually be absorbed by the rubber seal itself. Using a thicker oil like olive oil prevents oil from dripping too much.

, Don't wait so long to defrost your freezer in the future. Defrosting when there is only 1/4"" (6 mm) or less of ice will make the process much faster and keep your food from spoiling.

Finished.",How to Make Lemon Vinegar Ice Cubes to Clean Garbage Disposal," You don’t have to go organic or purchase a special kind of lemon––regular grocery store lemons will do the trick.;
, This will help to evenly distribute the juice before cutting.

, Size them to fit each ice cube tray mold. Then, place the lemon pieces into the separate holes of the ice cube tray.


Line up the trays if using more than one, so that you can fill them completely with lemon.






Don’t worry about de-seeding the lemon wedges. You won’t be to eating these ice cubes!







, Fill each mold just before the top (don't let it overflow).


Use only vinegar––don’t dilute with water. Diluting the cubes will lessen the deodorizing impact.







, The cubes need to be rock hard.


Pop the cubes from the trays. Transfer them to a plastic freezer bag to store in your freezer. (Leaving the cubes in the trays will expose them to food odors, minimizing their deodorizing impact.) Label and date––labeling will prevent anyone using the cubes for their drinks.







, Make a habit of dropping one cube in your disposal every night after doing the dishes. This will prevent last night’s dinner from intermingling with this morning’s breakfast.

Make a list of all the cleaning tasks that your home requires.,
Arrange your cleaning tasks using a calendar.,
Assign each cleaning task to the person responsible for it.,
Augment your monthly schedule with a daily checklist if desired.,
Adjust your housecleaning schedule as needed.",How to Manage Your Time When Housecleaning," Managing your time well is a matter of scheduling well, and enumerating your cleaning tasks will help you build a schedule.


Aim for comprehensiveness. Include both frequent and infrequent cleaning tasks on your list. For example, frequent tasks might include laundry, sweeping, and washing dishes. Less regular tasks might include cleaning windows, dusting air registers, and deep cleaning your appliances.
Next to each task on your list, estimate how often it needs to be done. For example, you might decide that dishes need to be cleaned daily, vacuuming can be done every 3 days, and cleaning out the refrigerator can be done once a month.;
, After deciding on the frequency of your housecleaning tasks, you can begin building your schedule. This is best done using a month-to-month calendar; you can also build your schedule on a weekly or even yearly basis if desired.


Begin by marking down your prior commitments on the calendar. For example, if a particular work commitment will absorb most of your time on a certain day, you won't want to assign yourself a time-consuming housecleaning task.
Next, mark down your most frequent cleaning tasks on the calendar. For example, if you've decided you need to vacuum every 3 or 4 days, you might mark ""vacuuming"" down on each Monday and Thursday. As you fill in your frequent tasks, make sure to spread them out evenly. You may want to group related tasks (such as vacuuming and sweeping) on the same day.
Now fill in your less frequent tasks. Weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly tasks can be filled in after your more frequent tasks. Once you have completed the entire month's schedule, you can use it for each successive month. Minor changes may be required by your work schedule.

, If the housecleaning in your home is handled by more than 1 person, make sure each person's responsibilities are indicated on the schedule. These responsibilities should also be worked around other time commitments.

, You may find that there are some tasks that need to be done every day or on an ""as needed"" basis. You could consider arranging these tasks in a separate daily checklist. Examples might include making the bed and spot cleaning floors and surfaces.

, The entire point of the housecleaning schedule is to help you manage your time so that cleaning tasks don't pile up and feel oppressive. If the schedule itself starts to feel oppressive, don't be afraid to make adjustments. Shift responsibilities around or scale back the frequency of tasks until the schedule fits your needs and you are able to stick to it.

Break the main task down into small tasks.,
Make a list of what needs to be done.,
Clean first thing in the morning.,
Start small.",How to Motivate Yourself to Clean1," If you look at your room and see that all your clothes need to be put away, the carpet needs to be vacuumed, the mirror and windows need cleaning, the bed needs to be made, and your dresser needs dusting, this will look like a huge, insurmountable task! Instead of looking at all of this and feeling overwhelmed, focus on a small task. Simply plan on putting your clothes away to start with. Then once you accomplish that, you can tackle another small task. Over time, your whole room will be cleaned without overwhelming yourself in the process., Include each small task that you need to accomplish. A list is a powerful motivator, especially when you cross tasks off as you complete them. Don’t underestimate the power of that checkmark next to your task! This shows your accomplishment and will help you to be goal-oriented. Knowing that you only have five more checkmarks to go will help your goal be more tangible.If the list is unrealistic for the timeframe you have available, break it up into sections that can be tackled in each session. Rank in order of priority. Uniforms have to be washed for Monday morning, but the cutlery can wait to be polished.
If you think of more things that need to be done as you work, add them to another list. Keep your mind on completing what you have started.

, As the day goes on, it gets progressively more difficult to accomplish unpleasant tasks. By getting it out of the way first thing in the morning, you will accomplish it more quickly and carry this sense of accomplishment with you throughout your day. This will create more motivation for you to clean the next time because you will remember how great that sense of accomplishment feels.Cleaning first thing also helps you to avoid procrastinating. Get started before you turn on your computer or phone. This will help you to eliminate distractions that will compete for your attention.

, Sometimes the first step is the hardest. By simply making yourself put that one shirt in the clothes hamper, that might be all you need to get going. By completing a small task, you will see that it really wasn’t that bad, which can motivate you to do the next task. A clean room is the result of many small tasks being completed. Start with one, and move on from there.Focus on one task for 10 minutes and see how far you get during this time. Then turn to another task for ten minutes. You’ll be surprised how much you can clean in a short amount of time.

Visualize a clean room.,
Invite friends over for the evening or the next day.,
Decide on a reward for a job well done.,
Post an inspirational message or picture.,
Time yourself.,
Record your progress.",How to Motivate Yourself to Clean2," That can be enough motivation in itself. This will remind you why you want to clean and why cleaning is important to you. When you focus on the end result, you will be motivated to get there.Try to be specific in your visualization. Don’t only focus on the clean room, but imagine yourself enjoying it with people you love. Maybe you see yourself enjoying a meal with your family in a clutter-free kitchen. This rewarding experience will make cleaning worth it., A definite deadline will get you moving, and you will have an appreciative audience for your great work! When you know your house needs to be cleaned by a specific date, you will avoid procrastinating. Knowing that someone will view your work can be very helpful and will hold you accountable.You could even share your goal or document your progress on social media. Sharing this with others will help you get going. A little positive peer pressure never hurts!

, Knowing that you will be rewarded is a great way to increase your motivation. Perhaps if you clean your house, you will treat yourself to a manicure or your favorite meal. Invite someone to celebrate with you!, Write an inspirational quote on your mirror or refrigerator with a dry erase marker. Hang an inspirational picture on your wall. Finding motivation from your surroundings will help get you going.If you aren't sure where to start, you could post a picture of what your room looks like when it's clean.
For a motivational quote, you could use a statement such as this one by Thoreau: ""Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined.""

, Setting a schedule can be a strong motivator because it makes your task finite and quantifiable. Knowing you will clean for an hour is much easier than just saying you will clean, because there is a definite end in sight. It will also help you to accomplish more by having a shorter, more focused time frame. When you have a set amount of time, you can quickly get to work rather than dillydallying or succumbing to distractions.Try breaking your cleaning up into time chunks that work for you, perhaps in one hour segments.

, This is useful especially if it is a large undertaking. Use a digital camera to take a picture of the room from the same angle every half hour. This visual evidence will give you a sense of accomplishment rather than simply dwelling on everything yet to be done. Seeing how much you’ve accomplished is a powerful motivator.You can even make a written log of everything you accomplished today. This will celebrate your achievement and give you something to look back at to remind you how much you can get done.

Enlist help.,
Listen to music and sing.,
Turn it into a game.,
Allow for quick breaks.",How to Motivate Yourself to Clean3," If the amount of cleaning to be done is too much for you, invite a friend or family member to help you. When you work together, it will be more fun and go much faster. This will help it seem less overwhelming too.Make a deal with a friend that if they help you with your cleaning, you’ll help them with theirs. This way you both benefit.

, Get some music that you enjoy and play it on the radio, on your iPod or phone or tune into a music station on the television. There are many websites that stream music for free. Listening to music is a powerful motivator that will help the time pass and make it much more enjoyable, especially if you sing along. You might even forget that you’re cleaning!You can even set your favorite song to play on repeat or make a cleaning playlist that will go through your favorite songs. That way you won’t continually be browsing through songs to find one you like. You can simply hit “play” and focus on cleaning.

, This will definitely make cleaning more enjoyable. For example, you could pick up things of one color or see how much you can pick up in 5 minutes. This will also help you to break your cleaning into more concentrated areas of focus.


Compete with yourself! If it took you a half hour to clean the windows last time, try for twenty minutes this time. By awakening your inner competitor, you will have fun and accomplish more.

, Have a cup of coffee, read a page of a magazine, or pat the cat, then get back to cleaning. Schedule these breaks ahead of time to break up your cleaning into more manageable chunks. If you know that you will straighten your room for a half hour and then enjoy a cup of coffee, time will go faster by making your goal more attainable and your reward imminent.


Make sure your breaks aren’t too long or you will likely remember how much you enjoy not cleaning! You are just looking for a quick break to reenergize yourself and then get right back into it.

Important: If you do choose to watch a movie, make sure you don't get comfy somewhere and continue to watch it instead of cleaning. Sing or play music as you clean. You could dance when you are cleaning.;
, Choose an interesting podcast to learn something amazing while you clean.

, Set a timer and see how much stuff you can pick up in the allotted time! (Also see the step on rewards below, as you could give yourself a prize.)

, For example: Pretend you're Cinderella and you're cleaning the house, but you have to be done in time so you can go to the ball.

, Dress up like a pop star and act as if you're cleaning up your dressing room to receive important people who want to congratulate you for an amazing performance.

, Choose colors and pick up only the things in those colors. Then switch to another color, then another, until all the things have been picked up, put away and cleaned.

, Set a certain time limit in which you have to finish tidying up that category in before you can move onto the next one. An example would be you have to pick up and put away all the clean washing in 10 minutes before you can move onto making your bed or vacuuming the floor.

, Many people get less and less motivated during cleaning. Eat a little of your favorite food or decorate your forehead with stickers; something to keep yourself from stopping.

, It may seem a dull thing to do but it's a way of tricking your mind into doing things automatically without having to think ""what next?"". This frees up your mind for thinking about other things, for listening to music and for having a more enjoyable time than simply scrubbing and vacuuming.

, Doing this will make your room look cleaner instantly, providing you with a good sense of motivation. Even better, it gives you space to sort things on.

, Hang up clothes, put dirty ones in the laundry basket and put away all items that aren't in their usual spot. Instant tidiness!

, After all, it'll be strewn with stuff, and cleaning gear, until the very end. Once it's cleared, the mopping or vacuuming will be a cinch.

, If a room is without a bin, bring one in for the cleaning time.

, Stop every 10 or 15 minutes to have a snack or a rest.

, Put the sprays and polishes together, floor cleaning tools such as mop, broom and vacuum together and, of course, the cleaning cloths together.

, (but make sure friends want to). Cleaning is always more fun when you have someone to do it with, and it doesn't last as long.

, For example: Tell your friend to close their eyes, tidy an object up, and your friend guesses what's missing or try to shoot items into a bin from a distance.

, If they say yes then usually you'll get into the cleaning mode.

, Highest score wins.

Clean every week!",How to Make Cleaning a Habit," Why do you not like it? Is an enormous mess the turn-off? Maybe your parents were lax with cleaning, and you took up their lazy lifestyle? You can fix these problems, but that will take some time.


Dealing with a huge mess of dirty laundry, candy wrappers, and lollipop sticks is torment. YOU didn't make this mess, so why should you have to clean it up? We all ask ourselves, ""_____ made this mess, not me! Why am I cleaning it up?"" The point is, sometimes, you have to just suck it up and clean it, whether you like or not.
;
, Such as a vacuum, a broom and dustpan, a duster, some cleaning spray, a washcloth, and a laundry basket. You never know when you might need this items while cleaning up.


If you do not have one or two of these items, now would be a good time to go purchase them. Before cleaning up the messes, get all the supplies.

, You may need to purchase a cart to get all the supplies into the room without having to make more than one trip. If you have a mess in the living room, make sure all of your supplies are somewhere near the mess, just for the convenience of not getting up and down every 5 seconds to get a different supply. But sometimes, the best supplies are your bare hands. When working with a mold stain, always wear rubber gloves, to avoid being contaminated, or worse, getting mold spores in your air and ending up with mold in your lungs, which can kill you if a medical professional doesn't help immediately. Maybe save the mold for the experts.


Getting the dirty clothes and candy wrappers out of the way is important. You need an open space so you can clean without having to try to shrink somewhat. Once that is out of the way, start!

, Not cleaning always starts with an excuse, and when it comes to cleanliness, no excuse is acceptable, ever.

, You need to get that cleaning avoidance out of the picture and bring your frequent cleaning habit in.

, This will fill your home with lots of light and fresh air, which will make you feel good as you clean. Refreshing and healthy!

, Time yourself to see how fast you could go while still doing a good job. Just think of it as you were playing a game. Use your imagination and creativity, to make it a less daunting task. Give yourself points for every room you clean well and have your parents evaluate your work.

, Pretend you're a pirate ship's cook and you have to do the dishes. If you're older, then think about what homework you need to do, or think of the weekend and relaxing(chocolate, computer and holidays).

Clean messes as soon as you make them.",How to Make Cleaning Easier," Play music as you clean, and even dance to it as you mop the floor. Listen to audiobooks or language lessons.;
, Tackle one room at a time, and break that room into smaller areas. Instead of wading in without a plan, focus on one thing at a time. This makes it easier to motivate yourself by seeing your progress. Here's an example:


Remove everything that does not belong in the room by tossing it into a laundry basket or other large container. You can sort this later.
Dust all furniture and surfaces with a damp rag.
Wipe down windows and walls.
Sweep or vacuum the floors, then mop them.

, A time limit motivates many people to work faster and stop procrastinating. If you broke the cleaning into smaller tasks, as described above, set a time limit for each one.

, Each time you complete a task, reward yourself. Take a break and do something you enjoy — though you should set a time limit if you're prone to turning that break into full relaxation mode.


For daily tasks, change your routine so the cleaning is always followed by something you enjoy. For example, start saving your morning cup of coffee until after you clean the kitchen.

, If you have young kids, make cleaning into a game. For example, whoever can make the counter the shiniest or the bathtubs the whitest gets a piece of candy.

, Open the windows to bring a breeze into the house. Fresh air feels wonderful when you've been cooped up in a room that smells of compost spills and bleach fumes.

, If you plan out the meals for your household, plan the cleaning in the same way. Write down which cleaning supplies you'll need, and make sure you have them in advance. This works especially well for occasional cleaning tasks, such as going through the fridge contents or cleaning the stove and oven.

, These cloths can be washed in the washing machine, and they don't develop bad smells as quickly as sponges do.

, Wear gloves whenever you use cleaning products. They'll protect your skin and let you handle unpleasant messes more quickly.

, You'll save a lot of time if your regular cleaning involves one bottle instead of six. A solution of mild dish soap and a little liquid bleach cleans most surfaces for daily upkeep. A commercial all-purpose cleaner works well for heavy dirt.


If you're scrubbing and scrubbing and nothing's happening, you need a more specialized product. Maybe it's worth having that ""blue glass cleaner for humid days"" under the sink... just don't use it for your everyday cleaning.

, Wouldn't you rather clean before you splash water all over the bathroom? Make it a habit to check the sink, toilet, shower stall, and bathtub before each shower or bath. Scrub anything that needs scrubbing, then hop in the shower and rinse away the gross feeling.

, Use one scouring sponge for all dirty surfaces. Scrub the toilet last, then throw away the scourer.


If you prefer not to waste cleaning products, use washable microfiber cloths.

, If you notice a minor spill, wipe up the toilet seat and surrounding area with toilet paper and throw it away. This saves you the bother of cleaning or storing a filthy scrubbing tool.

, Wipe down all counters, the oven range, and the microwave with a single microfiber cloth dampened with a general cleaner. Dry with a second microfiber cloth or kitchen paper.

, It's not a good idea to use concentrated chemical cleaners in the microwave. Instead, insert a glass bowl full of hot water and two freshly cut lemon halves. Run the microwave for at least three or four minute, then wipe down with a cloth or paper.

, If you're dealing with clutter, keep extra laundry baskets or boxes around to use as storage. Toss objects into ""keep,"" ""give away,"" and ""throw away"" boxes whenever you pick them off the floor or clear out a closet shelf. Deal with the boxes as soon as they become full.

, If you decide to clean a mess up tomorrow, there's a higher chance you'll forget or procrastinate. Add to that the fact that spills, stains, and encrusted food are much easier to deal with right away, and you have two great reasons not to wait."

Store what remains in enclosed containers.,

Vacuum weekly.,

Open the windows.",How to Make a Room Easy to Clean," Clutter takes up a lot of space both physically and mentally.;
, Be absolutely ruthless. If you haven't used something within the last month, it's just collecting dust. If it's not practical, its not worth having. Do not store things in the back of a closet or in the attic - just get rid of it!



Be green. Sell, donate or recycle as much as possible. Before selling or donating, be sure things are clean and free of stains.
Donate clothes you haven't worn over the past year. If something doesn't fit now, it probably won't fit in a few months from now.

Recycle magazines to friends and family. Keep them no longer than a month.
File only the bills and receipts that you will need for future reference. Discard the remainder.
Discard old toys, unfinished crafts or leftover craft supplies.
Discard useless furniture, tools and appliances.

, Wait a few days before the final discard. Look through everything once again so as not to regret parting with an item.

, This keeps everything free of dust and out of sight.


Use storage boxes or decorative containers. Store them under a bed, desk, table, couch or chair.
If your storage box is out of sight, it doesn't have to be fancy.
If your storage box is within sight, choose a decorative wicker basket with a cover, a trunk, a wooden box or even a wicker hamper with a cover.
Store tiny items in ziploc bags before placing them in a container.


Store small items in cabinets and drawers. Store clothes, books, dishes, towels, crafts, toys, small appliances or tools.
Store larger items in a closet. Hang clothes, place books on the top shelf, store boxes of crafts or toys, folding chairs, etc.
Make better use of book shelves. Store a collection of books, special hardbacks and reference books. Discard ratty paperbacks and books you'll never read again. Leave space at the top of the books to make them easy to dust with a feather duster. Stand books up and stack a few books as bookends to hold the others in place. Organize by size, author or subject.
Make better use of display cabinets. Display intricate items that would otherwise be difficult to keep free of dust. Display china, figurines, trophies, photographs in picture frames, seashells, dried flower arrangements and other various collections and keepsakes.

, Now that the room is free of clutter, this should only entail wiping over the top of the cabinets with a damp cloth, vacuuming the floor and straightening a few things out.

, Use a hose attachment to vacuum furniture, ceiling fans, window blinds, floorboards, air intake vents and cobwebs. Change the air filters every two months.

, Use window cleaner or an ammonia and water solution.

, Treat yourself to some fresh air. Treat your Vitamin D deficiency at the same time with added sunlight.

Massage your ears with your fingers, focusing on the tips and lobes.,
Dress warmly in comfortable clothes.,
Open the windows a crack to let some fresh air in.,
Look at the chores you need to complete.,
Do chores for five minutes when you feel your best.,
Take in plenty of fluids before, during, and after your chores.,
When you start to feel awfully tired, know when to stop.",How to Have Energy to Do Chores when You Are Sick," While it doesn't have to be fancy or a certain amount of calories, you should get food into your body so that you have more energy. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it becomes even more crucial when you are sick and need even more energy to fight off the illness.;
, This will give you a boost of needed energy, and you will feel a little more awake. Since there are energy points in your ears that are connected to your organs and body, massaging those points will help distribute that energy.

, By keeping your body warm, your blood can circulate, which is very important to your health. It will also help your body recover quickly. You will be unable to concentrate well if you are cold, but make sure you aren't hot either. Put on a pair of fuzzy socks and a sweater, but avoid turning on the heater unless if necessary.


If your nose is clogged, rub the bridge of your nose for a minute or so until your nose feels loosened up. You could also do this.






Take medicine for your sore throat if it becomes unbearable.







, It is a simple task, but it is an important start. This will not only fill the place with clean air, but the germs won't be stuck in the room. This is healthy for you, and it could help clear your nose. However, avoid opening the window all the way in case you get cold.

, Limit yourself according to how well you feel, and make a new list of the chores that are more important to complete. However, remember that it's important for you to rest in order for your body to make a quick recovery. Therefore, don't pile a bunch of heavy chores upon yourself while you aren't feeling well.

, You might be surprised when you realize how many tasks you can quickly complete in a few minutes. However, avoid pushing yourself, and take it easy. Keep the garbage can nearby so that you don't have to walk far, and you'll have it close for easy disposal of trash.

, Lukewarm water and juice are simple drinks you can have that will do wonders for your body. Chicken noodle soup and warm tea also can be helpful, but they might take a longer time to prepare.

, Take a break for as long as you need before continuing your chores again. Remember that you won't be able to perform perfectly so give 80% effort rather than your all. It's better to complete your tasks well than to lose all your energy in perfectly finishing one chore.


If you really don't feel well at all, call a friend or a family member and ask them for help.
Don't stress yourself out. You might worsen your condition, and you'll feel pretty low! Understand that your condition is temporary, and if you are unable to complete all your chores or any of them, you are not a failure. You just don't feel well, and your health is more important than your to-do list.

Develop a schedule.,
Use storage containers.,
Find a suitable place to keep every single item:
Place a hook on the back of your door and hang up your coat, hat and purse.,
Make better use of your closet.,
Do not bring food or drinks into your room.",How to Keep a Room Clean," Decide upon daily, weekly and monthly cleaning. For example:


Make your bed daily.






Do your laundry weekly.






Clean your closet monthly.








Whatever you choose for the schedule, be sure to stick to it. Otherwise, there is a risk that the cleaning work will be tougher when you do get around to it.;
, If there isn't enough room for everything, consider storing the things that you do not use in the attic or basement. Obtain some shipping boxes and label them.

,






Place your shoes near the door. You'll be able to find them more easily when you need to get ready to go somewhere.






Place your books and study materials in a specific area.






Place magazines on a table or a shelf near your bed for easy access. This way, you'll know where to find them anytime you need them.






Store extra shoes in a tray under your bed. Just pull the tray out when you need a new pair.







,
Store keepsakes, mementos and other miscellaneous items in a shoe box. This prevents clutter, and you can save tons of space.






Store video games and toys in shipping boxes.






Store a collection of small toys in a ziploc bag before placing it in a box. Just pull out the bag when you want to play with them.






Organize your books on the top shelf of the closet.







, Things can easily spill and then you would have to clean up the spill. In addition, insects like ants would come. Prevent this by having your food and drinks in the kitchen or in the living room. If you have to bring drinks, use a bottle and a coaster.

Take a good look at your room right now.,

Don't let the mess get so big in the first place!,

If your mess is huge, don't try to clean it all in one day.,

Divide the work up into smaller tasks.,

Make a game out of it.,

Listen to music while you clean.,

Make a workout out of cleaning!,

Reward yourself when you're finished.",How to Love Cleaning Your Room," It's time for a good cleaning, isn't it? The problem is, the mess has built up and it looks like an insurmountable task. However, think about how glad you will be once you have finally stopped procrastinating on it. It's one less thing to worry about, and you'll have a nice clean space to boot.
, When a small mess happens, clean it up. It makes the final task of giving your room a ceiling-to-floor cleaning much easier., Completely clean one portion of the room or one aspect, such as the closet or under the bed. Trying to get it all finished in one day will only frustrate you and make you more apt to stop cleaning all together., Tackle one thing at a time. This makes it a lot easier (and in turn, it makes it more fun). Pick up all trash first, so you won't have to work around it. Make three piles for all of the other things in your room - one for keeps, one for things that don't belong in your room, and one for give away (or to possibly sell if you think you could bring in a decent amount of money with it)., See how much cleaning you can get finished in a certain amount of time. Challenge yourself, and reward yourself when you complete certain tasks within a certain amount of time. A stopwatch or timer will come in handy for this., Cleaning is a lot more enjoyable, and seems to go by faster, if you have a little entertainment. Try to keep the music upbeat so you will be more revved up., Any movement, especially fervent cleaning, burns calories. Counting cleaning toward your calorie deficit is even more of a reward - you've not only cleaned your room, but you've done something good for your body!, You've worked hard and gotten your room nice and sparkling clean! Have a cookie, or have a nap on your nice, made bed. (Just remember to remake it when you wake up!) You deserve it!"

Start small.,
Don't spend an entire day tidying and cleaning.,
Clean weekly.,
Set a chore list.,
Dust, vacuum, and organize each room at a time.,
Don't fight over chores.,
Elect a family ""head."",
Provide motivation for cleaning.,
Make cleaning more fun.,
Give yourself a break!",How to Keep the House Clean All the Time," Simple tasks, such as vacuuming the lounge and cleaning the countertops can all make for an easier lifestyle. When you have done a few small tasks, move on to bigger chores. Mowing the lawn, cleaning windows and mirrors, organizing bookshelves, etc. help to keep everything in order.;
, Instead, clean a little bit every day. That way, it won't feel like a huge burden each time.

, Don't put it off, or else the mess will be much worse.

, If you work for long hours during the day while others stay at home, create a ""Chore List."" It's like a simple rota: at a certain time of day, one person that stayed at home will do a chore. All chores that need to be done must be done on time, so when you arrive home, the house will be neat and tidy, ready for people to sit down in and watch that new drama on TV.


No one person in the household should bear the sole responsibility for cleaning. It is everyone's responsibility to keep it clean. If you are constantly cleaning up after other house members, put an end to this arrangement. Tell them that they are all responsible and that the house always needs cleaning.

, Don't all rush to your rooms. The whole house needs cleaning, not just the bedrooms.


One person can dust, another can vacuum, another can tidy up (for example, neatly arranging the cushions in the living room), another can organize bookshelves, etc.

, Make it easy for everyone: rotate the chores each week. You may want to keep a record of it all.

, This person has to check each room in the house to make sure it is clean and tidy. Change the family ""head"" every month or so.

, If you have children, reward them for cleaning up. The reward could be going somewhere special, eating a homemade pie, watching a favorite TV show together, etc. Just make it clear that cleaning needs happen before the reward. Then, look forward to that family treat.

, Use games, music, and even races to make cleaning fun for everyone, no matter your age.

, Whether it's a shopping spree, a night in front of the television, a walk on the beach, or just a lie in, you need to rest. Do something you enjoy. It could be every night, every weekend, or any time that suits you.


Don't buy things that need dusting!

Absorb the mess.,
Re-wet the spot with water.,
Spray enzyme cleaner over the area.,
Apply another towel and absorb the cleaner.,
Allow the towel to sit overnight.,
Clean or dispose of the towels.,
Consider steam-cleaning the carpet.",How to Remove Pet Urine from Carpet1," Use wet towels or paper towels, layered and topped by some kind of weight, to quickly absorb fresh puddles. Run the towels under cool water, then wring them out so they're damp but not dripping. Place them over the stain completely and put something heavy on top, like cans of food, a pair of shoes, or a book. The moisture helps soak up the urine, while the weight presses the towels down into the carpet. Leave it on for at least 10 minutes.


If you use heavy books, put a layer of plastic wrap or aluminum foil on top of the wet towels first, to avoid wetting and staining the book.
Fold a bath towel two times and cover the urine spot. Stand on towel and dab the urine into the towel by walking In place. When urine is seen on the towel under your shoes pick up the towel and cover the urine with an unsoiled section of the folded towel. Repeat as necessary to get the liquid up. As urine comes up from the carpet use unfolded towels or only fold once.
If the spot has been wet longer than 10 minutes, it's probably soaked into the carpet pad. Make the towel 50% wider than the area of visible stain and use more damp towels and a heavier weight.;
, After you've lifted the towel, pour a small amount of cold water over the spot again. Start pouring just outside the perimeter of the stain, slowly moving toward the center. This will prevent the water from spreading the urine out into an even wider circle. Allow the water to work through the stain for about a minute., Non-toxic and effective, enzymatic cleaners work by breaking down stains into their basic elements, eliminating the compounds that create smells and stains. Using an enzymatic cleaner is the best way to help break down the proteins left over from the urine, removing the smell as well as the impulse for the pet to urinate in the same spot again.


You can buy enzymatic cleaner at most pet stores, or you can make your own with clean water, brown sugar, and orange peels.
Most enzymatic cleaners need to be kept on a wet area for several hours. However, some might use a different process, so be sure to read the instructions on the label. If you're cleaning wool carpet, make sure the cleaner is wool-safe.

, After soaking the spot with cleaning, follow the same procedure as with the first absorbing, and put a fresh towel over the enzymatic cleaner to absorb it and thoroughly cleanse the area. Weight the towel with a heavy object and leave it alone.

, When you pull it up in the morning, the visible stain should be gone, as well as the smell.

, Because the towels you used for absorbing the urine will have faint traces of your pet's scent, it's important to keep your pet from marking them again. Help your pet avoid the temptation by discarding the towel.


If you used paper towels in your poultices, be sure to seal them in a garbage bag and get rid of them as soon as possible, so that your pet doesn't try urinating on them, or digging them out of the garbage.
If you used cloth towels, put them into the washer immediately and run with hot water to clean them thoroughly, if you don't want to discard them completely. Wash the towels twice to be sure.

, If the enzymatic cleaner didn't remove the stain completely, consider renting a steam cleaner or hiring a professional to do the job for you. Make sure to ask if they have a product to add into their solution designed for pet stains. Stains are a lot easier to remove when they're fresh, so try to decide quickly if this is what you need to do.


Large volumes of concentrated alkaline salts and strong odors that come from bacteria feeding on the waste products contained in the urine can make professional cleaning necessary. The alkaline salts can create a very high pH environment (10 - 10.4) and destabilize normally stable dyes that cause bleeding. This is very difficult to address without steam cleaning and specialized cleaner.

Run a towel or cloth under cold water, squeeze it out, then use it to blot out the affected area.Take care to blot with repeated dabbing motions instead of scrubbing. Scrubbing will force the bleach deeper into the carpet fibers.;
, After blotting the stain with cold water, mix a half tablespoon of liquid dishwashing detergent with a cup (240 mL) of warm water. For larger stains, use the same ratio (for example, one tablespoon mixed with two cups or 480 ml of water) Let it sit for about five minutes.As an alternative to soap, you could substitute distilled white vinegar in the same ratio.

, After five minutes, use a clean, damp sponge or cloth to blot the area you’ve soaked in the detergent solution. Be sure to use cold water to get your sponge or cloth damp.When blotting, work from the outside of the stain toward the center to avoid spread it.

To make this cleaner, combine in a bucket:2 tablespoons (30 ml) of liquid laundry detergent
¼ cup (59 ml) of liquid all-purpose cleaner
1 scoop of OxiClean
1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fabric softener
1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water;
, For families with kids and pets, non-toxic cleaners are often high on the priority list, especially for things that get used every day like your carpets. To make a non-toxic carpet cleaner that also smells great, mix together:1 cup (235 ml) of white vinegar
2 cups (470 ml) of water
2 teaspoons (13 g) of salt
15 drops of essential oil, such as lemon, lavender, or pine

, Window cleaner isn't just for windows anymore, and you can actually mix it with water to make a cheap and effective carpet cleaner for the house, car, and elsewhere.


To make this cleaner, simply mix equal parts hot water and a window cleaner, such as Windex., Ammonia cleaners are more powerful than typical cleaners, but you have to be careful with them because ammonia is corrosive and can damage your skin, eyes, lungs, and certain materials. Put on some gloves, and carefully combine in a bucket:1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid dish detergent
¼ cup (59 ml) of ammonia
¼ cup (59 ml) of vinegar
3 gallons (11 L) of water

, Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful cleaner, and lemon is a grease-cutting cleaner that makes everything smell great. These two simple ingredients can be combined to make a homemade carpet cleaner. To make this cleaner:Pour ¾ cup (176 ml) of hydrogen peroxide to a bucket
Add 1½ cups (352 ml) of water
Add 5 drops of lemon essential oil
Stir to combine

, Powdered carpet cleaners are great for spills and greasy stains, and you can make your own powdered cleaning solution at home too. For a basic powdered cleaner for the carpet, combine in a small bowl:1 cup (220 g) of baking powder
1 cup (110 g) of corn starch
5 bay leaves, crushed (for smell)
A sprinkle of dried potpourri, crushed (optional)

, For an even more powerful cleaner and deodorizer, try making a dry baking soda and borax powder. You can also add your favorite herbs or flowers to the mix to customize the smell. To make this cleaner, combine in a bowl:1 cup (409 g) of borax
1 cup (220 g) of baking soda
1 tablespoon (5 g) of dried herbs or flowers
20 drops of essential oil

, To clean a carpet or spot by hand, you'll need to apply a thin and even layer of cleaner to the carpet. The easiest way to do this is to transfer a liquid cleaner to a spray bottle, or a dry cleaner to a shaker, which will give you good and even coverage.


Stir your cleaning mixture before transferring it to make sure all the ingredients are fully combined.

, It’s always important to test new cleaning products on surfaces before applying them widely, especially when you're dealing with things like carpet, fabric, and upholstery. The spot test will ensure that the cleaner won’t damage the carpet or the color. To do the spot test:Pick an inconspicuous area of carpet, such as a corner or under furniture
Spray or sprinkle some of the cleaner onto a small section of the carpet
Wait 24 hours
When the time is up, check the test spot for color-fastness, discoloration, or other damage
Only proceed with cleaning if there's no damage to the carpet

, To spot clean stains and marks, apply a thin and even layer of cleaner to the area you want to clean.To clean the entire carpet, divide the carpet into three or four sections and clean one section at a time.


When you're working in sections to clean an entire carpet, start at the farthest section from the door and work your way toward the door to avoid getting trapped.

, Once the cleaner is on the carpet, let it sit for about 10 minutes. This will give liquid cleaners time to soak in, and powder cleaners time to absorb odors and stains.


If you're pressed for time, it’s not strictly necessary to let the cleaner soak, but it will produce a cleaner carpet if you let it sit.

, Use a carpet brush or other stiff-bristled brush to scrub the area where you’ve applied cleaner. This will help push the cleaner deeper into the carpet, and loosen dirt, debris, and other particles that are lodged in the fibers of the carpet.Once you’ve brushed the entire area, wait for about 30 minutes to let liquid cleaners dry completely.

, When liquid cleaners have had time to dry completely and powder cleaners have had time to absorb smells and stains, vacuum the carpet thoroughly. Go over the area two or three times to make sure you suck up all the dirt, debris, and excess powder.Once the carpet has been vacuumed, repeat with the other sections if you're cleaning the whole carpet.

, Before using any new cleaner on a surface, you should always spot test the product to ensure it won’t cause damage. Pick an inconspicuous area of carpet and apply a small amount of your liquid or powder cleaner. Leave the cleaner for 24 hours.After 24 hours, check the test area for discoloration and damage. Proceed with cleaning if there's no visible damage.

, Most carpet shampooers have a single reservoir where the cleaning solution goes. Fill the reservoir with the homemade liquid cleaner of your choice. If the reservoir has a lid or cap, replace this before shampooing the carpet.


Some shampooers have separate reservoirs for clean water and cleaning solution, so be sure to fill both., Turn the shampooer on and pull the trigger (if you're shampooer has one) to activate the cleaning action. Starting in a corner farthest from the door, shampoo the carpet using the same back and forth motion you would to vacuum. Go over each section of carpet two or three times to ensure the carpet is fully saturated and scrubbed.As you clean the carpet, work your way toward a door to avoid getting stuck in the room.

, A carpet shampooer will apply larger quantities of cleaner to the carpet, so let the carpet sit for 24 hours after shampooing. This will allow the cleaner to fully soak into the carpet and evaporate, and give the carpet time to dry., When the carpet is fully dry and there's no cleaning residue left that you can feel with your hand, vacuum the entire carpet with your regular vacuum cleaner. This will suck up any dirt and debris that are in the carpet and complete the cleaning process.


Some carpet shampooers also serve as a vacuum. Don’t pull the trigger that activates the shampooing action when you want to use the cleaner as a vacuum.

Sop up the excess Kool Aid as soon as possible.,
Combine equal parts of ammonia and water in a bucket.,
Soak the stain with the cleaning solution.,
Fire up your iron.,
Place a clean, white towel over the ammonia/water soaked stain and apply the iron.",How to Get Kool Aid out of White Carpet Using Ammonia," The minute the drink hits your carpet, grab a white towel to soak up as much as possible.

Apply pressure with a dry, white towel to the area. Don’t rub (never rub a carpet), but instead firmly blot the area until you’ve absorbed as much Kool Aid as possible.



 


Dab the area with a clean, wet cloth. Dilute the Kool Aid with clean warm water by rinsing a clean white cloth under the water, wringing it out and then applying pressure on the area. You may absorb more Kool Aid in the process.





;
, Perform this task as quickly as possible, as you will want to get the solution on the carpet immediately.


If you don’t have ammonia, using window cleaning solution can be a decent substitute. However, make sure you use window cleaning solution that is clear and not blue (the blue coloring could discolor the carpet).






Stir carefully to ensure the mixture is fully combined (use a wooden spoon or rod).







, Avoid over soaking, as this can lead to either the solution or the stain bleeding onto other areas of the carpet.

Pour a little amount of solution onto the stain at a time. This lets you control how much is dispensed on the stain. If the stain is large, consider pouring the solution in stages by fully soaking one area and then moving onto the next.






Don’t over-pour the solution so that you have too much cleaning fluid on the carpet and need to soak up more fluid than Kool Aid. This will only create a bigger mess.







, You will be placing a white towel (preferably not a good one) over the stain and then using the heat from the iron to transfer the stain to the towel.

Dial the iron to its hottest setting. Use the setting designated for cotton clothing.






Consider adding some steam to the process. For extra stubborn Kool Aid stains, adding steam while ironing the stain may help lift them onto the towel.







, Make sure the iron is very hot before attempting this step.

Press the iron down onto the towel and hold it in place for approximately 10 seconds. You should hear a sizzling sound, which means the liquid is being absorbed by the towel.






Move the iron to the next area and repeat the motion until you’ve traveled around the entire stain.






Repeat the entire process until the stain has lifted. You may need to make several passes over the stain until it fully lifts.[[Image:Get Kool Aid out of White Carpet Using Ammonia Step 5Bullet3.jpg}}

Put on a pair of rubber gloves.",How to Clean Chocolate from a Carpet1," Take action as soon as possible after the chocolate has been rubbed into the carpet. As with most stains, the longer you leave it, the tougher it will be to remove.;
, You can use a paper towel to blot excess chocolate, or scrape it gently with a dull knife.If you choose to use a knife, place the removed chocolate onto a paper towel. Wipe the knife frequently to avoid smearing or grinding in the chocolate.
If the chocolate is soft, chill it with an ice cube or frozen package to make it easier to chip out with the knife.

, Different carpets react to stain removal techniques in different ways. Using the wrong removal method could cause the stain to become permanent or leave a worse mark than the stain itself.


Determine if your carpet is made of natural or synthetic fiber, as this will affect the types of liquid cleaners that are safe to use.
If you're in any doubt as to your carpet's suitability, contact a professional carpet cleaner.

, Before trying out any of the cleaning solutions below, test a small amount on a patch of carpet. Wait a few minutes to ensure the product will not damage your carpet. If your carpet starts to turn brown or lighter in color, immediately rinse the solution with cold water. Stop and call a professional.

, These will protect your hands from the chemicals in the cleaning solutions."

Have your car inspected if you can’t locate the source.",How to Clean Car Carpet Stains," Before you start cleaning the carpet, remove everything from the car’s floor. Give yourself plenty of elbow-room to work. Also give yourself a clearer view of any stains, dirt, debris, or other materials that might be obstructed by personal items., Use your vacuum’s smallest carpet attachment, if it includes one. Otherwise, use its standard-size carpet attachment for areas where it will fit. Then detach that and simply use the vacuum’s hose to suck up loose dirt and litter so you don’t end up scrubbing that into the stain.

, Add a few drops of mild dish detergent to a bucket, plus one cup (237 ml) of distilled white vinegar. Then fill it with a gallon (3.8 L) of clean hot water. Wet a hard-bristled brush in the solution and give the carpet a vigorous scrubbing so the solution reaches all of the carpet’s fibers.Err on the side of using too little soap than too much, since soapy residue will give dirt a handhold to hang onto if any is left behind.

, Ideally, use towels if you have any to spare for household projects. Otherwise, use thick cloth rags (as opposed to paper towels or anything else that’s just as flimsy). Pat the carpet dry, changing towels as needed, until you’ve blotted out as much moisture as you can., Even though your carpet should be clean by now, give it another once-over with your vacuum. Suck up any moisture that your towels couldn’t reach or absorb. Make the carpet finders stand up at attention for a fresh appearance., Open all windows and/or doors. Allow as much air as possible to circulate through the car. Clear out any lingering smell from your cleaning solution and give the carpet the chance to air-dry further at the same time., Whenever you spill something that might be difficult to clean up, make clean-up easier by taking immediate action. Pour enough water to soak the area as soon as you can. Dilute the offending substance before it has a chance to set in and dry.Be sure to use cold water, since hot water may actually cause some substances to set in quicker., If your soap/water/vinegar mixture wasn’t strong enough to remove any stains, pour glass cleaner over them instead of using a soapier mixture. Let it soak into the carpet for about five minutes. Then use a towel or thick cloth to pat dry and blot out the moisture.Unlike dish detergent, glass cleaner doesn’t create a soapy film. This makes it more ideal for heavy stains because you can use as much as needed without creating any sticky buildup for future dirt to cling to.

, If a pen or marker has leaked, exploded, or otherwise stained your carpet, apply a light coat of hairspray. Let it sit and check periodically. Once you see that the ink has begun to fade, dampen a paper towel or cloth with cold water and wipe the area down until the ink has been removed., Vomit’s acidity can ruin your carpet pretty quickly, so whenever someone gets sick in your car, neutralize the acidity by watering it down with club soda instead of plain water. If plain water is all you have, use it to make a baking soda paste and apply that to the affected area. But if you don’t have baking soda either, plain water is still better than nothing., Depending on the size of the stain, pour enough dry laundry starch to cover the area into a container. Then add enough cold water to make a thick paste and stir to combine. Apply this to the stain and wait for it to dry. Once it dries, vacuum it up or brush it away., Pour enough cornmeal to thoroughly cover the stained area. Leave it overnight to absorb the grease from the carpet. Then vacuum it up in the morning. If that doesn’t work:You can also try wiping the area down with a cotton cloth dampened with paint thinner and then sprinkling salt over it instead of cornmeal. However, paint thinner may cause your carpet’s color to run if it isn’t colorfast, so be sure to test it out on a tiny, out-of-view spot first.

, Dust your carpet liberally with borax. Then give it an hour or so to absorb the smell. After that, simply vacuum up the borax.Baking soda and kitty litter are both effective substitutes for borax.

, If your car still smells funky after the borax treatment, go hunting. Check under the seats and floor mats, inside pockets and compartments, in between cushions--anywhere and everywhere that might hide something. If you find the source of the smell:Throw the source away immediately and vacuum the area as best you can in case any remnants are left behind. Then target this area with the borax treatment while airing the car out.

, If your hunt for the offending smell’s source turns up dry, this could mean that the smell is coming from the car itself. If you’re familiar with your car’s components and how they work, pop the hood and check it out yourself. Otherwise, bring it to a repair shop so a professional can track down the problem.Possible sources could be (but are not limited to) overheated engines, old oil, and a/c issues.

Find old stains.,
Consider using ultraviolet light to explore more thoroughly.,
Search at night or in complete darkness.,
Mark each spot that you find.,
Try an enzymatic cleaner to start.,
Wet paper or cloth towels with cool water, and lay them over the spot.,
Steam-clean old stains.,
Try cleaning without detergent at first.,
Use oxidation if necessary.",How to Remove Pet Urine from Carpet2," You might have a general idea of where old stains might be from the odor. If you think there might be old stains in an area, explore using a sweeping motion, gradually moving farther away from the generally smelly location. The pet urine that you're looking for should show up as a yellow or greenish color. Try looking in the following areas:


Bookshelves
Furniture
Cloth decorations
Inside vents
Objects that appear to have holes, such as inside portable heaters
Clothing that your cat may be able to access
Other small areas your cat could squeeze into

, If you want to be thorough, buy a UV or fluorescent black light of a portable size. Look for a long bulb so you can cover more ground at much, preferably longer than 12 inches (30cm). Cheap bulbs with the housing included can be found at most hardware stores. Although pet stores sell the lights as well, they're usually smaller and more expensive. They can also be purchased at a reasonable cost online, depending on how much time you have to wait around living with the odor.

, Pet urine can be difficult to see, especially when old, so maximize your search efforts by taking advantage of darkness. Either wait for night, or make the room as dark as possible.

, If you're on the stain-finding warpath, make sure don't get ahead of yourself and forget where all the stains are. Keep a roll of blue painter tape on you while you're looking around, and mark each spot that needs to be cleaned with a small strip of blue tape. When you've found all the stains you want to clean up, go back with your cleaning materials and find your stains easily.

, Wet the area with cool distilled water, pouring a small amount around the perimeter of the stain, moving from the outside of the stain toward the center. Spray an enzymatic cleaner on the wet spot, and allow it to sit overnight. If your carpet is wool, make sure you're using a wool-safe cleaner.

, Put a heavy object on top of the wet towels and leave the towels overnight. When you remove it in the morning, you can assess whether or not you need to take more extreme measures.

, A rented cleaner can produce steam that's hot enough to sanitize the carpet, after which the water can be vacuumed up again. Alternatively, if the spot is particularly large or stained, you can hire a professional cleaner to manage it.

, If you find that you're still not pulling up the stain, ask the representatives at the rental center what they recommend, and try to use as little detergent as possible.


Wool can be damaged by steam cleaners, much like a wool sweater shrinks if you wash it in hot water. If the stain is on wool carpet that you don't wish to damage, seriously consider hiring a pro.

, One alternative to using a steam cleaner on an old stain is oxidizing it. Products that release oxygen are effective odor removers, and you can make a solution yourself at home.


Mix up ½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) of bleach with 1 quart (32 ounces/950ml) of distilled water. Do a patch test on a part of the carpet you don't usually see, and make sure you won't damage the color. Then saturate the area and allow the solution to soak into the carpet for at least 10 minutes.
Use a shop vac or a towel (as described above) to pull up the solution. You might need to do oxidate the carpet several times to remove a stain. Let the carpet dry completely between treatments.
Oxidizing products should never be used on wool or silk carpets. The treatment is only appropriate for synthetic fibers.

Try the vacuum method.,
Use the baking soda and vinegar method.,
Use the hydrogen peroxide and dish soap method.,
Avoid ammonia.,
Replace the padding underneath.",How to Remove Pet Urine from Carpet3," Pour some cold water on the stain and immediately vacuum it up with a wet/dry vacuum. Repeat at least twice, or as many times as is necessary to remove the discoloration. Do not let the water sit; suck it up immediately (within seconds) of each application.


For tough stains, add a bit of salt to the water, but never add soap. The residue left over in the carpet will attract dirt.

, Spray the area with vinegar, then sprinkle on enough baking soda to thinly coat the area of the stain. Cover the stain with a towel for 24 hours, then wash the area thoroughly with cold water. This mixture should absorb the stain and cleanse the area thoroughly, and cheaply.

, Start by dusting the stain with a thin coat of baking soda, then mix up about a cup of hydrogen peroxide with a tablespoon of dish soap in a spray bottle. Mix gently to combine. Then, saturate the baking soda and the stain thoroughly. Use an old toothbrush or your fingers to massage the mixture gently into the carpet, then let the mixture sit until it dries. Vacuum up the mess and clean it again with cool water.Hydrogen peroxide can damage some kinds of carpet, making it important that you spot test this mixture in an out-of-the-way area of the carpet to make sure that it won't stain the carpet irreparably.

, High in alkaline, ammonia should never be used to clean pet stains. It will leave a sticky residue in the carpet and damage the carpet fibers, attracting dirt and other debris. It will also attract pets back to the same area, because ammonia contains the same uric acids and salts that are present in urine, making it all too tempting for your pet to remark the area. Never use ammonia on pet stains. , For stubborn stains that you suspect may have soaked through the carpet into the padding, replacing the padding itself will help a lot. Pull up the carpet, cut a sample of the padding and bring it to a home improvement store to find padding of equal thickness. Cut out the stained padding and replace it with a piece of the new padding.

Color the stain with a crayon that closely matches your carpet color.,
Dilute the colored patch with a damp towel.,
Try using interior paint.,
Consult a professional carpet cleaner.",How to Get a Bleach Stain Out of a Carpet2," Look in your art supplies or take a few carpet fibers to a store to try to find a matching crayon. Work the crayon into the bleached area, taking care to color down to the base of the fibers. Try to stay within the lines of the stain and avoid coloring unbleached fibers.Marker pens may also sometimes be helpful., Coloring the bleached patch will likely result in a darker hue than the surrounding carpet. Use a damp towel to dilute the color and spread the pigment throughout the bleached area.Continue to color and dilute until you’ve blended the color to match your carpet.

, If the bleached spot is in an inconspicuous area, you can try using an interior paint. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to apply a thin coat over the stain, and try to paint each fiber from its base to the top. Apply more coats as necessary, but be sure to keep them thin.The best thing about using interior paint is that you can take some carpet fibers to your local home improvement store and have them match the color precisely.
Avoid using interior paint in spots that are obvious or receive lots of foot traffic. The paint will make the carpet fibers stiff.

, Ask a professional for help if you’ve tried using crayons or paint without success, or if you don’t want to take the chance recoloring the stain on your own. A professional cleaner can attempt to:Clean the stain
Cut out fibers
Cut out and replace the affected patch

Read the bleach's label before cleaning the stain.,
Wear gloves.,
Provide plenty of air-flow.",How to Get a Bleach Stain Out of a Carpet3," Dish soap and vinegar should both be safe to use on a bleach stain, but even so, read the bleach's directions and warnings before using those or any other product on the stain. Many include lists of chemicals that should never be mixed with bleach, like ammonia, which can cause a toxic reaction. Double-check the ingredients of any cleaning or repair product that you intend to use to make sure it doesn't include any of those ingredients.

, Keep in mind that bleach can harm your skin. Always wear protective gloves before trying to wash bleach out of your carpet by hand. Do so even if the bleach has dried, since the chemicals are still present even though the moisture isn't., Fumes from bleach can be overpowering, causing lightheadedness, nausea, and other ailments. If you're using vinegar to clean it up, expect the combined smell to be even more overwhelming. Open some windows and/or set up some fans to draw the fumes away from you while you work on the stain."

Ventilate your bathroom.,
Use odor eliminators over air fresheners.,
Look into air purifiers.,
Try desiccants.,
Make a homemade air freshener.",How to Remove Bathroom Odors1," If you want to cover up embarrassing odors, proper ventilation is key. Simple air flow can help reduce smells. If you have an overhead fan, turn it on after bathroom use. If you don't, open the bathroom window to let air enter.Don't just ventilate after using the toilet. Turn on the fan or open a window after a shower as well. The moist air from a hot shower can cause mildew to buildup, resulting in a musty smelling bathroom.;
, Many people keep a spray bottle on the back of the toilet to freshen the bathroom after use. If you go this route, invest in products labeled ""odor eliminator"" over simple air fresheners.


Air fresheners cover the smell. They do not actually eliminate the odor and the smell will remain once the product wears off. If the smell is strong, it may even be detectable over the scent of the air freshener.Odor eliminators seek to neutralize odors. They cover smells quicker and more effectively. When at your local supermarket, look for products identified as odor eliminators. There are a wide variety of odor eliminators on the market, so you may have to do some trial and error before you find a product that works for you. You can read product reviews online to get a sense of which products work most effectively at eliminating odors., If your bathroom has very poor air circulation, an odor eliminator alone may not cut it. Look into an air purifier, a plug-in device that helps increase air circulation and remove odor-causing bacteria from your bathroom's air. You can buy an air purifier at a department store or order one online. Air purifiers range in price. Top-rate purifiers can cost as much as $250, but may be unnecessary if their intended use is for a small bathroom. You can buy a smaller, cheaper purifier for $25 to $50., Your problem may not just be due to toilet use. You may have an issue with mildew. In this case, invest in desiccants. Desiccants are dry materials designed to absorb water. Common desiccants include silica gels, which often comes in packages.


You can use a synthetic desiccant, like silica gel, as long as you apply the powder in an area out of reach of children and animals. Desiccants can be toxic if swallowed. You can also keep desiccants in a small plastic container with holes poked in the lids.Plants are natural desiccants. Ferns or lily plants can help remove unwanted odors from your bathroom and leave it smelling fresh., Homemade air fresheners may be more effective than store bought products. If an odor eliminator isn't cutting it, try making your own air freshener.


For one air freshener, mix three parts water, one part vodka, and 10 to 20 drops of essential oils, such as lavender oil or eucalyptus oil. You can purchase essential oils at a local health or vitamin shop. Place the mixture in a spray bottle and leave on the back of the toilet. Spray when needed.If the above mixture leaves an alcohol-like odor, try mixing two cups of water with a tablespoon of white vinegar, a teaspoon of baking soda, and 10 drops of essential oils. Put in a spray bottle and leave on the back of your toilet. Spray when needed."
"
Use baking soda, lemon juice, and vinegar.,
Use essential oils when cleaning.,
Clean the toilet tank.,
Clean the bathroom regularly.,
Clean out drains.,
Watch for mold.",How to Remove Bathroom Odors2," Sometimes, the area around your toilet needs a good cleaning. This can help remove set-in odors that are causing a bad smell. A mixture of baking soda, lemon juice, and vinegar may work well. These products are often effective at reducing odor.


Make a paste of equal parts lemon juice and baking soda. Fresh lemon juice is best. Mix the substances together until your paste has the consistency of pancake batter.Spread this paste along the bottom of the toilet and the toilet seat using a damp rag. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.Place some vinegar in a spray bottle. After 10 or 15 minutes, spray the vinegar along the paste. Let it fizzle for a moment and then wipe off using your rag., Essential oils provide a powerful and pleasant odor. If your bathroom smell is an issue, consider adding a few drops of essential oils to a spray bottle of rubbing alcohol. Use this to clean areas like your sink and toilet bowl. Some essential oils, like cedar oil, have anti-fungal properties that can help neutralize and remove unwanted scents., Toilet tanks, if not cleaned regularly, can retain a urine smell. Many people neglect the toilet tank when engaging in routine bathroom cleaning. You can easily clean the toilet tank with white vinegar.


Open the toilet tank. Pour a half cup of vinegar in the tank. Then, put on some rubber gloves.Use a scrub brush to wash the sides of the tank. Then, flush the toilet. Add more vinegar and repeat the process a few times., Simply cleaning your bathroom on a regular basis can help with odors. You should do a routine cleaning once a week. Clean the toilet bowl, lid, and the sides of the toilet. Mop the floor. Clean the bathtub and shower, as well as the sink. You can use over-the-counter cleaning products or your own mixture of baking soda, lemon juice, and vinegar. Regular cleaning prevents odors from building up and causing problems.


Use high-quality commercial products when cleaning. Look for products that are specifically designed to target odor. It can help to know what kind of materials things like your sink, tub, and tiles are made out of, as certain cleaners may work best on certain surfaces.

, Clogs in drains are frequently the cause of bathroom odor. Make sure to clean out drains if you notice water backing up frequently. You should also take measures to prevent drains each month.


Remove the drain stopper and clean off any hair, dirt, or debris on the stopper. You can use white vinegar and water to clean a drain stopper.You can use a straightened coat hanger to reach down the drain. You can either push the clog through or pull it out using the hanger. You can also use a plunger, plunging the drain 5 to 6 times, if a coat hanger fails to address a clogged drain.Flush the drain. Use hot water, leaving the tap running for several minutes. This will help flush out any dirt and debris that may be causing bathroom odor.Once a month, mix half a cup of vinegar with a half a cup of baking soda. Pour this down your drain. This will clean out the drain, help remove clogs, and neutralize any odor caused by your bathroom's drain., Mold is a common cause of odor in a bathroom. It can also be a health concern. Make a point of periodically checking your bathroom for signs of mold.


While you may think spotting mold is easy, mold can often be subtle. It may be overlooked or mistaken for soot or dirt. You may notice speckles of black along your bathroom ceiling, for example. If these marks resurface after cleaning, and seem to expand, you may have a mold problem.
Look under the sink. Mold commonly begins to grow around the pipes under the sink, especially if water sometimes leaks out.
Recognize the symptoms of mold exposure. If you don't see any mold, but have any of the following symptoms, consider having a professional mold inspection done in your bathroom. Symptoms include wheezing, rashes, watering eyes, red eyes, itchy eyes, and a runny nose."

Re-caulk your tiles.,
Close the lid after flushing.,
Take out the trash regularly.,
Launder bathroom fabrics.,
Consider switching to odor or moisture resistant surfaces.",How to Remove Bathroom Odors3," Caulk is found between bathroom tiles and may also run along the walls of a bathroom. It can contribute to bathroom odor. Over time, caulk becomes porous and absorbs odors. If your bathroom smell does not respond to routine cleaning, remove old caulk with an X-acto knife. Replace it with fresh caulk. You can buy bathroom caulk at a local hardware store., Sometimes, small changes can make a big impact on bathroom smells. Remember to close the lid after using the bathroom. This can prevent unpleasant odors from leaking into the air., If you have a wastebasket in your bathroom, take it out at least once a week. Any trash that's left sitting out can build up odors over time, resulting in a foul smell. Regular trash removal can be very effective in combating bathroom odors., As bathrooms are frequently damp environments, towels can get musty fast. If you keep hand towels in your bathroom, launder them at least once a week. This can prevent a buildup of odors that leads to an unpleasant smell.To help remove odors, try adding a half cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle when doing laundry.Make sure you dry towels completely before putting them back in the bathroom., If you clean your bathroom carefully, but still have problems with mold or odor, it may be time for a major renovation. Consider switching to odor or moisture resistant surfaces for your tub, bathroom tiles, sinks, and so on. This may be costly, but if it's within your budget and odor is a real problem, it may be worth the money.

, You want the larger granule of salt for more exfoliation power.


If you don’t have larger grained salt, you can still use regular table salt, but you will need wider coverage when cleaning.

, Make sure the juice stays in the tub and doesn’t run onto the floor.

, The juice should allow the salt to cling to the tub. You only need about ½ cup of salt for the entire tub as you will be rubbing it over porcelain and fixtures.

, If necessary, apply a scrub brush or washcloth to the area for extra cleaning power.


Allow the grapefruit/salt combo to stand in areas that are especially tough or stained.
Wipe salt and grapefruit away as you work.

Figure out the type of pewter you have.,
Select a cleaner.,
Try mixing a handmade cleaner.,
Choose a quality pewter polish.,
Make your own polish.",How to Polish Pewter1," Different pewter requires different methods when it comes to polishing. Before you polish your pewter, figure out if it is polished pewter, satin pewter, or oxidized pewter.Polished pewter will be smooth and shiny. It should already look somewhat polished prior to the cleaning and polishing process.
Satin pewter will have a grainier finish than polished pewter. It is usually not shiny.
Oxidized pewter has a darker finish. Products made from oxidized pewter look like antiques, and are darker in color. Oxidized pewter does not need to be polished. You only need to wash it.;
, For the most part, you'll need to clean your pewter prior to polishing. Usually, most types of pewter respond well to an all purpose metal cleaner, which you can find at most hardware stores. However, it may be a better idea to use mild dish soap and warm water. This is less taxing on the pewter.Some cleaners double as polishes. Check if your chosen cleaner can also be used as a polish, as this can save you some time.

, A handmade cleaner can also be used on most types of pewter. If you would prefer to use something handmade, you can use vinegar and white flour to make a handmade cleaner.Mix a cup of white vinegar with half a cup of flour.
Stir the mixture until it forms a paste.

, You want to make sure the polish you use will not damage your pewter. For the most part, you can use the same types of polish on all different kinds of pewter. Some pewter cleaners, such as Brasso, actually double as polishes, so if you go with a commercial cleaner check the label to see if you can save some money and also use it as a polish.You can usually find pewter polish at a local hardware store. Well known brands include MET-ALL silver and pewter polish, Mash's Pewter Cleaner, and MAAS metal polish.

, You can also try to make your own polish, if you would prefer. You'll need to purchase a material called ""rottenstone,"" which you can buy online or at a hardware store. You will also need boiled linseed oil, which you can also find online or at a hardware store.Boil as much linseed oil as you think you will need. Allow the linseed oil to cool until it's cold enough that you can safely work with it.
Add rottenstone to the mix and stir. Keep adding rottenstone until a thick paste is formed. Once this paste cools, you can use it on all types of pewter.

Prevent uniform attack corrosion by protecting the metal surface.,
Prevent galvanic corrosion by halting ion flow from one metal to another.,
Prevent pitting corrosion by protecting the metal surface, avoiding environmental chloride sources, and avoiding nicks and scratches.,
Prevent crevice corrosion by minimizing tight spaces in the design of the object.,
Prevent stress corrosion cracking by using only safe loads and/or annealing.",How to Prevent Metals from Corroding1," Uniform attack corrosion (sometimes shortened to ""uniform"" corrosion) is a type of corrosion that occurs, appropriately, in a uniform fashion over an exposed metal surface. In this type of corrosion, the entire surface of the metal is under attack from corrosion and, thus, the corrosion proceeds at a uniform rate. For example, if an unprotected iron roof is regularly exposed to rain, the entire roof surface will come into contact with roughly the same amount of water and thus will corrode at a uniform rate. The easiest way to protect against uniform attack corrosion is usually to put a protective barrier between the metal and the corroding agents.This can be a wide variety of things - paint, an oil sealant, or an electrochemical solution like a galvanized zinc coating.


In underground or immersion situations, cathodic protection is also a good choice.;
, One important form of corrosion that can occur regardless of the physical strength of the metals involved is galvanic corrosion. Galvanic corrosion occurs when two metals with differing electrode potentials are in contact with one another in the presence of an electrolyte (like saltwater) that creates an electrical conducting path between the two. When this happens, metal ions flow from the more-active metal to the less-active metal, causing the more-active metal to corrode at an accelerated rate and the less-active metal to corrode at a slower rate. In practical terms, this means that corrosion will develop on the more-active metal at the point of contact between the two metals.


Any method of protection that prevents ion flow between the metals can potentially halt galvanic corrosion. Giving the metals a protective coating can help prevent electrolytes from the environment from creating an electrical conducting path between the two metals, while electrochemical protection processes like galvanization and anodizing also work well. It's also possible to thwart galvanic corrosion by electrically insulating the areas of the metals that come into contact with each other.
Additionally, the use of cathodic protection or a sacrificial anode can protect important metals from galvanic corrosion. See below for more information.

, Pitting is a form of corrosion that takes place at the microscopic scale but can have large-scale consequences. Pitting is of great concern for metals that derive their corrosion resistance from a thin layer of passive compounds on their surface, as this form of corrosion can lead to structural failures in situations where the protective layer would normally prevent them. Pitting occurs when a small part of the metal loses its protective passive layer. When this happens, galvanic corrosion occurs at a microscopic scale, leading to the formation of a tiny hole in the metal. Within this hole, the local environment becomes highly acidic, which accelerates the process. Pitting is usually prevented by applying a protective coating to the metal surface and/or using cathodic protection.Exposure to an environment high in chlorides (like, for example, salt water) is known to accelerate the pitting process.

, Crevice corrosion occurs in spaces of a metal object where access to the surrounding fluid (air or a liquid) is poor - for instance, under screws, under washers, under barnacles, or between the joints of a hinge. Crevice corrosion occurs where the gap near a metal surface is wide enough to allow fluid to enter but narrow enough that the fluid has difficulty leaving and becomes stagnant. The local environment in these small spaces becomes corrosive and the metal begins to corrode in a process similar to pitting corrosion. Preventing crevice corrosion is generally a design issue. By minimizing the occurrence of tight gaps in a metal object's construction through closing these gaps or allowing circulation, it's possible to minimize crevice corrosion.


Crevice corrosion is of special concern when dealing with metals like aluminum which have a protective, passive outer layer, as the mechanism of crevice corrosion can contribute to the breakdown of this layer., Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a rare form of corrosion-related structural failure that is of particular concern to engineers charged with building structures intended to support important loads. In the event of SCC, a load-bearing metal forms cracks and fractures below its specified load limit - in severe cases, at a fraction of the limit. In the presence of corrosive ions, tiny, microscopic cracks in the metal caused by tensile stress from a heavy load propagate as the corrosive ions reach the tip of the crack. This causes the crack to gradually grow and potentially cause eventual structural failure. SCC is especially dangerous because it can occur even in the presence of substances that are naturally only very mildly corrosive to the metal. This means that the dangerous corrosion occurs while the rest of the metal surface superficially appears unaffected.Preventing SCC is partly a design issue. For instance, by choosing a material that is SCC-resistant in the environment in which the metal will operate and ensuring that the metal material is properly stress-tested can help prevent SCC. Additionally, the process of annealing a metal can eliminate residual stresses from its manufacture.
SCC is known to be exacerbated by high temperatures and the presence of liquid containing dissolved chlorides."

Instead, move the your steel wool in a straight line running in the direction the pewter's grain.
Keep buffing the pewter until its restored to its original appearance. As silver pewter requires minimal maintenance, this should not take too long.

Make sure you know your pewter type before polishing.,
Stay away from silver polishes when working with pewter.,
Do not put pewter in the dishwasher.",How to Polish Pewter4," You do not want to end up damaging your pewter by improper polishing. Remember, oxidized pewter does not benefit from polishing, and polishing could actually be damaging.You should only wash this type of pewter with mild soapy water and then dry it., Stick to homemade polishes or polishes made specifically for pewter. Silver polish can be damaging to silver. Never substitute silver polish for pewter polish when polishing pewter., Dishwasher detergent is very hard on pewter. As it can cause damage to your pewter, you should never wash pewter in the dishwasher. Always hand wash your pewter products."

Choose a vinegar.,
Check the direction of the grain.,
Spray your steel liberally with vinegar.,
Wipe the steel down with a soft cloth.",How to Polish Stainless Steel1," Certain vinegars can work better than others. White and cider vinegar works similarly on stainless steel, but cider vinegar leaves a more pleasant smell.Use what you have on hand. Cleaning vinegar is best for tough stains thanks to its higher acidity. If your appliance is heavily tarnished, purchase cleaning vinegar.
, Like wood, stainless steel has a grain that will run either vertically or horizontally. Wiping the steel down in the direction of the grain will help you reach the small grooves where dirt or grime can get trapped., Pour the vinegar in a spray bottle to lightly coat the stainless steel in vinegar. Then, spray the vinegar over the item until the item is thinly covered in vinegar. If you do not want to use a spray bottle, you can moisten a cloth in vinegar and evenly rub the item.

For light polishing, dilute vinegar with water (1/2 cup of vinegar for every quart of warm water).Polish with undiluted vinegar on items with heavy staining.

, Using either a soft cloth or paper towel, wipe the vinegar off in the direction of the grain. This will remove debris from the item and restore its shine. Remember to wipe in the direction of the grain. You don't want vinegar to stay caught in the grooves and cause your steel to fade over time.

Paper towels can leave behind fibers or break off into small pieces. A washcloth will polish the stainless steel best.

Paint the metal surface.,
Use marine paint for metal exposed to water.,
Apply protective lubricants to moving metal parts.,
Clean metal surfaces thoroughly before painting or lubricating.,
Keep unprotected metal products away from moisture.,
Keep metal surfaces as clean as possible.",How to Prevent Metals from Corroding2," Perhaps the most common, affordable method of protecting metal from corrosion is simply to cover it up with a layer of paint. The process of corrosion involves moisture and an oxidizing agent interacting with the surface of the metal. Thus, when the metal is coated with a protective barrier of paint, neither moisture nor oxidizing agents can come into contact with the metal itself and no corrosion occurs.


However, paint itself is vulnerable to degradation. Reapply paint whenever it becomes chipped, worn or damaged. If paint degrades to the point that the underlying metal becomes exposed, be sure to inspect for corrosion or damage on the exposed metal.
There are a variety of methods for applying paint to metal surfaces. Metalworkers often use several of these methods in conjunction to ensure that the entire metal object receives a thorough coating. Below is a sampling of methods with comments on their usages:

Brush - used for hard-to-reach spaces.
Roller - used for covering large areas. Cheap and convenient.
Air spray - used for covering large areas. Quicker but less efficient than rollers (paint wastage is high).
Airless spray/Electrostatic airless spray - used for covering large areas. Quick and allows for variable levels of thick/thin consistency. Less wasteful than ordinary air spray. Equipment is expensive.



, Metal objects that regularly (or constantly) come into contact with the water, like boats, require special paints to protect against the increased possibility of corrosion. In these situations, ""normal"" corrosion in the form of rusting isn't the only concern (though it is a major one), as marine life (barnacles, etc.) that can grow on unprotected metal can become an additional source of wear and corrosion. To protect metal objects like boats and so on, be sure to use a high-grade marine epoxy paint. Not only do these types of paint protect the underlying metal from moisture, but also discourage the growth of marine life on its surface.

, For flat, static metal surfaces, paint does a great job of keeping out moisture and preventing corrosion without affecting the metal's usefulness. However, paint usually isn't suitable for moving metal parts. For instance, if you paint over a door hinge, when the paint dries, it will hold the hinge in place, hindering its motion. If you force the door open, the paint will crack, leaving holes for moisture to reach the metal. A better choice for metal parts like hinges, joints, bearings, and so on is a suitable water-insoluble lubricant. A thorough coat of this type of lubricant will naturally repel moisture while simultaneously ensuring the smooth, easy motion of your metal part.


Because lubricants don't dry in place like paints, they degrade over time and require occasional re-application. Reapply lubricants to metal parts periodically to ensure they remain effective as protective sealants.

, Whether you're using normal paint, marine paint, or a protective lubricant/sealant, you'll want to ensure your metal is clean and dry before starting the application process. Take care to ensure the metal is entirely free of dirt, grease, residual welding debris, or existing corrosion, as these things can undermine your efforts by contributing to future corrosion.


Dirt, grime, and other debris interferes with paint and lubricants by keeping the paint or lubricant from adhering directly to the metal surface. For instance, if you paint over a sheet of steel with a few stray metal shavings on it, the paint will set on the shavings, leaving blank spaces on the underlying metal. If and when the shavings fall off, the exposed spot will be vulnerable to corrosion.
If painting or lubricating a metal surface with some existing corrosion, your goal should be to make the surface as smooth and regular as possible to ensure the best possible adherence of the sealant to the metal. Use a wire brush, sandpaper, and/or chemical rust removers to remove as much loose corrosion as possible.

, As noted above, most forms of corrosion are exacerbated by moisture. If you can't manage to give your metal a protective coating of paint or sealant, you should take care to ensure it's not exposed to moisture. Making an effort to keep unprotected metal tools dry can improve their usefulness and lengthen their effective life.If your metal items are exposed to water or moisture, be sure to clean and dry them immediately following use to prevent corrosion from starting.


In addition to watching for exposure to moisture during use, be sure to store the metal items indoors in a clean, dry place. For large objects that won't fit in a cupboard or closet, cover the object with a tarp or cloth. This helps keep out moisture from the air and prevents dust from accumulating on the surface.

, After each use of a metal item, whether the metal is painted or not, be sure to clean its functional surfaces, removing any dirt, grime, or dust. Accumulations of dirt and debris on metal surface can contribute to the wear and ear of the metal and/or its protective coating, leading to corrosion over time.

Use a galvanization process.,
Use a sacrificial anode.,
Use impressed current.,
Use anodization.,
Use a metal that exhibits passivation.",How to Prevent Metals from Corroding3," Galvanized metal is metal that has been coated with a thin layer of zinc to protect it from corrosion. Zinc is more chemically-active than the underlying metal, so it oxidizes when exposed to air. Once the zinc layer oxidizes, it forms a protective coating, preventing further corrosion of the metal underneath. The most common type of galvanization today is a process called hot-dip galvanization in which metal parts (usually steel) are submerged in a vat of hot, molten zinc to gain a uniform coating.


This process involves handling industrial chemicals, some of which are hazardous at room temperature, at extremely hot temperatures and thus should not be attempted by anyone other than trained professionals. Below are the basic steps of the hot-dip galvanization process for steel:

The steel is cleaned with a caustic solution to remove dirt, grease, paint, etc., then thoroughly rinsed.
The steel is pickled in acid to remove mill scale, then rinsed.
A material called a flux is applied to the steel and allowed to dry. This helps the final zinc coating adhere to the steel.
The steel is dipped in a vat of molten zinc and allowed to heat to the temperature of the zinc.
The steel is cooled in a ""quench tank"" containing water.



, One way to protect a metal object from corrosion is to electrically attach a small, reactive piece of metal called a sacrificial anode to it. Because of the electrochemical relationship between the larger metal object and the small reactive object (explained briefly below), only the small, reactive piece of metal will undergo corrosion, leaving the large, important metal object intact. When the sacrificial anode corrodes completely, it must be replaced or the larger metal object will begin to corrode. This method of corrosion protection is often used for buried structures, like underground storage tanks, or objects in constant contact with water, like boats.


Sacrificial anodes are made from several different types of reactive metal. Zinc, aluminum, and magnesium are three of the most common metals used for this purpose. Because of the chemical properties of these materials, zinc and aluminum are often used for metal objects in saltwater, whereas magnesium is more suitable for fresh water purposes.
The reason a sacrificial anode works has to do with the chemistry of the corrosion process itself. When a metal object corrodes, areas that chemically resemble the anodes and cathodes in an electrochemical cell naturally form. Electrons flow from the most anode parts of the metal surface into surrounding electrolytes. Since sacrificial anodes are very reactive compared to the metal of the object being protected, the object itself becomes very cathodic in comparison and, thus, electrons flow out of the sacrificial anode, causing it to corrode but sparing the rest of the metal.

, Because the chemical process behind metal corrosion involves electric current in the form of electrons flowing out of the metal, it's possible to use an outside source of electric current to overpower the corrosive current and prevent corrosion. Essentially, this process (called impressed current) confers a continuous negative electrical charge on the metal being protected. This charge overpowers the current causing electrons to flow out of the metal, halting corrosion. This type of protection is often used for buried metal structures like storage tanks and pipelines.


Note that the type of current used for impressed current protection systems is usually direct current (DC).
Usually, corrosion-preventing impressed current is generated by burying two metal anodes in the soil near the metal object to be protected. Current is sent through an insulated wire to the anodes, which then flows through the soil and into the metal object. Current passes through the metal object and returns to the source of the current (generator, rectifier, etc.) through an insulated wire. , Anodizing is a special type of protective surface coating used to protect metal from corrosion and also to apply to apply dies and so forth. If you've ever seen a brightly-colored metal carabiner, you've seen a dyed anodized metal surface. Rather than involving the physical application of a protective coating, as with painting, anodizing uses an electric current to give the metal a protective coating that prevents nearly all forms of corrosion.


The chemical process behind anodization involves the fact that many metals, like aluminum, naturally form chemical products called oxides when they come into contact with oxygen in the air. This results in the metal normally having a thin outer oxide layer which protects (to varying degree, depending on the metal) against further corrosion. The electric current used in the anodizing process essentially creates a much thicker buildup of this oxide on the surface of the metal than would normally occur, providing great protection from corrosion.
There are several different ways to anodize metals. Below are the basic steps of one anodizing process.See How to Anodize Aluminum for more information.

The aluminum is cleaned and de-greased.
The aluminum's surface impurities are removed with a de-smut solution.
The aluminum is lowered into an acid bath at a constant current and temperature (for instance, 12 amps/sq ft and 70-72 degrees F (21-22 degrees C).
The aluminum is removed and rinsed.
The aluminum is optionally submerged in dye at 100-140 degrees F (38-60 degrees C).
The aluminum is sealed by placing it in boiling water for 20-30 minutes.



, As noted above, some metals naturally form a protective oxide coating upon exposure to air. Some metals form this oxide coating so effectively that they eventually become relatively chemically inactive. We say that these metals are passive in reference to the process of passivation by which they become less reactive. Depending on its desired use, a passive metal object may not necessarily need any extra protection to make it corrosion-resistant.


One well-known example of a metal that exhibits passivation is stainless steel. Stainless steel is an alloy of ordinary steel and chromium that is effectively corrosion-proof in most conditions without requiring any other protection. For most day-to-day uses, corrosion isn't usually a concern with stainless steel.

However, it bears mentioning that in certain conditions, stainless steel is not 100% corrosion-proof - notably, in salt water. Similarly, many passive metals become non-passive under certain extreme conditions and thus may not be suited for all uses.

Choose a silver polish.,
Apply the polish.,
Polish the silver.,
Rinse off the polish.,
Completely dry the silver.",How to Polish Sterling Silver2," There are two primary types of silver polish available on the market: a liquid, spray on, or cream silver polish. The former is better for regular polishings and minor tarnish while the latter is best for heavy tarnish and larger silver products., If you are using a liquid polish, shake the bottle well before applying. Get some of the liquid or cream on a clean polishing cloth, and wipe it onto the surface of the silver. Allow it to set for 1-2 minutes depending on the amount of tarnish.

, Use another section of your polishing cloth to wipe the polish around on your silver, focusing on tarnished areas. This is your primary polish session, so get off any unwanted marks or spots at this point.

, Run your silver under lukewarm or cool water to wash off the polish. Use a clean sponge or cloth to remove all traces of the chemicals and completely clean the silver.

, Use a new silver polishing or microfiber cloth to dry the silver. Do this immediately after rinsing to avoid the formation of new water spots on the metal. Give a final polish to your silver, and you’re done!

Depending on the amount and sizes of the silver you are polishing, you will need to boil more water; just enough to completely cover your items.

, Get a heat safe bowl and cut a piece of aluminum foil to fit the inside. Lay the aluminum foil shiny side up along the interior of the bowl. If you need to use multiple sheets in order to fill the whole thing, feel free to do so.

, Measure out 1 tablespoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of salt, and ½ cup of white vinegar. Add these one at a time into the bowl, creating a fizzy mixture on top of the aluminum foil. If you are polishing several larger items at once, you may need to double these measurements.

, Use a spoon to mix together all the ingredients in the bowl so that they completely dissolve. Leaving chunks of baking soda or salt in the mix could scratch or dull your silver.

, When your water has reached a boil, slowly pour it into the mixture. Use your spoon to mix the solution a bit more to make sure that it is thoroughly combined.

, Slowly drop in each piece of silver, using tongs if necessary to avoid getting burned. Allow the silver to sit for a few minutes in the solution, flipping so that both sides are exposed halfway through.

, Use tongs to pick each piece of silver out of the water, and place it onto your polishing cloth. Let it sit for a moment to cool slightly, and then polish the entire area of the silver with the cloth. Focus on previously tarnished areas to make sure that they are completely clean."

Remove the top of the olive oil bottle and place the cloth over the top. Then, flip the bottle over and allow the oil to soak into the cloth for one to two seconds.

If desired, you can substitute olive oil with baby oil., Before you begin buffing the object, coat the entire surface of the object in olive oil. Continue wiping the object until you can see a light sheen across the surface. If one patch is more heavily coated than another, spread the patch around evenly., While you're applying pressure to the object, you will use the same cloth that you applied the olive oil with. Use considerable pressure to work the olive oil into the grooves. Continue working the olive oil in for several minutes until you have moved over the entire object.

Again, check the direction of the grain before you wipe the oil off. Applying pressure against the grain can dull stainless steel if olive oil remains trapped in the grooves.

, If you allow the oil to sit on the stainless steel, it can dull the metal instead of polish it. Using a clean, soft cloth, wipe the object down until dry. After you have finished wiping down the object, lightly touch it. If it still feels oily, continue wiping. Use your cloth to wipe off the fingerprints after you have touched it.

Keep a damp cloth nearby to wipe away paint, dust and rust particles periodically while you work. This is much safer for you than waiting until the end to deal with them.
If there is any chance the paint you are stripping may contain lead, the dust mask is an absolute must for your own safety.;
, Use a wire brush to strip the paint from the metal, remembering to wipe dust and paint particles away with a damp cloth as you work.If you prefer, you can use sandpaper to remove the paint.









A combination approach is best – stripping large surfaces will go much faster with a wire brush, and then use the sandpaper to get in the nooks and crannies.
A cordless drill with a wire brush attachment is also an option, and a good one if you are stripping away paint from a large surface area. Remember to wear protective ear muffs when operating drills., Wipe away all paint dust with a damp cloth and discard the cloth. Scrape off any hunks of remaining paint. Use a fresh cloth to give your metal a thorough rub down, cleaning off all loose paint, dirt, grease and grime from the surface.









Even if the surface looks fairly clean, don’t skip this step. You want the surface of the metal to be virtually spotless, or as close as you can get to it.
Failure to clean your metal properly will result in a lousy paint job. The paint won’t stick to the metal properly and will peel off easily.

After sanding, wipe down your metal one final time with a damp cloth to remove any lingering debris.








, You will want to do this before you put on the regular primer, but only if you are working with rusted metal. If your metal isn't rusted, start with the usual oil-based primer that is described below. Before application, scrape off any loose rust and wipe it down to remove any flakes or residue. Once the rust is removed, coat the metal with zinc-chromate primer before using a full-bodied primer.


You will need to prime your surface with the full-bodied primer immediately after you use one of these products, so don’t apply them until you are ready to prime.
Zinc-chromate is a corrosive resistant substance. You spray it on first because you want it to be closest to the surface of the metal, to protect it from rust. After applying this substance, you should immediately apply the regular ""full-bodied"" primer so that the zinc-chromate remains as the first layer. It also acts as an adhesive for the full-bodied primer., Make sure your primer and your paint are compatible with one another. You will be using acrylic paint (which works best on metal), so you want to choose an oil-based primer that is compatible with acrylic paint. Look for primer products that are made specifically for metal, as well, since these will best adhere to the surface.


Most primers come in a spray can for ease of use, but if you prefer to use a brush to apply it, metal primer also comes in a bucket or can for that purpose.
Primer prepares your surface so that the paint will adhere well, but it also helps to smooth out any color and texture that you weren’t able to remove from it.

, Spray the primer evenly onto the surface of the metal until it is completely covered. If working outside, do not use spray primer on a windy day. It is recommended that you shake the can of primer for about 2 minutes before you start using it.







, Because metal is extremely prone to the effects of oxidization, a double coat of primer is the best course of action. Not only will this help the paint stick to the surface, but it will also make the metal less vulnerable to the effects of time and exposure to the elements.









Rust, in particular, can be staved off with the proper use of primer.

, Drying times vary from product to product, so check the information on your particular can for details. The acrylic paint will go on better and last longer if you apply it on primer that has dried completely.

, Spray paint is also an option, but this type of paint won’t last as long on metal. Apply the paint evenly to the surface of the metal.









If you’re using a brush, don’t overload the bristles with paint, since this can be messy and create an overly thick first coat.

, Check your specific product for details about drying times. If you don’t allow the first coat to dry completely, the painted finish won’t last as long. Luckily, most acrylic paints dry quickly, so you can get the entire job done in one day if you time it right.

, Make sure to apply the paint as evenly as possible. A second coat will ensure that the finished project looks the best upon completion. It will also provide additional protection and last longer on the metal.


It is possible to do the first coat with one color of paint, allow it to dry thoroughly, and then paint a second coat with another color. This method is perfect for lettering or applying a logo to an object.
Acrylic paint is water-resistant, which means multiple layers can be applied to achieve different effects.
When applying multiple layers, you must let the paint of each layer dry completely before applying the next one.

, If possible, paint it in a place where you can leave it once you’re done, without having to move it. This will prevent accidental damage to the finished surface.

Line a deep plastic container with paper towels.,
Soak the towels in ammonia.,
Sprinkle salt on top.,
Place the brass inside.,
Cover the brass with additional ammonia-soaked paper towels.,
Place the lid on the container.,
Finish the brass piece.",How to Patina Brass2," Crumple up a few clean paper towels and place them inside a plastic container with a lid.


The container should be deep enough to hold these paper towels and your brass piece, plus an additional layer of paper towel not yet added.
A clean container that once held sour cream, cottage cheese, or another food can work well. Make sure that the container is clean and has a lid that snaps on securely.
Never reuse this container for food afterward.;
, Pour ammonia over the paper towels in you container, adding enough to saturate the paper towels.


Ammonia is a hazardous chemical, so you should only do this in an area that is well-ventilated. You should also protect your eyes with safety goggles and your hands with plastic or rubber gloves.

, Pour a generous amount of table salt over the paper towels in your container, distributing it evenly over the surface.

, Rest your brass piece directly on top of the coated and soaked paper towels. Press gently so that the bottom and sides of the brass come into direct contact with the ammonia and salt.

, Crumple another clean paper towel and place it directly on top of your brass piece. Pour more ammonia onto the paper towel, soaking it thoroughly.


Use as many paper towels as necessary to cover the entire outside surface of the brass.
You should also lift up the paper towels and sprinkle a light coat of salt on top of the brass. After doing so, cover the brass piece with your ammonia-soaked paper towels again.

, Secure the lid in place and set the container aside for a few hours to days.


Keep the container in a safe location, away from kids and pets.
You'll need to check on your brass piece periodically throughout the process until the desired look forms. A little patina should start forming within a few minutes, but for a more dramatic or aged look, try giving the process a day or two.
For best results, check on the patina every 30 to 60 minutes.
Note that your paper towels will also change color during the process.

, When the patina you desire has developed, remove the brass from your container and set it aside on a clean paper towel to air dry. After drying it, rinse away any remaining ammonia under running water and air dry again.


If the patina is too dark or dense, lighten it by scrubbing the dark portions with #0000 steel wool.
After a day or two passes, you may also want to coat the piece with clear lacquer or a soft wax to preserve the look of your patina.

Make a solution of vinegar and salt.,
Soak the brass in your solution.,
Meanwhile, preheat the oven.,
Bake the brass piece.,
Reapply the vinegar solution and continue baking.,
Submerge the brass again.,
Dry and cool.,
Finish the brass piece.",How to Patina Brass3," Combine five parts dark vinegar with one part salt, mixing well to dissolve the salt.


You should prepare enough of the solution to completely cover your brass piece.
Use a plastic or glass container since a metal container can have a reaction to the chemicals present, thereby tainting the process.
Dark vinegar refers to any vinegar available in a deep shade, like black vinegar or balsamic vinegar.

, Submerge your brass piece in the salted-vinegar solution, making sure that all sides are covered. Allow it to soak for an hour or more.


When submerging more than one piece of brass, make sure that nothing overlaps and that none of the pieces touch during this part of the process.

, Preheat the oven anywhere from 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 230 degrees Celsius).


The higher the temperature, the more dramatic the patina will be.
If desired, prepare a metal baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil. You can leave the foil off, but leaving the pan unprotected may cause the pan to become discolored.

, Remove the brass from the vinegar solution and place it onto your prepared metal baking sheet. Bake it for 60 minutes, or until you like the appearance of the developing patina.


Note that the look that develops during this time will not be the final look.

, Take the brass out of the oven and submerge it into the solution again for about 5 minutes, coating all sides of the piece. Return the brass to the oven and bake for another 30 minutes.


Use tongs when handling the brass since the metal will be extremely hot.

, Remove the brass from the oven using tongs and dunk it into your vinegar solution again, coating all sides well.


This final submerging will create a blue-green patina. If you do not want this tint of color, though, skip this step and move onto the next one after taking the brass out of the oven.

, Spread out two or three sheets of wax paper, layering them one on top of the other, and place the brass on top. Set it aside until dry and cool to the touch.


This can take anywhere from a few hours to overnight.

, A nice patina should have developed by this point, so the brass can technically be left as is. If desired, you can buff the piece with a clean rag to enhance the appearance, or #0000 steel wool to lighten it.


You should also consider sealing your piece in clear lacquer or soft wax to preserve the patina finish.

Hard boil an egg.,
Stop the cooking process.,
Peel the egg.,
Cut the egg in half.,
Place the egg and the brass in a plastic bag.,
Set aside.,
Finish the piece.",How to Patina Brass4," Place the egg in a small saucepan and cover it with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cold water. Transfer the saucepan to the stove and heat the water to a boil. Immediately turn the heat off and cover the saucepan, cooking the egg in the warm water for another 12 to 15 minutes.


Consider adding a pinch of salt to the water before boiling it to make the peeling process easier.
You should turn the heat off immediately after the water begins to boil.
Cooking the egg in this manner prevents the egg from being overcooked.

, Remove the egg from the hot water using a slotted spoon and rinse it thoroughly under cold running water. Keep it there until it feels cool enough to handle, but not yet ice cold.


Chilling the egg makes it easier to handle, and chilling the egg quickly helps separate the shell from the cooked egg white. When using the egg for this process, though, you want to keep the egg a little warm, so you should avoid cooling it down too much.

, Roll the egg gently on a flat surface to crack the shell. Then, use your fingers to peel away the rest of the shell.


You'll want to preserve as much of the egg as possible, but don't worry if you lose a few chunks of egg white as you peel off the shell. The egg should still produce enough sulfur as it sits to give your brass a patina finish.

, Use a kitchen knife to cut the egg in half lengthwise. Note that both the egg white and egg yolk should be cut in two.


Keep the yolk and white together instead of separating them.
The egg yolk is an important part of this process, so it is important that you expose it in this step.

, Place both halves of your boiled egg into a resealable plastic bag, along with your brass piece. Seal the bag well.


Only use a bag with an airtight seal.
The brass does not need to directly touch the egg.

, Let the bag sit out at room temperature for several hours. After several hours pass, you should notice a subtle patina forming on the brass.


The egg yolk is giving off sulfuric gas, and that gas is responsible for giving the brass a patina finish.
Keep the egg and brass in the bag for as long as needed to achieve your desired shade of patina.
Note that this process can get very smelly, so you may want to set the bag aside in a garage or unused room for its duration.

, Remove the brass from the bag and discard the egg. It is recommended that you seal the brass piece with clear lacquer or soft wax to protect the patina finish.

Sprinkle half a lemon with table salt.,
Rub the lemon onto the copper's surface.,
Make a paste with lemon juice and salt.,
Apply the paste to tougher areas.,
Rinse and dry your copper.",How to Polish Copper1," Cut a lemon in half. Then, sprinkle half the lemon with a generous amount of salt.





;
, For mildly tarnished jewelry, you can simply rub down the surface with the lemon. Rub the surface the same way you would rub it with a sponge or cloth. Rub as much as necessary to remove the tarnish.







, If you can't remove tarnish using a lemon, squeeze out some juice from the lemon into a bowl. Add salt. Mix salt with the lemon until you've formed a thick paste.







, Use a spoon to apply your paste to the stubborn areas on your copper piece. Let the paste sit on for a few minutes. Long exposure to the lemon paste will result in more tarnish being removed.








You do not need to rub the paste in too hard. Simply applying the paste should polish your copper.

, After your copper is polished to your liking, rinse off any lingering lemon and salt residue by rinsing your copper with clean, warm water. Make sure to pat the copper dry afterwards with a soft rag or cloth. You do not want copper to stay wet for long, as this can cause rust.

When selecting a commercial polish, make sure it's a polish specifically made for copper.You can buy copper polish online or at a hardware store.

, Use a soft cloth to wipe any dust off your copper. Dust can get plastered onto copper if it's not wiped off before the polishing process. This is especially important for copper that's been stored in a dusty area, like an attic, for a prolonged period.







, Apply your polish to a polish cloth. The amount you need varies. Use a generous amount of polish for very tarnished pieces and only a light amount for copper that only requires a light polishing.







, Use your polishing cloth to buff your polish into your copper. Apply a decent amount of pressure to remove any tarnish. Keep polishing until your copper shines.







, Use clean water to rinse off any remaining polish after you're done. Then, gently pat your copper dry. Make sure to get the copper completely dry as water can cause copper to rust.

, You’ll need to both wash and rinse your wrought iron. One of your buckets or spray bottles will be reserved for just rinsing, and this one will be filled with only water. Be sure that the water isn’t too hot. You don’t want it to burn your hands when you begin cleaning your item.If you are cleaning large items such as furniture, a bucket may work best. For smaller items, a spray bottle may be more useful.
If you are cleaning outdoor wrought iron furniture or railings, it may be easier for you to use a garden hose to rinse these items. If you have access to a hose, you’ll only need to fill one bucket with water., You’ll want to use a mild cleanser such as dish soap or a household cleaner to gently clean the wrought iron without damaging it. Be sure to avoid antibacterial soaps or cleansers that contain bleach.


Add 1 tbsp. (14 mL) of soap to 1 qt. (946 mL) of water. If using a household cleaner, use 1/4 cup (59 mL) to 1/2 gallon (1892 mL) of water.

, If you are cleaning wrought iron that is kept indoors, distilled white vinegar can be substituted for soap. For outdoor items, vinegar may not be a strong enough cleaner to remove the dirt.Add 1/2 cup (118 mL) white vinegar to 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) (1892 mL) of water.

, You want your piece to be completely bare so that nothing stands in the way of the cleaning process. Take off all cushions, pillows, and coverings.


If your wrought iron item is made out of multiple materials, such as a bench with a wooden seat and iron sides, you may not be able to isolate the wrought iron. If this is the case, clean carefully in the places where the two materials meet. You can also try wrapping the non-wrought iron parts of your piece in plastic wrap.

, Don’t worry about squeezing the excess water from your sponge. You’ll want plenty of soapy water to ensure that you reach every nook and cranny of your wrought iron item.If you are using a spray bottle, spray the sponge or cloth with your cleaning solution until it’s thoroughly dampened.

, Wipe the wrought iron in a circular motion, working in small sections at a time, in order to fully clean the item. Re-dampen the sponge or cloth as necessary.

, Dip a clean sponge or cloth into your reserved bucket of water. Wipe the wrought iron again to rinse off the cleaning solution and dirt. Be sure to continue dipping the sponge or cloth in your water bucket to clean the sponge as you rinse the wrought iron.Remember that if you are washing your wrought iron outside, it may be easier to rinse with a garden hose.
If the water in your bucket becomes excessively dirty, you may want to dump the dirty water and refill the bucket with fresh, clean water.

, Outdoor items may be left to dry in the sun. Indoor items should be wiped with a clean, dry cloth to remove all excess moisture., Most wrought iron will periodically develop rust. If your item has rusty spots, immediately after cleaning the piece, file down the rust with a coarse wire brush or sandpaper. This restores your product, making it last longer and look like new., Phosphoric acid converts rust that you can’t remove into iron phosphate, which looks like a hard, black crust. You’ll need to leave the acid on the material for a full day in order for this conversion to occur.Phosphoric acid comes in both sprays and gels. No matter which product you use, be sure to protect your hands and face from the material. Use rubber gloves, a mask, and eye protection when applying.

, After the acid has had time to penetrate, you should be able to use your wire brush to get rid of the remaining rust spots. At this point, your piece should be rust free., Now that all your rust is removed, you’ll need to re-clean the item. Repeat steps one through eight from part one. This will ensure that any tiny remnants of rust are removed.

, Once your item is clean and dry again, coat your piece with wax. You can use a clean, dry, soft cloth to apply the product in small circular motions, just as you did with the soapy water. The wax will protect your iron from weather and wear., The wax needs to soak into the material, so you’ll have to give it ample time to dry completely. Depending on the size of your item, this may take up to eight hours, or overnight.


If you’re cleaning outside, check the weather before you start the waxing process. You don’t want it to rain on your item before the wax is dry.

, Once the wax is fully dry, use the reverse side of the soft cloth to polish the iron. Move in the same circular motions you’ve used to clean and apply wax., In order to keep your wrought iron in good condition, use a lint-free microfiber cloth or feather duster to remove dust at least once a week. This will cut down on the number of times you’ll have to fully clean or sand your items."

If you do not have a pot large enough, you can dip the brass halfway into the pot, then do the other side., Once you have combined your mixture, place it over heat and bring it to a roiling boil. The baking soda should have dissolved by this point. To facilitate dissolving, stir the solution several times as it is warming., Place your brass into the boiling water, taking care to keep your own hands and fingers clear of the water. If your brass item is large, place as much of it in the mixture as possible, then repeat the steps on the other side.

Lower your brass into the boiling solution carefully, using tongs or tweezers to minimize the risk of burns.

, Leave your brass to boil in this solution for at least 15 minutes, removing it from heat once the 15 minutes are up. You can allow the brass to cool in the mixture, or you can remove it immediately using tongs.If you do remove it from heat, you can place it under cool or room-temperature water to cool it down.

, Although most of the lacquer will have fallen away during the boiling process, you can wipe or peel away any remaining lacquer once the brass has cooled.

If this is not enough to strip your brass of all of its lacquer, you may continue repeating these steps until it has all peeled away.

, Making sure you are in a well-ventilated area, place heat-resistant gloves on your hands, and a face mask over your nose and mouth. You should also place protective eyewear on your eyes so as not to singe your eyebrows or lashes., Pour equal amounts of acetone (nail polish remover) and metal polish into your non-flammable container, making sure the mixture does not exceed more than a quarter of an inch (.635 cm). If it does reach higher, you’ll need to find a larger container.


Once you have placed the mixture into your bowl, coat your brass item with it to encourage the fire to burn away the lacquer.

, Stepping as far from the container as possible, set light to the solution using a long-necked lighter or long matchstick. This will make sure the mixture is not near enough to your skin to expose you to excess heat and risk burns.


Do not use a regular matchstick or cigarette lighter, as both require you to be dangerously close to the flammable solution.

, The solution should burn itself out after 3-5 minutes. If it does not, douse the flames using an extinguisher or by placing a large lid over the pot. Longer than 5 minutes runs the risk of damaging your brass.

, Removing your brass pieces from the bowl with tongs, run them under room temperature water to cool the metal and strip away the lacquer.


If you use cool water, the brass may cool faster, but you also run the risk of warping and staining. Room temperature water will cool the metal without damaging it.

, If any lacquer does not wash away in the rinse, wipe away the remainder with a clean cloth or cotton swabs. This is best done while running the item under water, as a dry piece of brass may not release its lacquer easily."

Before applying your remover, move to an area with a fan, a window, or both.If you do not have a well-ventilated room, take your project outside to a yard, porch, or balcony. Avoid using solvents indoors whenever possible.

, To prevent stripping or staining of whatever surface you are working on, place a protective layer beneath the brass, such as a sheet of newspapers, a tablecloth, or a strip of plastic.

Paint dropcloths also work well, and are usually thick and durable enough to withstand the caustic nature of varnish removers.

, Working with varnish remover, you’ll need to keep your hands, lungs, and face protected. Wear gloves to prevent the solution from reaching your skin, and place a face mask over your mouth and nose to minimize the amount of fumes you inhale.Covering your mouth and nose is particularly important if you do not have access to an outdoor space or well-ventilated area.

, To apply the lacquer remover, simply place a paintbrush into the remover and apply it directly to the brass. Make sure you do not leave behind any of the brush’s bristles, as these may interfere with the remover’s efficacy., Coat the entire piece in a generous layer of remover, making sure you don’t skip or miss any spots.If your brass piece has a lot of small nooks and crannies, you can use a bottle brush or small rag to access hard-to-reach spaces.

, Different brands have different wait times, so make sure you follow the directions on your particular brand of lacquer remover. While it may be tempting to use the remover for longer than is recommended, you may actually damage the brass by doing so. Only use the remover in recommended increments., Following the directions for your remover, wipe away the removal solution. This should take the lacquer with it, revealing the unfinished, raw brass beneath. If the varnish remover does not take away all of the lacquer, repeat as many times as necessary to remove all of the coating.To reach hard-to-reach spots, you may want to enlist the help of a second brush to remove varnish.

On the other hand, if it is deep rust or it has eaten right through parts, then you'll need to replace pieces, consider using synthetic chemical rust removers or speak to a professional restorer relevant to the item.;
, Use the right tools. You need the right tools to remove the rust. Items that may be useful for scrubbing the rust include steel wool pads, abrasive brushes, sandpaper, wire brushes or crumpled tin foil.These can be used on their own initially, then in combination with one of the methods suggested below.


A dull putty knife may be used for thicker rust, helping with chipping it away.
If it's fabric you're dealing with, don't scrape! Instead, follow the advice offered below relating to fabric.
Whether or not you can scrape the item will depend on its fragility. If the item looks to be rusted through, it's in need of repair, and none of the remedies offered here will be of help and could make things worse.

, For vehicles and other large items, the methods are not necessarily appropriate and separate advice should be sought.


See How to clean silver for appropriate cleaning methods for silverware.
See How to remove rust from a car for vehicle rust removal suggestions.
Jewelry other than costume jewelry should be cleaned according to the specific metal, due to its delicacy and special features. See further How to clean silver jewelry, How to clean brass jewelry , How to clean copper jewelry and How to clean jewelry.

,,, After this time, you can scrape rust away with the lime rind.


Do not leave it any longer than a few hours or the salt will increase the rust., Allow to dry completely before storing away.

, This includes trays, baking sheets, and pots and pans.

, Once peeled, cut it into halves, to make it easier to hold.

,, Rub until the rust has lifted off.


Dip again on another part of the potato or use the other potato half if you need to keep rubbing for a while or you're rubbing a large area.

, Place on an uncrowded dish rack or sit the drying tinware near a warm oven to speed up the trying.


Alternatively, wipe clean using a damp cloth.

, Use enough vinegar to cover.


Soda or soft drink can also be used in place of vinegar.It usually works faster, thus you'll need to keep an eye on it and remove the nuts and bolts as soon as they appear rust-free.

, The rust should have come off the nuts and bolts.

, Wipe clean. Allow to dry in a well-ventilated place, such as on plastic mesh or a dish rack.

, It's meant to be a thick paste, so add more baking soda if it's too runny.

,, With scrubbing, the rust should lift off. However, be aware that you may need to repeat this process several times to be effective., If not, use the cream of tartar paste.


Cream of tartar can be found at supermarkets, while hydrogen peroxide is often sold in pharmacies or drugstores.

, Decide how much paste you need, and use that amount of cream of tartar. Then add just enough hydrogen peroxide to form a paste.If it gets too runny, add more cream of tartar.

, Leave it to dry.

, Check the rust area. If it has improved, you're all done. If not, repeat until the rust stain improves.

, Do so as follows:


Drop salt or cream of tartar onto the area of the rust stain on the clothing.
Squeeze lemon juice over the salt and stain.
Place the clothing into the direct sunshine. Leave for a few hours, to let the sunlight do its work of bleaching the fabric.

, For example, do not leave garden tools sitting in the rain.

, These can absorb the moisture and may help to discourage rust growth., Then wipe with a little oil or WD-40 to help discourage rust., Cover it when it is not in use. This may help to discourage the growth of rust.

, Proper care and handling of cast iron pans and pots can be found here.

, Always ensure such items are fully dried before placing into a cupboard, the garage or anywhere else for storage. Ensure that the storage is not moist; if needed, use moisture soaking devices to reduce the humidity in the storage area.

Wear the proper protective gear.,
Seperate the chrome from other materials.,
Fill a glass or plastic container with muriatic acid.,
Leave the chrome in the acid for 30 minutes.,
Wipe down the chrome.,
Rinse the chrome with cold water.,
Repeat the steps to dull your chrome further.,
Neutralize the acid before disposing of it.",How to Dull Chrome2," Make sure that when you work with acid the room is well-ventilated so that you don't get sick from the fumes. Also, you'll want to wear a pair of rubber gloves, a face mask, and eye protection. Muriatic acid is highly dangerous and could cause serious medical problems if you get it on your skin or inhale it.If you get the acid on your skin or eyes, flush it with water for at least 15 minutes before seeking professional medical attention.
If you inhale the acid, go outside to get fresh air before seeking medical help.

, This method is perfect for smaller chrome items but could damage other materials if they come in contact with the acid. If you can, make sure to detach the chrome from any plastic or any other materials that it's attached to before moving to the next step.

, You can purchase muriatic acid at most hardware and pool stores or online. Once you get the acid, carefully pour it into a plastic or glass container so that it's high enough to completely submerge your chrome.If you are using the acid to dull chrome rims, make sure to dilute it in a solution of 10 parts water to 1 part acid to prevent damaging your car's paint., Let the chrome sit in the acid for up to 30 minutes. During this time, you should see the chrome finish begin to dissolve off of the metal. Once it has sat in the acid, you can remove it with your hands as long as you're wearing rubber gloves., When you remove the chrome from the acid, it will have a film over it. While still wearing your gloves, use another pair of gloves like a rag to rub down the film. Do not use cotton to wipe down your chrome or the acid may destroy it., Place your chrome under your faucet and rinse it under cold water, until all of the acid has been completely removed. Dry down the wet piece of chrome with a rag once you're done rinsing. The chrome piece should now be duller., Once you completely rinse and dry down your chrome, it may still not be as dull as you want it to be. To remove the remaining shine, submerge your chrome back into the acid for another 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing and drying it off., Do not dispose of your acid by putting it down the drain because it can cause damage to your piping. To neutralize the acid, pour a one-pound (453.59 g) box of sodium bicarbonate and an equal proportion of cold water until the acid stops fizzing. Once the acid stops fizzing, you can pour it down the sink.Pour the water into the acid slowly to prevent splashback.

Get rid of the bed bugs.,
Blot the spots with cold water immediately after you discover them.,
Find 3-5% Hydrogen Peroxide and dab the beg bug stains with it.,
Use a dry washcloth to scrub the spots on your mattress dry.,
Put your pillow cases and sheets in the washer: cold cycle only.,
Dry your laundry on low heat.",How to Get Rid of Bed Bug Stains," If you're going to get rid of bed bug stains, there's no point in continuing without first dealing with the source of the problem. That would be your bed bug infestation issue.;
, Blood stains, bed bug stains, and fecal matter stains all have one thing in common: they're all organic stains. Cold water allows you to moisten the bed bug stains without setting them. Warm water sets stains. Don't use it.

, Hydrogen peroxide reacts with the cellular matter (certain proteins and lipids in damaged cells) that is being left on your bedding by the bed bugs. It will help you lift those stains out of your mattress, sheets, pillow cases, and comforters. It even works on walls, floors and carpets.

, Your mattress likely cannot be washed like you can wash your bedding and such. Use the dry washcloth (better yet, a microfiber cloth) to pull the moisture (and the blood and bed bug fecal matter) out of the mattress's fabric.

, Again, you don't want to set those stains. Let the stain fighting properties of your typical laundry detergent do the work for you. A good 30 minute wash cycle should be enough to get rid of those bed bug stains.

, This doesn't really need explanation, but if you have a particularly damp mattress from all of that cleaning, you can dry it off with a hair dryer. No biggie. If you didn't get those bed bug stains out with cold water and hydrogen peroxide, they're not likely to ever come out. Might as well risk setting them rather than risk the chance of allowing mold to grow in all of that moisture.

Keep your cat out of the bedroom.,
Install plastic mattress covers.",How to Get Cat Urine Out of a Mattress," When you discover a fresh marking that’s still wet, grab a couple of old towels and press them firmly into the mattress to absorb as much of the urine as possible. Replace the towels with dry ones as needed. You know you’ve absorbed as much as possible when towels come away dry.Launder the towels immediately to remove the urine and get rid of the smell, otherwise the cat may mark again.
Use paper towels if you don't want to get cat urine on your towels.;
, When the weather is mild enough and it’s not raining, take the mattress outside if you can. This will make it easier to soak the mattress with water and cleaner, and speed up the drying process. Place the mattress on a clean surface, such as a picnic table or patio.


To protect the mattress from dirt, lay down a large plastic sheet before you put down the mattress.

, When the weather is too cold, snowing, or raining, leave the mattress in place on the bed. Lay down a large plastic sheet between the mattress and the box spring. Place one or two folded towels between the mattress and box spring underneath the affected area on the mattress.


The towels and plastic will help protect the box spring and the floor below from water damage.

, Fill a bucket with about 4 cups (940 ml) of room temperature water. Pour the water on the affected area of the mattress.Concentrate the water on the affected area as much as possible without soaking the rest of the mattress.


Dousing the area with water will dilute the urine and reduce the smell.

, Once you’ve thoroughly soaked the area with a bucketful of water, grab some fresh towels. Lay a couple of fresh towels over the wet area and press them into the mattress. Replace them with dry towels as necessary, until the towels come away dry.Like before, place the soiled towels in the laundry immediately.
Replace the towels underneath the mattress with dry ones.

, There are a few different products you can try when it comes to removing cat urine from a mattress. Enzyme cleaners are specifically designed to break down organic matter like urine and blood. Use about ½ to a full cup (118 to 235 ml) of cleaner, depending on the size of the stain. You can also try a mixture of household cleaning products such as:¼ to ½ cup (59 to 118 ml) vinegar mixed with equal parts water (depending on the size of the stain
¼ to ½ cup (59 to 118 ml) hydrogen peroxide mixed with equal parts water and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) laundry detergent or stain remover

, Slowly pour the cleaner over the affected area, making sure you cover the entire stain. If you're using a cleaner in a spray bottle, remove the spray nozzle and pour the cleaner directly onto the stain.


Spraying cleaner with a spray bottle will not penetrate the stain deeply enough, and won’t remove all the urine., Leave the cleaner to soak into the mattress for 15 minutes. This will give the cleaner time to work its way down into the mattress, penetrate the stain, and help break down the urine., After 15 minutes, take a couple of fresh towels and lay them over the stain on the mattress. Press them into the mattress to absorb excess cleaner, water, and urine. Continue blotting until you’ve absorbed all the moisture you can.


Launder the dirty towels immediately.

, Sprinkle about ½ cup (110 g) of baking soda over the wet area. This will help draw out more moisture, and pull urine and cleaner odors out of the mattress., Letting the cleaner air dry in the mattress will give it the best chance of breaking down the urine and cleaning the mattress.If you were able to take your mattress outside, leave it out to dry in a covered and protected area where it won’t get dirty or wet from rain.


Inside, set up a fan and point it at the mattress to help speed up the drying time. The mattress may take two to three days to dry completely.
To sleep on the mattress before it’s dry, cover the affected area with one or two towels, followed by a plastic bag. Make the bed as usual. Remove the towels in the morning to let the mattress continue air drying.

, When the baking soda has clumped together and absorbed all the liquid it can, use a vacuum to clean it off the mattress. If the mattress is still wet, you can add more baking soda to keep drawing out moisture and odors.


You may need a hard-bristled vacuum brush attachment to loosen the baking soda from the mattress., A medical problem could be causing your cat to urinate somewhere other than the litter box. To eliminate this possibility, and to treat your cat if something is wrong, take your pet to the vet and tell the vet your cat urinated outside the litter box. Possible medical causes for this include:Diabetes
Arthritis pain
Bladder or kidney stones
Urinary tract infections
Hyperthyroidism

, Anxiety is another common problem that could cause your cat to urinate outside of the litter box. There are lots of things that can stress cats out, but if anxiety is the problem, you will have to help calm your cat to prevent this from happening again. Common causes of feline stress and anxiety are:New additions to the family, such as a new baby or another pet. If this is the case, give your cat a safe space to retreat to and work on reintroducing the newcomer and the cat again.
Other cats or animals roaming outside your house. In that case, keep your cat inside, and take measures to deter the other animals from coming around.
Diet can also cause cat stress, especially if your cat is on a restrictive diet. Talk to your vet about the best course of action if you suspect diet is the problem.
Not enough play time or attention. While cats are solitary creatures, they still need attention. Dedicate time each day to playing with, brushing, and petting your cat.

, A good rule of thumb is to have one litter box per cat in the house, plus an extra.This can be especially important if your cat is older, has trouble getting to the bathroom quickly, or is starting to have trouble with stairs. In that case, make sure there's a litter box on each level of the house.


Place a litter box in two of the cat’s favorite rooms if your house has one floor.

, Cats are very clean animals, and they may stop using their litter boxes if the boxes aren't cleaned out often enough. Some cats will even refuse to use the litter box unless it’s cleaned out after each use.


You should be scooping the litter box once a day, and clumping litter should be changed out every two to three weeks., Older cats can get joint pain and arthritis. When it comes to using a litter box with high sides, getting in and out and using the box can be painful. Try a litter box with shorter sides and see if that makes a difference., One of the simplest solutions for stopping your cat from urinating on the bed is to keep the cat out of the bedrooms. This is especially important if you're allergic to your cat, since urine is one of the triggers for allergies.Pay attention to whether the cat starts to mark elsewhere, however. Preventing the cat from getting into your room may stop it from urinating on the bed, but it may start to mark somewhere else, especially if the underlying cause wasn’t addressed.

, These are great for keeping your mattress safe from all sorts of spills, including urine, beverages, and other liquids that could stain and cause bad odors. The plastic covers are like fitted sheets that go over top of the mattress, and then you make the bed as usual over the plastic sheet.


If your cat does urinate on the mattress again, strip the bed, launder the sheets, and use an all-purpose cleaner and a cloth to wipe the plastic.

Open curtains, blinds and windows!,
Do your bed.,
Put everything on your bed.,
Vacuum and/or sweep your entire floor.,
Take a break every half hour or so.,
Start at the top of the pile of things on your bed, working your way to the bottom.,
Organize your room afterwards.,
Flop onto your bed, take a deep breath, and just admire your totally clean and organized room.",How to Clean Your Room if You Are Lazy and Don't Want To," Don't be mean and shout it at them, but explain you want to do some serious cleaning and wish to not be disturbed as it may affect your cleaning progress.;
, Any music will do as long as you like it! Put the music on quite loud so you don't get distracted by any street noise.

, Get some air in your room. This will give you a nice breezy, feeling as you work, and you'll have more energy overall.

, This is essential. Put on some new covers if you want. A new bed cover can really brighten a room and personalize it! If you'd rather not change the covers, it's alright to do it another, but make sure you have it made and looking nice with a fresh pillowcase and a couple of stuffed animals if you'd like.

, Put everything that's on the floor onto your bed, apart from furniture... that can stay where it is. This way, you won't be able to sleep in your bed at night with all the clutter on top. You'll be forced to get it all done.

, The floor is now clear of all your junk, making it a good time to get rid of all those bits of dust and gravel you keep stepping on.

, Use it as a time to grab a drink and eat something if you're hungry. Being dehydrated isn't fun... especially when you're tasked with the mundane chore of cleaning. If you want, take a water bottle to your room so you can drink as you go. Don't drink too much though or you'll end up spending more time on the john than cleaning your room!

, Put clothes away in drawers and on closet hangers. Put items away in a place where similar things would be found (eg. Books in a bookshelf, cosmetics/perfumes on a dressing table etc.) Remember that if you don't clean it all up you'll be forced to sleep on the floor. An excellent motivator for the lazy.

, When you finish the cleaning overhaul, leave your room for that day. Completely de-cluttering your room is certainly enough for one day- trying to organize it as well is overkill and will leave you despising cleaning. Try organizing you room about 2-3 days later, so you are still in the cleaning mood but not dreadful of any five-letter word starting with 'c.'


Find extra shoeboxes laying around, label them, and use them as handy stackable organizers. Very cheap and easy to find space for.






Clear out your extra drawers and re-arrange the items inside. With some clever placing, you can end up with double the space for things to go inside.






Display objects on dresser tops or bulletin boards. This saves space inside drawers or cabinets, and gives your room a personal touch by putting on display items you love and cherish. A bonus if you want to change the way your room looks and clean it at the same time.







, You deserve to relax after working hard, pushing off your laziness, and cleaning up your room! Now, the mundane task of making sure your room doesn't get messy again...

Boil water.,
Line a dish or bowl with aluminum foil.,
Place the sterling silver on the foil.,
Add baking soda to the boiling water.,
Pour the baking soda solution into the dish.,
Let the silver soak in the solution for 2-10 minutes.,
Rinse the sterling silver with cool water.,
Dry the sterling silver with a soft, nonabrasive cloth.",How to Clean Sterling Silver at Home2," Place one cup (240 mL) of water in a saucepan. Bring the water to a boil on the stovetop., To clean sterling silver with baking soda, you will need a bowl or dish that can withstand boiling water, like a glass baking dish or bowl. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil large enough to line the inside of the dish or bowl. Place the foil inside the dish, making sure the bottom and sides are securely covered with foil., Once you have lined the dish or bowl with foil, place the sterling silver directly on the foil. The silver must be in contact with the aluminum foil for the chemical reaction that removes the tarnish to occur., Once the water is boiling, remove the saucepan from the heat. Add one tablespoon of baking soda to the boiling water. It is normal for the solution to bubble and forth., Pour the solution on top of the sterling silver. Make sure the sterling silver is completely submerged in the baking soda solution., You will need to let the sterling silver soak for several minutes to remove the tarnish. Pieces that are severely tarnished may need to soak for as long as 10 minutes., Once you have soaked the silver long enough to remove the tarnish, remove the silver from the baking soda solution. Rinse the jewelry with cool, clean water. If possible, use filtered water., Once you have rinsed the silver, dry it with a cloth made of nonabrasive fabric like microfiber or flannel. Make sure you dry the silver completely with the cloth.

Use a soft, nonabrasive cloth.,
Make long, back and forth strokes.,
Use clean sections of the cloth.,
Try a cotton swab for detail.",How to Clean Sterling Silver at Home3," You don’t need to purchase a special cloth to clean and polish your sterling silver. A soft, lint-free cloth made of a fabric like flannel or microfiber works well. Using a nonabrasive cloth will prevent scratches on your sterling silver.Never use an old t-shirt. Printing and ink on the shirt can damage the silver.Avoid tissues and paper towels, as they can scratch sterling silver.

, Gently polish the surface of the sterling silver. Make long strokes that go along with the grain of the silver. Avoid rubbing the cloth in circles, which can magnify existing scratches., When the area of the cloth you are using to polish the sterling silver turns black, begin using a new section of the cloth. This will ensure you do not place the tarnish you are removing back on the silver., If you find it difficult to reach tiny, detailed areas of the sterling silver, try using a cotton swab. Make sure the swab is one hundred percent cotton, as other materials may scratch or dull your sterling silver.

Take all your food out of the fridge.,
Throw out any aged, moldy, inedible or in any way questionable food.,
Take out any shelving, drawers ( sometimes known as ""crispers""), or other removable surface areas from the refrigerator.,
Wash the shelving, drawers, and other surfaces by hand.,
Wipe the inside of the refrigerator with your preferred cleaning solution.,
Make sure to clean the inside of the fridge doors.,
Dry off shelving before putting it back in its home in the refrigerator.,
Clean the gasket using a dissolved solution of ½ water and ½ vinegar or bleach.,
Reintroduce the food into the refrigerator.,
Wipe down all exterior surfaces of the refrigerator, including the front, back, sides, and top.,
Locate the coils.,
Isolate the refrigerator from its power source.,
Use a coil brush to gently remove dust and debris from the coils.,
Use the coil brush and a damp rag to remove dust and dirt from the condenser fan blade.,
Clean the floor and surrounding area using a vacuum and rag.

,
Plug the refrigerator back into electric power and slide the unit back into place.

,
Reference your Use and Care manual for information about how to change the filter in your unit.

,
Do a seasonal (quarterly) pass through your refrigerator to keep it smelling fresh and looking good.,
Use a homemade air freshener to absorb unpleasant smells and keep your fridge odor-free.,
Scent your fridge to give it a subtle fragrance.,
Crumple a piece of a brown paper bag into a ball and place it alongside fruits and veggies in the crisper for odor protection.",How to Clean a Refrigerator," Place it on a table or counter so the refrigerator is completely emptied out. You will want to have empty space so that you can easily assess what items to sort through.


Although most food will be fine when left out for a short period of time, make sure that such food is not left out more than an hour or so. Food can reach ""the danger zone"" in a relatively short period of time.
Having a cooler can make the process a bit safer for food safety, especially during hot summer months.
If you are cleaning out the refrigerator in cold weather, you may be able to put the items outside while you sort at your leisure.;
, If possible, bag securely to prevent leakage or mold distribution. The yearly or quarterly refrigerator clean often alerts us to items we've completely forgotten about.


Check expiration and ""use by"" dates. These are indicators that a given item should be cleaned out.
Throw away items that you are unlikely to use. If no one in the house likes olives, get rid of the jar that has been in the refrigerator since the martini party.
Empty the bin afterwards to make sure your house doesn't smell of all the food you throw out!

, In order to get the job done quicker, you'll probably want to remove shelving and the like and place it near the kitchen sink, where it will be much easier to clean.


For a quick clean, you do not necessarily have to take out all shelving. But doing so assures a more in-depth clean.
Usually shelving comes out in a similar fashion to oven racks, or drawers in a bureau.

, Dish soap will be fine. Most of what you took out of your fridge either won't fit or shouldn't be placed in a dishwasher. Instead, lather up some suds, get a nice brush or sponge to scrub with, and start going at the removable items from your fridge.


Never wash a cold glass shelf with hot water. The sudden temperature change could shatter the glass. Instead, use cold water or remove the shelf and let it come up to room temperature before washing it.
For heavy-duty spills and/or stains, don't be afraid to use the power of hot water and ammonia. Dilute a little bit of ammonia in hot water (1:5 ratio should be plenty) and let the item(s) soak before scrubbing.
Be sure to let the shelving, and drawers dry out completely on a drying rack before inserting back into the refrigerator.

, Attack any big or stubborn stains and hit all the remaining surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge.


You probably don't want to use a strongly scented soap or cleaner on the inside of the fridge, as food may absorb the smell. Instead, use one of the following natural cleaning solutions:

2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 quart hot water1 part apple cider vinegar to 3 parts hot water


For really stubborn stains or buildups, try using a dab of white toothpaste. It serves as an abrasive cleanser and it smells mighty fine to boot., If your refrigerator door has shelving space and is regularly used, make sure to hit that area too, either with a chemical cleaner or a gentler one (explanation above).

, With a clean cloth, wipe off any excess water from your removable shelving and place it back in the refrigerator.

, Don’t saturate the seal with undiluted bleach as this may ruin the integrity of the gasket. Pat the gasket dry and then apply lemon oil, mineral oil, or body lotion on the gasket to keep the rubber supple.

, Wipe off any jars, bottles, or tupperware and place them back into the refrigerator. Double-check the expiration dates on any perishable items before placing them back.

,


Pull the refrigerator forward to expose all sides. To avoid scratching your wood floor or tearing linoleum, use an appliance glide when moving your refrigerator.
Clean the all exterior surfaces using a towel and all-purpose cleaner.
If your model has the coils mounted on the back of the unit, skip wiping the back until Part 3.

, For information on your refrigerator's condenser coil location, reference your Use and Care manual. Depending on your refrigerator model, the condenser coils can be located in several places:


Along the back of the unit, or
Mounted under the unit and accessed via the rear panel, or
In the front of the unit and accessed via the toe grill.

, It is important to unplug the refrigerator to prevent electric shock. If your unit is built-in or difficult to pull forward, turn off power via your home’s breaker box.

, Be extremely careful not to puncture the coils.


After cleaning the coils with a coil brush, use a vacuum with attached brush to clean up the excess dust and dirt on and around the coils. Do not use a cleaning solution on the coils

, The fan circulates are across the coils, which aids in releasing excess heat. If the fan blade is obstructed in anyway, the coils will have a hard time releasing heat.

,,,, Every three months, remove most or all of your food from the fridge and wipe all the surfaces with a baking soda or vinegar solution. Regular maintenance will save you time and energy in the future.


This almost goes without saying, but if you notice a spill or stain in the fridge, try to clean it up quickly and remove the source of the stain. Spills or stains that aren't cleaned quickly can set and become harder to remove in the future.

, Before food goes bad, and starts coating the inside of your fridge with regular blasts of bad odors, it's time to act. Here's what you can equip your fridge with to combat these smells:


A clean sock filled with activated charcoal — from an aquarium store, not from your bbq briquettes. The charcoal absorbs bad odors for up to three months.
An opened box of baking soda. Baking soda is another excellent odor absorber.Most baking soda packages say you should change your baking soda out every 30 days, but you can probably get away with 60 to 90 days of use before exchanging.
Freshly ground coffee, placed in a small dish at the back of the fridge, also works very well at absorbing odors.
Unscented chlorophyll cat litter is yet another odor buster. 1/2"" kitty litter in a shallow pan at the back of the refrigerator should eliminate most offending smells.

, This may not be for everyone, but some people might enjoy the subtle hint of vanilla, for example, when they open their refrigerator. The operating word in this whole step is ""subtle."" You probably don't want any fragrance to be overwhelming upon opening of the fridge. Like cologne or perfume, a nice ""afterthought"" is much more pleasant, especially coupled with food:


Sprinkle a little vanilla extract, tea tree oil, or essence of lavender, lemon, or even bergamot in a cotton ball and place the cotton ball in a small dish at the back of the fridge. Exchange every couple of weeks.

, A crumpled paper bag works wonders at removing smells in the crisper.

your toaster, your coffee maker, your blender and your coffee grinder.

, Use a mop and bucket of soapy water to deep clean your floor., After you have finished cleaning, put all cleaning supplies back in their proper place so that you don't trip over them.

, Last of all, take out the trash. You should do this last because while you are cleaning you will undoubtedly find things you will want to throw away. Wash the trash can with soap and water. Replace the bag with a new one.

Play a game with the kids. Tell them ""I'm thinking of a toy that's on the floor. Whoever picks it up first gets to sit in my lap for story time.""
Play lively music and dance a few steps. It'll keep you moving along while having fun.
Listen to an audio book with a long project.

Time yourself. Set a timer for fifteen minutes and clean as much as you can. Make a game out of cleaning by competing against time.
Play a game. Allow yourself only ten minutes per hour to get up and clean. You'll be surprised by your ingenuity and efficiency with only a limited amount of time to devote to cleaning throughout the day.;

Discard unnecessary items rather than cleaning them or cleaning around them.
Try a game. Grab a bag for trash and donations. Pick a number, such as 25, and go as fast as you can putting that number of items into a bag. This prevents dawdling over any one item.
Drop your donations off regularly or phone a truck for pickup.

,


Use doormats to reduce the frequency of sweeping and washing the floor.
Choose surfaces and arrangements that are easy to clean. For example, either put the sofa right up against the wall or put it far enough away from the wall, to get a vacuum cleaner behind it, without having to move it.
Don't bother to fold underwear; just sort it and dump it in the drawer. Nobody's going to check.
Don't just throw your clothes in the closet; take a moment to hang them up. When things are accessible, it saves time in the long run.

,


Organize the kitchen. It's a very active place.
Keep working surfaces free of clutter, such as the bathroom and kitchen counters.
Make your bed every day. This provides a big surface area to sort through your things. It gives the room an overall tidy appearance.
Keep your drawers, cupboards and closets more spacious. Retain a minimal amount of clothing or towels. It will take a lot longer to put away laundry if there's limited space.
Keep things handy. Set up an area to have everything you'll need.
Hang an extra towel in the kitchen to add convenience.

If paying the bills, have your checkbook, calculator, envelopes, postage stamps and pen readily available in a basket or desk drawer.


Be neat. If you have a lot of mail, place it in a pile with the most important envelopes on the top.
Try not to let things pile up. One piece of paper in a cleaned area can give you an excuse to add more.

,


Do you have a few minutes while you're waiting for something to cook? Put away the dishes while you're still in the kitchen. Straighten the silverware drawer.
Keep a container of wipes in the bathroom and run one over the toilet or sink while you're still in there.
Going up or down the stairs? Is there anything that should go with you to be put away?
Bring things a little closer to where they belong as you're walking by. Always have something in your hand that's headed in the same direction.

, Work on one drawer or cabinet per session and don't overdo it.

, This week, clean the kitchen more thoroughly, doing only minimal upkeep in other areas. Next week, move on to the bedroom, bathroom, living room and so on.

Think about your habits and traffic patterns. Leave things in a convenient location until you have time to deal with them later.
Undress near your closet so that your shoes are closer to where they belong. Place a hamper within the same area.

Place a basket next to the couch for your books, newspapers or crafts; you can always put them away later.


Have zones where you allow yourself to be messy. Perhaps your desk, workshop or craft room could be off limits to others. Just close the door or simply acknowledge that this area is too busy or too creative to keep clean.

,


Empty the dishwasher promptly. An empty dishwasher means less dirty dishes in the sink.
Focus on cleaning certain central, highly visible areas first, especially if someone is coming over. Gather everything together and store it behind a closed door, such as in a closet or in the bedroom.
Whatever you do, don't start tearing apart drawers or closets if you are cleaning for a guest that is about to arrive.

This alone can make you feel like getting up and starting to clean.Look at pictures either online or in magazines of your ideal home. Imagine trying to get your own home as close to your vision of the perfect home as possible. Seeing how others organize and arrange their own houses can inspire you to make your home as beautiful as you can.
You can even look at pictures of your house when it is in its ideal state for inspiration.;
, You probably have also noticed how much calmer and more productive you are in an organized environment. It’s a fact that the more cluttered and unclean your environment is, the less stressed you feel., Call up a friend and tell them that you are having trouble finding the motivation to clean. Ask your friend to check in with you every twenty minutes or so to check your progress.

, If you are cleaning in the afternoon, invite people over later in the day. You will be motivated to save yourself the embarrassment of a messy house.

Pay attention to seating and eating areas.,
Cook.,
Invite friends.",How to Cheer up a Kitchen," Regardless of how old or new your kitchen is, that pile of dirty dishes sitting in the sink is not inspiring or cheery. Moreover, years of accumulated recipe scribbles, cookbooks, broken utensils and other kitchen paraphernalia needs an occasional sort-through to ensure that you only use the best, most reliable tools and that you're finding your favorite recipes with ease.


 


Declutter. Unnecessary items on counter-tops, tables, and so forth can cause kitchens to feel ""heavy"" and less cheerful.
Get unnecessary appliances off of the counters. The rule tends to be to have only one or two small appliances out. Usually these will be ones used every day, or ones that are two big or impractical to store. Toasters should not be stored in cabinets, as they tend to be full of crumbs. Coffee makers such as cappuccino makers are usually too big. Items used once a week, such as waffle irons should be stored out of sight.;
, Add or replace light fixtures, open the blinds, and consider installing a skylight, if you have that option. Light in the kitchen lets you see what you are doing and also brightens up the room. You may even find yourself inspired to tidy up more often.

Consider having specific spotlights installed over workspace areas. It is easier to see , especially when cutting, carving and chopping food, under a bright, direct light. Additional light also brightens up the kitchen space.
Under-cabinet lights are especially good at adding additional light. Some do not require wiring and run on batteries.
During winter, a more brightly lit kitchen will help maintain everyone's cheeriness.

,

Consider the color of your cabinets. Cabinets are often the main color of your kitchen. If your cabinets are very dark, this tends to make a kitchen feel less cheerful. White tends to brighten and lighten.
Replace flooring. A worn-out kitchen floor makes a kitchen look tired.
Paint walls. Sometimes just a fresh coat of paint will do wonders. Traditionally, lighter colors are used in kitchens to keep it light and cheerful.
Wash the walls and cabinets. Sometimes painting is not an option, such as in a rental or a mobile home. Kitchen walls are subjected to subtle stains from cooking even if a kitchen is kept clean. A deep cleaning with a cleaner such as TSP can significantly improve the appearance of the kitchen and you may decide you do not need to paint after all.
Choose colors you like, whether or not they are fashionable this year. What cheers up one person may not work for another. Gray, for instance, may sound dull and depressing but the right gray can look sophisticated and chic.

, A few inspiring pieces can bring personality into the ""heart of the home"". Some common items include: tea towels, pot holders, refrigerator magnets, curtains, and any other decorative item that strikes your fancy; this is your space!

It can be pleasurable to follow a theme: red and white, 1950's, flowers, and so on.
Be careful that decorative items do not cross over into becoming clutter. Remember that decorating is as much about what you choose not to keep in your kitchen as what you do. One or two focal items are probably plenty.
Try to keep most of your decorative items functional. The kitchen requires items to be primarily useful and help you cook, clean, and nurture. You will get more joy out of a pleasing teakettle that you use weekly than a knick-knack with no particular function. For instance, your grandmother's cookie jar can act as storage and give a sentimental cheer to your counter-top
Keep decorative items away from work surfaces and places they will get in the way, become soiled, or broken. For instance, counter-tops should be almost exclusively work surfaces, and not where you should display your Depression-era glassware.
Try to use decorative items that are easy to clean. Your collection of vintage plates, for instance, are easy to wash should they become dusty, greasy, or otherwise dirty.

, Foods are what your kitchen is all about, so put them on display. They'll look great, and possibly also inspire you to cook. Here are some good choices:

Fruits and vegetables. Choose a variety of colorful, seasonal vegetables and and display them in a bowl or basket on your counter. A bowl of Granny Smith apples, for instance, is often featured on tables of kitchen catalogs. Prominently displaying fruits and vegetables may also encourage consuming them.
Beans, grains, and colored pasta. Store a few in clear glass jars on the counter or on an open shelf. These can lend an inexpensive decorative air while being useful.
Preserved items in glass jars. From homemade jam or pickles to fancy herb vinegars and oils, there are lots to choose from. If you intend to eat these items, be sure to use them within the use-by date and rotate in new ones regularly. Also, keep them out of direct sunlight and away from heat.






, Hang a pot rack, use a utensil jar, or put colorful tableware behind glass cabinet doors where it can be seen. All these things make the kitchen look lived in, and may encourage you to live in it more.

Copper is a favorite for making a kitchen cheerier, as it's bright, reflective and elegant. Choose pans, kettle and other items made from copper and arrange them decoratively. Copper items are expensive, so make a few pieces go a long way and check out secondhand stores for older copper pans. Keep in mind that copper pots have a tendency to tarnish.
Avoid cookware clutter. A common decorating mistake is having too many things out on a pot rack, or utensil jar. Less is usually more.
Antique and vintage cooking utensils can be relatively inexpensive decorative kitchen items. These are usually relatively easy to find at estate sales, thrift stores, secondhand stores, and antique stores.

, Not all kitchens have naturally sunny windows, but it is possible to grow plants still, even under artificial light.

A windowsill herb garden is a great addition to any kitchen. It will add color and scent to your kitchen and to your cooking.

, Many kitchens are not just for cooking. Instead, they feature bar seating, breakfast nooks, or the dining table itself. If you have such a spot in your kitchen, tidy it up, and include your chosen colors and styling elements there.
, No, it's not part of the décor, but using your kitchen for its intended purpose is a great way to cheer it up. Here are some great reasons to cook in your own kitchen:

You'll learn a lot about food and cooking.
You will enjoy the smells and tastes of foods.
You will spend less money on food if you buy the ingredients and prepare them yourself.

You want cleaning to be your sole task, so eliminate anything else from the equation that may get in the way.Put all of your electronics in another room.
You can also give them to a friends and tell them to only give them back to you once your house is clean.

, Pick one task to begin with. It doesn’t have to be the biggest task. In fact, choosing something small might be a good way to start, because the sense of accomplishment you will have when you finish it will make you want to keep going.Don't think too hard about where you should begin. Just starting anywhere will give you the momentum to keep going.

, Carry a trash bag around with you as you are cleaning. Throw away or recycle things like empty boxes or items you don't use anymore. Getting rid of excess items in your home can de-clutter your house and make the rest of the cleaning process more manageable., Don’t start with dusting or any other task that has a small reward. If your bedroom is a mess for example, pick up all the clothes on the floor. This will make your room look a hundred times better. Doing tasks that make a big difference will make you want to keep cleaning., Crossing off what you have already done on your list will give you a huge sense of accomplishment. It also is a good way to show yourself that you are making progress, and that you can complete your goal if you keep going. , Take a picture before and after you have completed each task. This will show you the progress you have made and will make you feel great about the work that you’ve done., Taking breaks every thirty minutes or forty minutes may be necessary, but be careful to time these breaks. Give yourself ten or fifteen minutes, and then get back to work. Don't allow yourself to take breaks longer than fifteen minutes.


Consider setting an alarm your breaks to make sure you don't get caught up.

Have a weekly plan.,
Prepare well!,
Make sure you have a place for everything.,
Donate!,
Get other people (roommates, children and spouse) involved with the cleaning.,
Deal with bills and mail as you get it.",How to Have a Cleaning Schedule for Your House," Break the house down into sections and clean each section on certain days. For example, Mondays can be kitchen and dining room day, Tuesdays you can tackle the basement. This includes dusting, cleaning and organizing that room. This way you are not cleaning the entire living area in one day. Don't forget days you can do the exterior (mowing the lawn, tidying the garage). Tackling the house in small sections can really allow you to focus on that area only.;
, If you have a get together happening over the weekend, don't wait until Friday to clean the house. Start on Monday, and follow step one by doing small sections at at time.

, Extra kitchen appliances should be tucked away. Nowadays many inexpensive shelving options are available. If you are a visual person, then have everything organized out where you can see it.

, Donate! Donate! If you have not used anything in a year then donate it to charity or give it to someone who will. Always make sure you don't replace it with something else unless the new item does multiple functions allowing you to get rid of a number of items.

, Give them zones and rotate if need be. Cleaning is a responsibility and you work as part of a team it is not a means of getting an allowance. You should be doing it because you want to help out.

, Take a few minutes to decide if you should keep, file or recycle it. Paperwork can really pile up if left unresolved.

Purchase/find a box of heavy duty aluminum foil.,
Locate your grill brush or head out to purchase one.,
Grab supplies that will help you maintain a clean grill in the future.,
Wait for grill to cool before you clean.,
Tear one sheet of aluminum foil and crumple into a ball.,
Rub the aluminum foil ball over the grill racks, loosening any baked on food.,
Tear another sheet of aluminum foil that is the same size as your grill rack.,
Place the foil over the top of the grill rack, close the lid and turn the grill heat to high.,
Bake for 15 minutes and then clean after the grill cools.,
Clean with soap and water.,
Spray a light coating of non stick cooking spray on top of the grill rack.,
Consider using specially designed pots and pans for the grill.",How to Clean a Gas Grill Easily," Although any type of foil will do the trick, going for the heavier variety provides you with better cleaning opportunities.;
, The grill brush will help you remove the loosened caked on food particles and clean the rack.

, Preparation is key to keeping the grill in better shape for future cooking. Pick up a can of non stick cooking spray, a clean wet cloth and warm soapy water. You can mix soap and water in a pan and keep near the grill for post cleaning.

, The grill can still be warm to the touch but avoid cleaning it while its still hot (to avoid burning your hands).

, You want a large sized ball that will be big enough to cover some space for grill cleaning.

, While this won’t completely clean your grill, it will scrap off any surface food that is baked on top of the rack.


Run the clean cloth over the top of the rack to remove loosened food.







, If your grill rack is wider than the width of your foil, tear multiple sheets so it covers the grill rack completely.

, Make sure, however nothing else is inside the grill such as large, leftover pieces of food or utensils.

, Cleaning the grill will mean simply wiping down the cooked ash/debris.

, Make sure you remove any remaining food or ash from the grill before using it again in the future. While cleaning it won’t take a tremendous amount of elbow grease, it may take a little time.

, Don’t overdo it, just a very light amount will help future grilling experiences to be easier. You could also simply rub olive oil over the rack as well by pouring a small amount into a cloth and then rubbing the cloth over the rack.

, Most home or cooking stores sell cookware designed especially for grills."

Clean up any and all messes immediately.,
Make a habit of cleaning up as you go!,
Take 15 minutes a day to clean your home.,
Keep a bag/box for items that you no longer use or need.,
Clean during commercial breaks.",How to Maintain a Clean Home1," You will get into the habit of doing this after a while. Once you walk away from a mess, chances are that you won't go back to it.

, This saves time and keeps your home clean and organized. Washing dishes as you cook works great and prevents the large pile to wash after the meal.

, It's a tempting thought to try to clean the entire house all at once, and if you can do that, great! However, most don't have that much time that they can set aside on any one day. Instead, start with the kitchen and bathroom. These are two rooms that should always be clean and sanitary. Make it a goal to clean those two rooms and keep them clean. Then work on the rest of the home. Once you have a room clean and organized, make an effort to clean as you go so that it stays that way.

, This includes clothes, toys, books—whatever is in your home that's not being used. Keep everything labeled with the date that you put it in the bag and get rid of it after seven days. You can donate it, sell it, trash it—just get rid of them! The idea here is to get rid of clutter, not just to move it from one place to another.

, If you watch TV, have everyone hop up during commercials to do simple tasks like putting shoes away, hanging up coats and school bags up etc. Three people doing that three or four times through a 1/2 hour show equals a sum close to an hour of work! In addition, this ends up feeling more like a game than a chore.

Plastic caddies are available in a variety of sizes from both general merchandise retailers and specialty stores that sell cleaning and organizing products.;
, Perhaps the most important and useful cleaning product in a kit is an all-purpose cleaning spray. This spray can be used for wiping down many surfaces, including walls, countertops, railings, vanities, tables, and other furniture. Many of these sprays are available in all-natural formulations with pleasing scents.

, Abrasive cleaners are often packaged as either powders or thick creams. This type of cleaner is suitable for areas that tend to build up thick grime and therefore need to be scrubbed rather than simply wiped down. Bathtubs, bathroom tile, toilet bowls, and utility sinks are all areas that are best cleaned using a mild abrasive.

, Cleaning products designed specifically to kill microorganisms are available in both spray bottles and pre-moistened wipes. This type of cleaner is useful for cleaning bathroom surfaces (such as toilet flush handles) and areas of your kitchen countertop that have contacted uncooked meat or fish.

, Vinegar and baking soda are 2 natural, inexpensive, and versatile products for cleaning. Vinegar can be diluted with water and used to clean windows or kill mold and mildew. Baking soda can be used alone as a scrub, added to other cleaning products, or used to absorb odors.

, Microfiber cloths are great in conjunction with all-purpose cleaner for wiping down surfaces. You should also have several terrycloth towels on hand, as they are more absorbent than microfiber and can be used to clean up spills and other large messes.

, Toothbrushes are effective for cleaning around hard-to-reach edges, such as around faucets and handles. They are generally cheaper than specialty brushes designed for cleaning these areas.

, A broom has long been an essential tool for cleaning floors, although in many applications it can be replaced with a disposable microfiber cleaning tool. Long-handled brooms are best for general use, while a handheld brush is effective for cleaning hard-to-reach spots like underneath furniture.

, When buying a mop, make sure to buy a few replacement mop heads as well, as they get soiled quickly. Mops can also be replaced in many applications by disposable microfiber cleaning tools.

, A vacuum cleaner is an indispensable tool for cleaning dust from soft surfaces like carpet. A small ""stick"" vacuum will usually be adequate for small apartments, but for cleaning a larger home you should opt for a more powerful upright vacuum.

, There are a few chores that can't be managed on your backside, for everything else hoover from the comfort of your office recliner,

,, The more they can see how happy these things make you, the more likely it is they will gladly do it again. You could say: ""No one makes lasagna quite like you, it fills my heart full of wonder, and my taste buds feel like they are dancing on the wings of an angel.""The essential rule with laziness is that flattery will get you everywhere!

, Spend most of this time doing nothing, but create plenty of mess. Come up with a set of fictional complications that have made it a much harder job than expected.

, When their backs are turned, simply kick back, and relax.

, Organize the jobs you are putting off into a hierarchy. If you need to both tidy your room, and complete a vital work assignment, always opt for the tidying first (even if you do just hide the mess). The satisfaction of completing an entire task will put your lazy mind at rest. The lesson here is to always leave the lengthiest jobs till last!

, Very subtly, try to sabotage their jobs. Drop a few crumbs after they have vacuumed. Sneak in a red sock when they help with someone else washing, and slyly dirty up their dishes the moment they have cleaned them. However, it is vital to never be caught on a sabotage mission.

, Gather in the living room, settle down with a film keeping snacks and drinks to hand.

Get your rubbing alcohol.,
Buy materials to use when cleaning with rubbing alcohol.,
Confirm that the material you’ll be cleaning won’t be damaged by rubbing alcohol.,
Clean the surface of the material.,
Dampen your cleaning aid with rubbing alcohol.,
Perform a test cleaning.,
Apply the cleaning aid with rubbing alcohol to the surface of whatever you are cleaning.,
Find a well-ventilated area.,
Avoid using rubbing alcohol around cigarettes or open flames.,
Never mix alcohol and bleach.",How to Clean with Rubbing Alcohol," Rubbing alcohol is a solution of isopropyl alcohol and distilled water. It is commonly sold at most big box stores, grocery stores, and hardware stores.


Rubbing alcohol typically comes as 60% to 90% isopropyl alcohol and distilled water solution. Depending on what you’re cleaning, you may want a higher or lower percentage.
Sometimes rubbing alcohol will come as an ethanol and distilled water solution. For the purposes of cleaning, they are interchangeable.
In addition to cleaning, rubbing alcohol has disinfectant properties and may kill bacteria or viruses.;
, After you get your rubbing alcohol, you’ll need to secure materials to use to help you clean. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use a variety of cotton or other fabric products to aid in your cleaning.


For surfaces that may scratch easily, consider microfiber rags. Such surfaces include plastic (like keyboards or mice), other computer accessories, or car components.
For surfaces that are hard to access, you’ll want to consider cotton Q-tips. Such surfaces include groves in plastic or metal auto parts.
For surfaces in which you need a somewhat abrasive aid, use regular cotton rags or clothes.
Whenever possible, use clean white rags to lessen the chance of color transfer., Before you begin the process of cleaning with rubbing alcohol, you need to make sure that the surface or material won’t be damaged by it. This is important, since rubbing alcohol can damage certain surfaces.


Read any care tag or directions that comes with whatever you’re cleaning.
Make sure you’ve read care instructions on consumer electronics like LCD or LED screens. You should, particularly, avoid cleaning smartphone or tablet screens with rubbing alcohol. This could remove the fine, slick, coating that enables your touchscreen to work smoothly.
Be careful when using alcohol on delicate and aged fabrics or finished wood. Rubbing alcohol may remove lacquer or finish from wood., Before you clean the material with alcohol, you need to prepare it by wiping it down with water first. Wiping it down and removing dirt and grime is important, as any residual dirt could hinder the cleaning process and/or damage the material.


Take a clean rag. Depending on whether the surface is delicate or not, you'll need to choose between a regular cotton rag or a microfiber rag.
Dampen the rag.
Wipe the material down gently and slowly.
Allow the material to dry.
Consider blowing or using a cool blow dryer to blow away dust or residual fibers left from a rag., Your first step in using rubbing alcohol to clean will be to dampen whatever cleaning aid you’re using. Dampening is important, as you don’t’ want a lot of extra alcohol left on the surface of whatever it is you are cleaning.


If you’re cleaning with a cotton swab or a rag, firmly put it over the top of the bottle of rubbing alcohol and turn the bottle over. Allow the alcohol to penetrate the swab or rag for a couple seconds.
If the alcohol starts to drip on the floor or onto your hand, you’ve applied too much.
Make sure you're in an well-ventilated, as alcohol evaporates quickly. , While some materials are more vulnerable to alcohol than others, you should still do a test cleaning on whatever you’re cleaning. By doing a test cleaning, you’ll make sure that you don’t completely ruin what you’re cleaning.


Pick a spot that is not normally visible on the material of what you will be cleaning.
Take a cotton swab or Q-tip, dampen it with alcohol, and clean a 1-inch by 1-inch area.
Let the area dry.
Wait several hours to see if the color fades or the material has been damaged in any way., Now that you’ve dampened your cleaning aid, take it and apply it to the surface of whatever you’re cleaning. When applying the cleaning aid with rubbing alcohol, make sure to:


Move the cleaning aid gently across the surface of whatever you’re cleaning.
Swipe the cleaning aid in a back and forth pattern so you get good cleaning coverage.
Observe to make sure that you’re not leaving pools of alcohol behind you as you clean. If you are, take a clean, dry, white rag and sop up any excess., You should always use rubbing alcohol in a well-ventilated area. This is because rubbing alcohol can evaporate quickly and its fumes are flammable. As a result, make sure that wherever you are, it is well-ventilated.


If you’re in a garage or workshop, make sure to leave the garage door or workshop door open. If there are any windows, open them.
If you’re inside, make sure the air conditioner is running, you’ve got a fan on, and interior doors are open. This will maximize air flow.
Cleaning outdoors might work best.
If you notice yourself getting light-headed, move to a better ventilated area immediately., Alcohol is a highly-flammable substance. As a result, you should never use it around an open flame of any sort.


Extinguish candles, incense, or similar things before using rubbing alcohol.
Don’t smoke when using rubbing alcohol.
Avoid using rubbing alcohol around a gas lamp, a fire place, or near a gas-fueled stove that is on., You should never mix alcohol and bleach. The combination will create a toxic mixture that could irritate your lungs and cause you further medical problems.


If you’ve mixed alcohol and bleach together and notice negative effects, contact the poison control hotline immediately at: (800) 222-1222
If you suspect you or a friend are suffering from medical problems associated with inhaling alcohol and bleach, go to the hospital immediately.
Always be cautious when mixing chemicals with each other."

Rinse the surface with clean, cold water.",How to Dilute Bleach1," When you want to clean non-porous surfaces such as toilets and showers, sinks, and vinyl or tile floors, use a bleach to water ratio of 1:32. Add a half cup (118.3 ml) of bleach to a gallon (3.8 L) of water. Mix this in a sturdy plastic bucket., Using a mop for floors or a clean rag for other surfaces, carefully dip into the solution and wring the mop or rag out. Wipe the surface in sweeping motions. Go in a back and forth pattern to make sure you cover the whole area.

Make sure not to clean with bleach on surfaces like wood, leather, canvas, or carpet. Bleach will stain and fade this type of porous surface.

, If you let the bleach solution dry on the surface, it can leave residue. Always use a bucket of clean water, and a clean mop or rag if possible, to completely rinse the surface. A bleach odor may remain in the air after you rinse the surface, which is okay."

Set the dishes in a drying rack to air dry.",How to Dilute Bleach2," Bleach is great for sanitizing all kinds of kitchen items, but always wash the items first. Use regular dishwashing detergent and hot water. Scrub the items thoroughly to remove all food residue from them. Rinse the dishes after you wash them., Drain the hot soapy water from the sink. If you have an empty one gallon jug, fill this a couple of times to fill the sink. If you know about how much water your sink can hold, go ahead and run the water straight into the sink. You’ll want to use two to three gallons., Use a much weaker solution for items that come into contact with food than you would for other surfaces. One or two teaspoons (5-10 ml) to one tablespoon (14.8 ml) per gallon (3.8 L) of water is the best ratio., Place the already-washed dishes into the bleach and water solution. Let them soak for at least two minutes so the bleach has time to sanitize and kill any germs that remain on the items., Never put dishes, glasses, or utensils back in the drawer or cabinet while they are still wet. Leave the items to sit and let the remaining water and bleach evaporate off of them. There’s no need to rinse after the soak."

Wait for one minute and then blot the spot dry with a white cloth. If the color does not bleed or fade, it should be safe to use bleach on it.Choose a hem for shirts you tuck in and an inseam or spot around the waist on pants.
It’s also smart to check the tags on clothes. There will be a warning if the clothes are sensitive to bleach.

, Remember when you add bleach to your laundry not to let the bleach come into direct contact with the laundry. To accomplish this, start the washer before you put any laundry into it. Let the basin fill at least halfway before you add detergent and bleach., Bleach does not wash clothes, so you still need to use detergent to clean your laundry. If your machine has a detergent compartment, measure out the detergent and add it. If the machine has no detergent compartment, pour it directly into the water., For small loads, use about ½ cup (118 ml) of bleach. If you have an extra large load, it’s okay to use closer to a full cup (237 ml) of bleach. Pour it into a bleach compartment or directly into the water.Washer sizes and load sizes vary, so you’ll have to adjust how much bleach you use.

, Let the washer finish filling with water so that the bleach mixes up and dilutes into the water. When the machine is almost full, put your load of laundry into the water. Make sure it goes all the way into the water rather than floating on top."

Wear rubber gloves when working with bleach.,
Work in a well-ventilated room.,
Pour the bleach over a sink or tub.,
Use cold water.,
Avoid using undiluted bleach.",How to Dilute Bleach4," Chlorine bleach, which is the most common kind, is a strong acid. Bleach will burn your skin if you get it on yourself. Wear gloves that go up your forearm to protect from splashes.Even after you dilute the bleach, it’s best to wear gloves.

, Just as bleach can burn your skin, it’s also harmful if you breathe its fumes for a long period of time. Open the windows when you can, and set up fans to move the air around.If you have any breathing problems, wear a mask to reduce the intake of fumes, or avoid using bleach altogether.

, Undiluted bleach will fade and ruin many different materials. Never pour it over a wood floor or carpet. A stainless steel sink or a plastic wash tub is the best place to dilute your bleach., If you mix bleach with hot water, you’ll increase the fumes that are released from the bleach. This worsens the already hazardous breathing situation. In addition, hot water decomposes the active ingredient in bleach making it essentially useless., Bleach is highly concentrated and is not meant to be used undiluted. Without diluting bleach with water, you’ll likely do more damage than good. Bleach is strong enough to still be effective even in a diluted state."

A wet towel and a mild detergent like dish soap, work well for the initial cleaning of the stainless steel appliances. Only use a few drops of the mild detergent so it doesn’t leave behind a soapy residue while cleaning.


If there is dried, stuck-on food, you can try using a nylon scrubbing pad to loosen the food.Do not use steel wool scrubbers of any other kind of cleaning utensil that is not labeled “non-scratch.” Using harsh, abrasive cleaning tools could create costly scratches in the stainless steel surface. This damage may require the repair assistance of a professional.;
, Stainless steel can be polished with common, household products like glass cleaner, olive oil, lemon oil, and baby oil.Slightly moisten a rag or a microfiber cloth with your chosen polishing product (a little product goes a long way), and thoroughly wipe the stainless steel surface.


Follow the grain of the appliance while polishing. That way, you reduce the risk of making scratches in the stainless steel surface.

, Use the dry side of the cloth to buff and wipe away any remaining polishing solution. In the end, you want your appliance surface to be dry to the touch.


If your appliance still has streaks after you polish it, consider getting a stainless steel cleaner from a hardware store.

, Sprinkle and evenly distribute about 2 tablespoons of baking soda onto the dry sink’s surface. Use a damp sponge to rub and spread the baking soda around the sink’s basin surface.You may want to use harsh cleansers to remove the stains in your sink basin, but resist the temptation.Using bleach and other aggressive chemical cleansers can actually do more harm than good.

, The vinegar will react with the baking soda and start to foam. This foaming will help lift off the stain on the sink’s stainless steel surface. Leave the vinegar for about 10 minutes to ensure the baking soda and vinegar mixture thoroughly loosen the surface impurities.To evenly coat the sides of the sink, consider adding the vinegar to a spray bottle and spraying all around the basin. This will allow for a controlled coating of vinegar, rather than pouring vinegar down the sides of the sink.
Using a soft bristled toothbrush can help clean the smaller, hard to reach areas of the sink, like the drain and grooves around the drain.

, Rinse out the sink basin with water, and wipe it dry with a towel or cleaning cloth. Your sink should be shiny and clean, ready for the next use.


Consider protecting your sink basin with a plastic or rubber mat. Sink mats are cheap, and can help prevent damage from sharp silverware and dishes.If you do use a mat, detach the mat from the sink at least once a week to give both the sink and mat a thorough cleaning. This will help prevent food debris and bacteria from accumulating on the mat and sink surfaces.

, For general cleaning, dirty pans can be cleaned with dishwashing soap and water in the sink. Pans should be washed by hand, because dishwashers can work away at the handles of your pans.Use a towel or rag to immediately dry your pan. This immediate drying helps prevent water spots. If water spots do form, rinse them in club soda (reused from pan to pan) and dry with a soft rag or cloth.

, Fill your pan with about 1 inch of water and put it on a stove burner. Turn the stove on, and wait for the water to boil.


Once the water is boiling, add 2 tablespoons of salt, or 1 tablespoon of baking soda.Put the stove flame on low/medium low, and let this mixture lightly boil for approximately 30 minutes.

, Use a plastic or wooden spatula to rub the bottom of the pan, lifting off the stuck food. Continue scraping the bottom of the pan until all the stuck-on food is removed.


If your pan only has burn marks, you can sprinkle baking soda onto the burnt areas and scrub them away with a soft sponge. The baking soda will help dissolve the burn marks.
You can add the baking soda to a dry pan, or mix it with a small amount of water to make a baking soda paste. After you have removed the burn marks, rinse the pan with clean water and dry it with a clean cloth.For really tough burn marks, but you can use a slightly abrasive sponge to scrub and lift away the burned areas.

, After you clean your pans, give them some luster by using a cookware polish designed especially for stainless steel. You can find stainless steel cookware polish at most hardware stores and grocery stores around kitchen appliance aisles and areas.Be sure not to use industrial strength stainless steel polish on your pans. Industrial stainless steel polish has much harsher cleaning chemicals than cookware stainless steel polish.

, Add some mild detergent, like dish soap, to the water. Dip a clean cloth into the water and soap mixture, and wring out the cloth. Then, wipe the piece of jewelry with the cloth until the jewelry is clean.


Wipe and clean the jewelry going along the grain of the piece. This helps maintain the jewelry’s uniform finish.

, Consider using toothpaste to clean your jewelry if it is especially dirty and has some specific soiled areas. However, remember that toothpaste is slightly abrasive and could possible damage the jewelry piece. Rinse the jewelry thoroughly with water once your are finished cleaning it with the toothpaste.


If you decide to use toothpaste to clean your jewelry, use a cloth to rub the toothpaste onto the jewelry surface. Also make sure the toothpaste is a non-whitening brand that doesn’t contain silica. The whitening products and the silica can damage the stainless steel finish., Use a clean cloth to wipe down the piece of jewelry, and then leave it to air dry completely.

, Although stainless steel is durable, it can scratch. Try to store your jewelry away from other jewelry items that can potentially damage and scratch the stainless steel.A professional jeweler can also polish and repair damaged jewelry.
It’s best to store your stainless steel pieces separately from jewelry made of other metals. Consider keeping stainless steel jewelry in individual pouches."
